by jb lippincott company from the ranks i a strange thing had happened at the old fort during the still watches of the night even now at nine in the morning no one seemed to be in possession of the exact circumstances the officer of the day was engaged in an investigation and all that appeared to be generally known was the bald statement that the sentry on number five had fired at somebody or other about half after three that he had fired by order of the officer of the day who was on his post at the time and that now he flatly refused to talk about the matter garrison curiosity it is perhaps needless to say was rather stimulated than lulled by this announcement an unusual number of officers were chatting about headquarters when colonel maynard came over to his office several ladies too who had hitherto shown but languid interest in the morning music of the band had taken the trouble to stroll down to the old quadrangle ostensibly to see guardmounting mrs maynard was almost always on her piazza at this time and her lovely daughter was almost sure to be at the gate with two or three young fellows lounging about her this morning however not a soul appeared in front of the colonels quarters guardmounting at the fort was not held until nine oclock contrary to the somewhat general custom at other posts in our scattered army colonel maynard had ideas of his own upon the subject and it was his theory that everything worked more smoothly if he had finished a leisurely breakfast before beginning officework of any kind and neither the colonel nor his family cared to breakfast before eight oclock in view of the fact that mrs maynard had borne that name but a very short time and that her knowledge of army life dated only from the month of may the garrison was disposed to consider her entitled to much latitude of choice in such matters even while it did say that she was old enough to be above bridelike sentiment the womenfolk at the fort were of opinion that mrs maynard was fifty it must be conceded that she was over forty also that this was her second entry into the bonds of matrimony that no one should now appear on the colonels piazza was obviously a disappointment to several people in some way or other most of the breakfast tables at the post had been enlivened by accounts of the mysterious shooting the soldiers going the rounds with the policecart the butcher and grocer and baker from town the old milkwoman with her glistening cans had all served as newsmongers from kitchen to kitchen and the story that came in with the coffee to the lady of the house had lost nothing in bulk or bravery the groups of officers chatting and smoking in front of headquarters gained accessions every moment while the ladies seemed more absorbed in chat and confidences than in the sweet music of the band what fairly exasperated some men was the fact that the old officer of the day was not out on the parade where he belonged only the new incumbent was standing there in statuesque pose as the band trooped along the line and the fact that the colonel had sent out word that the ceremony would proceed without captain chester only served to add fuel to the flame of popular conjecture it was known that the colonel was holding a consultation with closed doors with the old officer of the day and never before since he came to the regiment had the colonel been known to look so pale and strange as when he glanced out for just one moment and called his orderly the soldier sprang up saluted received his message and with every eye following him sped off towards the old stone guardhouse in three minutes he was on his way back accompanied by a corporal and private of the guard in full dress uniform thats leary the man who fired the shot said captain wilton to his senior lieutenant who stood by his side belongs to b company doesnt he queried the subaltern seems to me i have heard captain armitage say he was one of his best men yes hes been in the regiment as long as i can remember what on earth can the colonel want him for near as i can learn he only fired by chesters order and neither of them knows what he fired at it was perhaps ten minutes more before private leary came forth from the doorway of the colonels office nodded to the corporal and raising their whitegloved hands in salute to the group of officers the two men tossed their rifles to the right shoulder and strode back to the guard another moment and the colonel himself opened his door and appeared in the hallway he stopped abruptly turned back and spoke a few words in low tone then hurried through the groups at the entrance looking at no man avoiding their glances and giving faint and impatient return to the soldierly salutations that greeted him the sweat was beaded on his forehead his lips were white and his face full of a trouble and dismay no man had ever seen there before he spoke to no one but walked rapidly homeward entered and closed the gate and door behind him for a moment there was silence in the group few men in the service were better loved and honored than the veteran soldier who commanded the th infantry and it was with genuine concern that his officers saw him so deeply and painfully affected for affected he certainly was never before had his cheery voice denied them a cordial goodmorning gentlemen never before had his blue eyes flinched he had been their comrade and commander in years of frontier service and his bachelor home had been the rendezvous of all genial spirits when in garrison they had missed him sorely when he went abroad on long leave the previous year and were almost indignant when they received the news that he had met his fate in italy and would return married she was the widow of a wealthy newyorker who had been dead some three years only and though over forty did not look her years to masculine eyes when she reached the fort in may after knowing her a week the garrison had decided to a man that the colonel had done wisely mrs maynard was charming courteous handsome and accomplished only among the women were there still a few who resented their colonels capture and some of these oblivious of the fact that they had tempted him with relations of their own were sententious and severe in their condemnation of second marriage for the colonel too was indulging in a second experiment of his first only one man in the regiment besides the commander could tell anything and he to the just indignation of almost everybody would not discuss the subject it was rumored that in the old days when maynard was senior captain and chester junior subaltern in their former regiment the two had very little in common it was known that the first mrs maynard while still young and beautiful had died abroad it was hinted that the resignation of a dashing lieutenant of the regiment which was synchronous with her departure for foreign shores was demanded by his brother officers but it was useless asking captain chester he could not tell and wasnt it odd here was chester again the only man in the colonels confidence in an hour of evident trouble by jove whats gone wrong with the chief was the first exclamation from one of the older officers i never saw him look so broken as no explanation suggested itself they began edging in towards the office the door stood open a handbell banged a clerk darted in from the sergeantmajors rooms and captain chester was revealed seated at the colonels desk this in itself was sufficient to induce several officers to stroll in and look inquiringly around captain chester merely nodding went on with some writing at which he was engaged after a moments awkward silence and uneasy glancing at one another the party seemed to arrive at the conclusion that it was time to speak the band had ceased and the new guard had marched away behind its pealing bugles lieutenant hall winked at his comrades strolled hesitatingly over to the desk balanced unsteadily on one leg and with his hands sticking in his trouserspockets and his foragecap swinging from protruding thumb and forefinger cleared his throat and with marked lack of confidence accosted his absorbed superior colonel gone home didnt you see him was the uncompromising reply and the captain did not deign to raise his head or eyes well er yes i suppose i did said mr hall shifting uncomfortably to his other leg and prodding the floor with the toe of his boot then that wasnt what you wanted to know i presume said captain chester signing his name with a vicious dab of the pen and bringing his fist down with a thump on the blottingpad while he wheeled around in his chair and looked squarely up into the perturbed features of the junior no it wasnt answered mr hall in an injured tone while an audible snicker at the door added to his sense of discomfort what i mainly wanted was to know could i go to town that matter is easily arranged mr hall all you have to do is to get out of that uncomfortable and unsoldierly position stand in the attitude in which you are certainly more at home and infinitely more picturesque proffer your request in respectful words and there is no question as to the result oh youre in command then said mr hall slowly wriggling into the position of the soldier and flushing through his bronzed cheeks i thought the colonel might be only gone for a minute the colonel may not be back for a week but you be here for dressparade all the same and mr hall he called as the young officer was turning away the latter faced about again was mr jerrold going with you to town yes sir he was to drive me in his dogcart and its over here now mr jerrold cannot go at least not until i have seen him why captain he got the colonels permission at breakfast this morning that is true no doubt mr hall and the captain dropped his sharp and captious manner and his voice fell as though in sympathy with the cloud that settled on his face i cannot explain matters just now there are reasons why the permission is withdrawn for the time being the adjutant will notify him and captain chester turned to his desk again as the new officer of the day guardbook in hand entered to make his report the usual orders captain said chester as he took the book from his hand and looked over the list of prisoners then in bold and rapid strokes he wrote across the page the customary certificate of the old officer of the day winding up with this remark he also inspected guard and visited sentries between and am the firing at am was by his order meantime those officers who had entered and who had no immediate duty to perform were standing or seated around the room but all observing profound silence for a moment or two no sound was heard but the scratching of the captains pen then with some embarrassment and hesitancy he laid it down and glanced around him has any one here anything to ask any business to transact two or three mentioned some routine matters that required the action of the postcommander but did so reluctantly as though they preferred to await the orders of the colonel himself captain wilton indeed spoke his sentiments i wanted to see colonel maynard about getting two men of my company relieved from extra duty but as he isnt here i fancy i had better wait not at all who are your men have it done at once mr adjutant and supply their places from my company if need be now is there anything else the group was apparently nonplussed as the adjutant afterwards put it by such unlookedfor complaisance on the part of the usually crotchety senior captain still no one offered to lead the others and leave the room after a moments nervous rapping with his knuckles on the desk captain chester again abruptly spoke gentlemen i am sorry to incommode you but if there be nothing more that you desire to see me about i shall go on with some other matters which pardon me do not require your presence at this very broad hint the party slowly found their legs and with much wonderment and not a few resentful glances at their temporary commander the officers sauntered to the doorway there however several stopped again still reluctant to leave in the face of so pervading a mystery for wilton turned am i to understand that colonel maynard has left the post to be gone any length of time he asked he has not yet gone i do not know how long he will be gone or how soon he will start for pressing personal reasons he has turned over the command to me and if he decide to remain away of course some fieldofficer will be ordered to come to headquarters for a day or two you will have to worry along with me but i shant worry you more than i can help ive got mystery and mischief enough here to keep me busy god knows just ask sloat to come back here to me will you and wilton i did not mean to be abrupt with you im all upset today mr adjutant notify mr jerrold at once that he must not leave the post until i have seen him it is the colonels last order tell him so ii the night before had been unusually dark a thick veil of clouds overspread the heavens and hid the stars moon there was none for the faint silver crescent that gleamed for a moment through the swiftsailing wisps of vapor had dropped beneath the horizon soon after tattoo and the mournful strains of taps borne on the rising wind seemed to signal extinguish lights to the entire firmament as well as to fort sibley there was a dance of some kind at the quarters of one of the staffofficers living far up the row on the southern terrace chester heard the laughter and chat as the young officers and their convoy of matrons and maids came tripping homeward after midnight he was a crusty old bachelor to use his own description and rarely ventured into these scenes of social gayety and besides he was officer of the day and it was a theory he was fond of expounding to juniors that when on guard no soldier should permit himself to be drawn from the scene of his duties with his books and his pipe chester whiled away the lonely hours of the early night and wondered if the wind would blow up a rain or disperse the clouds entirely towards one oclock a light bounding footstep approached his door and the portal flew open as a trimbuilt young fellow with laughing eyes and an air of exuberant health and spirits came briskly in it was rollins the junior second lieutenant of the regiment and chesters own and only pet so said the envious others he was barely a year out of leadingstrings at the point and as full of hope and pluck and mischief as a colt moreover he was frank and teachable said chester and didnt come to him with the idea that he had nothing to learn and less to do the boy won upon his gruff captain from the very start and to the incredulous delight of the whole regiment within six months the old cynic had taken him into his heart and home and mr rollins occupied a pleasant room under chesters rooftree and was the sole accredited sharer of the captains mess to a youngster just entering service whose ambition it was to stick to business and make a record for zeal and efficiency these were manifest advantages there were men in the regiment to whom such close communion with a watchful senior would have been most embarrassing and mr rollinss predecessor as second lieutenant of chesters company was one of these mr jerrold was a happy man when promotion took him from under the wing of crusty jake and landed him in company b more than that it came just at a time when after four years of loneliness and isolation at an upriver stockade his new company and his old one together with four others from the regiment were ordered to join headquarters and the band at the most delightful station in the northwest here mr rollins had reported for duty during the previous autumn and here they were with troops of other arms of the service enjoying the close proximity of all the good things of civilization chester looked up with a quizzical smile as his plebe came in well sir how many dances had you with sweet alice ben bolt not many i fancy with mr jerrold monopolizing everything as usual by gad some good fellow could make a colossal fortune in buying that young man at my valuation and selling him at his own oh come now captain laughed rollins jerrolds no such slouch as you make him out hes lazy and he likes to spoon and he puts up with a good deal of petting from the girls who wouldnt if he could get it but he is jolly and bighearted and dont put on any airs with us at least and the mess like him firstrate taint his fault that hes handsome and a regular ladykiller you must admit that he had a pretty tough four years of it up there at that cussed old indian graveyard and its only natural he should enjoy getting here where there are theatres and concerts and operas and dances and dinners yes dances and dinners and daughters all delightful i know but no excuse for a mans neglecting his manifest duty as he is doing and has been ever since we got here any other time the colonel would have straightened him out but no use trying it now when both women in his household are as big fools about the man as anybody in town bigger unless im a born idiot and chester rose excitedly i suppose he had miss renwick pretty much to himself tonight he presently demanded looking angrily and searchingly at his junior as though half expecting him to dodge the question oh yes why not its pretty evident she would rather dance and be with him than with any one else so what can a fellow do of course we ask her to dance and all that and i think he wants us to but i cannot help feeling rather a bore to her even if she is only eighteen and there are plenty of pleasant girls in the garrison who dont get any too much attention now were so near a big city and i like to be with them yes and its the right thing for you to do youngster thats one trait i despise in jerrold when we were up there at the stockade two winters ago and captain grays little girl was there he hung around her from morning till night and the poor little thing fairly beamed and blossomed with delight look at her now man he dont go near her he hasnt had the decency to take her a walk a drive or anything since we got here he began from the moment we came with that gang in town he was simply devoted to miss beaubien until alice renwick came then he dropped her like a hot brick by the eternal rollins he hasnt gotten off with that old love yet you mark my words theres indian blood in her veins and a look in her eye that makes me wriggle sometimes i watched her last night at parade when she drove out here with that copperfaced old squaw her mother for all her french and italian education and her years in new york and paris that girls got a wild streak in her somewhere she sat there watching him as the officers marched to the front and then her as he went up and joined miss renwick and there was a gleam of her white teeth and a flash in her black eyes that made me think of the leap of a knife from the sheath not but what twould serve him right if she did play him some devils trick its his own doing were any people out from town he suddenly asked yes half a dozen or so answered mr rollins who was pulling off his boots and inserting his feet into easy slippers while old crusty tramped excitedly up and down the floor most of them stayed out here i think only one team went back across the bridge whose was that the suttons i believe young cub sutton was out with his sister and another girl theres another damned fool growled chester that boy has ten thousand a year of his own a beautiful home that will be his a doting mother and sister and everything wealth can buy and yet by gad hes unhappy because he cant be a poor devil of a lieutenant with nothing but drills debts and riflepractice to enliven him thats what brings him out here all the time hed swap places with you in a minute isnt he very thick with jerrold oh yes rather jerrold entertains him a good deal which is returned with compound interest ill bet you mr jerrold simply makes a convenience of him he wont make love to his sister because the poor rich unsophisticated girl is as ugly as she is ubiquitous his majesty is fastidious you see and seeks only the caress of beauty and while he lives there at the suttons when he goes to town and dines and sleeps and smokes and wines there and uses their box at the operahouse and is courted and flattered by the old lady because dear cubby worships the ground he walks on and poor fanny sutton thinks him adorable he turns his back on the girl at every dance because she cant dance and leaves her to you fellows who have a conscience and some idea of decency he gives all his devotions to nina beaubien who dances like a coryphйe and drops her when alice renwick comes with her glowing spanish beauty oh damn it im an old fool to get worked up over it as i do but you young fellows dont see what i see you havent seen what ive seen and pray god you never may thats where the shoe pinches rollins it is what he reminds me of not so much what he is i suppose that i get rabid about he is for all the world like a man we had in the old regiment when you were in swaddlingclothes and i never look at mamie grays sad white face that it doesnt bring back a girl i knew just then whose heart was broken by just such a shallow selfish adorable scoun no i wont use that word in speaking of jerrold but its what i fear rollins you call him generous well so he is lavish if you like with his money and his hospitality here in the post money comes easily to him and goes but you boys misuse the term i call him selfish to the core because he can deny himself no luxury no pleasure though it may wring a womans life or more than that her honor to give it him the captain was tramping up and down the room now as was his wont when excited his face was flushed and his hand clinched he turned suddenly and faced the younger officer who sat gazing uncomfortably at the rug in front of the fireplace rollins some day i may tell you a story that ive kept to myself all these years you wont wonder at my feeling as i do about these goingson of your friend jerrold when you hear it all but it was just such a man as he who ruined one woman broke the heart of another and took the sunshine out of the life of two men from that day to this one of them was your colonel the other your captain now go to bed im going out and throwing down his pipe regardless of the scattering sparks and ashes captain chester strode into the hallway picked up the first foragecap he laid hands on and banged himself out of the front door mr rollins remained for some moments in the same attitude still gazing abstractedly at the rug and listening to the nervous tramp of his senior officer on the piazza without then he slowly and thoughtfully went to his room where his perturbed spirit was soon soothed in sleep his conscience being clear and his health perfect there were no deep cares to keep him tossing on a restless pillow to chester however sleep was impossible he tramped the piazza a full hour before he felt placid enough to go and inspect his guard the sentries were calling three oclock and the wind had died away as he started on his round dark as was the night he carried no lantern the main garrison was well lighted by lamps and the road circling the old fort was broad smooth and bordered by a stone coping wall where it skirted the precipitous descent into the riverbottom as he passed down the plank walk west of the quadrangle wherein lay the old barracks and the stone quarters of the commanding officer and the low onestoried row of bachelor dens he could not help noting the silence and peace of the night not a light was visible at any window as he strode down the line the challenge of the sentry at the old stone tower sounded unnecessarily sharp and loud and his response of officer of the day was lower than usual as though rebuking the unseemly outcry the guard came scrambling out and formed hurriedly to receive him but the captains inspection was of the briefest kind barely glancing along the prison corridor to see that the bars were in place he turned back into the night and made for the line of posts along the riverbank the sentry at the high bridge across the gorge and the next one well around to the southeast flank were successively visited and briefly questioned as to their instructions and then the captain plodded sturdily on until he came to the sharp bend around the outermost angle of the fort and found himself passing behind the quarters of the commanding officer a substantial twostoried stone house with mansard roof and dormerwindows the road in the rear was some ten feet below the level of the parade inside the quadrangle and consequently as the house faced the parade what was the groundfloor from that front became the second story at the rear the kitchen storeroom and servants rooms were on this lower stage and opened upon the road an outer stairway ran up to the centre door at the back but at the east and west flanks of the house the stone walls stood without port or window except those above the eaves the dormers light and air in abundance streamed through the broad venetian windows north and south when light and air were needed this night as usual all was tightly closed below all darkness aloft as he glanced up at the dormers high above his head as he did so his foot struck a sudden and sturdy obstacle he stumbled and pitched heavily forward and found himself sprawling at full length upon a ladder lying on the ground almost in the middle of the roadway damn those painters he growled between his set teeth they leave their infernal mantraps around in the very hope of catching me i believe now who but a painter would have left a ladder in such a place as this rising ruefully and rubbing a bruised knee with his hand he limped painfully ahead a few steps until he came to the sidewall of the colonels house here a plank walk passed from the roadway along the western wall until almost on a line with the front piazza where by a flight of steps it was carried up to the level of the parade here he paused a moment to dust off his clothes and rearrange his belt and sword he stood leaning against the wall and facing the gray stone gable end of the row of oldfashioned quarters that bounded the parade upon the southwest all was still darkness and silence confound this sword he muttered again the thing made rattle and racket enough to wake the dead wonder if i disturbed anybody at the colonels as though in answer to his suggestion there suddenly appeared high on the blank wall before him the reflection of a faint light had a little nightlamp been turned on in the front room of the upper story the gleam came from the north window on the side he saw plainly the shadow of the pretty lace curtains looped loosely back then the shade was gently raised and there was for an instant the silhouette of a slender hand and wrist the shadow of a lacebordered sleeve then the light receded as though carried back across the room waned as though slowly extinguished and the last shadows showed the curtains still looped back the rolling shade still raised i thought so he growled one tumble like that is enough to wake the seven sleepers let alone a lovesick girl who is probably dreaming over jerrolds parting words she is spirited and blueblooded enough to have more sense too that same superb brunette ah miss alice i wonder if you think that fellows love worth having it is two hours since he left you more than that and here you are awake yet cannot sleep want more air and have to come and raise your shade no such warm night either these were his reflections as he picked up his offending sword and more slowly and cautiously now groped his way along the western terrace he passed the row of bachelor quarters and was well out beyond the limits of the fort before he came upon the next sentry number five and recognized in the stern who comes there and the sharp rattle of the bayonet as it dropped to the charge the wellknown challenge of private leary one of the oldest and most reliable soldiers in the regiment all right on your post leary he asked after having given the countersign all right i think sor though if the captain had asked me that half an hour ago id not have said so it was so dark i couldnt see me hand afore me face sor but about halfpast two i was walkin very slow down back of the quarters whin just close by lootnant jerrolds back gate i seen somethin movin and as i come softly along it riz up an sure i thought twas the lootnant himself whin he seemed to catch sight o me or hear me and he backed inside the gate an shut it i was sure twas he he was so tall and slim like an so i niver said a word until i got to thinkin over it and then i couldnt spake sure if it had been the lootnant he wouldnt have backed away from a sintry hed a come out bold and given the countersign but i didnt think o that it looked like him in the dark an twas his quarters an i thought it was him until i thought agin and then sor i wint back and searched the yard but there was no one there hm odd thing that leary why didnt you challenge at first sure sor he lept inside the fince quick as iver we set eyes on each other he was bendin down and i thought it was one of the hound pups when i first sighted him and he hasnt been around since no sor nor nobody till the officer of the day came along chester walked away puzzled sibley was a most quiet and orderly garrison night prowlers had never been heard from especially over here at the south and southwest fronts the enlisted men going to or from town passed across the big high bridge or went at once to their own quarters on the east and north this southwestern terrace behind the bachelors row was the most secluded spot on the whole post so much so that when a fire broke out there among the fuelheaps one sharp winters night a year agone it had wellnigh enveloped the whole line before its existence was discovered indeed not until after this occurrence was a sentry posted on that front at all and once ordered there he had so little to do and was so comparatively sure to be undisturbed that the old soldiers eagerly sought the post in preference to any other and were given it as a peace privilege for months relief after relief tramped around the fort and found the terrace post as humdrum and silent as an empty church but this night number five leaped suddenly into notoriety instead of going home chester kept on across the plateau and took a long walk on the northern side of the reservation where the quartermasters stables and corrals were placed he was affected by a strange unrest his talk with rollins had roused the memories of years long gone by of days when he too was young and full of hope and faith ay full of love all lavished on one fair girl who knew it well but gently almost entreatingly repelled him her heart was wrapped up in another the adonis of his day in the gay old seaboard garrison she was a soldiers child barrackborn simply taught knowing little of the vice and temptations the follies and the frauds of the whirling life of civilization a good and gentle mother had reared her and been called hence her father an officer whose sabrearm was left at molino del rey and whose heart was crushed when the loving wife was taken from him turned to the child who so resembled her and centred there all his remaining love and life he welcomed chester to his home and tacitly favored his suit but in his blindness never saw how a few moonlit strolls on the old mossgrown parapet a few evening dances in the casemates with handsome wooing winning will forrester had done their work she gave him all the wild enthusiastic worshipping love of her girlish heart just about the time captain and mrs maynard came back from leave and then he grew cold and negligent there but lived at maynards fireside and one day there came a sensation a tragedy and mrs maynard went away and died abroad and a shocked and brokenhearted girl hid her face from all and pined at home and mr forresters resignation was sent from no one knew just where and no one would have cared to know except maynard he would have followed him pistol in hand but forrester gave him no chance years afterwards chester again sought her and offered her his love and his name it was useless she told him sadly she lived only for her father now and would never leave him till he died and then she prayed she might go too memories like this will come up at such times in these same still watches of the night chester was in a moody frame of mind when about half an hour later he came back past the guardhouse the sergeant was standing near the lighted entrance and the captain called him theres a ladder lying back of the colonels quarters on the roadway some of those painters left it i suppose its a wonder some of the reliefs have not broken their necks over it going around tonight let the next one pick it up and move it out of the way hasnt it been reported not to me sir corporal schreiber has command of this relief and he has said nothing about it here he is sir didnt you see it or stumble over it when posting your relief corporal asked chester no indeed sir i i think the captain must have been mistaken in thinking it a ladder we would surely have struck it if it had been no mistake at all corporal i lifted it it is a long heavy ladder over twenty feet i should say there is such a ladder back there captain said the sergeant but it always hangs on the fence just behind the young officers quarters bachelors row sir i mean and that ladder was there an hour ago when i went my rounds said the corporal earnestly i had my hurricanelamp sir and saw it on the fence plainly and there was nothing behind the colonels at that hour chester turned away thoughtful and silent without a word he walked straight into the quadrangle past the low line of stone buildings the offices of the adjutant and quartermaster the home of the sergeantmajor the club and billiardroom past the long piazzashaded row of bachelor quarters and came upon the plank walk at the corner of the colonels fence ten more steps and he stood stockstill at the head of the flight of wooden stairs there dimly visible against the southern sky its base on the plank walk below him its top resting upon the eaves midway between the dormerwindow and the roof of the piazza so that one could step easily from it into the one or on to the other was the very ladder that half an hour before was lying on the ground behind the house his heart stood still he seemed powerless to move even to think then a slight noise roused him and with every nerve tingling he crouched ready for a spring with quick agile movements noiseless as a cat sinuous and stealthy as a serpent the dark figure of a man issued from alice renwicks chamber window and came gliding down one second more and almost as noiselessly he reached the ground then quickly raised and turned the ladder stepped with it to the edge of the roadway and peered around the angle as though to see that no sentry was in sight then vanished with his burden around the corner another second and down the steps went chester three at a bound tiptoeing it in pursuit ten seconds brought him close to the culprit a tall slender shadow you villain halt down went the ladder on the dusty road the hand that chester had clinched upon the broad shoulder was hurled aside there was a sudden whirl a lightning blow that took the captain full in the chest and staggered him back upon the treacherous and entangling rungs and ere he could recover himself the noiseless stranger had fairly whizzed into space and vanished in the darkness up the road chester sprang in pursuit he heard the startled challenge of the sentry and then learys excited halt i say halt and then he shouted fire on him leary bring him down bang went the ready rifle with sharp sullen roar that woke the echoes across the valley bang again as leary sent a second shot after the first then as the captain came panting to the spot they followed up the road no sign of the runner attracted by the shots the sergeant of the guard and one or two men lanternbearing came running to the scene excitedly they searched up and down the road in mingled hope and dread of finding the body of the marauder or some clue or trace nothing whoever he was the fleet runner had vanished and made good his escape who could it have been sir asked the sergeant of the officer of the day surely none of the men ever come round this way i dont know sergeant i dont know just take your lamp and see if there is anything visible down there among the rocks he may have been hit and leaped the wall do you think you hit him leary i cant say sor he came by me like a flash i had just a seconds look at him and sure i niver saw such runnin could you see his face asked chester in a low tone as the other men moved away to search the rocks not his face sor twas too dark was there did he look like anybody you knew or had seen anybody in the command well sor not among the men that is theres none so tall and slim both and so light sure he must a worn gums sor you couldnt hear the whisper of a footfall but whom did he seem to resemble well if the captain will forgive me sor its unwillin i am to say the worrd but theres no one that tall and light and slim here sor but lootnant jerrold sure it couldnt be him sor leary will you promise me something on your word as a man i will sor say not one word of this matter to any one except i tell you or you have to before a court i promise sor and i believe you tell the sergeant i will soon be back with that he turned and walked down the road until once more he came to the plank crossing and the passageway between the colonels and bachelors row here again he stopped short and waited with bated breath and scarcelybeating heart the faint light he had seen before again illumined the room and cast its gleam upon the old gray wall even as he gazed there came silently to the window a tall whiterobed form and a slender white hand seized and lowered the shade noiselessly then as before the light faded away but she was awake waiting one moment in silence captain chester then sprang up the wooden steps and passed under the piazza which ran the length of the bachelor quarters halfway down the row he turned sharply to his left opened the greenpainted door and stood in a little dark hallway taking his matchbox from his pocket he struck a light and by its glare quickly read the card upon the first doorway to his right mr howard f jerrold th infantry usa opening this door he bolted straight through the little parlor to the bedroom in the rear a dim light was burning on the mantel the bed was unruffled untouched and mr jerrold was not there five minutes afterwards captain chester all alone had laboriously and cautiously dragged the ladder from the side to the rear of the colonels house stretched it in the roadway where he had first stumbled upon it then returned to the searchingparty on number five send two men to put that ladder back he ordered it is where i told you on the road behind the colonels iii when mrs maynard came to sibley in may and the officers with their wives were making their welcoming call she had with motherly pride and pleasure yielded to their constant importunities and shown to one party after another an album of photographs likenesses of her only daughter there were little cartes de visite representing her in long dresses and babycaps quaint little pictures of a chubbyfaced chubbylegged infant a few months older charming studies of a little girl with great black eyes and delicate features then of a tall slender slip of a maiden decidedly foreignlooking then of a sweet and pensive face with great dark eyes long beautiful curling lashes and very heavy lowarched brows exquisitely moulded mouth and chin and most luxuriant dark hair then others still older in every variety of dress even in fancy costume such as the girl had worn at fair or masquerade these and others still had mrs maynard shown them with repressed pride and pleasure and with sweet acknowledgment of their enthusiastic praises alice still tarried in the east visiting relatives whom she had not seen since her fathers death three years earlier and long before she came to join her mother at sibley and to enter upon the life she so eagerly looked forward to way out in the west you know with officers and soldiers and the band and buffalo and indians all around you there was not an officer or an officers wife who had not delightedly examined that album there was still another picture but that one had been shown to only a chosen few just one week after her daughters arrival and rather an absurd scene had occurred in which that most estimable officer lieutenant sloat had figured as the hero a more simpleminded wellintentioned fellow than sloat there did not live he was so full of kindness and good nature and readiness to do anything for anybody that it never seemed to occur to him that everybody on earth was not just as ready to be equally accommodating he was a perpetual source of delight to the colonel and one of the most loyal and devoted of subalterns despite the fact that his locks were long silvered with the frosts of years and that he had fought through the war of the rebellion and risen to the rank of a fieldofficer in maynards old brigade the most temperate of men ordinarily the colonel had one anniversary he loved to celebrate and sloat was his standby when the d of july came round just as he had been at his shoulder at that supreme moment when heedless of the fearful sweep of shell and canister through their shattered ranks picketts heroic virginians breasted the slope of cemetery hill and surged over the low stone wall into cushings guns hard stubborn fighting had maynards men to do that day and for serene courage and determination no man had beaten sloat both officers had bullethole mementos to carry from that field both had won their brevets for conspicuous gallantry and sloat was a happy and grateful man when years afterwards his old commander secured him a lieutenancy in the regular service he was the colonels henchman although he never had brains enough to win a place on the regimental staff and when mrs maynard came he overwhelmed her with cumbrous compliments and incessant calls he was to his confident belief her chosen and accepted knight for full two days after her arrival then jerrold came back from a brief absence and as in duty bound went to pay his respects to his colonels wife and that night there had been a singular scene mrs maynard had stopped suddenly in her laughing chat with two ladies had started from her seat wildly staring at the tall slender subaltern who entered the gateway and then fell back in her chair fairly swooning as he made his bow sloat had rushed into the house to call the colonel and get some water while mr jerrold stood paralyzed at so strange a reception of his first call mrs maynard revived presently explained that it was her heart or the heat or something and the ladies on their way home decided that it was possibly the heart it was certainly not the heat it was unquestionably something and that something was mr jerrold for she never took her eyes off him during the entire evening and seemed unable to shake off the fascination next day jerrold dined there and from that time on he was a daily visitor every one noted mrs maynards strong interest in him but no one could account for it she was old enough to be his mother said the garrison but not until alice renwick came did another consideration appear he was singularly like the daughter both were tall lithe slender both had dark lustrous eyes dark though almost perfect skin exquisitelychiselled features and slender shapely hands and feet alice was the picture of her father said mrs maynard and mr renwick had lived all his life in new york while mr jerrold was of an old southern family and his mother a cuban beauty who was the toast of the new orleans clubs not many years before the war poor sloat he did not fancy jerrold and was as jealous as so unselfish a mortal could be of the immediate ascendency the young fellow established in the colonels household it was bad enough before alice joined them after that it was wellnigh unbearable then came the dofjuly dinner and the colonels one annual jollification no man ever heard of sloats being intoxicated he rarely drank at all but this evening the reminiscences of the day the generous wine the unaccustomed elegance of all his surroundings due to mrs maynards taste and supervision and the influence of alice kenwicks exquisite beauty had fairly carried him away they were chatting in the parlor while miss renwick was entertaining some younglady friends from town and listening to the band on the parade sloat was expatiating on her grace and beauty and going over the album for the twentieth time when the colonel with a twinkling eye remarked to mrs maynard i think you ought to show majora sloat the directoire picture my dear alice would never forgive me said madame laughing though i consider it the most beautiful we have of her oh where is it oh do let us see it mrs maynard was the chorus of exclamations from the few ladies present oh i insist on seeing it madame was sloats characteristic contribution to the clamor i want you to understand it said mrs maynard pleased but still hesitating we are very daft about alice at home you know and its quite a wonder she has not been utterly spoiled by her aunts and uncles but this picture was a specialty an artist friend of ours fairly made us have it taken in the weddingdress worn by her grandmother you know the josephine beauharnais directoire style that was worn in seventeen ninetysomething her neck and shoulders are lovely and that was why we consented i went and so did the artist and we posed her and the photograph is simply perfect of her face and neck too but when alice saw it she blushed furiously and forbade my having them finished afterwards though she yielded when her aunt kate and i begged so hard and promised that none should be given away and so just half a dozen were finished indeed the dress is by no means as dйcolletй as many girls wear theirs at dinner now in new york but poor alice was scandalized when she saw it last month and she never would let me put one in the album oh do go and get it mrs maynard pleaded the ladies oh please let me see it mrs maynard added sloat and at last the motherpride prevailed mrs maynard rustled upstairs and presently returned holding in her hands a delicate silver frame in filigreework a quaint foreign affair and enclosed therein was a cabinet photograph en vignette the head neck and shoulders of a beautiful girl and the dainty diminutive whattherewasofit waist of the oldfashioned gown sashed almost immediately under the exquisite bust revealed quite materially the cause of alice renwicks blushes but a more beautiful portrait was never photographed the women fairly gasped with delight and envy sloat could not restrain his impatience to get it in his own hands and finally he grasped it and then eyed it in rapture it was two minutes before he spoke a word while the colonel sat laughing at his worshipping gaze mrs maynard somewhat uneasily stretched forth her hand and the other ladies impatiently strove to regain possession come major sloat youve surely had it long enough we want it again never said sloat with melodramatic intensity never this is my ideal of perfection of divinity in woman i will bear it home with me set it above my fireside and adore it day and night nonsense major sloat said mrs maynard laughing yet far from being at her ease come i must take it back alice may be in any minute now and if she knew i had betrayed her she would never forgive me come surrender and she strove to take it from him but sloat was in one of his utterly asinine moods he would have been perfectly willing to give any sum he possessed for so perfect a picture as this he never dreamed that there were good and sufficient reasons why no man should have it he so loved and honored his colonel that he was ready to lay down his life for any of his household in laying claim to this picture he honestly believed that it was the highest proof he could give of his admiration and devotion a tame surrender now meant that his protestations were empty words therefore argued sloat i must stand firm madame said he id die first and with that he began backing to the door alarmed now mrs maynard sprang after him and the little major leaped upon a chair his face aglow jolly rubicund beaming with bliss and triumph she looked up almost wringing her hands and turned half appealingly to the colonel who was laughing heartily on the sofa never dreaming sloat could be in earnest here ill give you back the frame i dont want that said sloat and began fumbling at the back of the photograph this was too much for the ladies they too rushed to the rescue one of them sprang to and shut the door the other seized and violently shook the back of his chair and sloat leaped to the floor still clinging to his prize and laughing as though he had never had so much entertainment in his life the long venetian windows opened upon the piazza and towards the nearest one he retreated holding aloft the precious gage and waving off the attacking party with the other hand he was within a yard of the blinds when they were suddenly thrown open a tall slender form stepped quickly in one hand seized the uplifted wrist the other the picture and in far less time than it takes to tell it mr jerrold had wrenched it away and with quiet bow restored it to its rightful owner oh i say now jerrold thats downright unhandsome of you gasped sloat id have been on my way home with it shut up you fool was the sharp hissing whisper wait till i go home if you want to talk about it and as quickly as he came mr jerrold slipped out again upon the piazza of course the story was told with varied comment all over the post several officers were injudicious enough to chaff the old subaltern about it and he was a little soreheaded the next day anyway the usually placid sloat grew the more indignant at jerrold he decided to go and upbraid him and as ill luck would have it they met before noon on the steps of the clubroom i want to say to you mr jerrold that from an officer of your age to one of mine i think your conduct last night a piece of impertinence i had a perfect right to do what i did replied jerrold coolly you were taking a most unwarrantable liberty in trying to carry off that picture how did you know what it was you had never seen it theres where you are mistaken mr sloat and jerrold purposely and exasperatingly refused to recognize the customary brevet i had seen it frequently two officers were standing by and one of them turned sharply and faced jerrold as he spoke it was his former company commander jerrold noted the symptom and flushed but set his teeth doggedly why mr jerrold mrs maynard said she never showed that to any one said sloat in much surprise you heard her did you not captain chester i did certainly was the reply all the same i repeat what ive said was jerrolds sullen answer i have seen it frequently and whats more he suddenly stopped well whats more said sloat suggestively never mind i dont care to talk of the matter replied jerrold and started to walk away but sloat was angry nettled jealous he had meant to show his intense loyalty and admiration for everything that was his colonels and had been snubbed and called a fool by an officer many years though not so many files his junior he never had liked him and now there was an air of conscious superiority about jerrold that fairly exasperated him he angrily followed and called to him to stop but jerrold walked on captain chester stood still and watched them the little man had almost to run before he overtook the tall one they were out of earshot when he finally did so there were a few words on both sides then jerrold shifted his light cane into his left hand and chester started forward half expecting a fracas to his astonishment the two officers shook hands and parted well said he as sloat came back with an angry yet bewildered face im glad you shook hands i almost feared a row and was just going to stop it so he apologized did he no nothing like it then what did you mean by shaking hands thats nothing never you mind said sloat confusedly i havent forgiven him by a good deal the mans conceit is enough to disgust anything but a woman i suppose he finished ruefully well its none of my business sloat but pardon my saying i dont see what there was to bring about the apparent reconciliation that handshake meant something oh well damn it we had some words and he or i well theres a bet and we shook hands on it seems to me thats pretty serious business sloat a bet following such a talk as you two have had i hope well captain interrupted sloat i wouldnt have done it if i hadnt been mad as blazes but i made it and must stick to it thats all you wouldnt mind telling me what it was i suppose i cant and that ends it captain chester found food for much thought and speculation over this incident so far as he was concerned the abrupt remark of sloat by no means ended it in his distrust of jerrold he too had taken alarm at the very substantial intimacy to which that young man was welcomed at the colonels quarters prior to his marriage old maynard had not liked him at all but it was mainly because he had been so negligent of his duties and so determined a beau in city society after his arrival at sibley he had indeed threatened to have him transferred to a company still on frontier service if he did not reform but then the riflepractice season began and jerrold was a capital shot and sure to be on the list of competitors for the department team so what was the use he would be ordered in for the riflecamp anyway and so the colonel decided to keep him at headquarters this was in the summer of the year gone by then came the colonels long leave his visit to europe his meeting with his old friend now the widow of the lamented renwick their delightful winter together in italy his courtship her consent their marriage and return to america when maynard came back to sibley and the old regiment he was so jolly and content that every man was welcomed at his house and it was really a source of pride and pleasure to him that his accomplished wife should find any of his young officers so thoroughly agreeable as she pronounced mr jerrold others were soldierly courteous well bred but he had the air of a foreign court about him she privately informed her lord and it seems indeed that in days gone by mr jerrolds father had spent many years in france and spain once as his countrys representative near the throne though the father died long before the boy was out of his knickerbockers he had left the impress of his grand manner and jerrold to women of any age was at once a courtier and a knight but the colonel never saw how her eyes followed the tall young officer time and again there were women who soon noted it and one of them said it was such a yearning longing look was mrs maynard really happy they asked each other did she really want to see alice mate with him the handsome the dangerous the selfish fellow they knew him to be if not could anything be more imprudent than that they should be thrown together as they were being day after day had alice wealth of her own if not did the mother know that nothing would tempt howard jerrold into an alliance with a dowerless daughter these and many more were questions that came up every day the garrison could talk of little else and alice renwick had been there just three weeks and was the acknowledged queen of hearts at sibley when the riflecompetitions began again and a great array of officers and men from all over the northwest came to the post by every train and their canvas tents dotted the broad prairie to the north one lovely evening in august just before the practice began colonel maynard took his wife to drive out and see the camp mr jerrold and alice renwick followed on horseback the carriage was surrounded as it halted near the range and half a score of officers old and young were chatting with mrs maynard while others gathered about the lovely girl who sat there in the saddle there came marching up from the railway a small squad of soldiers competitors arriving from the far west among them apparently their senior noncommissioned officer was a tall cavalry sergeant superbly built and with a bronzed and bearded and swarthy face that seemed to tell of years of campaigning over mountain and prairie they were all men of perfect physique all in the neat soldierly fatiguedress of the regular service some wearing the spotless white stripes of the infantry others the less artistic and equally destructible yellow of the cavalry their swinging stride erect carriage and clear and handsome eyes all spoke of the perfection of health and soldierly development curious glances were turned to them as they advanced and miss renwick catching sight of the party exclaimed oh who are these and what a tall soldier that sergeant is that sergeant miss renwick said a slow deliberate voice is the man i believe will knock mr jerrold out of the first prize that is sergeant mcleod as though he heard his name pronounced the tall cavalryman glanced for the first time at the group brought his rifle to the carry as if about to salute and was just stepping upon the roadside where he came in full view of the occupants of the carriage when a sudden pallor shot across his face and he plunged heavily forward and went down like a shot sympathetic officers and comrades surrounded the prostrate form in an instant the colonel himself sprang from his carriage and joined the group a blanket was quickly brought from a neighboring tent and the sergeant was borne thither and laid upon a cot a surgeon felt his pulse and looked inquiringly around any of you cavalrymen know him well has he been affected this way before a young corporal who had been bending anxiously over the sergeant straightened up and saluted i know him well sir and have been with him five years hes only had one sick spell in all that time twas just like this and then he told me hed been sunstruck once this is no case of sunstroke said the doctor it looks more like the heart how long ago was the attack you speak of three years ago last april sir i remember it because wed just got into fort raines after a long scout hed been the solidest man in the troop all through the cold and storm and snow we had in the mountains and we were in the readingroom and hed picked up a newspaper and was reading while the rest of us were talking and laughing and first thing we knew he was down on the floor just like he was tonight hm said the surgeon yes thats plenty steward give him that raise his head a little corporal now hell come round all right driving homeward that night colonel maynard musingly remarked did you see that splendid fellow who fainted away no answered his wife you all gathered about him so quickly and carried him away i could not even catch a glimpse of him but he had recovered had he not yes still i was thinking what a singular fact it is that occasionally a man slips through the surgeons examinations with such a malady as this now here is one of the finest athletes and shots in the whole army a man who has been through some hard service and stirring fights has won a tiptop name for himself and was on the highroad to a commission and yet this will block him effectually why what is the trouble some affection of the heart why halloo stop driver orderly jump down and run back there mrs maynard has dropped her fan what was it dear he asked anxiously you started and you are white and trembling i i dont know colonel let us go home it will be over in a minute where are alice and mr jerrold call them please she must not be out riding after dark but they were not in sight and it was considerably after dark when they reached the fort mr jerrold explained that his horse had picked up a stone and he had had to walk him all the way iv there was no sleep for captain chester the rest of the night he went home threw off his swordbelt and seated himself in a big easychair before his fireplace deep in thought once or twice he arose and paced restlessly up and down the room as he had done in his excited talk with rollins some few hours before then he was simply angry and argumentative or declamatory now he had settled down into a very different frame of mind he seemed awed stunned crushed he had all the bearing and mien of one who having defiantly predicted a calamity was thunderstruck by the verification of his prophecy in all his determined arraignment of mr jerrold in all the harsh things he had said and thought of him he had never imagined any such depth of scoundrelism as the revelations of the night foreshadowed chester differed from many of his brotherhood there was no room for rejoicing in his heart that the worst he had ever said of jerrold was unequal to the apparent truth he took no comfort to his soul that those who called him cynical crabbed unjust even malicious would now be compelled to admit he was right in his estimate like the best of us chester could not ordinarily say vade retro to the temptation to think if not to say didnt i tell you so when in everyday affairs his oftdisputed views were proved well founded but in the face of such a catastrophe as now appeared engulfing the fair fame of his regiment and the honor of those whom his colonel held dear chester could feel only dismay and grief what was his duty in the light of the discoveries he had made to the best of his belief he was the only man in the garrison who had evidence of jerrolds absence from his own quarters and of the presence of some one at her window he had taken prompt measures to prevent its being suspected by others he purposely sent his guards to search along the cliff in the opposite direction while he went to jerrolds room and thence back to remove the telltale ladder should he tell any one until he had confronted jerrold with the evidences of his guilt and wringing from him his resignation send him far from the post before handing it in time and again he wished frank armitage were here the youngest captain in the regiment armitage had been for years its adjutant and deep in the confidence of colonel maynard he was a thorough soldier a strong selfreliant courageous man and one for whom chester had ever felt a warm esteem armitage was on leave of absence however had been away some time on account of family matters and would not return it was known until he had effected the removal of his mother and sister to the new home he had purchased for them in the distant east it was to his company that jerrold had been promoted and there was friction from the very week that the handsome subaltern joined armitage had long before taken his measure and was in no wise pleased that so lukewarm a soldier should have come to him as senior subaltern they had a very plain talk for armitage was straightforward as a dart and then as jerrold showed occasional lapses the captain shut down on some of his most cherished privileges and to the indignation of society the failure of mr jerrold to appear at one or two gatherings where he was confidently expected was speedily laid at his captains door the recent death of his father kept armitage from appearing in public and as neither he nor the major who commanded the regiment while maynard was abroad vouchsafed the faintest explanation society was allowed to form its own conclusions and did to the effect that mr jerrold was a wronged and persecuted man it was just as the maynards arrived at sibley that armitage departed on his leave and to his unspeakable bliss mr jerrold succeeded to the command of his company this fact coupled with the charming relations which were straightway established with the colonels family placed him in a position of independence and gave him opportunities he had never known before it was speedily evident that he was neglecting his military duties that company b was running down much faster than armitage had built it up and yet no man felt like speaking of it to the colonel who saw it only occasionally on dressparade chester had just about determined to write to armitage himself and suggest his speedy return when this eventful night arrived now he fully made up his mind that it must be done at once and had seated himself at his desk when the roar of the sunrise gun and the blare of the bugles warned him that reveille had come and he must again go to his guard before he returned to his quarters another complication even more embarrassing had arisen and the letter to armitage was postponed he had received the present of his guard and verified the presence of all his prisoners when he saw major sloat still standing out in the middle of the parade where the adjutant usually received the reports of the rollcalls several company officers having made their reports were scurrying back to quarters for another snooze before breakfasttime or to get their cup of coffee before going out to the range chester strolled over towards him whats the matter sloat nothing much the colonel told me to receive the reveille reports for hoyt this week hes on general courtmartial yes i know all that i mean what are you waiting for mr jerrold again theres no report from his company have you sent to wake him no ill go myself and do it thoroughly too and the little major turned sharply away and walked direct to the low range of bachelor quarters dove under the piazza and into the green doorway hardly knowing how to explain his action chester quickly followed and in less than a minute was standing in the selfsame parlor which by the light of a flickering match he had searched two hours before here he halted and listened while sloat pushed on into the bedroom and was heard vehemently apostrophizing some sleeper does the government pay you for this sort of thing i want to know get up jerrold this is the second time youve cut reveille in ten days get up i say and the major was vigorously shaking at something for the bed creaked and groaned wake up i say im blowed if im going to get up here day after day and have you sleeping wake nicodemus wake you snoozing snoring openmouthed masher come now i mean it a drowsy disgusted yawn and stretch finally rewarded his efforts mr jerrold at last opened his eyes rolled over yawned sulkily again and tried to evade his persecutor but to no purpose like a little terrier sloat hung on to him and worried and shook oh dont damn it dont growled the victim what do you want anyway has that infernal reveille gone yes and youre absent again and no report from b company by the holy poker if you dont turn out and get it and report to me on the parade ill spot the whole gang absent and then no matinйe for you today my buck come out with you i mean it hall says you and he have an engagement in town and pon my soul ill bust it if you dont come out and so growling and complaining and yet half laughing adonis rolled from his couch and began to get into his clothes chesters blood ran cold then boiled think of a man who could laugh like that and remember when how had he returned to the house listen confound you sloat i wouldnt rout you out in this shabby way why couldnt you let a man sleep im tired half to death what have you done to tire you slept all yesterday afternoon and danced perhaps a dozen times at the doctors last night youve had more sleep than ive had begad you took miss renwick home before twas over and mean it was of you too with all the fellows that wanted to dance with her that wasnt my fault mrs maynard made her promise to be home at twelve you old cackler thats what sticks in your crop yet you are persecuting me because they like me so much better than they do you he went on laughingly now come now sloat confess it is all because youre jealous you couldnt have that picture and i could chester fairly started he had urgent need to see this young gallant he was staying for that purpose but should he listen to further talk like this too late to move for sloats answer came like a shot i bet you you never could but didnt i tell you i had a week ago ay but i didnt believe it you couldnt show it pshaw man look here stop though remember on your honor you never tell on my honor of course well there a drawer was opened chester heard a gulp of dismay of genuine astonishment and conviction mixed as sloat muttered some halfarticulate words and then came into the front room jerrold followed caught sight of chester and stopped short with sudden and angry change of color i did not know you were here he said it was to find where you were that i came was the quiet answer there was a moments silence sloat turned and looked at the two men in utter surprise up to this time he had considered jerrolds absence from reveille as a mere dereliction of duty which was ascribable to the laziness and indifference of the young officer so far as lay in his power he meant to make him attend more strictly to business and had therefore come to his quarters and stirred him up but there was no thought of any serious trouble in his mind his talk had all been roughly goodhumored until until that bet was mentioned and then it became earnest now as he glanced from one man to the other he saw in an instant that something new something of unusual gravity was impending chester buttoned to the throat in his dark uniform accurately gloved and belted with pale set almost haggard face was standing by the centretable under the droplight jerrold only half dressed his feet thrust into slippers his fingers nervously working at the studs of his dainty white shirt had stopped short at his bedroom door and with features that grew paler every second and a dark scowl on his brow was glowering at chester since when has it been the duty of the officer of the day to come around and hunt up officers who dont happen to be out at reveille he asked it is not your absence from reveille i want explained mr jerrold was the cold and deliberate answer i wanted you at this morning and you were not and had not been here an unmistakable start and shock a quick nervous hunted glance around the room so cold and pallid in the early light of the august morning a clutch of jerrolds slim brown hand at the bared throat but he rallied gamely strode a step forward and looked his superior full in the face sloat marked the effort with which he cleared away the huskiness that seemed to clog his larynx but admired the spunk with which the young officer returned the seniors shot what is your authority here i would like to know what business has the officer of the day to want me or any other man not on guard captain chester you seem to forget that i am no longer your second lieutenant and that i am a company commander like yourself do you come by colonel maynards order to search my quarters and question me if so say so at once if not get out and jerrolds face was growing black with wrath and his big lustrous eyes were wide awake now and fairly snapping chester leaned upon the table and deliberated a moment he stood there coldly distrustfully eying the excited lieutenant then turned to sloat i will be responsible for the rollcall of company b this morning sloat i have a matter of grave importance to bring up to this this gentleman and it is of a private nature will you let me see him alone sloat said jerrold dont go yet i want you to stay these are my quarters and i recognize your right to come here in search of me since i was not at reveille but i want a witness here to bear me out im too amazed yet too confounded by this intrusion of captain chesters to grasp the situation i never heard of such a thing as this explain it if you can mr jerrold what i have to ask or say to you concerns you alone it is not an official matter it is as man to man i want to see you alone and at once now will you let major sloat retire silence for a moment the angry flush on jerrolds face was dying away and in its place an ashen pallor was spreading from throat to brow his lips were twitching ominously sloat looked in consternation at the sudden change shall i go he finally asked jerrold looked long fixedly searchingly in the set face of the officer of the day breathing hard and heavily what he saw there sloat could not imagine at last his hand dropped by his side he made a little motion with it a slight wave towards the door and again dropped it nervously his lips seemed to frame the word go but he never glanced at the man whom a moment before he so masterfully bade to stay and sloat sorely puzzled left the room not until his footsteps had died out of hearing did chester speak how soon can you leave the post i dont understand you how soon can you pack up what you need to take and get away get away where what on earth do you mean you must know what i mean you must know that after last nights work you quit the service at once and forever i dont know anything of the kind and i defy you to prove the faintest thing but jerrolds fingers were twitching and his eyes had lost their light do you suppose i did not recognize you asked chester when where gulped jerrold when i seized you and you struck me i never struck you i dont know what you mean my god man let us end this useless fencing the evidence i have of your last nights scoundrelism would break the strongest record for the regiments sake for the colonels sake let us have no public scandal its awful enough as the thing stands write your resignation give it to me and leave before breakfast if you can ive done nothing to resign for you know perfectly well i havent do you mean that such a crime that a womans ruin and disgrace isnt enough to drive you from the service asked chester tingling in every nerve and longing to clinch the shapely swelling throat in his clutching fingers god of heaven jerrold are you dead to all sense of decency captain chester i wont be bullied this way i may not be immaculate but no man on earth shall talk to me like this i deny your insinuations ive done nothing to warrant your words even if if you did come sneaking around here last night and find me absent you cant prove a thing you what when i saw you almost caught you by heaven i wish the sentry had killed you then and there i never dreamed of such hardihood youve done nothing but dream by jove i believe youre sleepwalking yet what on earth do you mean by catching and killing me pon my soul i reckon youre crazy captain chester and color was gradually coming back again to jerrolds face and confidence to his tone enough of this mr jerrold knowing what you and i both know do you refuse to hand me your resignation of course i do do you mean to deny to me where i saw you last night i deny your right to question me i deny anything everything i believe you simply thought you had a clue and could make me tell suppose i was out last night i dont believe you know the faintest thing about it do you want me to report the whole thing to the colonel of course i dont naturally i want him to know nothing about my being out of quarters and its a thing that no officer would think of reporting another for youll only win the contempt of every gentleman in the regiment if you do it what good will it do you keep me from going to town for a few days i suppose what earthly business is it of yours anyway jerrold i can stand this no longer i ought to shoot you in your tracks i believe youve brought ruin and misery to the home of my warmest friend and dishonor to the whole service and you talk of two or three days stoppage from going to town if i cant bring you to your senses by god the colonel shall and he wheeled and left the room for a moment jerrold stood stunned and silent it was useless to attempt reply the captain was far down the walk when he sprang to the door to call him again then hurrying back to the bedroom he hastily dressed muttering angrily and anxiously to himself as he did so he was thinking deeply too and every movement betrayed nervousness and trouble returning to the front door he gazed out upon the parade then took his foragecap and walked rapidly down towards the adjutants office the orderly bugler was tilted up in a chair leaning half asleep against the whitewashed front but his was a weasel nap for he sprang up and saluted as the young officer approached where did major sloat go orderly was the hurried question over towards the stables sir him and captain chester was here together and theyre just gone run over to the quarters of b company and tell merrick i want him right away tell him to come to my quarters and thither mr jerrold returned seated himself at his desk wrote several lines of a note tore it into fragments began again wrote another which seemed not entirely satisfactory and was in the midst of a third when there came a quick step and a knock at the door opening the shutters he glanced out of the window a gust of wind sent some of the papers whirling and flying and the bedroom door banged shut but not before some few halfsheets of paper had fluttered out upon the parade where other little flurries of the morning breeze sent them sailing over towards the colonels quarters anxious only for the coming of merrick and no one else mr jerrold no sooner saw who was at the front door than he closed the shutters called come in and a short squat wiry little man dressed in the fatigueuniform of the infantry stood at the doorway to the hall come in here merrick said the lieutenant and merrick came how much is it you owe me now thirtyodd dollars i think i believe it is lieutenant answered the man with shifting eyes and general uneasiness of mien you are not ready to pay it i suppose and you got it from me when we left fort raines to help you out of that scrape there the soldier looked down and made no answer merrick i want a note taken to town at once i want you to take it and get it to its address before eight oclock i want you to say no word to a soul heres ten dollars hire old murphys horse across the river and go if you are put in the guardhouse when you get back dont say a word if you are tried by garrison court for crossing the bridge or absence without leave plead guilty make no defence and ill pay you double your fine and let you off the thirty dollars but if you fail me or tell a soul of your errand ill write to you know who at raines do you understand and agree i do yessir go and get ready and be here in ten minutes meantime captain chester had followed sloat to the adjutants office he was boiling over with indignation which he hardly knew how to control he found the graymoustached subaltern tramping in great perplexity up and down the room and the instant he entered was greeted with the inquiry whats gone wrong whats jerrold been doing dont ask me any questions sloat but answer it is a matter of honor what was your bet with jerrold i oughtnt to tell that chester surely it cannot be a matter mixed up with this i cant explain sloat what i ask is unavoidable tell me about that bet why he was so superior and airy you know and was trying to make me feel that he was so much more intimate with them all at the colonels and that he could have that picture for the mere asking and i got mad and bet him he never could was that the day you shook hands on it yes and that was her picture the picture then he showed you this morning chester you heard the conversation you were there you know that im on honor not to tell yes i know thats quite enough v before seven oclock that same morning captain chester had come to the conclusion that only one course was left open for him after the brief talk with sloat at the office he had increased the perplexity and distress of that easilymuddled soldier by requesting his company in a brief visit to the stables and corrals a square and reliable old veteran was the quartermaster sergeant who had charge of those establishments chester had known him for years and his fidelity and honesty were matters the officers of his former regiment could not too highly commend when sergeant parks made an official statement there was no shaking its solidity he slept in a little box of a house close by the entrance to the main stable in which were kept the private horses of several of the officers and among them mr jerrolds and it was his boast that day or night no horse left that stable without his knowledge the old man was superintending the morning labors of the stablehands and looked up in surprise at so early a visit from the officer of the day were you here all last night sergeant was chesters abrupt question certainly sir and up until one oclock or more were any horses out during the night any officers horses i mean no sir not one i thought possibly some officers might have driven or ridden to town no sir the only horses that crossed this threshold going out last night were mr suttons team from town they were put up here until near one oclock and then the doctor sent over for them i locked up right after that and can swear nothing else went out chester entered the stable and looked curiously around presently his eye lighted on a tall rangy bay horse that was being groomed in a wide stall near the doorway thats mr jerrolds roderick isnt it yes sir hes fresh as a daisy too hasnt been out for three days and mr jerrolds going to drive the dogcart this morning chester turned away sloat said he as they left the stable if mr jerrold was away from the post last night and you heard me say he was out of his quarters could he have gone any way except afoot after what you heard parks say gone in the suttons outfit i suppose was sloats cautious answer in which event he would have been seen by the sentry at the bridge would he not ought to have been certainly then well go back to the guardhouse and wonderingly and uncomfortably sloat followed he had long since begun to wish he had held his peace and said nothing about the confounded rollcall he hated rows of any kind he didnt like jerrold but he would have crawled ventre а terre across the wide parade sooner than see a scandal in the regiment he loved and it was becoming apparent to his sluggish faculties that it was no mere matter of absence from quarters that was involving jerrold chester was all aflame over that picturebusiness he remembered and the whole drift of his present investigation was to prove that jerrold was not absent from the post but absent only from his quarters if so where had he spent his time until nearly four sloats heart was heavy with vague apprehension he knew that jerrold had borne alice renwick away from the party at an unusually early hour for such things to break up he knew that he and others had protested against such desertion but she declared it could not be helped he remembered another thing a matter that he thought of at the time only from another point of view it now seemed to have significance bearing on this very matter for chester suddenly asked wasnt it rather odd that miss beaubien was not here at the dance she has never missed one seems to me since jerrold began spooning with her last year why she was here she was are you sure rollins never spoke of it and we had been talking of her i inferred from what he said that she was not there at all and i saw her drive homeward with her mother right after parade so it didnt occur to me that she could have come out again all that distance in time for the dance singular why shouldnt rollins have told me sloat grinned a dreary sort of smile it was too you go into society so seldom you dont see these things ive more than half suspected rollins of being quite ready to admire miss beaubien himself and since jerrold dropped her he has had plenty of opportunity great guns i never thought of it if id known she was to be there id have gone myself last night how did she behave to miss renwick why sweet and smiling and chipper as you please if anything i think miss renwick was cold and distant to her i couldnt make it out at all and did jerrold dance with her once i think and they had a talk out on the piazza just a minute i happened to be at the door and couldnt help seeing it and what got me was this mr hall came out with miss renwick on his arm they were chatting and laughing as they passed me but the moment she caught sight of jerrold and miss beaubien she stopped and said i think i wont stay out here its too chilly or something like it and went right in and then jerrold dropped miss beaubien and went after her he just handed the young lady over to me saying he was engaged for next dance and skipped how did she like that wasnt she furious no thats another thing that got me she smiled after him all sweetness and well she did say i count upon you youll be there and he nodded oh she was bright as a button after that what did she mean be where do you suppose sloat this all means more to me and to us all than i can explain i dont know i cant imagine was it to see her again that night i dont know at all if it was he fooled her for he never went near her again rollins put her in the carriage whose did she come out with the suttons why certainly i thought you knew that and neither old madame beaubien nor mrs sutton with them what was the old squaw thinking of by this time they had neared the guardhouse where several of the men were seated awaiting the call for the next relief all arose at the shout of the sentry on number one turning out the guard for the officer of the day chester made hurried and impatient acknowledgment of the salute and called to the sergeant to send him the sentry who was at the bridge at one oclock it turned out to be a young soldier who had enlisted at the post only six months before and was already known as one of the most intelligent and promising candidates for a corporalship in the garrison were you on duty at the bridge at one oclock carey asked the captain i was sir my relief went on at and came off at what persons passed your post during that time there was a squad or two of men coming back from town on pass i halted them sir and corporal murray came down and passed them in i dont mean coming from town who went the other way only one carriage sir mr suttons could you see who were in it certainly sir it was right under the lamppost this end of the bridge that i stood when i challenged lieutenant rollins answered for them and passed them out he was sitting beside mr sutton as they drove up then jumped out and gave me the countersign and bade them goodnight right there rollins again thought chester why did he keep this from me who were in the carriage he asked mr sutton sir on the front seat driving and two young ladies on the back seat nobody else not a soul sir i could see in it plain as day one lady was miss sutton and the other miss beaubien i know i was surprised at seeing the latter because she drove home in her own carriage last evening right after parade i was on post there at that hour too sir the second relief is on from to that will do carey i see your relief is forming now as the officers walked away and sloat silently plodded along beside his darkbrowed senior the latter turned to him i should say that there was no way in which mr jerrold could have gone townwards last night should not you he might have crossed the bridge while the third relief was on and got a horse at the other side he didnt do that sloat i had already questioned the sentry on that relief it was the third that i inspected and visited this morning well how do you know he wanted to go to town why couldnt he have gone up the river or out to the range perhaps there was a little game of draw out at camp there was no light in camp much less a little game of draw after eleven oclock you know well enough that there is nothing of that kind going on with gaines in command that isnt jerrolds game even if those fellows were bent on ruining their eyesight and nerve and spoiling the chance of getting the men on the division and army teams i wish it were his game instead of what it is still chester he may have been out in the country somewhere you seem bent on the conviction he was up to mischief here around this post i wont ask you what you mean but theres more than one way of getting to town if a man wants to very bad how of course he can take a skiff and row down the river but hed never be back in time for reveille there goes six oclock and i must get home and shave and think this over keep your own counsel no matter who asks you if you hear any questions or talk about shooting last night you know nothing heard nothing and saw nothing shooting last night exclaimed sloat all agog with eagerness and excitement now where was it who was it but chester turned a deaf ear upon him and walked away he wanted to see rollins and went straight home why didnt you tell me miss beaubien was out here last night was the question he asked as soon as he had entered the room where all aglow from his cold bath the youngster was dressing for breakfast he colored vividly then laughed well you never gave me much chance to say anything did you you talked all the time as i remember and suddenly vanished and slammed the door i would have told you had you asked me but all the same it was evident for the first time that here was a subject rollins was shy of mentioning did you go down and see them across sentry post certainly jerrold asked me to he said he had to take miss renwick home and was too tired to come back was going to turn in i was glad to do anything to be civil to the suttons why id like to know they have never invited you to the house or shown you any attention whatever you are not their style at all rollins and im glad of it it wasnt for their sake you stayed there until one oclock instead of being here in bed i wish and he looked wistfully earnestly at his favorite now i wish i could think it wasnt for the sake of miss beaubiens black eyes and aboriginal beauty look here captain said rollins with another rush of color to his face you dont seem to fancy miss beaubien and shes a friend of mine and one i dont like to hear slightingly spoken of you said a good deal last night that well wasnt pleasant to hear i know it rollins i beg your pardon i didnt know then that you were more than slightly acquainted with her im an old bat and go out very little but some things are pretty clear to my eyes and dont you be falling in love with nina beaubien that is no match for you im sure you never had a word to say against her father the old colonel was a perfect type of the french gentleman from all i hear yes and her mother is as perfect a type of a chippewa squaw if she is only a halfbreed and claims to be only a sixteenth rollins theres indian blood enough in nina beaubiens little finger to make me afraid of her she is strong as death in love or hate and you must have seen how she hung on jerrolds every word all last winter you must know she is not the girl to be lightly dropped now she told me only a day or two ago they were the best of friends and had never been anything else said rollins hotly has it gone that far my boy i had not thought it so bad by any means its no use talking with a man who has lost his heart his reason goes with it and chester turned away you dont know anything about it was all poor rollins could think of as a suitable thing to shout after him and it made no more impression than it deserved as has been said captain chester had decided before seven oclock that but one course lay open to him in the matter as now developed had armitage been there he would have had an adviser but there was no other man whose counsel he eared to seek old captain gray was as bitter against jerrold as chester himself and with even better reason for he knew well the cause of his little daughters listless manner and tearful eyes she had been all radiance and joy at the idea of coming to sibley and being near the great cities but not one happy look had he seen in her sweet and wistful face since the day of her arrival wilton too was another captain who disliked jerrold and chesters rugged sense of fair play told him that it was not among the enemies of the young officer that he should now seek advice but that if he had a friend among the older and wiser heads in the regiment it was due to him that that older and wiser head be given a chance to think a little for jerrolds sake and there was not one among the seniors whom he could call upon as he ran over their names chester for the first time realized that his exsubaltern had not a friend among the captains and senior officers now on duty at the fort his indifference to duties his airy foppishness his conceit and selfsufficiency had all served to create a feeling against him and this had been intensified by his conduct since coming to sibley the youngsters still kept up jovial relations with and professed to like him but among the seniors there were many men who had only a nod for him on meeting wilton had epitomized the situation by saying he had no use for a masher and poor old gray had one day scowlingly referred to him as the professional beauty in view of all this feeling chester would gladly have found some man to counsel further delay but there was none he felt that he must inform the colonel at once of the fact that mr jerrold was absent from his quarters at the time of the firing of his belief that it was jerrold who struck him and sped past the sentry in the dark and of his conviction that the sooner the young officer was called to account for his strange conduct the better as to the episodes of the ladder the lights and the form at the dormerwindow he meant for the present at least to lock them in his heart but he forgot that others too must have heard those shots and that others too would be making inquiries vi a lovely morning it was that beamed on sibley and the broad and beautiful valley of the cloudwater when once the sun got fairly above the moist horizon mist and vapor and heavy cloud all seemed swallowed up in the gathering glowing warmth as though the king of day had risen athirst and drained the welcoming cup of nature it must have rained at least a little during the darkness of the night for dew there could have been none with skies so heavily overcast and yet the short smooth turf on the parade the leaves upon the little shadetrees around the quadrangle and all the beautiful vines here on the trelliswork of the colonels veranda shone and sparkled in the radiant light the roses in the little garden and the oldfashioned morningglory vines over at the east side were all aglitter in the flooding sunshine when the bugler came out from a glance at the clock in the adjutants office and sounded sickcall to the indifferent ear of the garrison once each day at am the doctor trudged across to the hospital and looked over the halfdozen hopelessly healthy but wouldbe invalids who wanted to get off guard duty or a morning at the range thanks to the searching examination to which every soldier must be subjected before he can enter the service of uncle sam and to the disciplined order of the lives of the men at sibley maladies of any serious nature were almost unknown it was a gloriously healthy post as everybody admitted and to judge from the specimen of youngwomanhood that came singing blithe and low out among the roses this same joyous morning exuberant physical wellbeing was not restricted to the men a fairer picture never did dark beauty present than alice renwick as she bent among the bushes or reached high among the vines in search of her favorite flowers tall slender willowy yet with exquisitelyrounded form slim dainty little hands and feet graceful arms and wrists all revealed in the flowing sleeves of her snowy weblike gown fitting her and displaying her sinuous grace of form as gowns so seldom do today and then her face a glorious picture of rich ripe tropical beauty with its great soulful sunlit eyes heavily shaded though they were with those wondrous lashes beautiful too in contour as was the lithe body and beautiful in every feature even to the rare and dewy curve of her red lips half opened as she sang she was smiling to herself as she crooned her soft murmuring melody and every little while the great dark eyes glanced over towards the shaded doors of bachelors row there was no one up to watch and tell why should she not look thither and even stand one moment peering under the veranda at a darkened window halfway down the row as though impatient at the nonappearance of some familiar signal how came the laggard late how slept the knight while here his lady stood impatient she twined the leaves and roses in a fragrant knot ran lightly within and laid them on the snowy cloth beside the colonels seat at table came forth and plucked some more and fastened them blushing blissful in the lacefringed opening of her gown through which soft and creamy shone the perfect neck daisy tell my fortune pray he loves me not he loves me she blithely sang then hurrying to the gate shaded her eyes with the shapely hand and gazed intently twas nearing eight nearing breakfasttime but some one was coming horrid captain chester of all men coming of course to see papa and papa not yet down and mamma had a headache and had decided not to come down at all she would breakfast in her room what girl on earth when looking and longing and waiting for the coming of a graceful youth of twentysix would be anything but dismayed at the substitution therefor of a bulky heavyhearted captain of fortysix no matter if he were still unmarried and yet her smile was sweet and cordial why goodmorning captain chester im so glad to see you this bright day do come in and let me give you a rose papa will soon be down and she opened the gate and held forth one long slim hand he took it slowly as though in a dream raising his foragecap at the same time yet making no reply he was looking at her far more closely than he imagined how fresh how radiant how fair and gracious and winning every item of her attire was so pure and white and spotless every fold and curve of her gown seemed charged with subtile delicate fragrance as faint and sweet as the shy and modest woodviolets she noted his silence and his haggard eyes she noted the intent gaze and the color mounted straightway to her forehead and have you no word of greeting for me she blithely laughed striving to break through the awkwardness of his reserve or are you worn out with your night watch as officer of the day he fairly started had she seen him then did she know it was he who stood beneath her window he who leaped in chase of that scoundrel he who stole away with that heavy telltale ladder and knowing all this could she stand there smiling in his face the incarnation of maiden innocence and beauty impossible yet what could she mean how did you know i had so long a vigil he asked and the cold strained tone the halfaverted eyes the pallor of his face all struck her at once instantly her manner changed oh forgive me captain i see you are all worn out and im keeping you here at the gate come to the piazza and sit down ill tell papa you are here for i know you want to see him and she tripped lightly away before he could reply and rustled up the stairs he could hear her light tap at the colonels door and her soft clear flutelike voice papa captain chester is here to see you papa indeed she spoke to him and of him as though he were her own he treated her as though she were his flesh and blood as though he loved her devotedly even before she came had not they been prepared for this did not mrs maynard tell them that alice had become enthusiastically devoted to her stepfather and considered him the most knightly and chivalric hero she had ever seen he could hear the colonels hearty and loving tone in reply and then she came fluttering down again papa will be with you in five minutes captain but wont you let me give you some coffee its all ready and you look so tired even ill i have had a bad night he answered but im growing old and cannot stand sleeplessness as you young people seem to was she faltering he watched her eagerly narrowly almost wonderingly not a trace of confusion not a sign of fear and yet had he not seen her and that other figure i wish you could sleep as i do was the prompt reply i was in the land of dreams ten minutes after my head touched the pillow and mamma made me come home early last night because of our journey today you know we are going down to visit aunt grace colonel maynards sister at lake sablon and mamma wanted me to be looking my freshest and best she said and i never heard a thing till reveille his eyes sad penetrating doubting yet selfdoubting too searched her very soul unflinchingly the dark orbs looked into his even pityingly for she quickly spoke again captain do come into the breakfastroom and have some coffee you have not breakfasted im sure he raised his hand as though to repel her offer even to put her aside he must understand her he could not be hoodwinked in this way pardon me miss renwick but did you hear nothing strange last night or early this morning were you not disturbed at all i no indeed true her face had changed now but there was no fear in her eyes it was a look of apprehension perhaps of concern and curiosity mingled for his tone betrayed that something had happened which caused him agitation and you heard no shots fired shots no oh captain chester what does it mean who was shot tell me and now with paling face and wild apprehension in her eyes she turned and gazed beyond him past the vines and the shady veranda across the sunshine of the parade and under the old piazza searching that still closed and darkened window who she implored her hands clasping nervously her eyes returning eagerly to his face it was not mr jerrold he answered coldly he is unhurt so far as shot is concerned then how is he hurt is he hurt at all she persisted and then as she met his gaze her eyes fell and the burning blush of maiden shame surged up to her forehead she sank upon a seat and covered her face with her hands i thought of mr jerrold naturally he said he would be over early this morning was all she could find to say i have seen him and presume he will come to all appearances he is the last man to suffer from last nights affair he went on relentlessly almost brutally but she never winced it is odd you did not hear the shots i thought yours was the northwest room this one he indicated pointing overhead so it is and i slept there all last night and heard nothing not a thing do tell me what the trouble was then what was there for him to say the colonels footsteps were heard upon the stair and the colonel with extended hand and beaming face and cheery welcome came forth from the open doorway welcome chester im glad youve come just in time for breakfast mrs maynard wont be down she slept badly last night and is sleeping now what was the firing last night i did not hear it at the time but the orderly and old maria the cook were discussing it as i was shaving it is that i came to see you about colonel i am the man to hold responsible no prisoners got away i hope no sir nothing i fear that would seem to justify my action i ordered number five to fire why what on earth could have happened around there almost back of us said the colonel in surprise i do not know what had happened or what was going to happen and chester paused a moment and glanced towards the door through which miss renwick had retired as soon as the colonel arrived the old soldier seemed to understand the glance she would not listen he said proudly i know explained chester i think it best that no one but you should hear anything of the matter for the present until i have investigated further it was nearly halfpast three this morning as i got around here on fives post inspecting sentinels and came suddenly in the darkness upon a man carrying a ladder on his shoulder i ordered him to halt the reply was a violent blow and the ladder and i were dropped at the same instant while the man sprang into space and darted off in the direction of number five i followed quick as i could heard the challenge and the cries of halt and shouted to leary to fire he did but missed his aim in the haste and darkness and the man got safely away of course there is much talk and speculation about it around the post this morning for several people heard the shots besides the guard and although i told leary and others to say nothing i know it is already generally known oh well come in to breakfast said the colonel well talk it over there pardon me sir i cannot i must get back home before guardmount and rollins is probably waiting to see me now i i could not discuss it at the table for there are some singular features about the matter why in gods name what asked the colonel with sudden and deep anxiety well sir an officer of the garrison is placed in a compromising position by this affair and cannot or will not explain who mr jerrold sir jerrold why i got a note from him not ten minutes ago saying he had an engagement in town and asking permission to go before guardmounting if mr hall was ready hall wanted to go with him jerrold wrote but hall has not applied for permission to leave the post it is jerrold who is compromised colonel i may be all wrong in my suspicions all wrong in reporting the matter to you at all but in my perplexity and distress i see no other way frankly sir the moment i caught sight of the man he looked like jerrold and two minutes after the shots were fired i inspected jerrolds quarters he was not there though the lamps were burning very low in the bedroom and his bed had not been occupied at all when you see leary sir he will tell you that he also thought it must be mr jerrold the young scapegrace been off to town i suppose colonel said chester quickly you not i must decide that i went to his quarters after reveille and he was then there and resented my visit and questions admitted that he had been out during the night but refused to make any statement to me well chester i will haul him up after breakfast possibly he had been up to the riflecamp or had driven to town after the doctors party of course that must be stopped but im glad you missed him it of course staggers a mans judgment to be knocked down but if you had killed him it might have been as serious for you as this knockdown blow will be for him that is the worst phase of the matter what could he have been thinking of he must have been either drunk or mad and he rarely drank oh dear dear dear but thats very bad very bad striking the officer of the day why chester thats the worst thing thats happened in the regiment since i took command of it its about the worst thing that could have happened to us of course he must go in arrest ill see the adjutant right after breakfast ill be over early chester and with grave and worried face the colonel bade him adieu as he turned away chester heard him saying again to himself about the worst thing he could have done the worst thing he could have done and the captains heart sank within him what would the colonel say when he knew how far far worse was the foul wrong mr jerrold had done to him and his vii before guardmounting almost half an hour before his usual time for appearing at the office colonel maynard hurried in to his desk sent the orderly for captain chester and then the clerks in the sergeantmajors room heard him close and lock the door as the subject of the shooting was already under discussion among the men there assembled this action on the part of the chief was considered highly significant it was hardly five minutes before chester came looked surprised at finding the door locked knocked and was admitted the look on the haggard face at the desk the dumb misery in the eyes the wrath and horror in it all carried him back twenty years to that gloomy morning in the casemates when the story was passed around that captain maynard had lost a wife and an intimate friend during the previous night chester saw at a glance that despite his precautions the blow had come the truth been revealed at one fell swoop lock the door again chester and come here i have some questions to ask you the captain silently took the chair which was indicated by a wave of the colonels hand and waited for a moment no word more was spoken the old soldier white and trembling strangely reseated himself at the desk and covered his face with his hands twice he drew them with feebly stroking movement over his eyes as though to rally the stunned faculties and face the trying ordeal then a shiver passed through his frame and with sudden lift of the head he fixed his gaze on chesters face and launched the question chester is there any kindness to a man who has been through what i have in telling only half a tale as you have done the captain colored red i am at a loss to answer you colonel he said after brief reflection you know far more than you did half an hour ago and what i knew i could not bear to tell you as yet my god my god tell me all and tell me at once here man if you need stimulant to your indignation and cannot speak without it read this i found it open among the rosebushes in the garden where she must have dropped it when out there with you read it tell me what it means for god knows i cant believe such a thing of her he handed chester a sheet of notepaper it was moist and blurred on the first page but the inner pages though damp were in good condition the first second and third pages were closely covered in a bold nervous hand that chester knew well it was jerrolds writing beyond a doubt and chesters face grew hot as he read and his heart turned cold as stone when he finished the last hurried line my darling i must see you if only for a moment before you leave do not let this alarm you for the more i think the more i am convinced it is only a bluff but captain chester discovered my absence early this morning when spying around as usual and now he claims to have knowledge of our secret even if he was on the terrace when i got back it was too dark for him to recognize me and it seems impossible that he can have got any real clue he suspects perhaps and thinks to force me to confession but i would guard your name with my life be wary act as though there were nothing on earth between us and if we cannot meet until then i will be at the dйpфt with the others to see you off and will then have a letter ready with full particulars and instructions it will be in the first thing i hand to you hide it until you can safely read it your mother must not be allowed a glimmer of suspicion and then you are safe as for me even chester cannot make the colonel turn against me now my jealous one my fiery sweetheart do you not realize now that i was wise in showing her so much attention a thousand kisses come what may they cannot rob us of the past howard i fear you heard and were alarmed by the shots just after i left you all was quiet when i got home it was some seconds before chester could control himself sufficiently to speak i wish to god the bullet had gone through his heart he said it has gone through mine through mine this will kill her mother chester cried the colonel springing suddenly to his feet she must not know it she must not dream of it i tell you it would stretch her in the dust dead for she loves that child with all her strength with all her being i believe for it is two motherloves in one she had a son older than alice by several years her firstborn her glory he was but the boy inherited the fathers passionate and impulsive nature he loved a girl utterly beneath him and would have married her when he was only twenty there is no question that he loved her well for he refused to give her up no matter what his father threatened they tried to buy her off and she scorned them then they had a letter written while he was sent abroad under pretence that he should have his will if he came back in a year unchanged by jove it seems she was as much in love as he and it broke her heart she went off and died somewhere and he came back ahead of time because her letters had ceased and found it all out there was an awful scene he cursed them both father and mother and left her senseless at his feet and from that day to this they never heard of him never could get the faintest report it broke renwick killed him i guess for he died in two years and as for the mother you would not think that a woman so apparently full of life and health was in desperate danger she had some organic trouble with the heart years ago they tell her and this experience has developed it so that now any great emotion or sudden shock is perilous do you not see how doubly fearful this comes to us chester i have weathered one awful storm but im old and broken now this this beats me tell me what to do the captain was silent a few moments he was thinking intently does she know you have that letter he asked maynard shook his head i looked back as i came away she was in the parlor singing softly to herself at the very moment i picked it up lying open as it was right there among the roses the first words staring me in the face i meant not to read it never dreamed it was for her and had turned over the page to look for the superscription there was none but there i saw the signature and that postscript about the shots that startled me and i read it here just before you came and then could account for your conduct something i could not do before god of heaven would any man believe it of her it is incredible chester tell me everything you know now even everything you suspect i must see my way clear and then the captain with halting and reluctant tongue told his story how he had stumbled on the ladder back of the colonels quarters and learned from number five that some one had been prowling back of bachelors row how he returned there afterwards found the ladder at the sidewall and saw the tall form issue from her window how he had given chase and been knocked breathless and of his suspicions and learys as to the identity of the stranger the colonel bowed his head still deeper and groaned aloud but he had still other questions to ask did you see any one else at the window not while he was there at any time then before or after and the colonels eyes would take no denial i saw faltered chester nobody the shade was pulled up while i was standing there after i had tripped on the ladder i supposed the noise of my stumble had awakened her and was that all did you see nothing more colonel i did see afterwards a womans hand and arm closing the shade my god and she told me she slept the night through never waked or heard a sound did you hear nothing yourself colonel nothing when she came home from the party she stopped a moment saying something to him at the door then came into the library and kissed me goodnight i shut up the house and went to bed about halfpast twelve and her door was closed when i went to our room so there were two closed doors yours and hers and the broad hall between you certainly we have the doors open all night that lead into the rear rooms and their windows this gives us abundant air alice always has the hall door closed at night and mrs maynard was she asleep no mrs maynard was lying awake and seemed a little restless and disturbed some of the women had been giving her some hints about jerrold and fretting her you know she took a strange fancy to him at the start it was simply because he reminded her so strongly of the boy she had lost she told me so but after a little she began to discover traits in him she did not like and then his growing intimacy with alice worried her she would have put a stop to the doctors party to her going with him i mean but the engagement was made some days ago two or three days since she warned alice not to trust him she says and it is really as much on this as any other account that we decided to get her away off to see her aunt grace oh god how blind we are how blind we are and poor old maynard bowed his head and almost groaned aloud chester rose and in his characteristic way began tramping nervously up and down there was a knock at the door the adjutants compliments and twas time for guardmount would the colonel wish to see him before he went out asked the orderly i ought to go sir said chester i am old officer of the day and there will be just time for me to get into full uniform let them go on without you said maynard i cannot spare you now send word to that effect now now about this man this jerrold what is the best thing we can do of course i know what he most deserves but what is the best thing under all the circumstances of course my wife and alice will leave today she was still sleeping when i left and pray god is not dreaming of this it was nearly two before she closed her eyes last night and i too slept badly you have seen him what does he say denies everything anything challenges me to prove that he was absent from his house more than five minutes indeed i could not for he may have come in just after i left and pretended utter ignorance of my meaning when i accused him of striking me before i ordered the sentry to fire of course it is all useless now when i confront him with this letter he must give in then let him resign and get away as quietly as possible before the end of the week no one need know the causes of course shooting is what he deserves but shooting demands explanation it is better for your name hers and all that he should be allowed to live than that the truth were suspected as it would be if he were killed indeed sir if i were you i would take them to sablon keep them away for a fortnight and leave him to me it may be even judicious to let him go on with all his duties as though nothing had happened as though he had simply been absent from reveille and let the whole matter drop like that until all remark and curiosity is lulled then you can send her back to europe or the east time enough to decide on that but i will privately tell him he must quit the service in six months and show him why it isnt the way it ought to be settled it probably isnt the way armitage would do it but it is the best thing that occurs to me one thing is certain you and they ought to get away at once and he should not be permitted to see her again i can run the post a few days and explain matters after you go the colonel sat in wretched silence a few moments then he arose if it were not for her danger her heart i would never drop the matter here never i would see it through to the bitter end but you are probably right as to the prudent course to take ill get them away on the noon train he thinks they do not start until later now i must go and face it my god chester could you look at that child and realize it even now even now sir i believe i believe someway somehow she is innocent god grant it sir and then the colonel left the office avoiding as has been told a word with any man chester buttoned the telltale letter in an inner pocket after having first folded the sheet lengthwise and then enclosed it in a long official envelope the officers wondering at the colonels distraught appearance had come thronging in hoping for information and then had gone unsatisfied and disgusted practically turned out by their crabbed senior captain the ladies after chatting aimlessly about the quadrangle for half an hour had decided that mrs maynard must be ill and while most of them awaited the result two of their number went to the colonels house and rang at the bell a servant appeared mrs maynard wasnt very well this morning and was breakfasting in her room and miss alice was with her if the ladies would please excuse them and so the emissaries returned unsuccessful then too as we have seen despite his good intention of keeping matters hushed as much as possible chesters nervous irritability had got the better of him and he had made damaging admissions to wilton of the existence of a cause of worriment and perplexity and this wilton told without compunction and then there was another excitement that set all tongues wagging every man had heard what chester said that mr jerrold must not quit the garrison until he had first come and seen the temporary commanding officer and hall had speedily carried the news to his friend are you ready to go asked mr jerrold who was lacing his boots in the rear room no ive got to go and get into cits first all right go and be lively ill wait for you at murphys beyond the bridge provided you say nothing about it you dont mean you are going against orders going of course i am ive got old maynards permission and if chester means to revoke it hes got to get his adjutant here inside of ten seconds what you tell me isnt official im off now and when the adjutant returned to captain chester it was with the information that he was too late mr jerrolds dogcart had crossed the bridge five minutes earlier perhaps an hour later the colonel sent for chester and the captain went to his house the old soldier was pacing slowly up and down the parlor floor i wanted you a moment a singular thing has happened you know that directoire cabinet photo of alice my wife always kept it on her dressingtable and this morning its gone that frame the silver filigree thing was found behind a sofapillow in alices room and she declares she has no idea how it got there chester is there any new significance in this the captain bowed assent what is it that photograph was seen by major sloat in jerrolds bureaudrawer at reveille this morning and such was the situation at sibley the august day the colonel took his wife and her lovely daughter to visit aunt grace at lake sablon viii in the big red omnibus that was slowly toiling over the dusty road several passengers were making their way from the railwaystation to the hotel at lake sablon two of them were women of mature years whose dress and bearing betokened lives of ease and comfort another was a lovely brunette of less than twenty the daughter evidently of one of these ladies and an object of loving pride to both these three seemed at home in their surroundings and were absorbed in the packet of letters and papers they had just received at the station it was evident that they were not new arrivals as were the other passengers who studied them with the halfenvious feelings with which newcomers at a summer resort are apt to regard those who seem to have been long established there and who gathered from the scraps of conversation that they had merely been over to say goodby to friends leaving on the very train which brought in the rest of what we good americans term the busload there were women among the newlyarrived who inspected the dark girl with that calm unflinching impertinent scrutiny and halfaudibly whispered comment which had they been of the opposite sex would have warranted their being kicked out of the conveyance but which was ignored by the fair object and her friends as completely as were the commentators themselves there were one or two men in the omnibus who might readily have been forgiven an admiring glance or two at so bright a vision of girlish beauty as was miss renwick this august afternoon and they had looked but the one who most attracted the notice of mrs maynard and aunt grace a tall stalwart distinguishedlooking party in gray travellingdress had taken his seat close to the door and was deep in the mornings paper before they were fairly away from the station laying down the letter she had just finished reading mrs maynard glanced at her daughter who was still engaged in one of her own and evidently with deep interest from fort sibley alice yes mamma all three miss craven mrs hoyt and mr jerrold would you like to see it and with rising color she held forth the one in her hand not now was the answer with a smile that told of confidence and gratification both it is about the german i suppose yes he thinks it outrageous that we should not be there says it is to be the prettiest ever given at the fort and that mrs hoyt and mrs craven who are the managers for the ladies had asked him to lead he wants to know if we cannot possibly come are you not very eager to go alice i should be said aunt grace with sympathetic interest yes i am answered miss renwick reflectively it had been arranged that it should come off next week when as was supposed we would be home after this visit it cannot be postponed of course because it is given in honor of all the officers who are gathered there for the riflecompetition and that will be all over and done with today and they cannot stay beyond tuesday next we must give it up auntie and she looked up smilingly and you have made it so lovely for me here that i can do it without a sigh think of that an army german and fanny craven says the favors are to be simply lovely yes i did want to go but papa said he felt unequal to it the moment he got back from chicago day before yesterday and he certainly does not look at all well so that ended it and i wrote at once to mrs hoyt this is her answer now what does she say oh it is very kind of her she wants me to come and be her guest if the colonel is too ill to come and mamma will not leave him she says mr hoyt will come down and escort me but i would not like to go without mamma and the big dark eyes looked up wistfully and i know she does not care to urge papa when he seems so indisposed to going mrs maynards eyes were anxious and troubled now she turned to her sisterinlaw do you think he seems any better grace i do not it is hard to say he was so nervously anxious to get away to see the general the very day you arrived here that there was not a moment in which i could ask him about himself and since his return he has avoided all mention of it beyond saying it is nothing but indigestion and he would be all right in a few days i never knew him to suffer in that way in my life is there any regimental matter that can be troubling him she asked in lower tone nothing of any consequence whatever of course the officers feel chagrined over their defeat in the riflematch they had expected to stand very high but mr jerrolds shooting was unexpectedly below the average and it threw their team behind but the colonel didnt make the faintest allusion to it that hasnt worried him anywhere near as much as it has the others i should judge i do not think it was all mr jerrolds fault mamma said miss renwick with gentle reproach and a very becoming flush im going to stand up for him because i think they all blame him for other mens poor work he was not the only one on our team whose shooting was below former scores they claim that none fell so far below their expectations as he alice you know i am no judge of such matters but mr hoyt and captain gray both write the colonel that mr jerrold had been taking no care of himself whatever and was entirely out of form in any event im glad the cavalry did no better was miss renwicks loyal response you remember the evening we rode out to the range and captain gray said that there was the man who would win the first prize from mr jerrold that tall cavalry sergeant who fainted away sergeant mcleod dont you remember mother well he did not even get a place and mr jerrold beat him easily something in her mothers eyes warned her to be guarded and in that indefinable but unerring system of feminine telegraphy called her attention to the man sitting by the door looking quickly to her right miss renwick saw that he was intently regarding her at the mention of fort sibley the stranger had lowered his paper revealing a bronzed face cleanshaven except for the thick blonde moustache and a pair of clear steady searching blue eyes under heavy brows and lashes and these eyes were very deliberately yet respectfully fixed upon her own nor were they withdrawn in proper confusion when detected it was miss renwick whose eyes gave up the contest and returned in some sense of defeat to her mothers face what letters have you for the colonel asked mrs maynard coming au secours three two of them from his devoted henchman captain chester who writes by every mail i should imagine and these he will go off into some secluded nook with and come back looking blue and worried then heres another forwarded from sibley too i do not know this hand perhaps it is from captain armitage who they say is to come back next month poor mr jerrold why poor mr jerrold asked aunt grace with laughing interest as she noted the expression on her nieces pretty face because he cant bear captain armitage and now alice said her mother reprovingly you must not take his view of the captain at all remember what the colonel said of him mother dear protested alice laughing i have no doubt captain armitage is the paragon of a soldier but he is unquestionably a most unpleasant and ungentlemanly person in his conduct to the young officers mr hall has told me the same thing i declare i dont see how they can speak to him at all he has been so harsh and discourteous and unjust the color was rising in earnest now but a warning glance in her mothers eye seemed to check further words there was an instants silence then aunt grace remarked alice your nextdoor neighbor has vanished i think your vehemence has frightened him surely enough the big blueeyed man in tweeds had disappeared during this brief controversy he had quickly and noiselessly let himself out of the open door swung lightly to the ground and was out of sight among the trees why what a strange proceeding said aunt grace again we are fully a mile and a half from the hotel and he means to walk it in this glaring sun evidently he did the driver reined up at the moment in response to a suggestion from some one in a forward seat and there suddenly appeared by the wayside striding out from the shelter of the sumachs the athletic figure of the stranger go ahead he called in a deep chestvoice that had an unmistakable ring to it the tone that one so readily recognizes in men accustomed to prompt action and command im going across lots and swinging his heavy stick with quick elastic steps and erect carriage the man in gray plunged into a woodpath and was gone alice said aunt grace again that man is an officer im sure and you have driven him into exile and lonely wandering ive seen so much of them when visiting my brother in the old days before my marriage that even in civilian dress it is easy to tell some of them just look at that back and those shoulders he has been a soldier all his life horrors suppose it should be captain armitage himself miss renwick looked genuinely distressed as well as vexed certainly no officer but captain armitage would have had reason to leave the stage certainly officers and their families occasionally visited sablon in the summertime but captain armitage could hardly be here there was comforting assurance in the very note she held in her hand it cannot be she said because mr jerrold writes that they have just heard from him at sibley he is still at the seashore and will not return for a month mr jerrold says he implored captain chester to let him have three days leave to come down here and have a sail and a picnic with us and was told that it would be out of the question did he tell you any other news asked mrs maynard looking up from her letter again anything about the german he says he thinks it a shame we are to be away and well read it yourself and she placed it in her mothers hands the dark eyes seriously anxiously studying her face as she read presently mrs maynard laid it down and looked again into her own then pointing to a certain passage with her finger handed it to her daughter men were deceivers ever she said laughing yet oracularly significant and alice renwick could not quite control the start with which she read mr jerrold is to lead with his old love nina beaubien they make a capital pair and she of course will be radiant with alice out of the way that is something mr jerrold failed to mention is it not miss renwicks cheeks were flushed and the dark eyes were filled with sudden pain as she answered i did not know she was there she was to have gone to the lakes the same day we left she did go alice said her mother quietly but it was only for a brief visit it seems the colonel was not at their cottage when the omnibus reached the lake over at the hotel were the usual number of loungers gathered to see the new arrivals and alice presently caught sight of the colonel coming through the park if anything he looked more listless and dispirited than he had before they left she ran down the steps to meet him smiling brightly up into his worn and haggard face are you feeling a little brighter papa here are letters for you he took them wearily barely glancing at the superscriptions i had hoped for something more he said and passed on into the little frame house which was his sisters summer home is your mother here he asked looking back as he entered the door in the north room with aunt grace papa she answered and then once more and with graver face she began to read mr jerrolds letter it was a careful study she was making of it this time and not altogether a pleasant one aunt grace came out and made some laughing remark at seeing her still so occupied she looked up pluckily smiling despite a sense of wounded pride and answered i am only convincing myself that it was purely on general principles that mr jerrold seemed so anxious i should be there he never wanted me to lead with him at all all the same it stung and aunt grace saw and knew it and longed to take her to her heart and comfort her but it was better so she was finding him out unaided she was still studying over portions of that ingenious letter when the rustle of her aunts gown indicated that she was rising she saw her move towards the steps heard a quick firm tread upon the narrow planking and glanced up in surprise there uncovering his closecropped head stood the tall stranger looking placidly up as he addressed aunt grace pardon me can i see colonel maynard he is at home pray come up and take a chair i will let him know i i felt sure you must be some friend of his when i saw you in the stage said the good lady with manifest and apologetic uneasiness yes responded the stranger as he quickly ascended the steps and bowed before her smiling quietly the while let me introduce myself i am captain armitage of the colonels regiment there i knew it was aunt graces response as with both hands uplifted in tragic despair she gave one horrorstricken glance at alice and rushed into the house there was a moments silence then with burning cheeks but with brave eyes that looked frankly into his alice renwick arose came straight up to him and held out her pretty hand captain armitage i beg your pardon he took the extended hand and gazed earnestly into her face while a kind almost merry smile lighted up his own have the boys given me such an uncanny reputation as all that he asked and then as though tickled with the comicality of the situation he began to laugh what ogres some of us old soldiers do become in the course of years do you know young lady i might never have suspected what a brute i was if it had not been for you what a blessed thing it was the colonel did not tell you i was coming you would never have given me this true insight into my character but she saw nothing to laugh at and would not laugh her lovely face was still burning with blushes and dismay and full of trouble i do not look upon it lightly at all she said it was unpardonable in me to to to take so effective and convincing a method of telling a man of his grievous sins not a bit of it i like a girl who has the courage to stand up for her friends i shall congratulate jerrold and hall both when i get back lucky fellows that they are and evidently captain armitage was deriving altogether too much jolly entertainment from her awkwardness she rallied and strove to put an end to it indeed captain armitage i do think the young officers sorely need friends and advocates at times i never would have knowingly spoken to you of your personal responsibilities in the woes of mr jerrold and mr hall but since i have done so unwittingly i may as well define my position especially as you are so goodnatured with it all and here it must be admitted miss renwicks beautiful eyes were shyly lifted to his in a most telling way once there they looked squarely into the clear blue depths of his and never flinched it seemed to me several times at sibley that the young officers deserved more consideration and courtesy than their captains accorded them it was not you alone that i heard of i am profoundly gratified to learn that somebody else is a brute he answered trying to look grave but with that irrepressible merriment twitching at the corners of his mouth and giving sudden gleams of his firm white teeth through the thick moustache you are come to us just in time miss renwick and if you will let me come and tell you all my sorrows the next time the colonel pitches into me for something wrong in b company ill give you full permission to overhaul me for everything or anything i say and do to the youngsters is it a bargain and he held out his big firm hand i think you are very different from what i heard was all her answer as she looked up in his eyes twinkling as they were with fun oh we are to shake hands on it as a bargain is that it very well then ix when captain armitage left the cottage that night he did not go at once to his own room brief as was the conversation he had enjoyed with miss renwick it was all that fate vouchsafed him for that date at least the entire party went to tea together at the hotel but immediately thereafter the colonel carried armitage away and for two long hours they were closeted over some letters that had come from sibley and when the conference broke up and the wondering ladies saw the two men come forth it was late almost ten oclock and the captain did not venture beyond the threshold of the sittingroom he bowed and bade them a somewhat ceremonious goodnight his eyes rested lingered on miss renwicks uplifted face and it was the picture he took with him into the stillness of the summer night the colonel accompanied him to the steps and rested his hand upon the broad gray shoulder god only knows how i have needed you armitage this trouble has nearly crushed me and it seemed as though i were utterly alone i had the haunting fear that it was only weakness on my part and my love for my wife that made me stand out against chesters propositions he can only see guilt and conviction in every new phase of the case and though you see how he tries to spare me his letters give no hope of any other conclusion armitage pondered a moment before he answered then he slowly spoke chester has lived a lonely and an unhappy life his first experience after graduation was that wretched affair of which you have told me of course i knew much of the particulars before but not all i respect chester as a soldier and a gentleman and i like him and trust him as a friend but colonel maynard in a matter of such vital importance as this and one of such delicacy i distrust not his motives but his judgment all his life practically he has been brooding over the sorrow that came to him when your trouble came to you and his mind is grooved he believes he sees mystery and intrigue in matters that others might explain in an instant but think of all the array of evidence he has enough and more than enough i admit to warrant everything he has thought or said of the man but he simply puts it this way if he be guilty can she be less is it possible armitage that you are unconvinced certainly i am unconvinced the matter has not yet been sifted as i understand it you have forbidden his confronting jerrold with the proofs of his rascality until i get there admitting the evidence of the ladder the picture and the form at the window ay the letter too i am yet to be convinced of one thing you must remember that his judgment is biassed by his early experiences he fancies that no woman is proof against such fascinations as jerrolds and your belief is that some women many women are utterly above such a possibility old maynard wrung his comrades hand you make me hope in spite of myself my past experiences my very senses armitage i have leaned on you so many years that i missed you sorely when this trial came if you had been there things might not have taken this shape he looks upon chester and its one thing chester hasnt forgiven in him as a meddling old granny you remember the time he so spoke of him last year but he holds you in respect or is afraid of you which in a man of his calibre is about the same thing it may not be too late for you to act then when he is disposed of once and for all i can know what must be done where she is concerned and under no circumstances can you question mrs maynard no no if she suspected anything of this it would kill her in any event she must have no suspicion of it now but does she not ask has she no theory about the missing photograph surely she must marvel over its disappearance she does at least she did but im ashamed to own it armitage we had to quiet her natural suspicions in some way and i told her that it was my doing that i took it to tease alice put the photograph in the drawer of my desk and hid the frame behind her sofapillow chester knows of the arrangement and we had settled that when the picture was recovered from mr jerrold he would send it to me armitage was silent a frown settled on his forehead and it was evident that the statement was far from welcome to him presently he held forth his hand well goodnight sir i must go and have a quiet think over this i hope you will rest well you need it colonel but maynard only shook his head his heart was too troubled for rest of any kind he stood gazing out towards the park where the tall figure of his exadjutant had disappeared among the trees he heard the lowtoned pleasant chat of the ladies in the sittingroom but he was in no mood to join them he wished that armitage had not gone he felt such strength and comparative hope in his presence but it was plain that even armitage was confounded by the array of facts and circumstances that he had so painfully and slowly communicated to him the colonel went drearily back to the room in which they had had their long conference his wife and sister both hailed him as he passed the sittingroom door and urged him to come and join them they wanted to ask about captain armitage with whom it was evident they were much impressed but he answered that he had some letters to put away and he must attend first to that among those that had been shown to the captain mainly letters from chester telling of the daily events at the fort and of his surveillance in the case of jerrold was one which alice had brought him two days before this had seemed to him of unusual importance as the others contained nothing that tended to throw new light on the case it said i am glad you have telegraphed for armitage and heartily approve your decision to lay the whole case before him i presume he can reach you by sunday and that by tuesday he will be here at the fort and ready to act this will be a great relief to me for do what i could to allay it there is no concealing the fact that much speculation and gossip is afloat concerning the events of that unhappy night leary declares he has been closemouthed the other men on guard know absolutely nothing and captain wilton is the only officer to whom in my distress of mind i betrayed that there was a mystery and he has pledged himself to me to say nothing sloat too has an inkling and a big one that jerrold is the suspected party but i never dreamed that anything had been seen or heard which in the faintest way connected your household with the matter until yesterday then leary admitted to me that two women mrs cliffords cook and the doctors nurserymaid had asked him whether it wasnt lieutenant jerrold he fired at and if it was true that he was trying to get in at the colonels back door twice mrs clifford has asked me very significant questions and three times today have officers made remarks to me that indicated their knowledge of the existence of some grave trouble what makes matters worse is that jerrold when twitted about his absence from reveille loses his temper and gets confused there came near being a quarrel between him and rollins at the mess a day or two since he was saying that the reason he slept through rollcall was the fact that he had been kept up very late at the doctors party and rollins happened to come in at the moment and blurted out that if he was up at all it must have been after he left the party and reminded him that he had left before midnight with miss renwick this completely staggered jerrold who grew confused and tried to cover it with a display of anger now two weeks ago rollins was most friendly to jerrold and stood up for him when i assailed him but ever since that night he has had no word to say for him when jerrold played wrathful and accused rollins of mixing in other mens business rollins bounced up to him like a young bullterrier and i believe there would have been a row had not sloat and hoyt promptly interfered jerrold apologized and rollins accepted the apology but has avoided him ever since wont speak of him to me now that i have reason to want to draw him out as soon as armitage gets here he can do what i cannot find out just what and who is suspected and talked about mr jerrold of course avoids me he has been attending strictly to his duty and is evidently confounded that i did not press the matter of his going to town as he did the day i forbade it mr hoyts being too late to see him personally gave me sufficient grounds on which to excuse it but he seems to understand that something is impending and is looking nervous and harassed he has not renewed his request for leave of absence to run down to sablon i told him curtly it was out of the question the colonel took a few strides up and down the room it had come then the good name of those he loved was already besmirched by garrison gossip and he knew that nothing but heroic measures could ever silence scandal impulse and the innate sense of fight urged him to go at once to the scene leaving his wife and her fair daughter here under his sisters roof but armitage and common sense said no he had placed his burden on those broad gray shoulders and though ill content to wait he felt that he was bound stowing away the letters too nervous to sleep too worried to talk he stole from the cottage and with hands clasped behind his back with lowbowed head he strolled forth into the broad vista of moonlit road there were bright lights still burning at the hotel and gay voices came floating through the summer air the piano too was thrumming a waltz in the parlor and two or three couples were throwing embracing slowlytwirling shadows on the windows over in the barand billiardrooms the click of the balls and the refreshing rattle of cracked ice told suggestively of the occupation of the inmates keeping on beyond these distracting sounds he slowly climbed a long gradual ascent to the bench or plateau above the wooded point on which were grouped the glistening white buildings of the pretty summer resort and having reached the crest turned silently to gaze at the beauty of the scene at the broad flawless bosom of a summer lake all sheen and silver from the unclouded moon far to the southeast it wound among the bold and rockribbed bluffs rising from the forest growth at their base to shorn and rounded summits miles away to the southward twinkled the lights of one busy little town others gleamed and sparkled over towards the northern shore close under the polestar while directly opposite frowned a massive wall of palisaded rock that threw deep and heavy and far from shore its long reflection in the mirror of water there was not a breath of air stirring in the heavens not a ripple on the face of the waters beneath save where close under the bold headland down on the other side the signallights white and crimson and green creeping slowly along in the shadows revealed one of the packets ploughing her steady way to the great marts below nearer at hand just shaving the long strip of sandy wooded point that jutted far out into the lake a broad raft of timber pushed by a hardworking blackfunnelled sternwheeler was slowly forging its way to the outlet of the lake its shadowy edge sprinkled here and there with little sparks of lurid red the pilotlights that gave warning of its slow and silent coming far down along the southern shore under that black bluffline close to the silver wateredge a glowing meteor seemed whirling through the night and the low distant rumble told of the atlantic express thundering on its journey here along with him on the level plateau were other roomy cottages some dark some still sending forth a guiding ray while long lines of whitewashed fence gleamed ghostly in the moonlight and were finally lost in the shadow of the great bluff that abruptly shut in the entire point and plateau and shut out all further sight of lake or land in that direction far beneath he could hear the soft plash upon the sandy shore of the little wavelets that came sweeping in the wake of the raftboat and spending their tiny strength upon the strand far down on the hotel point he could still hear the soft melody of the waltz he remembered how the band used to play that same air and wondered why it was he used to like it it jarred him now presently the distant crack of a whip and the low rumble of wheels were heard the omnibus coming back from the station with passengers from the night train he was in no mood to see any one he turned away and walked northward along the edge of the bench towards the deep shadow of the great shoulder of the bluff and presently he came to a long flight of wooden stairs leading from the plateau down to the hotel and here he stopped and seated himself awhile he did not want to go home yet he wanted to be by himself to think and brood over his trouble he saw the omnibus go round the bend and roll up to the hotel doorway with its load of pleasureseekers and heard the joyous welcome with which some of their number were received by waiting friends but life had little of joy to him this night he longed to go away anywhere anywhere could he only leave this haunting misery behind he was so proud of his regiment he had been so happy in bringing home to it his accomplished and gracious wife he had been so joyous in planning for the lovely times alice was to have the social successes the girlish triumphs the garrison gayeties of which she was to be the queen and now so very very soon all had turned to ashes and desolation she was so beautiful so sweet winning graceful oh god could it be that one so gifted could possibly be so base he rose in nervous misery and clinched his hands high in air then sat down again with hiding hopeless face rocking to and fro as sways a man in mortal pain it was long before he rallied and again wearily arose most of the lights were gone silence had settled down upon the sleeping point he was chilled with the night air and the dew and stiff and heavy as he tried to walk down at the foot of the stairs he could see the nightwatchman making his rounds he did not want to explain matters and talk with him he would go around there was a steep pathway down into the ravine that gave into the lake just beyond his sisters cottage and this he sought and followed moving slowly and painfully but finally reaching the grassy level of the pathway that connected the cottages with the woodroad up the bluff trees and shrubbery were thick on both sides and the path was shaded he turned to his right and came down until once more he was in sight of the white walls of the hotel standing out there on the point until close at hand he could see the light of his own cottage glimmering like faithful beacon through the trees and then he stopped short a tall slender figure a man in dark snugfitting clothing was creeping stealthily up to the cottage window the colonel held his breath his heart thumped violently he waited watched he saw the dark figure reach the blinds he saw them slowly softly turned and the faint light gleaming from within he saw the figure peering in between the slats and then god was it possible a low voice a mans voice whispering or hoarsely murmuring a name he heard a sudden movement within the room as though the occupant had heard and were replying coming his blood froze it was not alices room it was his his and hers his wifes and that was surely her step approaching the window yes the blind was quickly opened a whiterobed figure stood at the casement he could see hear bear no more with one mad rush he sprang from his lair and hurled himself upon the shadowy stranger you hound who are you but twas no shadow that he grasped a muscular arm was round him in a trice a brawny hand at his throat a twisting sinewy leg was curled in his and he went reeling back upon the springy turf stunned and wellnigh breathless when he could regain his feet and reach the casement the stranger had vanished but mrs maynard lay there on the floor within a white and senseless heap x perhaps it was as well for all parties that frank armitage concluded that he must have another whiff of tobacco that night as an incentive to the think he had promised himself he had strolled through the park to the grove of trees out on the point and seated himself in the shadows here his reflections were speedily interrupted by the animated flirtations of a few couples who tiring of the dance came out into the coolness of the night and the seclusion of the grove where their murmured words and soft laughter soon gave the captains nerves a strain they could not bear he broke cover and betook himself to the very edge of the stone retaining wall out on the point he wanted to think calmly and dispassionately he meant to weigh all he had read and heard and form his estimate of the gravity of the case before going to bed he meant to be impartial to judge her as he would judge any other woman so compromised but for the life of him he could not he bore with him the mute image of her lovely face with its clear truthful trustful dark eyes he saw her as she stood before him on the little porch when they shook hands on their laughing or his laughing compact for she would not laugh how perfect she was her radiant beauty her uplifted eyes so full of their selfreproach and regret at the speech she had made at his expense how exquisite was the grace of her slender rounded form as she stood there before him one slim hand half shyly extended to meet the cordial clasp of his own he wanted to judge and be just but that image dismayed him how could he look on this picture and then on that the one portrayed in the chain of circumstantial evidence which the colonel had laid before him it was monstrous it was treason to womanhood one look in her eyes superb in their innocence was too much for his determined impartiality armitage gave himself a mental kick for what he termed his imbecility and went back to the hotel its no use he muttered im a slave of the weed and cant be philosophic without my pipe up to his little box of a room he climbed found his pipecase and tobaccopouch and in five minutes was strolling out to the point once more when he came suddenly upon the nightwatchman a personage of whose functions and authority he was entirely ignorant the man eyed him narrowly and essayed to speak not knowing him and desiring to be alone armitage pushed past and was surprised to find that a hand was on his shoulder and the man at his side before he had gone a rod beg pardon sir said the watchman gruffly but i dont know you are you stopping at the hotel i am said armitage coolly taking his pipe from his lips and blowing a cloud over his other shoulder and who may you be i am the watchman and i do not remember seeing you come today nevertheless i did on what train sir this afternoons uptrain you certainly were not on the omnibus when it got here very true i walked over from beyond the schoolhouse you must excuse me sir i did not think of that and the manager requires me to know everybody is this major armitage armitage is my name but im not a major yes sir im glad to be set right and the other gentleman him as was inquiring for colonel maynard tonight hes in the army too but his name dont seem to be on the book he only came in on the late train another man to see colonel maynard asked the captain with sudden interest just come in you say im sure ive no idea what was he like i dont know sir at first i thought you was him the driver told me he brought a gentleman over who asked some questions about colonel maynard but he didnt get aboard at the dйpфt and he didnt come down to the hotel got off somewhere up there on the bench and jim didnt see him wheres jim said armitage come with me watchman i want to interview him together they walked over to the barn which the driver was just locking up after making everything secure for the night who was it inquiring for colonel maynard asked armitage i dont know sir was the slow answer there was a man got aboard as i was coming across the common there in the village at the station there were several passengers from the train and some baggage so he may have started ahead on foot but afterwards concluded to ride as soon as i saw him get in i reined up and asked where he was going he had no baggage nor nuthin and my orders are not to haul anybody except people of the hotel so he came right forward through the bus and took the seat behind me and said twas all right he was going to the hotel and he passed up a halfdollar i told him that i couldnt take the money that busfares were paid at the office and drove ahead then he handed me a cigar and pretty soon he asked me if there were many people and who had the cottages and when i told him he asked which was colonel maynards but he didnt say he knew him and the next thing i knew was when we got here to the hotel he wasnt in the bus he must have stepped back through all those passengers and slipped off up there on the bench he was in it when we passed the little brown church up on the hill what was he like i couldnt see him plain he stepped out from behind a tree as we drove through the common and came right into the bus it was dark in there and all i know is he was tall and had on dark clothes some of the people inside must have seen him better but they are all gone to bed i suppose i will go over to the hotel and inquire anyway said armitage and did so the lights were turned down and no one was there but he could hear voices chatting in quiet tones on the broad sheltered veranda without and going thither found three or four men enjoying a quiet smoke armitage was a man of action he stepped at once to the group pardon me gentlemen but did any of you come over in the omnibus from the station tonight i did sir replied one of the party removing his cigar and twitching off the ashes with his little finger then looking up with the air of a man expectant of question the watchman tells me a man came over who was making inquiries for colonel maynard may i ask if you saw or heard of such a person a gentleman got in soon after we left the station and when the driver hailed him he went forward and took a seat near him they had some conversation but i did not hear it i only know that he got out again a little while before we reached the hotel could you see him and describe him i am a friend of colonel maynards an officer of his regiment which will account for my inquiry well yes sir i noticed he was very tall and slim was dressed in dark clothes and wore a dark slouched hat well down over his forehead he was what i would call a militarylooking man for i noticed his walk as he got off but he wore big spectacles blue or brown glass i should say and had a heavy beard which way did he go when he left the bus he walked northward along the road at the edge of the bluff right up towards the cottages on the upper level was the answer armitage thanked him for his courtesy explained that he had left the colonel only a short time before and that he was then expecting no visitor and if one had come it was perhaps necessary that he should be hunted up and brought to the hotel then he left the porch and walked hurriedly through the park towards its northernmost limit there to his left stood the broad roadway along which nestling under shelter of the bluff was ranged the line of cottages some twostoried with balconies and verandas others low singlestoried affairs with a broad hallway in the middle of each and rooms on both north and south sides farthermost north on the row almost hidden in the trees and nearest the ravine stood aunt graces cottage where were domiciled the colonels household it was in the big baywindowed north room that he and the colonel had had their long conference earlier in the evening the south room nearly opposite was used as their parlor and sittingroom aunt grace and miss renwick slept in the little front rooms north and south of the hallway and the lights in their rooms were extinguished so too was that in the parlor all was darkness on the south and east all was silence and peace as armitage approached but just as he reached the shadow of the stunted oaktree growing in front of the house his ears were startled by an agonized cry a womans halfstifled shriek he bounded up the steps seized the knob of the door and threw his weight against it it was firmly bolted within loud he thundered on the panels tis i armitage he called he heard the quick patter of little feet the bolt was slid and he rushed in almost stumbling against a trembling terrorstricken yet welcoming whiterobed form alice renwick barefooted with her glorious wealth of hair tumbling in dark luxuriance all down over the dainty nightdress alice renwick with pallid face and wild imploring eyes what is wrong he asked in haste its mother her room and its locked and she wont answer was the gasping reply armitage sprang to the rear of the hall leaned one second against the opposite wall sent his foot with mighty impulse and muscled impact against the opposing lock and the door flew open with a crash the next instant alice was bending over her senseless mother and the captain was giving a hand in much bewilderment to the panting colonel who was striving to clamber in at the window the ministrations of aunt grace and alice were speedily sufficient to restore mrs maynard a teaspoonful of brandy administered by the colonels trembling hand helped matters materially then he turned to armitage come outside he said once again in the moonlight the two men faced each other armitage can you get a horse certainly what then go to the station get men if possible and head this fellow off he was here again tonight and it was not alice he called but my but mrs maynard i saw him i grappled with him right here at the baywindow where she met him and he hurled me to grass as though id been a child i want a horse i want that man tonight how did he get away from sibley do you mean do you think it was jerrold good god yes who else could it be disguised of course and bearded but the figure the carriage were just the same and he came to this window to her window and called and she answered my god armitage think of it come with me colonel you are all unstrung was the captains answer as he led his broken friend away at the front door he stopped one moment then ran up the steps and into the hall where he tapped lightly at the casement what is it was the low response from an invisible source miss alice yes the watchman is here now i will send him around to the window to keep guard until our return the colonel is a little upset by the shock and i want to attend to him we are going to the hotel a moment before i bring him home you are not afraid to have him leave you not now captain is mrs maynard better yes she hardly seems to know what has happened indeed none of us do what was it a tramp looking for something to eat tried to open the blinds and the colonel was out here and made a jump at him they had a scuffle in the shrubbery and the tramp got away it frightened your mother thats the sum of it i think is papa hurt no a little bruised and shaken and mad as a hornet i think perhaps ill get him quieted down and sleepy in a few minutes if you and mrs maynard will be content to let him stay with me i can talk almost any man drowsy mamma seems to worry for fear he is hurt assure her solemnly that he hasnt a scratch he is simply fighting mad and im going to try and find the tramp does mrs maynard remember how he looked she could not see the face at all she heard some one at the shutters and a voice and supposed of course it was papa and threw open the blind oh i see thats all miss alice ill go back to the colonel goodnight and armitage went forth with a lighter step one sensation knocked endwise colonel i have it on the best of authority that mrs maynard so fearlessly went to the window in answer to the voice and noise at the shutters simply because she knew you were out there somewhere and she supposed it was you how simple these mysteries become when a little daylight is let in on them after all come im going to take you over to my room for a stiff glass of grog and then after his trampship while you go back to bed armitage you seem to make very light of this nights doings what is easier than to connect it all with the trouble at sibley nothing was ever more easily explained than this thing colonel and all i want now is a chance to get that tramp then ill go to sibley and pon my word i believe that mystery can be made as commonplace a piece of petty larceny as this was of vagrancy come but when armitage left the colonel at a later hour and sought his own room for a brief rest he was in no such buoyant mood a nightsearch for a tramp in the dense thickets among the bluffs and woods of sablon could hardly be successful it was useless to make the attempt he slept but little during the cool august night and early in the morning mounted a horse and trotted over to the railwaystation has any train gone northward since last night he inquired at the office none that stop here was the answer the first train up comes along at i want to send a despatch to fort sibley and get an answer without delay can you work it for me the agent nodded and pushed over a package of blanks armitage wrote rapidly as follows captain chester commanding fort sibley is jerrold there tell him i will arrive tuesday answer f armitage it was along towards nine oclock when the return message came clicking in on the wires was written out and handed to the tall soldier with the tired blue eyes he read started crushed the paper in his hand and turned from the office the answer was significant lieutenant jerrold left sibley yesterday afternoon not yet returned absent without leave this morning chester xi nature never vouchsafed to wearied man a lovelier day of rest than the still sunday on which frank armitage rode slowly back from the station the soft mellow tone of the churchbell tolling the summons for morning service floated out from the brown tower and was echoed back from the rocky cliff glistening in the august sunshine on the northern bluff groups of villagers hung about the steps of the little sanctuary and gazed with mild curiosity at the arriving parties from the cottages and the hotel the big red omnibus came up with a load of worshippers and farther away down the vista of the road armitage could see others on foot and in carriages all wending their way to church he was in no mood to meet them the story that he had been out pursuing a tramp during the night was pretty thoroughly circulated by this time he felt assured and every one would connect his early ride to the station in some way with the adventure that the grooms hostlers cooks and kitchenmaids had all been dilating upon ever since daybreak he dreaded to meet the curious glances of the women and the questions of the few men whom he had taken so far into his confidence as to ask about the mysterious person who came over in the stage with them he reined up his horse and then seeing a little pathway leading into the thick wood to his right he turned in thither and followed it some fifty yards among bordering treasures of coreopsis and goldenrod and wild luxuriance of vine and foliage dismounting in the shade he threw the reins over his arm and let his horse crop the juicy grasses while he seated himself on a little stump and fell to thinking again he could hear the reverent voices of one or two visitors strolling about among the peaceful flowerdecked graves behind the little church and only a short stonesthrow away through the shrubbery he could hear the low solemn voluntary of the organ and presently the glad outburst of young voices in the opening hymn but he knew that belated ones would still be coming to church and he would not come forth from his covert until all were out of the way then too he was glad of a little longer time to think he did not want to tell the colonel the result of his morning investigations to begin with the watchman the driver and the two men whom he had questioned were all of an opinion as to the character of the stranger he was a military man the passengers described his voice as that of a man of education and social position the driver and passengers declared his walk and carriage to be that of a soldier he was taller they said than the tall stalwart saxon captain but by no means so heavily built as to age they could not tell his beard was black and curly no gray hairs his movements were quick and elastic but his eyes were hidden by those colored glasses and his forehead by the slouch of that broadbrimmed felt hat at the station while awaiting the answer to his despatch armitage had questioned the agent as to whether any man of that description had arrived by the night train from the north he had seen none he said but there was larsen over at the postoffice store who came down on that train perhaps he could tell oddly enough mr larsen recalled just such a party tall slim dark darkbearded with blue glasses and dark hat and clothes but he was bound for lakeville the station beyond and he remained in the car when he larsen got off larsen remembered the man well because he sat in the rear corner of the smoker and had nothing to say to anybody but kept reading a newspaper and the way he came to take note of him was that while standing with two friends at that end of the car they happened to be right around the man the saturday evening train from the city is always crowded with people from the river towns who have been up to market or the matinйes and even the smoker was filled with standing men until they got some thirty miles down larsen wanted to light a fresh cigar and offered one to each of his friends then it was found they had no matches and one of them who had been drinking a little and felt jovial turned to the dark stranger and asked him for a light and the man without speaking handed out a little silver matchbox it was just then that the conductor came along and larsen saw his ticket it was a round trip to lakeville he was evidently going there for a visit and therefore said larsen he didnt get off at sablon station which was six miles above but armitage knew better it was evident that he had quietly slipped out on the platform of the car after the regular passengers had got out of the way and let himself off into the darkness on the side opposite the station thence he had an open and unimpeded walk of a few hundred yards until he reached the common and then when overtaken by the hotel omnibus he could jump aboard and ride there was only one road only one way over to the hotel and he could not miss it there was no doubt now that whoever he was the night visitor had come down on the evening train from the city and his return ticket would indicate that he meant to go back the way he came it was halfpast ten when that train arrived it was nearly midnight when the man appeared at the cottage window it was after two when armitage gave up the search and went to bed it was possible for the man to have walked to lakeville six miles south and reached the station there in abundant time to take the uptrain which passed sablon without stopping a little before daybreak if he took that train and if he was jerrold he would have been in the city before seven and could have been at fort sibley before or by eight oclock but chesters despatch showed clearly that at the hour for signing the company morning reports mr jerrold was not at his post was he still in the neighborhood and waiting for the noon train if so could he be confronted on the cars and accused of his crime he looked at his watch it was nearly eleven and he must push on to the hotel before that hour report to the colonel then hasten back to the station he sprang to his feet and was just about to mount when a vision of white and scarlet came suddenly into view there within twenty feet of him making her dainty way through the shrubbery from the direction of the church sunshine and shadow alternately flitting across her lovely face and form alice renwick stepped forth into the pathway and shading her eyes with her hand gazed along the leafy lane towards the road as though expectant of anothers coming then attracted by the beauty of the goldenrod she bent and busied herself with gathering in the yellow sprays armitage with one foot in the stirrup stood stockstill half in surprise half stunned by a sudden and painful thought could it be that she was there in hopes of meeting any one he retook his foot from the stirrup and relaxing the rein still stood gazing at her over his horses back that placid quadruped whose years had been spent in these pleasant byways and were too many to warrant an exhibition of coltish surprise promptly lowered his head and resumed his occupation of grassnibbling making a little crunching noise which miss renwick might have heard but apparently did not she was singing very softly to herself daisy tell my fortune pray he loves me not he loves me and still armitage stood and gazed while she absorbed in her pleasant task still pulled and plucked at the goldenrod in all his life no vision of fair women had been to him fair and sacred and exquisite as this down to the tip of her arched and slender foot peeping from beneath the broidered hem of her snowy skirt she stood the lady born and bred and his eyes looked on and worshipped her worshipped yet questioned why came she here absorbed he released his hold on the rein and dobbin nothing loath reached with his long lean neck for further herbage and stepped in among the trees still stood his negligent master fascinated in his study of the lovely graceful girl again she raised her head and looked northward along the winding shaded woodpath a few yards away were other great clusters of the wild flowers she loved more sunkissed goldenrod and with a little murmur of delight gathering her dainty skirts in one hand she flitted up the pathway like an unconscious hummingbird garnering the sweets from every blossom a little farther on the pathway bent among the trees and she would be hidden from his sight but still he stood and studied her every movement drank in the soft cooing melody of her voice as she sang and then there came a sweet solemn strain from the brown sunlit walls just visible through the trees and reverent voices and the resonant chords of the organ thrilled through the listening woods the glorious anthem of the church militant at the first notes she lifted up her queenly head and stood listening and appreciative then he saw her rounded throat swelling like a birds and the rich full tones of her voice rang out through the welcoming sunshine and the fluttering wrens and proud redbreasted robins and rival songqueens the brownwinged thrushes even the impudent shrieking jays seemed to hush and listen dobbin fairly astonished lifted up his holloweyed head and looked amazedly at the white songstress whose scarlet sash and neckribbons gleamed in such vivid contrast to the foliage about her a wondering little cottontail rabbit shy and wild as a hawk came darting through the bushes into the sunshiny patchwork on the path and then uptilted and with quivering ears and nostrils and widestaring eyes stood paralyzed with helpless amaze ignoring the tall man in gray as did the singer herself richer rounder fuller grew the melody as abandoning herself to the impulse of the sacred hour she joined with all her girlish heart in the words of praise and thanksgiving in the glad and triumphant chorus of the te deum from beginning to end she sang now ringing and exultant now soft and plaintive following the solemn words of the ritual sweet and low and suppliant in the petition we therefore pray thee help thy servants whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood confident and exulting in the declaration thou art the king of glory o christ and then rich with fearless trust and faith in the thrilling climax let me never be confounded armitage listened as one in a trance from the depth of her heart the girl had joined her glorious voice to the chorus of praise and adoration and now that all was stilled once more her head had fallen forward on her bosom her hands laden with goldenrod were joined together it seemed as though she were lost in prayer and this was the girl this the pure godworshipping godfearing woman who for one black instant he had dared to fancy had come here expectant of a meeting with the man whose aim had been frustrated but the night before he could have thrown himself at her feet and implored her pardon he did step forth and then hat in hand baring his proud saxon head as his forefathers would have uncovered to their monarch he waited until she lifted up her eyes and saw him and knew by the look in his frank face that he had stood by a mute listener to her unstudied devotions a lovely flush rose to her very temples and her eyes drooped their pallid lids until the long lashes swept the crimson of her cheeks have you been here captain i never saw you was her fluttering question i rode in here on my way back from the station not caring to meet all the good people going to church i felt like an outcast i too am a recreant today it is the first time i have missed service in a long while mamma felt too unstrung to come and i had given up the idea but both she and aunt grace urged me i was too late for the omnibus and walked up and then i would not go in because service was begun and i wanted to be home again before noon i cannot bear to be late at church or to leave it until everything is over but i cant be away from mother so long today shall we walk that way now in a minute i must find my horse he is in here somewhere tell me how the colonel is feeling and mrs maynard both very nervous and worried though i see nothing extraordinary in the adventure we read of poor hungry tramps everywhere and they rarely do harm i wonder a little at your venturing here in the woodpaths after what occurred last night why captain armitage no one would harm me here so close to the church indeed i never thought of such a thing until you mentioned it did you discover anything about the man nothing definite but i must be at the station again to meet the uptrain and have to see the colonel meantime let me find dobbin or whatever they call this venerable relic im riding and then ill escort you home but dobbin had strayed deeper into the wood it was some minutes before the captain could find and catch him the rich melody of sacred music was again thrilling through the perfumed woods the glad sunshine was pouring its warmth and blessing over all the earth glinting on bluff and brake and palisaded cliff the birds were all singing their rivalling psaltery and nature seemed pouring forth its homage to the creator and preserver of all on this his holy day when frank armitage once more reached the bowered lane where fairest sweetest sight of all his lady stood waiting him she turned to him as she heard the hoofbeat on the turf and smiled can we wait and hear that hymn through ay sing it she looked suddenly in his face something in the very tone in which he spoke startled her something deeper more fervent than she had ever heard before and the expression in the steady deepblue eyes was another revelation alice renwick had a womans intuition and yet she had not known this man a day the color again mounted to her temples and her eyes fell after one quick glance i heard you joining in the te deum he urged sing once more i love it there they are just beginning again do you know the words she nodded then raised her head and her glad young voice carolled through the listening woods holy holy holy all heavens triumphant choir shall sing when the ransomed nations fall at the footstool of their king then shall saints and seraphim hearts and voices swell one hymn round the throne with full accord holy holy holy lord there was silence when the music ceased she had turned her face towards the church and as the melody died away in one prolonged triumphant chord she still stood in reverent attitude as though listening for the words of benediction he too was silent but his eyes were fixed on her he was thirtyfive she not twenty he had lived his soldier life wifeless but like other soldiers his heart had had its rubs and aches in the days gone by years before he had thought life a black void when the girl he fancied while yet he wore the academic gray calmly told him she preferred another nor had the intervening years been devoid of their occasional yearnings for a mate of his own in the isolation of the frontier or the monotony of garrison life but flitting fancies had left no trace upon his strong heart the love of his life only dawned upon him at this late day when he looked into her glorious eyes and his whole soul went out in passionate worship of the fair girl whose presence made that sunlit lane a heaven were he to live a thousand years no scene on earth could rival in his eyes the lovehaunted woodland pathway wherein like forest queen she stood the sunshine and leafy shadows dancing over her graceful form the goldenrod enhancing her dark and glowing beauty the sacred influences of the day throwing their mystic charm about her as though angels guarded and shielded her from harm his life had reached its climax his fate was sealed his heart and soul were centred in one sweet girl and all in one brief hour in the woodland lane at sablon she could not fail to see the deep emotion in his eyes as at last she turned to break the silence shall we go she said simply it is time but i wish we could remain you do not go to church very often at sibley do you i have not heretofore but you would teach me to worship you have taught me he muttered below his breath as he extended a hand to assist her down the sloping bank towards the avenue she looked up quickly once more pleased yet shy and shifted her great bunch of goldenrod so that she could lay her hand in his and lean upon its steady strength down the incline and so hand in hand with old dobbin ambling placidly behind they passed out from the shaded pathway to the glow and radiance of the sunlit road xii colonel maynard i admit everything you say as to the weight of the evidence said frank armitage twenty minutes later but it is my faith understand me my faith i say that she is utterly innocent as for that damnable letter i do not believe it was ever written to her it is some other woman what other is there or was there was the colonels simple reply that is what i mean to find out will you have my baggage sent after me tonight i am going at once to the station and thence to sibley i will write you from there if the midnight visitor should prove to have been jerrold he can be made to explain i have always held him to be a conceited fop but never either crackbrained or devoid of principle there is no time for explanation now goodby and keep a good lookout that fellow may be here again and in an hour more armitage was skimming along the winding riverside en route to sibley he had searched the train from pilot to rear platform and no man who in the faintest degree resembled mr jerrold was on board he had wired to chester that he would reach the fort that evening but would not resume duty for a few days he made another search through the train as they neared the city and still there was no one who in stature or appearance corresponded with the descriptions given him of the sinewy visitor late in the afternoon chester received him as he alighted from the train at the little station under the cliff it was a beautiful day and numbers of people were driving or riding out to the fort and the high bridge over the gorge was constantly resounding to the thunder of hoofs many others too had come out on the train for the evening dressparade always attracted a swarm of visitors a corporal of the guard with a couple of men was on hand to keep vigilant eye on the arrivals and to persuade certain proscribed parties to reenter the cars and go on should they attempt to revisit the post and the faces of these were lighted up as they saw their old adjutant but none others of the garrison appeared let us wait a moment and get these people out of the way said armitage i want to talk with you is jerrold back yes he came in just ten minutes after i telegraphed to you was present at inspection and if it had not been for your despatch this morning i should not have known he had remained out of quarters he appeared to resent my having been to his quarters calls it spying i presume what permission had he to be away i gave him leave to visit town on personal business yesterday afternoon he merely asked to be away a few hours to meet friends in town and mr hall took tattoo rollcall for him as i do not require any other officer to report the time of his return i did not exact it of him but of course no man can be away after midnight without special permission and he was gone all night what is it armitage has he followed her down there somebody was there last night and capsized the colonel pretty much as he did you the night of the ladder episode said armitage coolly by heaven and i let him go how do you know twas he who else could it be armitage thats what the colonel asks but it isnt clear to me yet awhile i wish it were less clear to me said chester gloomily the worst is that the story is spreading like a pestilence all over the post the women have got hold of it and there is all manner of talk i shouldnt be surprised if mrs hoyt had to be taken violently ill she has written to invite miss renwick to visit her as it is certain that colonel and mrs maynard cannot come and hoyt came to me in a horror of amaze yesterday to know if there were any truth in the rumor that i had caught a man coming out of mrs maynards window the other night i would tell him nothing and he says the ladies declare they wont go to the german if she does heavens im thankful you are come the thing has been driving me wild these last twelve hours i wanted to go away myself is she coming up no she isnt but let me say this chester that whenever she is ready to return i shall be ready to escort her chester looked at his friend in amazement and without speaking yes i see you are astonished but you may as well understand the situation i have heard all the colonel could tell and have even seen the letter and since she left here a mysterious stranger has appeared by night at sablon at the cottage window though it happened to be her mothers this time and i dont believe alice renwick knows the first thing about it armitage are you in love chester i am in my sound senses now come and show me the ladder and where you found it and tell me the whole story over again i think it grows interesting one moment has he that picture yet i suppose so i dont know in these last few days everybody is fighting shy of him he thinks it is my doing and looks black and sulky at me but is too proud or too much afraid of consequences to ask the reason of the cold shoulders and averted looks gray has taken seven days leave and gone off with that little girl of his to place her with relatives in the east he has heard the stories and it is presumed that some of the women have told her she was down sick here a day or two well now for the window and the ladder i want to see the outside through your eyes and then i will view the interior with my own the colonel bids me do so together they slowly climbed the long stairway leading up the face of the cliff chester stopped for a breathingspell more than once youre all out of condition man said the younger captain pausing impatiently what has undone you this trouble and nothing else by gad it has unstrung the whole garrison i believe you never saw our people fall off so in their shooting of course we expected jerrold to go to pieces but nobody else there were others that seemed to fall away too where was that cavalryteam that was expected to take the skirmish medal away from us sound as a dollar every man with the single exception of their big sergeant i dont like to make ugly comparisons to a man whom i believe to be more than half interested in a woman but it makes me think of the old story about medusa one look at her face is too much for a man that sergeant mcleod went to grass the instant he caught sight of her and never has picked up since consider me considerably more than half interested in the woman in this case chester make all the comparisons that you like provided they illumine matters as you are doing now and tell me more of this sergeant mcleod what do you mean by his catching sight of her and going to grass i mean he fell flat on his face the moment he saw her and hasnt been in good form from that moment to this the doctor says its heartdisease thats what the colonel says troubles mrs maynard she was senseless and almost pulseless some minutes last night what manner of man is mcleod a tall slim darkeyed swarthy fellow a man with a history and a mystery i judge a man with a history a mystery who is tall slim has dark eyes and swarthy complexion and faints away at sight of miss renwick might be said to possess peculiar characteristics family traits some of them of course youve kept an eye on mcleod where is he chester stood leaning on the rail breathing slowly and heavily his eyes dilated as he gazed at armitage who was surveying him coolly though the tone in which he spoke betrayed a new interest and a vivid one i confess i never thought of him in connection with this affair said chester theres the one essential point of difference between us was the reply you go in on the supposition that there is only one solution to this thing and that a woman must be dishonored to begin with i believe there can be several solutions and that there is only one thing in the lot that is at all impossible whats that miss renwicks knowledge of that nights visitor or of any other secret or sin i mean to work other theories first and the mcleod trail is a good one to start on where can i get a look at him somewhere out in the rockies by this time he was ordered back to his troop five days ago and they are out scouting at this moment unless im vastly mistaken you have seen the morning despatches about the indians yes looks squally at the spirit rock reservation do you mean that mcleod is there thats where his troop ought to be by this time there is too small a force on the trail now and more will have to go if a big outbreak is to be prevented then he has gone and i cannot see him let me look at the window then a few steps brought them to the terrace and there standing by the west wall and looking up at the closed slats of the dormerwindow captain chester retold the story of his nightadventure armitage listened attentively asking few questions when it was finished the latter turned and walked to the rear door which opened on the terrace it was locked the servants are having a holiday i presume he said so much the better ask the quartermaster for the key of the front door and ill go in while everybody is out looking at dressparade there goes first call now let your orderly bring it to me here will you ten minutes later with beating heart he stood and uncovered his handsome head and gazed silently reverently around him he was in her room it was dainty as her own dainty self the dressingtable the windows the pretty little white bed the broad inviting lounge the worktable and basket the very washstand were all trimmed and decked alike white and yellow prevailing white lace curtains draped the window on the west that fateful window and the two that opened out on the roof of the piazza white lace curtains draped the bed the dressingtable and the washstand white lace or some equally flimsy and feminine material hung about her bookshelves and worktable and over the lounge and bows of bright yellow ribbon were everywhere yellow pincushions and wallpockets hung about the toilettable soft yellow rugs lay at the bedand loungeside and a sunshiny tone was given to the whole apartment by the shades of yellow silk that hung close to the windows on the wall were some choice etchings and a few foreign photographs on the bookshelves were a few volumes of poetry and the prose of george eliot and our own hawthorne hanging on pegs in the corner of the simple army room covered by a curtain were some heavy outergarments an ulster a travelling coat and cape of english make and one or two dresses that were apparently too thick to be used at this season of the year he drew aside the curtain one moment took a brief glance at the garments raised the hem of a skirt to his lips and turned quickly away a door led from the room to the one behind it a spare bedroom evidently that was lighted only from the back of the house and had no sidewindow at all another door led to the hall a broad oldfashioned affair and crossing this he stood in the big front room occupied by the colonel and his wife this was furnished almost as luxuriously from an army point of view as that of miss renwick but not in white and yellow armitage smiled to see the evidences of mrs maynards taste and handiwork on every side in the years he had been the old soldiers adjutant nothing could have exceeded the simplicity with which the colonel surrounded himself now it was something akin to sybaritish elegance thought the captain but all the same he made his deliberate survey there was the big dressingtable and bureau on which had stood that ravished picture that photograph of the girl he loved which others were able to speak of and one man to appropriate feloniously while yet he had never seen it his impulse was to go to jerrolds quarters and take him by the throat and demand it of him but what right had he how knew he even that it was now there in view of the words that chester had used towards him jerrold must know of the grievous danger in which he stood that photograph would prove most damaging evidence if discovered very probably after yielding to his vanity and showing it to sloat he meant to get it back very certainly after hearing chesters words he must have determined to lose no time in getting rid of it he was no fool if he was a coxcomb looking around the halfdarkened room armitage lingered long over the photographs which hung about the dressingtable and over the mantel several prettilyframed duplicates of those already described as appearing in the album one after another he took them in his hands bore them to the window and studied them attentively some were not replaced without a long lingering kiss he had not ventured to disturb an item in her room he would not touch the knob of a drawer or attempt to open anything she had closed but here in quarters where his colonel could claim joint partnership he felt less sentiment or delicacy he closed the hall door and tried the lock turning the knob to and fro then he reopened the door and swung it upon its hinges for a wonder neither lock nor hinges creaked the door worked smoothly and with little noise then he similarly tried the door of her room it was in equally good working order quite free from the squeak and complaint with which quartermasters locks and hinges are apt to do their reluctant duty the discovery pleased him it was possible for one to open and close these portals noiselessly if need be and without disturbing sleepers in either room returning to the east chamber he opened the shades so as to get more light and his eye fell upon an old album lying on a little table that stood by the bedside there was a nightlamp upon the table too a little affair that could hold only a thimbleful of oil and was intended evidently to keep merely a faint glow during the night hours other volumes a bible some devotional books like the changed cross and a hymnal or two were also there but the album stood most prominent and armitage curiously took it up and opened it there were only half a dozen photographs in the affair it was rather a case than an album and was intended apparently for only a few family pictures there was but one that interested him and this he examined intently almost excitedly it represented a little girl of nine or ten years alice undoubtedly with her arms clasped about the neck of a magnificent st bernard dog and looking up into the handsome features of a tall slender darkeyed blackhaired boy of sixteen or thereabouts and the two were enough alike to be brother and sister who then was this boy armitage took the photograph to the window and studied it carefully parade was over and the troops were marching back to their quarters the band was playing gloriously as it came tramping into the quadrangle and the captain could not but glance out at his own old company as in compact column of fours it entered the grassy diamond and swung off towards the barracks he saw a knot of officers too turning the corner by the adjutants office and for a moment he lowered the album to look mr jerrold was not of the number that came sauntering up the walk dropping away by ones or twos as they reached their doors and unbuckled their belts or removed their helmets in eager haste to get out of the constraint of full dress but in another moment jerrold too appeared all alone walking rapidly and nervously armitage watched him and could not but see how other men turned away or gave him the coolest possible nod as he passed the tall slender lieutenant was handsomer even than when he last saw him and yet there was gloom and worry on the dark beauty of his face nearer and nearer he came and had passed the quarters of the other officers and was almost at the door of his own when armitage saw a little wiry soldier in full dress uniform running across the parade as though in pursuit he recognized merrick one of the scapegraces of his company and wondered why he should be chasing after his temporary commander just as jerrold was turning under the piazza the soldier seemed to make himself heard and the lieutenant with an angry frown on his face stopped and confronted him i told you not to come to me again he said so loud that every word was audible to the captain standing by the open window above what do you mean sir by following me in this way the reply was inaudible armitage could see the little soldier standing in the respectful position of attention looking up and evidently pleading i wont do it until im ready was again heard in jerrolds angry tones though this time the lieutenant glanced about as though to see if others were within earshot there was no one apparently and he grew more confident youve been drinking again today merrick youre not sober now and i wont give you money to get maudlin and go to blabbing secrets on no sir go back to your quarters and stay there the little soldier must indeed have been drinking as the lieutenant declared armitage saw that he hesitated instead of obeying at once and that his flushed face was angrily working then that he was arguing with his superior and talking louder this was contrary to all the captains ideas of proper discipline even though he was indignant at the officer for permitting himself to be placed in so false and undignified a position jerrolds words too had acquired a wide significance but they were feeble as compared with the sudden outburst that came from the soldiers lips by god lieutenant you bribed me to silence to cover your tracks and then you refuse to pay if you dont want me to tell what i know the sooner you pay that money the better this was more than armitage could stand he went downstairs three at a jump and out through the colonels garden with quick impetuous steps jerrolds furious face turned ashen at the sight and merrick with one amazed and frightened look at his captain faced about and slunk silently away to him armitage paid no further attention it was to the officer he addressed himself mr jerrold i have heard pretty much all this conversation it simply adds to the evil report with which you have managed to surround yourself step into your quarters i must see you alone jerrold hesitated he was thunderstruck by the sudden appearance of the captain whom he had believed to be hundreds of miles away he connected his return unerringly with the web of trouble which had been weaving about him of late he conceived himself to have been most unjustly spied upon and suspected and was full of resentment at the conduct of captain chester but chester was an old granny who sometimes made blunders and had to back down it was a different thing when armitage took hold jerrold looked sulkily into the clear stern blue eyes a moment and the first impulse of rebellion wilted he gave one irresolute glance around the quadrangle then motioned with his hand to the open door something of the old jaunty creole lightness of manner reasserted itself after you captain he said xiii once withindoors it was too dark for armitage to see the features of his lieutenant and he had his own reasons for desiring to read them mr jerrold on the other hand seemed disposed to keep in the shadows as much as possible he made no movement to open the shutters of the one window which admitted light from the front and walked back to his bedroom door glanced in there as though to see that there were no occupants then carefully closed it as he returned to face his captain he took off his helmet and placed it on the centretable then thrusting his thumbs inside the handsome goldbroidered swordbelt stood in a jaunty attitude but with a very uneasy look in his eyes to hear what his senior might have to say between the two men an invitation to sit would have been a superfluity neither had ever remained long enough in the others quarters since the exchange of the first calls when jerrold came to the garrison to render a chair at all necessary be good enough to strike a light mr jerrold said armitage presently seeing that his unwilling host made no effort on his own account i proposed going out at once captain and presume you cannot have any very extended remarks to make you cannot see the writing i have to call your attention to without a light i shall detain you no longer than is necessary had you an engagement nothing of great consequence i presume it will keep it will have to the matter i have come upon will admit no further delay light your lamp if you please and jerrold did so slowly and with much reluctance he wiped his forehead vigorously the instant the flame began to splutter but as the clear steady light of the argand gradually spread over the little room armitage could see the sweat again beading his forehead and the dark eyes were glancing nervously about and the hands that were so firm and steady and fine the year before and held the springfield in so light yet immovable an aim were twitching now it was no wonder jerrolds score had dropped some thirty per cent his nerve had gone to pieces armitage stood and watched him a moment then he slowly spoke i have no desire to allude to the subject of your conversation with merrick it was to put an end to such a thing not to avail myself of any information it might give that i hurried in we will put that aside and go at once to the matter that brings me back you are aware of course that your conduct has compromised a womans name and that the garrison is talking of nothing else jerrold grasped the back of a chair with one slender brown hand and looked furtively about as though for some hope of escape something like a startled gulp seemed to work his throatmuscles an instant then he stammered his reply i dont know what you mean you do know what i mean captain chester has already told you captain chester came in here and made an unauthorized inspection of my quarters because he heard a shot fired by a sentry i was out i dont deny that but he proceeded to say all manner of insulting and unwarrantable things and tried to force me to hand in a resignation simply because i was out of quarters after taps i could account for his doing something so idiotic but im at a loss to comprehend your taking it up the most serious allegation ever made against an officer of the regiment is made against you the senior lieutenant of my company and the evidence furnished me by the colonel and by captain chester is of such a character that unless you can refute it and clear her name you will have a settlement with me to start with and your dismissal from the regiment settlement with you what concern have you in the matter interrupted jerrold waste no words on that mr jerrold understand that where her name is concerned no man on earth is more interested than i now answer me you were absent from your quarters for some hours after the doctors party somebody believed to have been you was seen and fired at for refusing to halt at the order of captain chester at in the morning the ladder that usually hung at your fence was found at the colonels while you were out and that night a womans name was compromised beyond repair unless you can repair it unless you prove beyond peradventure where you were both that night and last night prove beyond question that you were not where you are believed to have been her name is stained and yours blackened forever there are other things you must fully explain but these first jerrolds face was growing gray and sickly he stared at the stern eyes before him and could make no answer his lips moved dryly but made no sound come i want to hear from you where were you if not with or seeking her name your place and witnesses by god captain armitage the army is no longer a place for a gentleman if his every movement is to be spied upon like this the world is no place for a man of your stamp is perhaps a better way of putting it said armitage whose fingers were twitching convulsively and whose whole frame quivered with the effort he was making to restrain the rage and indignation that consumed him he could not he would not believe in her guilt he must have this mans proof no matter how it might damn him for good and all no matter whom else it might involve so long as it cleared her precious name he must be patient he must be calm and resolute but the mans coldblooded selfish criminal concealment nearly maddened him with infinite effort he controlled himself and went on but it is of her im thinking not of you it is the name you have compromised and can clear and should clear even at the expense of your own in fact mr jerrold must clear now will you tell me where you were and how you can prove it i decline to say i wont be crossquestioned by men who have no authority captain chester said he would refer it to the colonel and when he asks i will answer not until then i ask in his name i am authorized by him for he is not well enough to meet the ordeal you say so and i dont mean to dispute your word captain armitage but i have a right to demand some proof how am i to know he authorized you he himself gave me this letter in your handwriting said armitage and opening the long envelope he held forth the missive over which the poor old colonel had gone nearly wild he found it the morning they left in her garden if jerrolds face had been gray before it was simply ghastly now he recoiled from the sight after one fruitless effort to grasp the letter then rallied with unlookedfor spirit by heaven armitage suppose i did write that letter what does it prove but what i say that somebody has been prying and spying into my affairs how came the colonel by it if not by fraud or treachery he picked it up in the garden i tell you among the rosebushes where she where miss renwick had been but a few moments before and where it might appear that she had dropped it she that letter what had she to do with it what right had she to read it armitage stepped impulsively forward a glad glorious light was bursting upon his soul he could almost have seized jerrolds hand and thanked him but proofs proofs were what he needed it was not his mind that was to be convinced it was society that must be satisfied of her utter innocence that it might be enabled to say well i never for a moment believed a word of it link by link the chain of circumstantial evidence must be destroyed and this was only one you mean that that letter was not intended for miss renwick he asked with eagerness he strove hard to repress it was never meant for anybody said jerrold the color coming back to his face and courage to his eyes that letter was never sent by me to any woman its my writing of course i cant deny that but i never even meant it to go if it left that desk it must have been stolen ive been hunting high and low for it i knew that such a thing lying around loose would be the cause of mischief god is that what all this fuss is about and he looked warily yet with infinite anxiety into his captains eyes there is far more to it as you well know sir was the stern answer for whom was this written if not for her it wont do to half clear her name answer me this captain armitage do you mean that that letter has compromised miss renwick that it is she whose name has been involved and that it was of her that chester meant to speak certainly it was and i too there was an instants silence then jerrold began to laugh nervously oh well i fancy it isnt the first time the revered and respected captain has got away off the track all the same i do not mean to overlook his language to me and i may say right now captain armitage that yours too calls for explanation you shall have it in short order mr jerrold and the sooner you understand the situation the better so far as i am concerned miss renwick needed no defender but thanks to your mysterious and unwarranted absence from quarters two very unlucky nights and to other circumstances i have no need to name and to your penchant for letterwriting of a most suggestive character it is miss renwick whose name has been brought into question here at this post and most prominently so in plain words mr jerrold you who brought this trouble upon her by your own misconduct must clear her no matter at whose expense or or what i make no threats i prefer that you should make the proper explanations from a proper sense of what is due and suppose i say that no man is called upon to explain a situation which has been distorted and misrepresented by the evil imagination of his fellows then i may have to wring the truth out of you and will but for her sake i want as little publicity as possible after this display on your part i am not bound to show you any consideration whatever understand this however the array of evidence that you were feloniously inside colonel maynards quarters that night and at his cottage window last night is of such a character that a court would convict you unless your alibi was conclusive leave the service you certainly shall unless this whole thing is cleared up i never was anywhere near colonel maynards either last night or the other night i was absent you will have to prove it mere denials wont help you in the face of such evidence as we have that you were there the first time what evidence the photograph that was stolen from mrs maynard between two and four oclock that morning was seen in your drawer by major sloat at reveille you were fool enough to show it to him captain armitage i shall be quite able to show when the proper time comes that the photograph i showed major sloat was not stolen it was given me that is beyond belief mr jerrold once and for all understand this case you have compromised her good name by the very mystery of your actions you have it in your power to clear her by proving where you were since you were not near her by showing how you got that photograph by explaining how you came to write so strange a letter now i say to you will you do it instantly or must we wring it from you a sneering smile was the only answer for a moment then i shall take great pleasure in confounding my enemies should the matter be brought before a court im sure if the colonel can stand that sort of thing i can but as for defending myself or anybody else from utterly unjust and proofless suspicions its quite another thing good god jerrold do you realize what a position you are taking do you oh not at all captain was the airy reply not at all it is not a position i have taken it is one into which you misguided conspirators have forced me i certainly am not required to compromise anybody else in order to relieve a suspicion which you not i have created how do you know that there may not be some other woman whose name i propose to guard you have been really very flattering in your theories so far armitage could bear no more the airy conceit and insolence of the man overcame all selfrestraint and resolution with one bound he was at his throat his strong white hands grasping him in a sudden vicelike grip then hurling him with stunning thundering force to the floor down headlong went the tall lieutenant his sword clattering by his side his slim brown hands clutching wildly at anything that might bear him up and dragging with him in his catastrophe a rack of huntingpouches antlers and one heavy doublebarrelled shotgun all came tumbling down about the struggling form and armitage glaring down at him with clinching fists and rasping teeth had only time to utter one deepdrawn malediction when he noted that the struggles ceased and jerrold lay quite still then the blood began to ooze from a jagged cut near the temple and it was evident that the hammer of the gun had struck him another moment and the door opened and with anxious face chester strode into the room you havent killed him armitage is it as bad as that pick him up and well get him on the bed hes only stunned i didnt even hit him those things tumbled afterwards said armitage as between them they raised the dead weight of the slender adonis in their arms and bore him to the bedroom here they bathed the wound with cold water and removed the uniform coat and presently the lieutenant began to revive and look about him who struck me he faintly asked your shotgun fell on your head but i threw you down jerrold im sorry i touched you but youre lucky it was no worse this thing is going to raise a big bump here shall i send the doctor no ill come round presently well see about this thing afterwards is there any friend you want to see shall i send word to anybody asked chester no dont let anybody come tell my striker to bring my breakfast but i want nothing tonight but to be let alone at least you will let me help you undress and get to bed said chester no i wish youd go both of you i want quiet peace and theres none of it with either of you and so they left him later captain chester had gone to the quarters and after much parleying from without had gained admission jerrolds head was bound in a bandage wet with arnica and water he had been solacing himself with a pipe and a whiskey toddy and was in a not unnaturally ugly mood you may consider yourself excused from duty until your face is well again by which time this matter will be decided i admonish you to remain here and not leave the post until it is you can prefer charges and see what youll make of it was the vehement reply devil a bit will i help you out of the thing after this nights work xiv tuesday and the day of the longprojected german had come and if ever a lot of garrisonpeople were wishing themselves well out of a flurry it was the social circle at sibley invitations had been sent to all the prominent people in town who had shown any interest in the garrison since the regiments arrival beautiful favors had been procured an elaborate supper had been prepared the ladies contributing their efforts to the salads and other solids the officers wisely confining their donations to the wines it was rumored that new and original figures were to be danced and much had been said about this feature in town and much speculation had been indulged in but the beaubien residence had been closed until the previous day nina was away with her mother and beyond reach of question and mr jerrold had not shown his face in town since her departure nor was he accessible when visitors inquired at the fort they had never known such mysterious army people in their lives what on earth could induce them to be so closemouthed about a mere german one might suppose they had something worth concealing and presently it became noised abroad that there was genuine cause for perplexity and possibly worse to begin with every one at sibley now knew something of the night adventure at the colonels and as no one could give the true statement of the case the stories in circulation were gorgeous embellishments of the actual facts it would be useless even if advisable to attempt to reproduce these wild theories but never was army garrison so tumultuously stirred by the whirlwind of rumor it was no longer denied for an instant that the absence of the colonel and his household was the direct result of that nights discoveries and when to mrs hoyts inexpressible relief there came a prettilyworded note from alice on monday evening informing her that neither the colonel nor her mother felt well enough to return to sibley for the german and that she herself preferred not to leave her mother at a time when she needed her care mrs hoyt and her intimates with whom she instantly conferred decided that there could be no doubt whatever that the colonel knew of the affair had forbidden their return and was only waiting for further evidence to decide what was to be done with his erring stepdaughter women talked with bated breath of the latest stories in circulation of chesters moody silence and preoccupation of jerrolds ostracism and of frank armitages sudden return on monday morning the captain had quietly appeared in uniform at the office and it was known that he had relinquished the remainder of his leave of absence and resumed command of his company there were men in the garrison who well knew that it was because of the mystery overhanging the colonels household that armitage had so suddenly returned they asked no questions and sought no explanation all men marked however that jerrold was not at the office on monday and many curiously looked at the morning report in the adjutants office no he was not in arrest neither was he on sickreport he was marked present for duty and yet he was not at the customary assembly of all the commissioned officers at headquarters more mystery and most exasperating too it was known that armitage and jerrold had held a brief talk in the latters quarters soon after sundays evening parade and that the former had been reinforced for a time by captain chester with whom he was afterwards closeted officers who heard that he had suddenly returned and was at chesters went speedily to the latters quarters at least two or three did and were met by a servant at the door who said that the gentlemen had just gone out the back way and sure enough neither chester nor armitage came home until long after taps and then the colonels cook told several people that the two gentlemen had spent over an hour upstairs in the colonels and miss alices room and was foolin around the house till near ten oclock another thing that added to the flame of speculation and curiosity was this two of the ladies returning from a moonlit stroll on the terrace just after tattoo came through the narrow passageway on the west side of the colonels quarters and there at the foot of the little flight of steps leading up to the parade they came suddenly upon captain chester who was evidently only moderately pleased to see them and nervously anxious to expedite their onward movement with the perversity of both sexes however they stopped to chat and inquire what he was doing there and in the midst of it all a faint light gleamed on the opposite wall and the reflection of the curtains in alice renwicks window was distinctly visible then a sturdy masculine shadow appeared and there was a rustling above and then with exasperating mysterious and epigrammatic terseness a deep voice propounded the utterly senseless question hows that to which in great embarrassment chester replied hold on a minute im talking with some interested spectators whereat the shadow of the big man shot out of sight and the ladies found that it was useless to remain there would be no further developments so long as they did and so they came away with many a lingering backward look but the idea of asking such a fool question as hows that why couldnt the man say what he meant it was gathered however that armitage and chester had been making some experiments that bore in some measure on the mystery and all this time mr jerrold was in his quarters only a stonesthrow away how interested he must have been but while the garrison was relieved at knowing that alice renwick would not be on hand for the german and it was being fondly hoped she might never return to the post there was still another grievous embarrassment how about mr jerrold he had been asked to lead when the german was first projected and had accepted that was fully two weeks before and now no one knew just what ought to be done it was known that nina beaubien had returned on the previous day from a brief visit to the upper lakes and that she had a costume of ravishing beauty in which to carry desolation to the hearts of the garrison belles in leading that german with mr jerrold old madame beaubien had been reluctant said her city friends to return at all she heartily disapproved of mr jerrold and was bitterly set against ninas growing infatuation for him but nina was headstrong and determined moreover she was far more than a match for her mothers vigilance and it was known at sibley that two or three times the girl had been out at the fort with the suttons and other friends when the old lady believed her in quarters totally different cub sutton had confided to captain wilton that madame beaubien was in total ignorance of the fact that there was to be a party at the doctors the night he had driven out with nina and his sister and that nina had pulled the wool over her mothers eyes and made her believe she was going to spend the evening with friends in town naming a family with whom the beaubiens were intimate a long drive always made the old lady sleepy and as she had accompanied nina to the fort that afternoon she went early to bed having secured her wild birdling as she supposed from possibility of further meetings with jerrold for nearly a week said cub madame beaubien had dogged nina so that she could not get a moment with the man with whom she was evidently so smitten and the girl was almost at her wits end with seeing the depth of his flirtation with alice renwick and the knowledge that on the morrow her mother would spirit her off to the cool breezes and blue waves of the great lake cub said she so worked on fannys feelings that they put up the scheme together and made him bring them out gad if old maman only found it out thered be no more germans for nina shed ship her off to the good sisters at crevecoeur and slap her into a convent and leave all her money to the church and yet said city society old maman idolized her beautiful daughter and could deny her no luxury or indulgence she dressed her superbly though with a somewhat barbaric taste where ninas own good sense and eastern teaching did not interfere what she feared was that the girl would fall in love with some adventurer or what was quite as bad some army man who would carry her darling away to arizona or other inaccessible spot her plan was that nina should marry here at home some one of the staid young merchant princes rising into prominence in the western metropolis and from the very outset nina had shown a singular infatuation for the buttons and straps and music and heavenknowswhatall out at the fort she gloried in seeing her daughter prominent in all scenes of social life she rejoiced in her triumphs and took infinite pains with all preparations she would have set her foot against ninas simply dancing the german at the fort with jerrold as a partner but she could not resist it that the papers should announce on sunday morning that the event of the season at fort sibley was the german given last tuesday night by the ladies of the garrison and led by the lovely miss beaubien with lieutenant or captain anybody there were a dozen bright graceful winning women among the dames and damsels at the fort and alice renwick was a famous beauty by this time it was more than maman beaubien could withstand that her nina should lead all these and so her consent was won back they came from chequamegon and the stately home on summit avenue reopened to receive them it was monday noon when they returned and by three oclock fanny sutton had told nina beaubien what she knew of the wonderful rumors that were floating in from sibley she was more than half disposed to be in love with jerrold herself she expected a proper amount of womanly horror incredulity and indignation but she was totally unprepared for the outburst that followed nina was transformed into a tragedy queen on the instant and poor simplehearted foolish fanny sutton was almost scared out of her small wits by the fire of denunciation and fury with which her story was greeted she came home with white frightened face and hunted up cub and told him that she had been telling nina some of the queer things the ladies had been saying about mr jerrold and nina almost tore her to pieces and could he go right out to the fort to see mr jerrold nina wanted to send a note at once and if he couldnt go she had made her promise that she would get somebody to go instantly and to come back and let her know before four oclock cub was always glad of an excuse to go out to the fort but a coldness had sprung up between him and jerrold he had heard the ugly rumors in that mysterious way in which all such things are heard and while his shallow pate could not quite conceive of such a monstrous scandal and he did not believe half he heard he sagely felt that in the presence of so much smoke there was surely some fire and avoided the man from whom he had been inseparable of course he had not spoken to him on the subject and singularly enough this was the case with all the officers at the post except armitage and the commander it was understood that the matter was in chesters hands to do with as was deemed best it was believed that his resignation had been tendered and all these fortyeight hours since the story might be said to be fairly before the public jerrold had been left much to himself and was presumably in the depths of dismay one or two men urged by their wives who thought it was really time something were done to let him understand he ought not to lead the german had gone to see him and been refused admission asked from within what they wanted the reply was somewhat difficult to frame and in both cases resolved itself into oh about the german to which jerrolds voice was heard to say the germans all right ill lead if im well enough and am not bothered to death meantime but ive got some private matters to attend to and am not seeing anybody today and with this answer they were fain to be content it had been settled however that the officers were to tell captain chester at ten oclock that in their opinion mr jerrold ought not to be permitted to attend so long as this mysterious charge hung over him and mr rollins had been notified that he must be ready to lead poor rollins he was in sore perplexity he wanted nothing better than to dance with nina beaubien he wondered if she would lead with him or would even come at all when she learned that jerrold would be unable to attend sickness was to be the ostensible cause and in the youth and innocence of his heart rollins never supposed that nina would hear of all the other assignable reasons he meant to ride in and call upon her monday evening but as ill luck would have it old sloat who was officer of the day stepped on a round pebble as he was going down the long flight to the railwaystation and sprained his ankle just at five oclock rollins got orders to relieve him and was returning from the guardhouse when who should come driving in but cub sutton and cub reined up and asked where he would be apt to find mr jerrold he isnt well and has been denying himself to all callers today said rollins shortly well ive got to see him or at least get a note to him said cub its from miss beaubien and requires an answer you know the way to his quarters i presume said rollins coldly you have been there frequently i will have a man hold your horse or you can tie him there at the rail just as you please thanks ill go over i believe and go he did and poor rollins was unable to resist the temptation of watching whether the magic name of nina would open the door it did not but he saw cub hand in the little note through the shutters and ere long there came another from within this cub stowed in his waistcoatpocket and drove off with and rollins walked jealously homeward but that evening he went through a worse experience and it was the last blow to his budding passion for sparklingeyed nina it was nearly tattoo and a dark night when chester suddenly came in rollins you remember my telling you i was sure some of the men had been getting liquor in from the shore down below the station and running it that way i believe we can nab the smuggler this evening theres a boat down there now the corporal has just told me smuggling liquor was one of chesters horrors he surrounded the post with a cordon of sentries who had no higher duty apparently than that of preventing the entrance of alcohol in any form he had run a redcross crusade against the posttraders store in the matter of light wines and small beer claiming that only adulterated stuff was sold to the men and forbidding the sale of anything stronger than pop over the traders counter then when it became apparent that liquor was being brought on the reservation he made vigorous efforts to break up the practice colonel maynard rather poohpoohed the whole business it was his theory that a man who was determined to have a drink might better be allowed to take an honest one coram publico than a smuggled and deleterious article but he succumbed to the rule that only light wines and beer should be sold at the store and was lenient to the poor devils who overloaded and deranged their stomachs in consequence but chester no sooner found himself in command than he launched into the crusade with redoubled energy and spent hours of the day and night trying to capture invaders of the reservation with a bottle in their pockets the bridge was guarded so was the crossing of the cloudwater to the south and so were the two roads entering from the north and west and yet there was liquor coming in and as though to give chester a benefit some of the men in barracks had a royal old spree on saturday night and the captain was sorerheaded than any of the participants in consequence in some way he heard that a rowboat came up at night and landed supplies of contraband down by the riverside out of sight and hearing of the sentry at the railwaystation and it was thither he hurriedly led rollins this monday evening they turned across the railway on reaching the bottom of the long stairs and scrambled down the rocky embankment on the other side rollins following in reluctant silence and holding his sword so that it would not rattle but he had no faith in the theory of smugglers he felt in some vague and unsatisfactory way a sense of discomfort and anxiety over his captains late proceedings and this stealthy descent seemed fraught with ill omen once down in the flats their footsteps made no noise in the yielding sand and all was silence save for the plash of the waters along the shores far down the river were the reflections of one or two twinkling lights and close under the bank in the slackwater a few stars were peeping at their own images but no boat was there and the captain led still farther to a little copse of willow and there in the shadows sure enough was a rowboat with a little lantern dimly burning half hidden in the stern not only that but as they halted at the edge of the willows the captain put forth a warning hand and cautioned silence no need rollinss straining eyes were already fixed on two figures that were standing in the shadows not ten feet away one that of a tall slender man the other a young girl it was a moment before rollins could recognize either but in that moment the girl had turned suddenly had thrown her arms about the neck of the tall young man and with her head pillowed on his breast was gazing up in his face kiss me once more howard then i must go they heard her whisper rollins seized his captains sleeve and strove sick at heart to pull him back but chester stoutly stood his ground in the few seconds more that they remained they saw his arms more closely enfold her they saw her turn at the brink and in an utter abandonment of rapturous passionate love throw her arms again about his neck and stand on tiptoe to reach his face with her warm lips they could not fail to hear the caressing tone of her every word or to mark his receptive but gloomy silence they could not mistake the voice the form shadowy though it was the girl was nina beaubien and the man beyond question howard jerrold they saw him hand her into the light skiff and hurriedly kiss her goodnight once again as though she could not leave him her arms were thrown about his neck and she clung to him with all her strength then the little boat swung slowly out into the stream the sculls were shipped and with practised hand nina beaubien pulled forth into the swirling waters of the river and the faint light like slowlysetting star floated downward with the sweeping tide and finally disappeared beyond the point then jerrold turned to leave and chester stepped forth and confronted him mr jerrold did i not instruct you to confine yourself to your quarters until satisfactory explanation was made of the absences with which you are charged jerrold started at the abrupt and unlookedfor greeting but his answer was prompt not at all sir you gave me to understand that i was to remain here not to leave the post until you had decided on certain points and though i do not admit the justice of your course and though you have put me to grave inconvenience i obeyed the order i needed to go to town today on urgent business but between you and captain armitage am in no condition to go for all this sir there will come proper retribution when my colonel returns and now sir you are spying upon me spying i say and it only confirms what i said of you before silence mr jerrold this is insubordination i dont care a damn what it is sir there is nothing contemptuous enough for me to say of you or your conduct to me not another word mr jerrold go to your quarters in arrest mr rollins you are witness to this language but rollins was not turning from the spot in blankness of heart before a word was uttered between them he followed the waning light with eyes full of yearning and trouble he trudged his way down along the sandy shore until he came to the silent waters of the slough and could go no farther and then he sat him down and covered his face with his hands it was pretty hard to bear xv tuesday still and all manner of things had happened and were still to happen in the hurrying hours that followed sunday night the garrison woke at tuesdays reveille in much perturbation of spirit as has been said but by eight oclock and breakfasttime one cause of perplexity was at an end relief had come with monday afternoon and alice renwicks letter saying she would not attend the german and now still greater relief in the news that sped from mouth to mouth lieutenant jerrold was in close arrest armitage and chester had been again in consultation monday night said the gossips and something new had been discovered no one knew just what and the toils had settled upon jerrolds handsome head and now he was to be tried as usual in such cases the news came in through the kitchen and most officers heard it at the breakfasttable from the lips of their better halves who could hardly find words to express their sentiments as to the inability of their lords to explain the new phase of the situation when the first sergeant of company b came around to captain armitage with the sickbook soon after six in the morning the captain briefly directed him to transfer lieutenant jerrold on the morning report from present for duty to in arrest and no sooner was it known at the quarters of company b than it began to work back to officers row through the medium of the servants and strikers it was the sole topic of talk for a full hour many ladies who had intended going to town by the early train almost perilled their chances of catching the same in their eagerness to hear further details but the shriek of the whistle far up the valley broke up the group that was so busily chatting and speculating over in the quadrangle and with shy yet curious eyes the party of at least a dozen matrons and maids wives or sisters of the officers scurried past the darkened windows of mr jerrolds quarters and through the mysterious passage west of the colonels silent house and down the long stairs just in time to catch the train that whirled them away cityward almost as soon as it had disgorged the mornings mail chatting and laughing and full of blithe anticipation of the glories of the coming german in preparation for which most of their number had found it necessary to run in for just an hours shopping they went jubilantly on their way shopping done they would all meet take luncheon together at the womans exchange return to the post by the afternoon train and have plenty of time for a little nap before dressing for the german perhaps the most interesting question now up for discussion was who would lead with mr rollins the train went puffing into the crowded dйpфt the ladies hastened forth and in a moment were on the street cabs and carriages were passed in disdain a brisk walk of a block carried them to the main thoroughfare and into the heart of the shopping district a rush of hoofs and wheels and pedestrians there encountered them and the roar assailed their sensitive and unaccustomed ears yet high above it all pierced and pealed the shrill voices of the newsboys darting here and there with their eagerlybought journals but women bent on germans and shopping have time and ears for no such news as that which demands the publication of extras some of them never hear or heed the cry indian massacree here yare all about the killin of major thornton an his sojers extry extry it is not until they reach the broad portals of the great stewart of the west that one of their number half incredulously buys a copy and reads aloud major thornton th infantry captain langham and lieutenant bliss th cavalry and thirty men are killed captains wright and lane and lieutenants willard and brooks th cavalry and some forty more men are seriously wounded the rest of the command is corralled by an overwhelming force of indians and their only hope is to hold out until help can reach them all troops along the line of the union pacific are already under orders oh isnt it dreadful yes but arent you glad it wasnt ours oh look theres nina beaubien over there in her carriage do lets find out if shes going to lead with rollins vж victis far out in the glorious park country in the heart of the centennial state a little band of bluecoats sent to succor a perilled agent is making desperate stand against fearful odds less than two hundred men has the wisdom of the department sent forth through the wilderness to find and if need be fight its way through five times its weight in wellarmed foes the officers and men have no special quarrel with those indians nor the indians with them only two winters before when those same indians were sick and starving and their lying gobetweens the bureauemployees would give them neither food nor justice a small band made their way to the railway and were fed on soldier food and their wrongs righted by soldier justice but another snarl has come now and this time the bureaupeople are in a pickle and the army ever between two fires at least and thankful when it isnt six is ordered to send a little force and go out there and help the agent maintain his authority the very night before the column reaches the borders of the reservation the leading chiefs come in camp to interview the officers shake hands beg tobacco and try on their clothes then go back to their braves and laugh as they tell there are only a handful and plan the morrows ambuscade and massacre vж victis there are women and children among the garrisons along the union pacific whose hearts have little room for thoughts of germans in the horror of this mornings tidings but sibley is miles and miles away and as mrs wheeler says arent you glad it wasnt ours out at the fort there is a different scene the morning journals and the clicking telegraph send a thrill throughout the whole command the train has barely whistled out of sight when the ringing notes of officers call resound through the quadrangle and out over the broader drillground beyond wondering but prompt the staid captains and eager subalterns come hurrying to headquarters and the band that had come forth and taken its station on the parade all ready for guardmount goes quickly back while the men gather in big squads along the shaded row of their quarters and watch the rapid assembly at the office and there old chester with kindling eyes reads to the silent company the brief official order ay though it be miles and miles away fast as steam and wheel can take it the good old regiment in all its sturdy strength goes forth to join the rescue of the imprisoned comrades far in the colorado rockies have your entire command in readiness for immediate fieldservice in the department of the platte special train will be there to take you by noon at latest and though many a man has lost friend and comrade in the tragedy that calls them forth and though many a brow clouds for the moment with the bitter news of such useless sacrifice every eye brightens every muscle seems to brace every nerve and pulse to throb and thrill with the glorious excitement of quick assembly and coming action ay we are miles and miles away we leave the dear old post with homes and firesides wives children and sweethearts all to the care of the few whom sickness or old wounds or advancing years render unfit for hard sharp marching and thank god well be there to take a hand and help those gallant fellows out of their corral or to have one good blow at the cowardly hounds who lured and lied to them how the assembly rings on the morning air how quick they spring to ranks those eager bearded faces and trim blueclad forms how buoyant and brisk even the elders seem as the captains speed over to their company quarters and the quick stirring orders are given field kits all the cooked rations you have on hand overcoat blanket extra socks and underclothes every cartridge youve got haversack and canteen and nothing else now get ready lively how irrepressible is the cheer that goes up how we pity the swells of the light battery who have to stay how wistful those fellows look and how eagerly they throng about the barracks yearning to go and since that is denied praying to be of use in some way small wonder is it that all the bustle and excitement penetrates the portals of mr jerrolds darkened quarters and the shutters are thrown open and his bandaged head comes forth what is it harris he demands of a lightbatteryman who is hurrying past orders for colorado sir the regiment goes by special train major thorntons commands been massacred and theres a big fight ahead my god here stop one moment run over to company b and see if you can find my servant or merrick or somebody if not you come back quick i want to send a note to captain armitage i can take it sir were not going the band and the battery have to stay and jerrold with trembling hand and feverish haste seats himself at the same desk whence on that fatal morning he sent the note that wrought such disaster and as he rises and hands his missive forth throwing wide open the shutters as he does so his bedroom doors fly open and a whirling gust of the morning wind sweeps through from rear to front and half a score of bills and billets letters and scraps of paper go ballooning out upon the parade by heaven he mutters thats how it happened is it look at them go for going they were in spiral eddies or fluttering skips up the grassy quad and over among the rosebushes of alice renwicks garden over on the other side of the narrow oldfashioned frontier fort the men were bustling about and their exultant eager voices rang out on the morning air all was life and animation and even in jerrolds selfish soul there rose responsive echo to the soldierly spirit that seemed to pervade the whole command it was their first summons to active fieldduty with prospective battle since he had joined and with all his shortcomings as a duty officer in garrison and his many frailties of character jerrold was not the man to lurk in the rear when there was danger ahead it dawned on him with sudden and crushing force that now it lay in the power of his enemies to do him vital injury that he could be held here at the post like a suspected felon a mark for every finger a target for every tongue while every other officer of his regiment was hurrying with his men to take his knightly share in the coming onset it was intolerable shameful he paced the floor of his little parlor in nervous misery ever and anon gazing from the window for sight of his captain it was to him he had written urging that he be permitted a few moments talk this is no time for a personal misunderstanding he wrote i must see you at once i can clear away the doubts can explain my action but for heavens sake intercede for me with captain chester that i may go with the command as luck would have it armitage was with chester at the office when the letter was handed in he opened it gave a whistle of surprise and simply held it forth to the temporary commander read that he said chester frowned but took the note and looked it curiously over i have no patience with the man now he said of course after what i saw last night i begin to understand the nature of his defence but we dont want any such man in the regiment after this whats the use of taking him with us that isnt the point said armitage now or never possibly is the time to clear up this mystery of course maynard will be up to join us by the first train and what wont it be worth to him to have positive proof that all his fears were unfounded even if it wasnt jerrold there is still the fact that i saw a man clambering out of her window how is that to be cleared up said chester gloomily that may come later and wont be such a bugbear as you think if you were not worried into a morbid condition over all this trouble you would not look so seriously upon a thing which i regard as a piece of mere night prowling with a possible spice of romance what romance id like to know never mind that now im playing detective for the time being let me see jerrold for you and find out what he has to offer then you can decide are you willing all right but remember this while i think of it you admit that the light you saw on the wall sunday night was exactly like that which you saw the night of your adventure and that the shadows were thrown in the same way you thought that night that the light was turned up and afterwards turned out in her room and that it was her figure you saw at the window didnt you yes what then well i believe her statement that she saw and heard nothing until reveille i believe it was mrs maynard who did the whole thing without miss renwicks knowing anything about it why because i accomplished the feat with the aid of the little nightlamp that i found by the colonels bedside it is my theory that mrs maynard was restless after the colonel finally fell asleep that she heard your tumble and took her little lamp crossed over into miss renwicks room opened the door without creaking as i can do to your satisfaction found her sleeping quietly but the room a trifle close and warm set her nightlamp down on the table as i did threw her shadow on the wall as i did and opened the shade as you thought her daughter did then she withdrew and left those doors open both hers and her daughters and the light instead of being turned down as you thought was simply carried back into her own room that is all possible but how about the man in her room nothing was stolen though money and jewelry were lying around loose if theft was not the object what was theft certainly was not and im not prepared to say what was but i have reason to believe it wasnt miss renwick anything to prove it yes and though time is precious and i cannot show you you may take my word for it we must be off at noon and both of us have much to do but there may be no other chance to talk and before you leave this post i want you to realize her utter innocence i want to armitage i know you do so look here we assume that the same man paid the night visit both here and at sablon and that he wanted to see the same person if he did not come to steal do we not yes we know that at sablon it was mrs maynard he sought and called the colonel says so yes presumably then it was she not her daughter he had some reasons for wanting to see here at sibley what is more if he wanted to see miss renwick there was nothing to prevent his going right into her window nothing well i believe i can prove he didnt on the contrary that he went around by the roof of the porch to the colonels room and tried there but found it risky on account of the blinds and that finally he entered the hall window what might be called neutral ground the painters had been at work there as you said two days before and the paint on the slats was not quite dry the blinds and sills were the only things they had touched up on that front it seems and nothing on the sides now on the fresh paint of the colonels slats are the new imprints of masculine thumb and fingers and on the sill of the hall window is a footprint that i know to be other than jerrolds why because he doesnt own such a thing as this track was made with and i dont know a man in this command who does it was the handiwork of the tonto apaches and came from the other side of the continent you mean it was exactly an indian moccasin meantime mr jerrold had been making hurried preparations as he had fully determined that at any cost he would go with the regiment he had been burning a number of letters when captain armitage knocked and hurriedly entered jerrold pushed forward a chair and plunged at once into the matter at issue there is no time to waste captain i have sent to you to ask what i can do to be released from arrest and permitted to go with the command answer the questions i put to you the other night and certify to your answers and of course youll have to apologize to captain chester for your last nights language that of course though you will admit it looked like spying now let me ask you did he tell you who the lady was no i told him how did you know by intuition and my knowledge of previous circumstances we have no time to discuss it i make no attempt to conceal it now but i ask that on your honor neither you nor he reveal it and continue to let the garrison believe that you were in miss renwicks room that ghastly night asked armitage dryly jerrold flushed i have denied that and i would have proved my alibi could i have done so without betraying a womans secret must i tell so far as i am concerned mr jerrold said armitage with cold and relentless meaning you not only must tell you must prove both that nights doings and saturday nights both that and how you obtained that photograph my god in one case it is a womans name in the other i have promised on honor not to reveal it that ends it then you remain here in close arrest and the charges against you will be pushed to the bitter end i will write them this very hour xvi at ten oclock that morning shortly after a smiling interview with the ladies of fort sibley in which with infinite spirit and the most perfect selfcontrol miss beaubien had informed them that she had promised to lead with mr jerrold and since he was in duress she would lead with no one and sent them off wondering and greatly excited there came running up to the carriage a telegraph messenger boy who handed her a despatch i was going up to the avenue mum he explained but i seen you here ninas face paled as she tore it open and read the curt lines come to me here your help needed instantly she sprang from the carriage tell mother i have gone over to see some fort friends not to wait she called to the coachman well knowing he would understand that she meant the ladies with whom she had been so recently talking like a frightened deer she sped around the corner hailed the driver of a cab lounging with his fellows along the walk ordered him to drive with all speed to summit avenue and with beating heart decided on her plan her glorious eyes were flashing the native courage and fierce determination of her race were working in her womans heart she well knew that imminent danger threatened him she had dared everything for love of his mere presence his sweet caress what would she not dare to save him if save she could he had not been true to her she knew and knew well that whether sought or not alice renwick had been winning him from her that he was wavering that he had been cold and negligent but with all her soul and strength she loved him and believed him grand and brave and fine as he was beautiful now now was her opportunity he needed her his commission his honor depended on her he had intimated as much the night before had told her of the accusations and suspicions that attached to him but made no mention of the photograph he had said that though nothing could drag from him a word that would compromise her she might be called upon to stand twixt him and ruin and now perhaps the hour had come she could free exonerate glorify him and in doing so claim him for her own who after this could stand twixt her and him he loved her though he had been cold and she had he bidden her bow her dusky head to earth and kiss the print of his heel she would have obeyed could she but feel sure that her reward would be a simple touch of his hand an assurance that no other woman could find a moments place in his love verily he had been doing desperate wooing in the long winter for the very depths of her nature were all athrob with love for him and now he could no longer plead that poverty withheld his offer of his hand she would soon be mistress of her own little fortune and at her mothers death of an independence go to him she would and on wings of the wind and go she did the cab released her at the gate to her home and went back with a double fare that set the driver to thinking she sped through the house and out the rear doors much to the amaze of cook and others who were in consultation in the kitchen she flew down a winding flight of stairs to the level below and her fairy feet went tripping over the pavement of a plebeian street a quick turn and she was at a little secondrate stable whose proprietor knew her and started from his chair whats wrong today miss nina i want the roan mare and light buggy again quick as you can your own price at the old terms mr graves silence he nodded called to a subordinate and in five minutes handed her into the frail vehicle an impatient chirrup and flap of the reins and the roan shot forth into the dusty road leaving old graves shaking his head at the door ive known her ever since she was weaned he muttered and shes a wild bird if ever there was one but shes never been the like o this till last month and the roan mare was covered with foam and sweat when nina beaubien drove into the bustling fort barely an hour after her receipt of jerrolds telegram a few officers were gathered in front of headquarters and there were curious looks from face to face as she was recognized mr rollins was on the walk giving some instructions to a sergeant of his company and never saw her until the buggy reined up close behind him and turning suddenly he met her face to face as she sprang lightly to the ground the young fellow reddened to his eyes and would have recoiled but she was mistress of the situation she well knew she had but to command and he would obey or at the most if she could no longer command she had only to implore and he would be powerless to withstand her entreaty i am glad you are here mr rollins you can help me sergeant will you kindly hitch my horse at that post now she added in low hurried tone come with me to mr jerrolds rollins was too stupefied to answer silently he placed himself by her side and together they passed the group at the office miss beaubien nodded with something of her old archness and coquetry to the capraising party but never hesitated together they passed along the narrow board walk followed by curious eyes and as they reached the angle and stepped beneath the shelter of the piazza in front of the long low greenblinded bachelors row there was sudden sensation in the group mr jerrold appeared at the door of his quarters rollins halted some fifty feet away raised his cap and left her and all alone with the eyes of fort sibley upon her nina beaubien stepped bravely forward to meet her lover they saw him greet her at the door some of them turned away unwilling to look and yet unwilling to go and not understand this new phase of the mystery rollins looking neither to right nor left repassed them and walked off with a set savage look on his young face and then as one or two still gazed fascinated by this strange and daring proceeding others too turned back and half ashamed of themselves for such a yielding to curiosity glanced furtively over at jerrolds door there they stood he restrained by his arrest unable to come forth she restrained more by his barring form than by any consideration of maidenly reserve for had he bidden she would have gone within she had fully made up her mind that wherever he was even were it behind the sentinels and bars of the guardhouse she would demand that she be taken to his side he had handed out a chair but she would not sit they saw her looking up into his face as he talked and noted the eager gesticulation so characteristic of his creole blood that seemed to accompany his rapid words they saw her bending towards him looking eagerly up in his eyes and occasionally casting indignant glances over towards the group at the office as though she would annihilate with her wrath the persecutors of her hero then they saw her stretch forth both her hands with a quick impulsive movement and grasp his one instant looking so faithfully steadfastly loyally into his clouded and anxious face then she turned and with quick eager steps came tripping towards them they stood irresolute every man felt that it was somebodys duty to step forward meet her and be her escort though the party but no one advanced there was if anything a tendency to sidle towards the office door as though to leave the sidewalk unimpeded but she never sought to pass them by with flashing eyes and crimson cheeks she bore straight upon them and with indignant emphasis upon every word accosted them captain wilton major sloat i wish to see captain chester at once is he in the office certainly miss beaubien shall i call him or will you walk in and both men were at her side in a moment thanks i will go right in if you will kindly show me to him another moment and armitage and chester deep in the midst of their duties and surrounded by clerks and orderlies and assailed by half a dozen questions in one and the same instant looked up astonished as wilton stepped in and announced miss beaubien desiring to see captain chester on immediate business there was no time for conference there she stood in the doorway and all tongues were hushed on the instant chester rose and stepped forward with anxious courtesy she did not choose to see the extended hand it is you alone i wish to see captain is it impossible here i fear it is miss beaubien but we can walk out in the open air i feel that i know what it is you wish to say to me he added in a low tone took his cap from the peg on which it hung and led the way again she passed through the curious but respectful group and jerrold watching furtively from his window saw them come forth the captain turned to her as soon as they were out of earshot i have no daughter of my own my dear young lady but if i had i could not more thoroughly feel for you than i do how can i help you the reply was unexpectedly spirited he had thought to encourage and sustain her be sympathetic and paternal but as he afterwards ruefully admitted he never did seem to get the hang of a womans temperament apparently sympathy was not the thing she needed it is late in the day to ask such a question captain chester you have done great wrong and injustice the question is now will you undo it he was too surprised to speak for a moment when his tongue was unloosed he said i shall be glad to be convinced i was wrong i know little of army justice or army laws captain chester but when a girl is compelled to take this step to rescue a friend there is something brutal about them or the men who enforce them mr jerrold tells me that he is arrested i knew that last night but not until this morning did he consent to let me know that he would be courtmartialled unless he could prove where he was the night you were officer of the day two weeks ago and last saturday night he is too noble and good to defend himself when by doing so he might harm me but i am here to free him from the cruel suspicion you have formed she had quickened her step and in her impulsiveness and agitation they were almost at the end of the walk he hesitated as though reluctant to go along under the piazza but she was imperious and he yielded no come she said i mean that you shall hear the whole truth and that at once i do not expect you to understand or condone my conduct but you must acquit him we are engaged and i love him he has enemies here as i see all too plainly and they have prejudiced mother against him and she has forbidden my seeing him i came out to the fort without her knowledge one day and it angered her from that time she would not let me see him alone she watched every movement and came with me wherever i drove she gave orders that i should never have any of our horses to drive or ride alone i whom father had indulged to the utmost and who had ridden and driven at will from my babyhood she came out to the fort with me that evening for parade and never even agreed to let me go out to see some neighbors until she learned he was to escort miss renwick she had ordered me to be ready to go with her to chequamagon the next day and i would not go until i had seen him there had been a misunderstanding i got the suttons to drive me out while mother supposed me at the laurents and mr jerrold promised to meet me east of the bridge and drive in town with us and i was to send him back in gravess buggy he had been refused permission to leave the post he said and could not cross the bridge where the sentries would be sure to recognize him but as it was our last chance of meeting he risked the discovery of his absence never dreaming of such a thing as his private rooms being inspected he had a little skiff down in the willows that he had used before and by leaving the party at midnight he could get home change his dress run down the bank and row downstream to the point there leave his skiff and climb up to the road he met us there at one oclock and the suttons would never betray either of us though they did not know we were engaged we sat in their parlor a quarter of an hour after we got to town and then twas time to go and there was only a little ten minutes walk down to the stable i had seen him such a very short time and i had so much to tell him chester could have burst into rapturous applause had she been an actress her cheeks were aflame her eyes full of fire and spirit her bosom heaving her little foot tapping the ground as she stood there leaning on the colonels fence and looking straight up in the perturbed veterans face she was magnificent he said to himself and in her bravery selfsacrifice and indignation she was it was then after two and i could just as well go with him somebody had to bring the buggy back and graves himself hitched in his roan mare for me and i drove out picked up mr jerrold at the corner and we came out here again through the darkness together even when we got to the point i did not let him go at once it was over an hours drive it was fully halfpast three before we parted he sprang down the path to reach the riverside and before he was fairly in his boat and pulling up against the stream i heard far over here somewhere those two faint shots that was the shooting he spoke of in his letter to me not to her and what business colonel maynard had to read and exhibit to his officers a letter never intended for him i cannot understand mr jerrold says it was not what he wanted it to be at all as he wrote hastily so he wrote another and sent that to me by merrick that morning after his absence was discovered it probably blew out of the window as these other things did this morning see for yourself captain and she pointed to the two or three bills and scraps that had evidently only recently fluttered in among the now neglected roses then when he was aroused at reveille and you threatened him with punishment and held over his head the startling accusation that you knew of our meeting and our secret he was naturally infinitely distressed and could only write to warn me and he managed to get in and say goodby to me at the station as for me i was back home by five oclock let myself noiselessly up to my room and no one knew it but the suttons and old graves neither of whom would betray me i had no fear of the long dark road i had ridden and driven as a child all over these bluffs and prairies before there was any town worth mentioning and in days when my father and i found only friends not enemies here at sibley miss beaubien let me protest against your accusation it is not for me to reprove your grave imprudence or recklessness nor have i the right to disapprove your choice of mr jerrold let me say at once that you have none but friends here and if it ever should be known to what lengths you went to save him it will only make him more envied and you more genuinely admired i question your wisdom but upon my soul i admire your bravery and spirit you have cleared him of a terrible charge a most disdainful and impatient shrug of her shapely shoulders was miss beaubiens only answer to that allusion the possibility of mr jerrolds being suspected of another entanglement was something she would not tolerate i know nothing of other peoples affairs i simply speak of my own let us end this as quickly as possible captain now about saturday night mother had consented to our coming back for the german she enjoys seeing me lead it seems and she decided to pay a short visit to relations at st croix staying there saturday night and over sunday this would give us a chance to meet again as he could spend the evening in st croix and return by late train and i wrote and asked him he came we had a long talk in the summerhouse in the garden for mother never dreamed of his being there and unluckily he just missed the night train and did not get back until inspection it was impossible for him to have been at sablon and he can furnish other proof but would do nothing until he had seen me miss beaubien you have cleared him i only wish that you could clear every one i am in no wise concerned in that other matter to which you have alluded neither is mr jerrold may i say to him at once that this ends his persecution the captain smiled you certainly deserve to be the bearer of good tidings i wish he may appreciate it another moment and she had left him and sped back to jerrolds doorway he was there to meet her and chester looked with grim and uncertain emotion at the radiance in her face he had to get back to the office and to pass them so as civilly as he could considering the weight of wrath and contempt he felt for the man he stopped and spoke your fair advocate has been allpowerful mr jerrold i congratulate you and your arrest is at an end captain armitage will require no duty of you until we are aboard but weve only half an hour the train is coming sharp at noon train what train where are you going she asked a wild anxiety in her eyes a sudden pallor on her face we are ordered posthaste to colorado nina to rescue what is left of thorntons men but for you i should have been left behind but for me left behind she cried oh howard howard have i only only won you to send you into danger oh my darling oh god dont dont go they will kill you it will kill me oh what have i done what have i done nina hush my honor is with the regiment i must go child well be back in a few weeks indeed i fear twill all be over before we get there nina dont look so dont act so think where you are but she had borne too much and the blow came all too soon too heavy she was wellnigh senseless when the beaubien carriage came whirling into the fort and old maman rushed forth in voluble and rabid charge upon her daughter all too late it was useless now her darlings heart was weaned away and her love lavished on that tall objectionable young soldier so soon to go forth to battle reproaches tears wrath were all in order but were abandoned at sight of poor ninas agony of grief noon came and the train and with buoyant tread the gallant command marched down the winding road and filed aboard the cars and howard jerrold shamestricken humbled at the contemplation of his own unworthiness slowly unclasped her arms from about his neck laid one long kiss upon her white and quivering lips took one brief look in the great dark haunting despairing eyes and carried her wail of anguish ringing in his ears as he sprang aboard and was whirled away but there were women who deemed themselves worse off than nina beaubien the wives and daughters and sweethearts whom she met that morn in town for when they got back to sibley the regiment was miles away for them there was not even a kiss from the lips of those they loved time and train waited for no woman there were comrades battling for life in the colorado rockies and aid could not come too soon xvii under the cloudless heavens under the starlit skies blessing the grateful dew that cools the upland air and moistens the bunchgrass that has been bleaching all day in the fierce rays of the summer sun a little column of infantry is swinging steadily southward long and toilsome has been the march hot dusty and parching the day halts have been few and far between and every man from the colonel down is coated with a gray mask of powdered alkali the contribution of a two hours tramp through deadmans caсon just before the sun went down now however they are climbing the range the morrow will bring them to the broad and beautiful valley of the spirit wolf and there they must have news officers and men are footsore and weary but no one begs for rest colonel maynard riding ahead on a sorry hack he picked up at the station two days long march behind them is eager to reach the springs at forest glade before ordering bivouac for the night a week agone no one who saw him at sablon would have thought the colonel fit for a march like this but he seems rejuvenate his head is high his eye as bright his bearing as full of spirit as mans could possibly be at sixty and the whole regiment cheered him when he caught the column at omaha a talk with chester and armitage seemed to have made a new man of him and tonight he is full of an energy that inspires the entire command though they were farther away than many other troops ordered to the scene the fact that their station was on the railway and that they could be sent by special trains to omaha and thence to the west enabled them to begin their rescuemarch ahead of all the other foottroops and behind only the powerful command of cavalry that was whirled to the scene the moment the authorities woke up to the fact that it should have been sent in the first place old maynard would give his very ears to get to thorntons corral ahead of them but the cavalry has thirtysix hours start and four legs to two every moment he looks ahead expectant of tidings from the front that shall tell him the th were there and the remnant rescued even then he knows he and his long springfields will be needed the cavalry can fight their way in to the succor of the besieged but once there will be themselves surrounded and too few in numbers to begin aggressive movements he and his will indeed be welcome reinforcements and so they trudge ahead the moon is up and it is nearly ten oclock when high up on the rolling divide the springs are reached and barely waiting to quench their thirst in the cooling waters the wearied men roll themselves in their blankets under the giant trees and guarded by a few outlying pickets are soon asleep most of the officers have sprawled around a little fire and are burning their bootleather thereat the colonel his adjutant and the doctor are curled up under a tentfly that serves by day as a wrap for the rations and cookingkit they carry on packmule two company commanders the alpha and omega of the ten as major sloat dubbed them the senior and junior in rank chester and armitage by name have rolled themselves in their blankets under another tentfly and are chatting in low tones before dropping off to sleep they have been inseparable on the journey thus far and the colonel has had two or three long talks with them but who knows what the morrow may bring forth there is still much to settle one officer he of the guard is still afoot and trudging about among the trees looking after his sentries another officer also alone is sitting in silence smoking a pipe it is mr jerrold cleared though he is of the charges originally brought against him in the minds of his colonel and captain chester he has lost caste with his fellows and with them only two or three men have been made aware of the statement which acquitted him but every one knows instinctively that he was saved by nina beaubien and that in accepting his release at her hands he had put her to a cruel expense every man among his brother officers knows in some way that he has been acquitted of having compromised alice renwicks fair fame only by an alibi that correspondingly harmed another the fact now generally known that they were betrothed and that the engagement was openly announced made no difference without being able to analyze his conduct the regiment was satisfied that it had been selfish and contemptible and that was enough to warrant giving him the cold shoulder he was quick to see and take the hint and in bitter distress of mind to withdraw himself from their companionship he had hoped and expected that his eagerness to go with them on the wild and sudden campaign would reinstate him in their good graces but it failed utterly any man would seek that was the verdict of the informal council held by the officers he would have been a poltroon if he hadnt sought to go but while he isnt a poltroon he has done a contemptible thing and so it stood rollins had cut him dead refused his hand and denied him a chance to explain tell him he cant explain was the savage reply he sent by the adjutant who consented to carry jerrolds message in order that he might have fair play he knows without explanation the wrong he has done to more than one i wont have anything to do with him others avoided him and only coldly spoke to him when speech was necessary chester treated him with marked aversion the colonel would not look at him only armitage his captain had a decent word for him at any time and even he was stern and cold the most envied and careless of the entire command the adonis the beau the crack shot the graceful leader in all garrison gayeties the beautiful dancer rider tennisplayer the adored of so many sentimental women at sibley poor jerrold had found his level and his proud and sensitive though selfish heart was breaking sitting alone under the trees he had taken a sheet of paper from his pocketcase and was writing by the light of the rising moon one letter was short and easily written for with a few words he had brought it to a close then folded and in a bold and vigorous hand addressed it the other was far longer and over this one thinking deeply erasing some words and pondering much over others he spent a long hour it was nearly midnight and he was chilled to the heart when he stiffly rose and took his way among the blanketed groups to the campfire around which so many of his wearied comrades were sleeping the sleep of the tired soldier here he tore to fragments and scattered in the embers some notes and letters that were in his pockets they blazed up brightly and by the glare he stood one moment studying young rollinss smooth and placid features then he looked around on the unconscious circle of bronzed and bearded faces there were many types of soldier there men who had led brigades through the great war and gone back to the humble bars of the lineofficer at its close men who had led fierce charges against the swarming indians in the rough old days of the first prairie railways men who had won distinction and honorable mention in hard and trying frontier service men who had their faults and foibles and weaknesses like other men and were aggressive or compliant strongwilled or yielding overbearing or meek as are their brethren in other walks of life men who were simple of heart single in purpose and ambition diverse in characteristics but unanimous in one trait no meanness could live among them and jerrolds heart sank within him colder lower stonier than before as he looked from face to face and cast up mentally the sum of each mans character his hospitality had been boundless his bounty lavish one and all they had eaten of his loaf and drunk of his cup but was there among them one who could say of him he is generous and i stand his friend was there one of them one of theirs for whom he had ever denied himself a pleasure great or small he looked at poor old gray with his wrinkled anxious face and thought of his distress of mind only a few thousands not three years pay had the veteran scraped and saved and stored away for his little girl whose heart was aching with its first cruel sorrow his work his undoing his cursed selfish greed for adulation his reckless love of love the morrows battle if it came might leave her orphaned and alone and poor as it was a fathers pitying sympathy could not be her help with the coming year would gray mourn him if the fortune of war made him the victim would any one of those averted faces look with pity and regret upon his stiffening form would there be any one on earth to whom his death would be a sorrow but nina would it even be a blow to her she loved him wildly he knew that but would she did she but dream the truth he knew her nature well he knew how quickly such burning love could turn to fiercest hate when convinced that the object was utterly untrue he had said nothing to her of the photograph nothing at all of alice except to protest time and again that his attentions to her were solely to win the good will of the colonels family and of the colonel himself so that he might be proof against the machinations of his foes and yet had he not that very night on which he crossed the stream and let her peril her name and honor for one stolen interview had he not gone to her exultant welcome with a traitorous knowledge gnawing at his heart that very night before they parted at the colonels door had he not lied to alice renwick had he not denied the story of his devotion to miss beaubien and was not his practised eye watching eagerly the beautiful dark face for one sign that the news was welcome and so precipitate the avowal trembling on his lips that it was her he madly loved not nina though she hurriedly bade him goodnight though she was unprepared for any such announcement he well knew that alice renwicks heart fluttered at the earnestness of his manner and that he had indicated far more than he had said fear not love had drawn him to nina beaubien that night and hope had centred on her more beautiful rival when the discoveries of the night involved him in the first trembling symptoms of the downfall to come and he was to have spent the morning with her the woman to whom he had lied in word while she to whom he had lied in word and deed was going from him not to return until the german and even then he planned treachery he meant to lead with alice renwick and claim that it must be with the colonels daughter because the ladies of the garrison were the givers then he knew nina would not come at all and possibly might quarrel with him on that ground what could have been an easier solution of his troublous predicament she would break their secret engagement he would refuse all reconciliation and be free to devote himself to alice but all these grave complications had arisen alice would not come nina wrote demanding that he should lead with her and that he should meet her at st croix and then came the crash he owed his safety to her selfsacrifice and now must give up all hope of alice renwick he had accepted the announcement of their engagement he could not do less after all that had happened and the painful scene at their parting and yet would it not be a blessing to her if he were killed even now in his selfabnegation and misery he did not fully realize how mean he was how mean he seemed to others he resented in his heart what sloat had said of him but the day before little caring whether he heard it or not it would be a mercy to that poor girl if jerrold were killed he will break her heart with neglect or drive her mad with jealousy inside of a year but the regiment seemed to agree with sloat and so in all that little band of comrades he could call no man friend one after another he looked upon the unconscious faces cold and averted in the oblivion of sleep but not more cold not more distrustful than when he had vainly sought among them one relenting glance in the early moonlight that battle eve in bivouac he threw his arms upward shook his head with hopeless gesture then buried his face in the sleeves of his rough campaign overcoat and strode blindly from their midst early in the morning an hour before daybreak the shivering outpost crouching in a hollow to the southward catch sight of two dim figures shooting suddenly up over a distant ridge horsemen they know at a glance and these two come loping down the moonlit trail over which two nights before had marched the cavalry speeding to the rescue over which in an hour the regiment itself must be on the move old campaigners are two of the picket and they have been especially cautioned to be on the lookout for couriers coming back along the trail they spring to their feet in readiness to welcome or repel as the sentry rings out his sharp and sudden challenge couriers from the corral is the jubilant answer this colonel maynards outfit ay ay sonny is the unmilitary but characteristic answer whats your news got there in time and saved whats left of em but its a hellhole and you fellows are wanted quick as you can come thirty miles ahead wheres the colonel the corporal of the guard goes back to the bivouac leading the two arrivals one is a scout a plainsman born and bred the other a sergeant of cavalry they dismount in the timber and picket their horses then follow on foot the lead of their companion of the guard while the corporal and the scout proceed to the wagonfly and fumble at the opening the tall sergeant stands silently a little distance in their rear and the occupants of a neighboring shelter the counterpart of the colonels begin to stir as though their light slumber had been broken by the smothered sound of footsteps one of them sits up and peers out at the front gazing earnestly at the tall figure standing easily there in the flickering light then he hails in low tones that you mr jerrold what is the matter and the tall figure faces promptly towards the hailing voice the spurred heels come together with a click the gauntleted hand rises in soldierly salute to the broad brim of the scoutinghat and a deep voice answers respectfully it is not mr jerrold sir it is sergeant mcleod th cavalry just in with despatches armitage springs to his feet sheds his shell of blankets and steps forth into the glade with his eyes fixed eagerly on the shadowy form in front he peers under the broad brim as though striving to see the eyes and features of the tall dragoon did you get there in time he asks half wondering whether that was really the question uppermost in his mind in time to save the survivors sir but no attack will be made until the infantry get there were you not at sibley last month asks the captain quickly yes sir with the competitors you went back before your regimental team did you not i no sir i went back with them you were relieved from duty at sibley and ordered back before them were you not even in the pallid light armitage could see the hesitation the flurry of surprise and distress in the sergeants face dont fear to tell me man i would rather hear it than any news you could give me i would rather know you were not sergeant mcleod than any fact you could tell speak low man but tell me here and now whatever motive you may have had for this disguise whatever anger or sorrows in the past you must sink them now to save the honor of the woman your madness has perilled answer me for your sisters sake are you not fred renwick do you swear to me she is in danger by all thats sacred and you ought to know it i am fred renwick now what can i do xviii the sun is not an hour high but the bivouac at the springs is far behind with advanceguard and flankers well out the regiment is tramping its way full of eagerness and spirit the men can hardly refrain from bursting into song but although at route step the fact that indian scouts have already been sighted scurrying from bluff to bluff is sufficient to warn all hands to be silent and alert wilton with his company is on the dangerous flank and guards it well armitage with company b covers the advance and his men are strung out in long skirmishline across the trail wherever the ground is sufficiently open to admit of deployment where it is not they spring ahead and explore every point where indian may lurk and render ambuscade of the main column impossible with armitage is mcleod the cavalry sergeant who made the night ride with the scout who bore the despatches the scout has galloped on towards the railway with news of the rescue the sergeant guides the infantry reinforcement observant men have noted that armitage and the sergeant have had a vast deal to say to each other during the chill hours of the early morn others have noted that at the first brief halt the captain rode back called colonel maynard to one side and spoke to him in low tones the colonel was seen to start with astonishment then he said a few words to his second in command and rode forward with armitage to join the advance when the regiment moved on again and the head of column hove in sight of the skirmishers they saw that the colonel armitage and the sergeant of cavalry were riding side by side and that the officers were paying close attention to all the dragoon was saying all were eager to hear the particulars of the condition of affairs at the corral and all were disposed to be envious of the mounted captain who could ride alongside the one participant in the rescuing charge and get it all at first hand the fieldofficers of course were mounted but every lineofficer marched afoot with his men except that three horses had been picked up at the railway and impressed by the quartermaster in case of need and these were assigned to the captains who happened to command the skirmishers and flankers but no man had the faintest idea what manner of story that tall sergeant was telling it would have been of interest to every soldier in the command but to no one so much so as to the two who were his absorbed listeners armitage before their early march had frankly and briefly set before him his suspicions as to the case and the trouble in which miss renwick was involved no time was to be lost any moment might find them plunged in fierce battle and who could foretell the results who could say what might happen to prevent this her vindication ever reaching the ears of her accusers some men wondered why it was that colonel maynard sent his compliments to captain chester and begged that at the next halt he would join him the halt did not come for a long hour and when it did come it was very brief but chester received another message and went forward to find his colonel sitting in a little grove with the cavalryman while the orderly held their horses a short space away armitage had gone forward to his advance and chester showed no surprise at the sight of the sergeant seated side by side with the colonel and in confidential converse with him there was a quaint sly twinkle in maynards eyes as he greeted his old friend chester said he i want you to be better acquainted with my stepson mr renwick he has an apology to make to you the tall soldier had risen the instant he caught sight of the newcomer and even at the halfplayful tone of the colonel would relax in no degree his soldierly sense of the proprieties he stood erect and held his hand at the salute only very slowly lowering it to take the one so frankly extended him by the captain who however was grave and quiet i have suspected as much since daybreak he said and no man is gladder to know it is you than i am you would have known it before sir had i had the faintest idea of the danger in which my foolhardiness had involved my sister the colonel has told you of my story i have told him and captain armitage what led to my mad freak at sibley and while i have much to make amends for i want to apologize for the blow i gave you that night on the terrace i was far more scared than you were sir i think we can afford to forgive him chester he knocked us both out said the colonel chester bowed gravely that was the easiest part of the affair to forgive he said and it is hardly for me i presume to be the only one to blame the sergeant for the trouble that has involved us all especially your household colonel it was expensive masquerading to say the least replied the colonel but he never realized the consequences until armitage told him today you must hear his story in brief chester it is needful that three or four of us know it so that some may be left to set things right at sibley god grant us all safe return he added piously and with deep emotion i can far better appreciate our home and happiness than i could a month ago now renwick tell the captain what you have told us and briefly it was told how in his youthful fury he had sworn never again to set foot within the door of the father and mother who had so wronged the poor girl he loved with boyish fervor how he called down the vengeance of heaven upon them in his frenzy and distress how he had sworn never again to set eyes on their faces may god strike me dead if ever i return to this roof until she is avenged may he deal with you as you have dealt with her was the curse that flew from his wild lips and with that he left them stunned he went west was soon penniless and caring not what he did seeking change adventure anything to take him out of his past he enlisted in the cavalry and was speedily drafted to the th which was just starting forth on a stirring summer campaign he was a fine horseman a fine shot a man who instantly attracted the notice of his officers the campaign was full of danger adventure rapid and constant marching and before he knew it or dreamed it possible he had become deeply interested in his new life only in the monotony of a month or two in garrison that winter did the service seem intolerable his comrades were rough in the main but thoroughly goodhearted and he soon won their esteem the spring sent them again into the field another stirring campaign and here he won his stripes and words of praise from the lips of a veteran general officer as well as the promise of future reward and then the love of soldierly deeds and the thirst for soldierly renown took firm hold in his breast he began to turn towards the mother and father who had been wrapped up in his future who loved him so devotedly he was forgetting his early and passionate love and the bitter sorrow of her death was losing fast its poignant power to steel him against his kindred he knew they could not but be proud of the record he had made in the ranks of the gallant th and then he shrank and shivered when he recalled the dreadful words of his curse he had made up his mind to write implore pardon for his hideous and unfilial language and invoke their interest in his career when returning to fort raines for supplies he picked up a new york paper in the readingroom and read the announcement of his fathers death whose health had been broken ever since the disappearance of his only son two years before the memory of his malediction had indeed come home to him and he fell stricken by a sudden and unaccountable blow it seemed as though his heart had given one wild leap then stopped forever things did not go so well after this he brooded over his words and believed that an avenging god had launched the bolt that killed the father as punishment to the stubborn and recreant son he then bethought him of his mother of pretty alice who had loved him so as a little girl he could not bring himself to write but through inquiries he learned that the house was closed and that they had gone abroad he plodded on in his duties a trying year then came more lively fieldwork and reviving interest he was forgetting entirely the sting of his first great sorrow and mourning gravely the gulf he had placed twixt him and his he thought time and again of his cruel words and something began to whisper to him he must see that mother again at once kiss her hand and implore her forgiveness or she too would be stricken suddenly he saved up his money hoping that after the summers riflework at sibley he might get a furlough and go east and the night he arrived at the fort tired with his long railwayjourney and panting after a long and difficult climb uphill his mothers face swam suddenly before his eyes and he felt himself going down when they brought him to he heard that the ladies were mrs maynard and her daughter miss renwick his own mother remarried his own alice a grown young woman this was indeed news to put him in a flutter and spoil his shooting he realized at once that the gulf was wider than ever how could he go to her now the wife of a colonel and he an enlisted man like other soldiers he forgot that the line of demarcation was one of discipline not of sympathy he did not realize what any soldier among his officers would gladly have told him that he was most worthy to reveal himself now a noncommissioned officer whose record was an honor to himself and to his regiment a soldier of whom officers and comrades alike were proud he never dreamed indeed how few there are who do that a man of his character standing and ability is honored and respected by the very men whom the customs of the service require him to speak with only when spoken to he supposed that only as fred renwick could he extend his hand to one of their number whereas it was under his soldier name he won their trust and admiration and it was as sergeant mcleod the officers of the th were backing him for a commission that would make him what they deemed him fit to be their equal unable to penetrate the armor of reserve and discipline which separates the officer from the rank and file he never imagined that the colonel would have been the first to welcome him had he known the truth he believed that now his last chance of seeing his mother was gone until that coveted commission was won then came another blow the doctor told him that with his hearttrouble he could never pass the physical examination he could not hope for preferment then and must see her as he was and see her secretly and alone then came blow after blow his shooting had failed so had that of others of his regiment and he was ordered to return in charge of the party early on the morrow the order reached him late in the evening and before breakfasttime on the following day he was directed to start with his party for town thence by rail to his distant post that night in desperation he made his plan twice before he had strolled down to the post and with yearning eyes had studied every feature of the colonels house he dared ask no questions of servants or of the men in garrison but he learned enough to know which rooms were theirs and he had noted that the windows were always open if he could only see their loved faces kneel and kiss his mothers hand pray god to forgive him he could go away believing that he had undone the spell and revoked the malediction of his early youth it was hazardous but worth the danger he could go in peace and sin no more towards mother at least and then if she mourned and missed him could he not find it out some day and make himself known to her after his discharge he slipped out of camp leaving his boots behind and wearing his light apache moccasins and flannel shirt and trousers danger to himself he had no great fear of if by any chance mother or sister should wake he had but to stretch forth his hand and say it is only i fred danger to them he never dreamed of strong and athletic despite his slender frame he easily lifted the ladder from jerrolds fence and dodging the sentry when he spied him at the gate finally took it down back of the colonels and raised it to a rear window by the strangest chance the window was closed and he could not budge it then he heard the challenge of a sentry around on the east front and had just time to slip down and lower the ladder when he heard the rattle of a sword and knew it must be the officer of the day there was no time to carry off the ladder he left it lying where it was and sprang down the steps towards the station soon he heard number five challenge and knew the officer had passed on he waited some time but nothing occurred to indicate that the ladder was discovered and then plucking up courage and with a muttered prayer for guidance and protection he stole uphill again raised the ladder to the west wall noiselessly ascended peered in alices window and could see a faint nightlight burning in the hall beyond but that all was darkness there stole around on the roof of the piazza to the hall window stepped noiselessly upon the sill climbed over the lowered sash and found himself midway between the rooms he could hear the colonels placid snoring and the regular breathing of the other sleepers no time was to be lost shading the little nightlamp with one hand he entered the open door stole to the bedside took one long look at his mothers face knelt breathed upon but barely brushed with his trembling lips the queenly white hand that lay upon the coverlet poured forth one brief prayer to god for protection and blessing for her and forgiveness for him retraced his steps and caught sight of the lovely picture of alice in the directoire costume he longed for it and could not resist she had grown so beautiful so exquisite he took it frame and all carried it into her room slipped the card from its place and hid it inside the breast of his shirt stowed the frame away behind her sofapillow then looked long at the lovely picture she herself made lying there sleeping sweetly and peacefully amid the white drapings of her dainty bed then twas time to go he put the lamp back in the hall passed through her room out at her window and down the ladder and had it well on the way back to the hooks on jerrolds fence when seized and challenged by the officer of the day mad terror possessed him then he struck blindly dashed off in panicky flight paid no heed to sentrys cry or whistling missile but tore like a racer up the path and never slackened speed till sibley was far behind when morning came the order that they should go was temporarily suspended some prisoners were sent to a neighboring military prison and he was placed in charge and on his return from this duty learned that the colonels family had gone to sablon the next thing there was some strange talk that worried him a story that one of the men who had a sweetheart who was second girl at mrs hoyts brought out to camp a story that there was an officer who was too much in love with alice to keep away from the house even after the colonel so ordered and that he was prowling around the other night and the colonel ordered leary to shoot him leary who was on post on number five he felt sure that something was wrong felt sure that it was due to his night visit and his first impulse was to find his mother and confide the truth to her he longed to see her again and if harm had been done to make himself known and explain everything having no duties to detain him he got a pass to visit town and permission to be gone a day or more on saturday evening he ran down to sablon drove over as captain armitage had already told them and peering in his mothers room saw her still up though in her nightdress he never dreamed of the colonels being out and watching he had scouted all those trees and no one was nigh then he softly called she heard and was coming to him when again came fierce attack he had all a soldiers reverence for the person of the colonel and would never have harmed him had he known twas he it was the night watchman that had grappled with him he supposed and he had no compunctions in sending him to grass then he fled again knowing that he had only made bad worse walked all that night to the station next north of sablon a big town where the early morning train always stopped and by ten on sunday morning he was in uniform again and off with his regimental comrades under orders to haste to their station there was trouble with the indians at spirit rock and the th were held in readiness from beneath his scoutingshirt he drew a flat packet an indian case which he carefully unrolled and there in its folds of wrappings was the lovely directoire photograph whose then was the one that sloat had seen in jerrolds room it was this that armitage had gone forward to determine and he found his sadeyed lieutenant with the skirmishers jerrold said he with softened manner a strange thing is brought to light this morning and i lose no time in telling you the man who was seen at maynards quarters coming from miss renwicks room was her own brother and the colonels stepson he was the man who took the photograph from mrs maynards room and has proved it this very day this very hour jerrold glanced up in sudden surprise he is with us now and only one thing remains which you can clear up we are going into action and i may not get through nor you nor who knows who will you tell us now how you came by your copy of that photograph for answer jerrold fumbled in his pocket a moment and drew forth two letters i wrote these last night and it was my intention to see that you had them before it grew very hot one is addressed to you the other to miss beaubien you had better take them now he said wearily there may be no time to talk after this send hers after its over and dont read yours until then why i dont understand this exactly said armitage puzzled cant you tell me about the picture no i promised not to while i lived but its the simplest matter in the world and no one at the colonels had any hand in it they never saw this one that i got to show sloat it is burned now i said twas given me that was hardly the truth i have paid for it dearly enough and this note explains it yes you can read it tomorrow xix and the morrow has come down in a deep and bluffshadowed valley hung all around with picturesque crags and pinecrested heights under a cloudless september sun whose warmth is tempered by the mountainbreeze a thousand roughlooking bronzed and bearded and powderblackened men are resting after battle here and there on distant ridge and point the cavalry vedettes keep vigilant watch against surprise or renewed attack down along the banks of a clear purling stream a sentry paces slowly by the brown line of rifles swivelstacked in the sunshine men by the dozen are washing their blistered feet and grimy hands and faces in the cool refreshing water men by the dozen lie soundly sleeping some in the broad glare some in the shade of the little clump of willows all heedless of the pestering swarms of flies out on the broad grassy slopes sidelined and watched by keeneyed guards the herds of cavalry horses are quietly grazing forgetful of the wild excitement of yestereven every now and then some one of them lifts his head pricks up his ears and snorts and stamps suspiciously as he sniffs at the puffs of smoke that come drifting up the valley from the fires a mile away the waking men too bestow an occasional comment on the odor which greets their nostrils downstream where the fires are burning are the blackened remnants of a wagontrain tires bolts and axles are lying about but all woodwork is in smouldering ashes so too is all that remains of several hundredweight of stores and supplies destined originally to nourish the indians but by them diverted to feed the fire there is a big circle of seething flame and rolling smoke here too a malodorous neighborhood around which fatigueparties are working with averted heads and among them some surly and unwilling indians driven to labor at the muzzle of threatening revolver or carbine aid in dragging to the flames carcass after carcass of horse and mule and in gathering together and throwing on the pyre an array of miscellaneous soldier garments blouses shirts and trousers all more or less hacked and bloodstained all of no more use to mortal wearer out on the southern slopes just where a ravine crowded with wildrose bushes opens into the valley more than half the command is gathered formed in rectangular lines about a number of shallow elongated pits in each of which there lies the stiffening form of a comrade who but yesterday joined in the battlecheer that burst upon the valley with the setting sun silent and reverent they stand in their rough campaign garb the escort of infantry rests on arms the others bow their uncovered heads and it is the voice of the veteran colonel that in accents trembling with sympathy and emotion renders the last tribute to fallen comrades and lifts to heaven the prayers for the dead then see the mourning groups break away from the southern side the brown rifles of the escort are lifted in air the listening rocks resound to the sudden ring of the flashing volley the soft low wailing goodby of the trumpets goes floating up the vale and soon the burialparties are left alone to cover the once familiar faces with the earth to which the soldier must return and the comrades who are left foot and dragoon come marching silent back to camp and when the old regiment begins its homeward journey leaving the wellwon field to the fastarriving commands and bidding hearty soldier farewell to the cavalry comrades whose friendship they gained in the front of a savage foe the company that was the first to land its fire in the fight goes back with diminished numbers and under command of its second lieutenant alas poor jerrold there is a solemn little group around the campfire the night before they go frank armitage flat on his back with a riflebullet through his thigh but taking things very coolly for all that is having a quiet conference with his colonel such of the wounded of the entire command as are well enough to travel by easy stages to the railway go with maynard and the regiment in the morning and sergeant mcleod with his sabrearm in a sling is one of these but the captain of company b must wait until the surgeons can lift him along in an ambulance and all fear of fever has subsided to the colonel and chester he hands the note which is all that is left to comfort poor nina beaubien to them he reads aloud the note addressed to himself you are right in saying that the matter of my possession of that photograph should be explained i seek no longer to palliate my action in making that puppyish bet with sloat i did believe that i could induce miss renwick or her mother to let me have a copy but i was refused so positively that i knew it was useless this simply added to my desire to have one the photographer was the same that took the pictures and furnished the albums for our class at graduation and i more than any one had been instrumental in getting the order for him against very active opposition he had always professed the greatest gratitude to me and a willingness to do anything for me i wrote to him in strict confidence told him of the intimate and close relations existing between the colonels family and me told him i wanted it to enlarge and present to her mother on her approaching birthday and promised him that i would never reveal how i came by the picture so long as i lived and he sent me one just in time have i not paid heavily for my sin no one spoke for a moment chester was the first to break the silence poor fellow he kept his word to the photographer but what was it worth to a woman there had been a week of wild anxiety and excitement at sibley it was known through the columns of the press that the regiment had hurried forward from the railway the instant it reached the colorado trail that it could not hope to get through to the valley of the spirit wolf without a fight and that the moment it succeeded in joining hands with the cavalry already there a vigorous attack would be made on the indians the news of the rescue of the survivors of thorntons command came first and with it the tidings that maynard and his regiment were met only thirty miles from the scene and were pushing forward the next news came two days later and a wail went up even while men were shaking hands and rejoicing over the gallant fight that had been made and women were weeping for joy and thanking god that those whom they held dearest were safe it was down among the wives of the sergeants and other veterans that the blow struck hardest at sibley for the stricken officers were unmarried men while among the rank and file there were several who never came back to the little ones who bore their name company b had suffered most for the indians had charged fiercely on its deployed but steadfast line armitage almost choked and broke down when telling the colonel about it that night as he lay under the willows it was the first smile i had seen on his face since i got back that with which he looked up in my eyes and whispered goodby and died just after we drove them back my turn came later old sloat too had his customary crack as he expressed it a shot through the wrist that made him hop and swear savagely until some of the men got to laughing at the comical figure he cut and then he turned and damned them with hearty good will and seemed all oblivious of the bullets that went zipping past his frosting head young rollins to his inexpressible pride and comfort had a bullethole through his scoutinghat and another through his shoulderstrap that raised a big welt on the white skin beneath but to the detriment of promotion no captain was killed and jerrold gave the only file the one question at sibley was what will nina beaubien do she did nothing she would see nobody from the instant the news came she had hardly slept at night was always awake at dawn and out at the gate to get the earliest copy of the morning papers but the news reached them at nightfall and when some of the ladies from the fort drove in to offer their sympathy and condolence in the morning and to make tender inquiry the answer at the door was that miss nina saw nobody that her mother alone was with her and that she was very still and so it went for some days then there came the return of the command to sibley and hundreds of people went up from town to see the six companies of the fort garrison march up the winding road amid the thunder of welcome from the guns of the light battery and the exultant strains of the band mrs maynard and alice were the only ladies of the circle who were not there a son and brother had joined them after long absence at aunt graces cottage at sablon was the explanation and the colonel would bring them home in a few days after he had attended to some important matters at the fort in the first place chester had to see to it that the tongue of scandal was slit so far as the colonels household was concerned and all good people notified that no such thing had happened as was popularly supposed and everybody received the announcement with the remark that she knew all along it couldnt be so and that a grievous and absurd but most mortifying blunder had been made it was a most unpleasant ghost to down the shadow of that scandal for it would come up to the surface of garrison chat at all manner of confidential moments but no man or woman could safely speak of it to chester it was gradually assumed that he was the man who had done all the blundering and that he was supersensitive on the subject there was another thing never satisfactorily explained to some of the garrison people and that was nina beaubiens strange conduct in less than a week she was seen on the street in colors brilliant colors when it was known she had ordered deep mourning and then she suddenly disappeared and went with her silent old mother abroad to this day no woman in society understands it for when she came back long long afterwards it was a subject on which she would never speak there were one or two who ventured to ask and the answer was for reasons that concern me alone but it took no great power of mental vision to see that her heart wore black for him forever his letter explained it all she had received it with a paroxysm of passionate grief and joy kissed it covered it with wildest caresses before she began to read and then little by little as the words unfolded before her staring eyes turned cold as stone it is my last night of life nina and i am glad tis so proud and sensitive as i am the knowledge that every man in my regiment has turned from me that i have not a friend among them that there is no longer a place for me in their midst more than all that i deserve their contempt has broken my heart we will be in battle before the setting of another sun any man who seeks death in indian fight can find it easily enough and i can compel their respect in spite of themselves they will not recognize me living as one of them but dying on the field they have to place me on their roll of honor but now i turn to you what have i been what am i to have won such love as yours may god in heaven forgive me for my past all too late i hate and despise the man i have been the man whom you loved one last act of justice remains if i died without it you would mourn me faithfully tenderly lovingly for years but if i tell the truth you will see the utter unworthiness of the man and your love will turn to contempt it is hard to do this knowing that in doing it i kill the only genuine regret and dry the only tear that would bless my memory but it is the one sacrifice i can make to complete my selfhumiliation and it is the one thing that is left me that will free you it will sting at first but like the surgeons knife its cut is mercy nina the very night i came to you on the bluffs the very night you perilled your honor to have that parting interview i went to you with a lie on my lips i had told her we were nothing to each other you and i more than that i was seeking her love i hoped i could win her and had she loved me i would have turned from you to make her my wife nina i loved alice renwick goodby dont mourn for me after this xx they were having a family conclave at sablon the furlough granted sergeant mcleod on account of wound received in action with hostile indians would soon expire and the question was should he ask an extension apply for a discharge or go back and rejoin his troop it was a matter on which there was much diversity of opinion mrs maynard should naturally be permitted first choice and to her wish there was every reason for according deep and tender consideration no words can tell of the rapture of that reunion with her longlost son it was a scene over which the colonel could never ponder without deep emotion the telegrams and letters by which he carefully prepared her for fredericks coming were all insufficient she knew well that her boy must have greatly changed and matured but when this tall bronzed bearded stalwart man sprang from the old red omnibus and threw his one serviceable arm around her trembling form the mother was utterly overcome alice left them alone together a full hour before even she intruded and little by little as the days went by and mrs maynard realized that it was really her fred who was whistling about the cottage or booming trooper songs in his great basso profundo and glorying in his regiment and the cavalry life he had led a wonderful content and joy shone in her handsome face it was not until the colonel announced that it was about time for them to think of going back to sibley that the cloud came fred said he couldnt go in fact the colonel himself had been worrying a little over it as fred renwick the tall distinguished young man in civilian costume he would be welcome anywhere but though his garb was that of the sovereign citizen so long as his furlough lasted there were but two weeks more of it left and officially he was nothing more nor less than sergeant mcleod troop b th cavalry and there was no precedent for a colonels entertaining as an honored guest and social equal one of the enlisted men of the army he rather hoped that fred would yield to his mothers entreaties and apply for a discharge his wound and the latent trouble with his heart would probably render it an easy matter to obtain and yet he was ashamed of himself for the feeling then there was alice it was hardly to be supposed that so very high bred a young woman would relish the idea of being seen around fort sibley on the arm of her brother the sergeant but wonderful to relate miss alice took a radically different view of the whole situation so far from wishing fred out of the army she importuned him day after day until he got out his best uniform with its resplendent chevrons and stripes of vivid yellow and the yellow helmetcords though they were but humble worsted and when he came forth in that dress with the bronze medal on his left breast and the sharpshooters silver cross his tall athletic figure showing to such advantage his dark southern manly features so enhanced by contrast with his yellow facings she clapped her hands with a cry of delight and sprang into his one available arm and threw her own about his neck and kissed him again and again even mamma had to admit he looked astonishingly well but alice declared she would never thereafter be reconciled to seeing him in anything but a cavalry uniform the colonel found her not at all of her mothers way of thinking she saw no reason why fred should leave the service other sergeants had won their commissions every year why not he even if it were some time in coming was there shame or degradation in being a cavalry sergeant not a bit of it fred himself was loath to quit he was getting a little homesick too homesick for the boundless life and space and air of the broad frontier homesick for the rapid movement and vigorous hours in the saddle and on the scout his arm was healing and such a delight of a letter had come from his captain telling him that the adjutant had just been to see him about the new staff of the regiment the gallant sergeantmajor a young prussian of marked ability had been killed early in the campaign the vacancy must soon be filled and the colonel and the adjutant both thought at once of sergeant mcleod i wont stand in your way sergeant wrote his troop commander but you know that old ryan is to be discharged at the end of his sixth enlistment the th of next month there is no man i would sooner see in his place as first sergeant of my troop than yourself and i hate to lose you but as it will be for the gain and the good of the whole regiment you ought to accept the adjutants offer all the men rejoice to hear you are recovering so fast and all will be glad to see sergeant mcleod back again even mrs maynard could not but see the pride and comfort this letter gave her son her own longing was to have him established in some business in the east but he said frankly he had no taste for it and would only pine for the old life in the saddle there were other reasons too said he why he felt that he could not go back to new york and his voice trembled and mrs maynard said no more it was the sole allusion he had made to the old old sorrow but it was plain that the recovery was incomplete the colonel and the doctor at sibley believed that fred could be carried past the medical board by a little management and everything began to look as though he would have his way all they were waiting for said the colonel was to hear from armitage he was still at fort russell with the headquarters and several troops of the th cavalry his wound was too severe for him to travel farther for weeks to come but he could write and he had been consulted they were sitting under the broad piazza at sablon looking out at the lovely placid lake and talking it over among themselves i have always leaned on armitage ever since i first came to the regiment and found him adjutant said the colonel i always found his judgment clear but since our last experience i have begun to look upon him as infallible alice renwicks face took on a flood of crimson as she sat there by her brothers side silent and attentive only within the week that followed their return the colonels and her brothers had the story of the strange complication been revealed to them twice had she heard from freds lips the story of frank armitages greeting that frosty morning at the springs time and again had she made her mother go over the colonels account of the confidence and faith he had expressed in there being a simple explanation of the whole mystery and of his indignant refusal to attach one moments suspicion to her shocked stunned outraged as she felt at the mere fact that such a story had gained an instants credence in garrison circles she was overwhelmed by the weight of circumstantial evidence that had been arrayed against her only little by little did her mother reveal it to her only after several days did fred repeat the story of his night adventure and his theft of her picture of his narrow escape and of his subsequent visit to the cottage only gradually had her mother revealed to her the circumstances of jerrolds wager with sloat and the direful consequences of his double absences the very nights on which fred had made his visits of the suspicions that resulted the accusations and his refusal to explain and clear her name mrs maynard felt vaguely relieved to see how slight an impression the young man had made on her daughters heart alice seemed but little surprised to hear of the engagement to nina beaubien of her rush to his rescue and their romantic parting the tragedy of his death hushed all further talk on that subject there was one on which she could not hear enough and that was about the man who had been most instrumental in the rescue of her name and honor alice had only tender sorrow and no reproach for her stepfather when after her mother told her the story of his sad experience twenty years before she related his distress of mind and suspicion when he read jerrolds letter it was then that alice said and against that piece of evidence no man i suppose would hold me guiltless you are wrong dear was her mothers answer it was powerless to move captain armitage he scouted the idea of your guilt from the moment he set eyes on you and never rested until he had overturned the last atom of evidence even i had to explain said her mother simply to confirm his theory of the light captain chester had seen and the shadows and the form at the window it was just exactly as armitage reasoned it out i was wretched and wakeful sleeping but fitfully that night i arose and took some bromide about three oclock and soon afterwards heard a fall or a noise like one i thought of you and got up and went in your room and all was quiet there but it seemed close and warm so i raised your shade and then left both your door and mine open and went back to bed i dozed away presently and then woke feeling all startled again dont you know the sensation one experiences when aroused from sleep certain that there has been a strange and startling noise and yet unable to tell what it was i lay still a moment but the colonel slept through it all and i wondered at it i knew there had been a shot or something but could not bear to disturb him at last i got up again and went to your room to be sure you were all right and you were sleeping soundly still but a breeze was beginning to blow and flap your shade to and fro so i drew it and went out taking my lamp with me this time and softly closing your door behind me see how it all seemed to fit in with everything else that had happened it took a man with a will of his own and an unshaken faith in woman to stand firm against such evidence and though alice renwick was silent she appreciated the fact none the less day after day she clung to her stalwart brothers side she had ceased to ask questions about captain armitage and the strange greeting after the first day or two but oddly enough she could never let him talk long of any subject but that campaign of his ride with the captain to the front of the long talk they had had and the stirring fight and the magnificent way in which armitage had handled his long skirmishline he was enthusiastic in his praise of the tall saxon captain he soon noted how silent and absorbed she sat when he was the theme of discourse he incidentally mentioned little things he had said about her that morning and marked how her color rose and her eyes flashed quick joyful questioning glance at his face then fell in maiden shyness he had speedily gauged the cause of that strange excitement displayed by armitage at seeing him the morning he rode in with the scout now he was gauging with infinite delight the other side of the question the brotherlike he began to twit and tease her and that was the last of the confidences all the same it was an eager group that surrounded the colonel the evening he came down with the captains letter it settles the thing in my mind well go back to sibley tomorrow and as for you sergeantmajor fred your name has gone in for a commission and ive no doubt a very deserving sergeant will be spoiled in making a very goodfornothing second lieutenant get you back to your regiment sir and call on captain armitage as soon as you reach fort russell and tell him you are much obliged he has been blowing your trumpet for you there and as some of those cavalrymen have sense enough to appreciate the opinion of such a soldier as my exadjutant some of them mind you i dont admit that all cavalrymen have sense enough to keep them out of perpetual trouble you came in for a hearty endorsement and youll probably be up before the next board for examination go and bone your constitution and the rule of three and who was the father of zebedees children and the order of the ptolemies and the seleucidж and other such things that theyll be sure to ask you as indispensable to the mental outfit of an indianfighter it was evident that the colonel was in joyous mood but alice was silent she wanted to hear the letter he would have handed it to frederick but both mrs maynard and aunt grace clamored to hear it read aloud so he cleared his throat and began my dear colonel freds chances for a commission are good as the enclosed papers will show you but even were this not the case i would have but one thing to say in answer to your letter he should go back to his troop whatever our friends and fellowcitizens may think on the subject i hold that the profession of the soldier is to the full as honorable as any in civil life and it is liable at any moment to be more useful i do not mean the officer alone i say and mean the soldier as for me i would rather be first sergeant of my troop or company or sergeantmajor of my regiment than any lieutenant in it except the adjutant hope of promotion is all that can make a subalterns life endurable but the staffsergeant or the first sergeant honored and respected by his officers decorated for bravery by congress and looked up to by his comrades is a king among men the pay has nothing to do with it i say to renwick come back as soon as your wound will let you and i envy him the welcome that will be his as for me i am even more eager to get back to you all but things look very dubious the doctors shake their heads at anything under a month and say ill be lucky if i eat my thanksgiving dinner with you if trying to get well is going to help october shall not be done with before b company will report me present again i need not tell you my dear old friend how i rejoice with you in your hum and haw and this is all about something else goes on the colonel in malignant disregard of the longing looks in the eyes of three women all of whom are eager to hear the rest of it and one of whom wouldnt say so for worlds write to me often remember me warmly to the ladies of your household i fear miss alice would despise this wild open prairiecountry there is no goldenrod here and i so often see her as hum and hum and all that sort of talk of no interest to anybody says he with a quizzical look over his bows at the lovely face and form bending forward with forgetful eagerness to hear how he so often sees her and there is a great bunch of goldenrod in her lap now and a vivid blush on her cheek the colonel is waxing as frivolous as fred and quite as great a tease and then october comes and fred has gone and the colonel and his household are back at sibley where the garrison is enraptured at seeing them and where the women precipitate themselves upon them in tumultuous welcome if alice cannot quite make up her mind to return the kisses and shrinks slightly from the rapturous embrace of some of the younger and more impulsive of the sisterhood if mrs maynard is a trifle more distant and stately than was the case before they went away the garrison does not resent it the ladies dont wonder they feel indignant at the way people behaved and talked and each lady is sure that the behavior and the talk were all somebody elses not by any possible chance could it be laid at the door of the speaker and alice is the reigning belle beyond dispute though there is only subdued gayety at the fort for the memory of their losses at the spirit wolf is still fresh in the minds of the regiment but no man alludes to the events of the black august night no woman is permitted to address either mrs maynard or her daughter on the subject there are some who seek to be confidential and who cautiously feel their way for an opening but the mental sparring is vain there is an indefinable something that tells the intruder thus far and no farther mrs maynard is courteous cordial and hospitable alice sweet and gracious and sympathetic even but confidential never and then captain armitage late in the month comes home on crutches and his men give him a welcome that makes the rafters ring and he rejoices in it and thanks them from his heart but there is a welcome his eyes plead for that would mean to him far more than any other how wistfully he studies her face how unmistakable is the love and worship in every tone how quickly the garrison sees it all and how mad the garrison is to see whether or not tis welcome to her but alice renwick is no maiden to be lightly won the very thought that the garrison had so easily given her over to jerrold is enough to mantle her cheek with indignant protest she accepts his attentions as she does those of the younger officers with consummate grace she shows no preference will grant no favors she makes fair distribution of her dances at the hops at the fort and the parties in town there are young civilians who begin to be devoted in society and to come out to the fort on every possible opportunity and these too she welcomes with laughing grace and cordiality she is a glowing radiant gorgeous beauty this cool autumn and she rides and drives and dances and the women say flirts and looks handsomer every day and poor armitage is beginning to look very grave and depressed he wooes and wins not is the cry his wound has almost healed so far as the thigh is concerned and his crutches are discarded but his heart is bleeding and it tells on his general condition the doctors say he ought to be getting well faster and so they tell miss renwick at least somebody does but still she relents not and it is something beyond the garrisons power of conjecture to decide what the result will be into her pretty whiteandyellow room no one penetrates except at her invitation even when the garrison ladies are spending the day at the colonels and even if they did there would be no visible sign by which they could judge whether his flowers were treasured or his picture honored above others into her brave and beautiful nature none can gaze and say with any confidence either she loves or she loves not winter comes with biting cold and blinding snow and still there is no sign the joyous holidays the glad new year are almost at hand and still there is no symptom of surrender no one dreams of the depth and reverence and gratitude and loyalty and strength of the love that is burning in her heart until all of a sudden in the most unexpected and astonishing way it bursts forth in sight of all they had been down skating on the slough a number of the youngsters and the daughters of the garrison rollins was there doing the devoted to mamie gray and already there were gossips whispering that she would soon forget she ever knew such a beau as jerrold in the newfound happiness of another one hall was there with the doctors pretty daughter and mrs hoyt was matronizing the party which would of course have been incomplete without alice she had been skating hand in hand with a devoted young subaltern in the artillery and poor armitage whose leg was unequal to skating had been ruefully admiring the scene he had persuaded sloat to go out and walk with him and sloat went but the hollow mockery of the whole thing became apparent to him after they had been watching the skaters awhile and he got chilled and wanted armitage to push ahead the captain said he believed his leg was too stiff for further tramping and would be the better for a rest and sloat left him heavens how beautiful she was with her sparkling eyes and radiant color glowing with the graceful exercise he sat there on an old log watching the skaters as they flew by him and striving to keep up an impartial interest or an appearance of it for the other girls but the red sun was going down and twilight was on them all of a sudden and he could see nothing but that face and form he closed his eyes a moment to shut out the too eager glare of the glowing disk taking its last fierce peep at them over the western bluffs and as he closed them the same vision came back the picture that had haunted his every living dreaming moment since the beautiful august sunday in the woodland lane at sablon with undying love with changeless passion his life was given over to the fair slender maiden he had seen in all the glory of the sunshine and the goldenrod standing with uplifted head with all her soul shining in her beautiful eyes and thrilling in her voice both worshipping and worshipped was alice renwick as she sang her hymn of praise in unison with the swelling chorus that floated through the trees from the little brown church upon the hill from that day she was queen alice in every thought and he her loyal faithful knight for weal or woe boom went the sunset gun far up on the parade above them twas dinnertime and the skaters were compelled to give up their pastime armitage set his teeth at the entirely too devotional attitude of the artilleryman as he slowly and lingeringly removed her skates and turned away in that utterly helpless frame of mind which will overtake the strongest men on similar occasions he had been sitting too long in the cold and was chilled through and stiff and his wounded leg seemed numb leaning heavily on his stout stick he began slowly and painfully the ascent to the railway and chose for the purpose a winding path that was far less steep though considerably longer than the sharp climb the girls and their escorts made so light of one after another the glowing faces of the fair skaters appeared above the embankment and their gallants carefully convoyed them across the icy and slippery track to the wooden platform beyond armitage toiling slowly up his pathway heard their blithe laughter and thought with no little bitterness that it was a case of out of sight out of mind with him as with better men what sense was there in his long devotion to her why stand between her and the far more natural choice of a lover nearer her years like unto like was natures law it was flying in the face of providence to expect to win the love of one so young and fair when others so young and comely craved it the sweat was beaded on his forehead as he neared the top and came in sight of the platform yes they had no thought for him already mrs hoyt was halfway up the wooden stairs and the others were scattered more or less between that point and the platform at the station far down at the south end paced the furclad sentry there it was an easy step from the track to the boards and there with much laughter but no difficulty the young officers had lifted their fair charges to the walk all were chatting gayly as they turned away to take the wooden causeway from the station to the stairs and miss renwick was among the foremost at the point where it left the platform here however she glanced back and then about her and then bending down began fumbling at the buttons of her boot oh permit me miss renwick said her eager escort i will button it thanks no please dont wait good people ill be with you in an instant and so the other girls absorbed in talk with their respective gallants passed her by and then alice renwick again stood erect and looked anxiously but quickly back captain armitage is not in sight and we ought not to leave him he may not find it easy to climb to that platform she said armitage oh hell come on all right answered the batteryman with easy assurance maybe he has gone round by the road even if he hasnt ive seen him make that in one jump many a time hes an active old buffer for his years but his wound may prove too much for that jump now ah there he comes she answered with evident relief and just at the moment too the foragecap of the tall soldier rose slowly into view some distance up the track and he came walking slowly down on the sharp curve towards the platform the same sharp curve continuing on out of sight behind him behind the high and rocky bluff hes taken the long way up said the gunner well shall we go on not yet she said with eyes that were glowing strangely and a voice that trembled her cheeks too were paling mr stuart im sure i heard the roar of a train echoed back from the other side nonsense miss renwick theres no train either way for two hours yet but she had begun to edge her way back toward the platform and he could not but follow looking across the intervening space a rocky hollow twenty feet in depth he could see that the captain had reached the platform and was seeking for a good place to step up then that he lifted his right foot and placed it on the planking and with his cane and the stiff and wounded left leg strove to push himself on had there been a hand to help him all would have been easy enough but there was none and the plan would not work absorbed in his efforts he could not see stuart he did not see that miss renwick had left her companions and was retracing her steps to get back to the platform he heard a sudden dull roar from the rocks across the stream then a sharp shrill whistle just around the bluff my god a train and that man there alone helpless deserted stuart gave a shout of agony back roll back over the bank armitage glanced around determined gave one mighty effort the ironferruled stick slipped on the icy track and down he went prone between the glistening rails even as the black vomiting monster came thundering round the bend he had struck his head upon the iron and was stunned not senseless but scrambled to his hands and knees and strove to crawl away even as he did so he heard a shriek of anguish in his ears and with one wild leap alice renwick came flying from the platform in the very face of advancing death and the next instant her arm clasped about his neck his strong arms tightly clasping her they were lying side by side bruised stunned but safe in a welcoming snowdrift halfway down the hither bank when stuart reached the scene as soon as the engine and some wreckingcars had thundered by he looked down upon a picture that dispelled any lingering doubt in his mind armitage clasping queen alice to his heart was half rising from the blessed mantlet of the snow and she her head upon his broad shoulder was smiling faintly up into his face then the glorious eyes closed in a deathlike swoon fort sibley had its share of sensations that eventful year its crowning triumph in the one that followed was the wedding in the early spring of all the lovely women there assembled the bride by common consent stood unrivalled queen alice indeed there was some difference of opinion among authorities as to who was really the finestlooking and most soldierly among the throng of officers in the conventional fulldress uniform many there were who gave the palm to the tall dark slender lieutenant of cavalry who wore his shoulderknots for the first time on this occasion and who for a man from the ranks seemed consummately at home in the manifold and trying duties of a groomsman mrs maynard leaning on his arm at a later hour and looking up rapturously in
