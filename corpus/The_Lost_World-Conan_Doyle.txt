 chapter one gladys hungerton i often listened to mr hungerton he talked to me about economics it was very boring but i was in love with his daughter gladys one evening i listened to him for a long time finally he left i now had a chance to speak to gladys she was a proud woman and she treated me as a friend she looked at me and said youre going to propose marriage how do you know i replied a woman always knows but edward i dont love you i love somebody else she continued who i cried nobody really i love the idea of someone i want to love a hero somebody like the great explorers richard burton and lord stanley a man who has nearly seen death a great hero when i marry i want to marry a great man then ill do something great for you i replied when you do come back we can talk about marriage then she said i left her and went to work i was a journalist and i had to work that evening when i arrived at the offices of the newspaper the daily gazette i went to see my boss the news editor mr mcardle youre doing a very good job he said when he saw me thank you very much sir i replied i want to ask you a favour what is it could you possibly send me on a mission for the paper then i could write some good articles for you what kind of mission mr malone well anything with adventure and danger do you really want to die so young no i want to do something heroic with my life i said well the age of exploration and romance is over no wait i have an idea what about exposing a fraud you could show that hes a liar do you like that idea yes anything is good i replied well continued mr mcardle im sure that you can talk to this man youre good at making friends with people thank you sir i said so try to talk to professor challenger challenger i cried professor challenger the famous zoologist the man who attacked blundell the journalist of the telegraph well said mr mcardle you said that you wanted adventure yes i do i answered but what exactly has professor challenger done he went to south america on an expedition two years ago he answered excitedly he came back last year he certainly went to south america but he doesnt want to say where exactly he started to tell everyone about his adventures however when people ask him questions he never replies something wonderful happened or the man is a very good liar he has some photographs in bad condition but scientists say that they are fakes when journalists try to talk to him he just throws them down the stairs well mr malone this is your mission goodbye my meeting was over now i had to make a plan to meet professor challenger i knew that he hated journalists i decided to write him a letter saying i was interested in science this is the letter that i wrote dear professor challenger i am only a student of nature and science but i am very interested in your ideas on the debate between the scientists august weismann and charles darwin i would very much like to discuss some of your ideas i believe you are the real expert on this matter i have many questions to ask you about this fascinating subject please could i visit you at eleven oclock tomorrow morning yours respectfully edward d malone chapter two professor challenger later i received a letter from professor challenger dear sir i received your letter you can come to my house however i am a great scientist and i do not need your good opinion of me show this letter to my servant when you arrive i do not want any of those horrible journalists in my house yours faithfully george edward challenger professor challenger the next day i went to his house a servant opened the door is professor challenger expecting you he asked yes he is i answered have you got the letter he continued i showed the letter to his servant and walked in a small woman stopped me she looked more french than english to me do you already know my husband she asked no i dont i answered well then i must apologise for him now hes a perfectly impossible person do not argue with him he can be dangerous do you want to talk about south america yes madam i answered because i could not lie to a lady oh thats a very dangerous subject just say that you agree with him call me if he seems dangerous i can usually control him the servant then led me into professor challengers study i was surprised when i saw him he had a very large head and a big black beard his chest and arms were enormous well he said i am the student who wanted to ask you some questions about weismann and darwin i said perhaps your opinion of weismann was too critical i continued and recent experiments show that maybe hes right well he said seriously you know that the cranial index is a constant factor naturally i answered but i did not understand anything and that germ plasm is different from the parthenogenetic egg oh yes i cried and i was surprised at my courage but what does this show he concluded i dont know what does this show it shows he said in a loud voice that youre one of those horrible journalists and that youre not a young scientist i talked nonsense to you my words had no real meaning he stood up and i was surprised because he was extremely short he began to walk in my direction you mustnt attack me i said but i will he answered he attacked me and in a second we went quickly out of the front door into the street fortunately just then a policeman arrived and said whats happening this man attacked me i said do you want me to arrest him he asked no i replied i was wrong too the policeman walked away the professor looked at me and smiled a little come in he said i want to tell you something more we entered his house again mrs challenger was extremely angry youre terrible youre not a famous professor at a great university because you always attack people she shouted the professor grabbed his wife and put her on top of a pillar put me down she shouted say please he answered no put me down now she continued no say please he said again please please please she shouted then the professor took her down and gave her a big kiss after this the professor and i returned to his study im going to talk to you about south america he said two years ago i went on a journey to south america i went to the amazon to check some observations of the scientists wallace and bates during my stay in the amazon i became a friend of the cucama indians they told me that there was a sick man that needed help but before i arrived the man died i was surprised however when i saw him he was a white man not an indian his name was maple white and he was from the united states he was an artist here are some of his pictures i looked at them some were of the indians and others were of different animals like turtles and alligators well i said these dont seem very unusual look at the next one he said it was a picture of a cliff with a thin high tower of rock in front of it i dont know anything about rocks i said well try the next picture then he said the next one was of a man next to a huge and very strange lizard why did he draw this the professor asked i dont know perhaps he drank too much gin i answered or perhaps he really saw this creature he said i wanted to laugh but i didnt want to fight with him again anyway he continued the indians took me to the cliffs in maple whites drawings i took some photographs most of them got wet during my journey home here is one that you can still see look i looked carefully at the photograph it was not in very good condition what do you see he asked i see the same cliffs and the rock tower of the drawing i answered yes of course but what do you see on the top of the rock tower i can see a tree and on top of the tree a large bird its not a bird at all he concluded and i shot it he then pulled a wing out of a drawer is that the wing of a gigantic bat i asked no he answered its the wing of a pterodactyl look at this book he then showed me an illustration in a book that compared the wings of birds bats and pterodactyls this is incredible i cried because now i really believed him how is it possible it seems that a volcanic action pushed up a huge area of rock millions of years ago this area was protected and so the animals on this plateau continued to live they never changed and theyre still there today why dont you tell other scientists about your discoveries i told them about them but they laughed he said tonight theres going to be a lecture at the zoological institute hall on the record of the ages by mr waldron ill be there come and youll see the reaction of other scientists to my discoveries i promised to come and left professor challenger chapter three question that evening i arrived at the zoological institute hall outside there was a large crowd of people inside there were professors and also a large group of students they were happy and noisy mr waldron some scientists and professor challenger sat at the front mr waldron began his lecture he told us about the origin of our planet he told us about the evolution of life from simple sea animals to fish and reptiles and finally to mammals then he began to talk about the dinosaurs fortunately those terrible reptiles were extinct long before humans appeared on this planet question someone said in a loud voice mr waldron stopped for a moment but then he continued those terrible reptiles which were extinct before the coming of man question shouted someone again mr waldron looked with great surprise at the scientists near him he then saw professor challenger with a smile on his face ah i understand said mr waldron its my friend professor challenger and then he continued his lecture but it did not end here every time mr waldron talked about extinct prehistoric life professor challenger interrupted him then the students began to shout question with the professor these interruptions must end shouted mr waldron angrily for a moment there was silence in the hall then challenger stood up i must ask you mr waldron he said to stop saying things that are not scientifically true some people began to shout send him home and others i want to hear him professor challenger sat down again and smiled mr waldror finished his lecture quickly finally professor challenger had his chance to speak ladies and gentlemen he began mr waldron is not a real scientist he only explains our work to the general public he is wrong when he says that certain animals are extinct nobody here believes me but i am a prophet of science i am like galilee and darwin and i here there was a long interruption the professor walked forward and raised both hand everybody became silent i wont say anymore you can however test my ideas do you want to send somebody as your representative then the famous scientist professor summerlee stood up are you referring to the discoveries that you made in the amazon two years ago asked professor summerlee yes i am replied challenger and why didnt wallace bates and other famous explorers of that region see these things continued summerlee perhaps sir you have confused the thames with the amazon the amazon is a much larger river answered challenger its about kilometres long its not strange that i saw things that they did not see yes of course continued summerlee i understand the difference we cant test or prove your discoveries perhaps you can tell us the exact location of your discoveries i cant give that information now will you go on an expedition to test my discoveries yes i will answered summerlee and the crowd cheered then said professor challenger youll have all the information you need to go there but you cant go alone who will go with professor summerlee to the amazon this was a difficult moment for me but i thought about gladys i will go i cried name name shouted the audience my name is edward dunn malone im a journalist for the daily gazette i answered in front of me there was another man standing whats your name sir asked challenger im lord john roxton he answered ive already been up the amazon i know the area well lord john roxton is a famous hunter and traveller he and mr malone will be perfect for this mission said professor challenger the meeting was over i walked out of the hall into the night i was walking down the street when somebody touched my arm it was lord roxton mr malone he said well be companions on this adventure my house is near here come with me i want to talk to you we went to lord roxtons house it was full of strange objects from around the world and the heads of wild animals he gave me something to drink and a cigar to smoke we sat down in comfortable armchairs and began to talk well he said we did it young man i certainly didnt plan to go on this expedition what about you no not at all can you shoot he asked quite well i answered then he took out a rifle and said this is a very good rifle i used it against the slave traders three years ago sometimes young man you must fight for human rights and justice i fought my own personal war against the slave traders in peru i killed many of them in the end i killed pedro lopez their leader he then took out another gun and gave it to me so he continued what do you know about professor challenger i met him for the first time today i answered and how did you become interested in this expedition he asked i told him a little about my meeting with professor challenger and he listened carefully then he pulled out a map of south america and put it on the table i believe he told you the truth he said i love south america ive seen it all i think its the most wonderful place on this planet once you know it youll understand that anything is possible anything the amazon river flows through a forest almost as big as europe why cant there be something new and wonderful in such a place and why cant we be the men to discover it we talked a little more and then i left finally the expedition was ready and professor summerlee lord john roxton and i walked towards the boat but before we got on the boat we heard somebody shout it was professor challenger i have a few things to say he began first i have no reason to thank you the truth is the truth and your expedition has no importance to me my directions and instructions are in this closed envelope you must open it when you arrive at a town on the amazon called manaos and only on the day and at the time which is written on the outside of the envelope is that clear mr malone you can write anything you want in your letters to the newspaper but you cant give any details about your exact destination goodbye sir after meeting you i hate journalists a little less goodbye lord john i can see that you dont know anything at all about science but youll be able to hunt dinosaurs and goodbye to you also professor summerlee if you can possibly learn anything im sure this expedition will be good for you after this he turned and left chapter four into an unknown world we travelled across the atlantic to the city of para in brazil here we hired a black guide named zambo who fortunately spoke some english we also hired gomez and manuel who were half indian they both knew the amazon very well then we travelled by boat up the amazon to the town of manaos finally it was july at oclock the day and hour when we could open the envelope we were all standing around a table lord john picked up the envelope and opened it he pulled out a piece of paper he put it on the table but there was nothing written on it he turned it over but there was nothing there professor summerlee laughed with this piece of paper professor challenger is telling us that this is all ridiculous and that hes a fraud he cried now we can return home and tell everybody that hes a terrible liar just then we heard someone say can i come in there to our great surprise was professor challenger im afraid im a few minutes late he said is everything ready for your journey we can start tomorrow i said good you dont need a map now because im here the next day we began our journey up the river in a boat called the esmeralda at the beginning the river was wide it was like travelling on a lake on the fourth day we turned into a tributary two days later we reached an indian village we got off the boat here and on august professor challenger sent the esmeralda back to manaos some indians built two canoes for us and we took two more indians with us they were with professor challenger the first time they seemed terrified to repeat the journey we got into our canoes and began to travel up the narrow river in the middle of the primeval forest fabulous tall trees stood over us they were like the columns of a church on the third day we heard a strange noise whats that i asked drums said lord john war drums i have heard them before yes sir war drums said gomez wild indians bad ones not good ones they watch us every mile of the way theyll kill us when they can the drums seemed to say well kill you if we can well kill you if we can our two professors were not afraid at all they were too interested in the wonderful plants and animals around them or they were too busy arguing about scientific theories that night we slept in the canoes in the middle of the river we waited for an attack but nothing happened the next day we arrived at some rapids about a mile long these were the rapids where professor challenger lost most of his photos on his earlier journey we carried the canoes around them that night we were about ten miles above the rapids the next day we continued our journey until professor challenger said look at that palm tree there thats the entrance to an unknown world we pushed the canoes past the palm until we arrived at a shallow transparent stream it flowed through a low tunnel of green plants the sound of the drums slowly disappeared and the wild animals became less afraid of us on the third day we could no longer travel by canoe because the stream was not deep enough we began our journey on foot the characteristics of the land changed we began walking higher up the tropical forest disappeared and there were only palm trees after we left the canoes we walked for miles finally we came to an area where there were no more trees then we came to a bamboo forest it took us all day to cross it the next day we climbed up a hill suddenly professor challenger saw a gigantic bird fly up slowly from the ground did you see did you see it summerlee he shouted what do you think it was summerlee asked i believe it was a pterodactyl he answered how absurd it was just a big bird said professor summerlee professor challenger was too angry to speak and we continued our journey lord john then came up to me he was holding his binoculars that was certainly not like any bird that ive ever seen he said to me we crossed another hill and then we saw the high red cliffs of maple whites picture they were about seven miles from our camp chapter five the rock tower that night we made our camp at the base of the cliffs the high tower of rock was near us and on top of it was one high tree the pterodactyl that i shot was on that tree said professor challenger professor summerlee for the first time seemed to believe professor challenger but continued professor challenger we still have a big problem how can we get to the plateau there must be a way up because maple white arrived there during my last expedition i explored to the east well said lord john we should explore to the west the next day we walked west and we arrived at maple whites old camp there we found an indication left by maple white it pointed west soon we came to an area of bamboo under the cliffs in the middle of this i saw something white we cut away some of the bamboo and discovered a skull and then a skeleton the skeleton had clothes and boots it was obviously a european who is this asked lord john every bone in his body is broken i know who he is said professor challenger its james clover maple whites friend maple white didnt come here alone its also clear said lord john that he fell from the top of the cliffs or somebody pushed him we were all silent did someone throw him we began to think of the possible dangers in that unknown land above us we continued walking until we saw an arrow marked on the rocks of the cliffs maple white again said professor challenger we continued for another five miles and came to an opening in the cliffs there was another arrow pointing higher up we followed this arrow and came to a cave there was another arrow there lord john had an electric torch and we entered the cave but the cave was blocked by large rocks this was the way maple white arrived at the top but now we could not use it the next day we walked twentytwo miles around the base of the cliffs and made camp again lord john shot a large animal called an agouti for our dinner we gave half to the indians and we cooked half of it over a fire that night there was no moon and it was very dark then something incredible happened suddenly we heard the sound of gigantic wings from above then for a second in the light of the fire we saw a long neck two red eyes and a beak with teeth then this creature flew away with our dinner it was a pterodactyl we were all shocked and summerlee was the first to speak professor challenger he said very seriously i must apologise i was wrong the next day we continued to walk around the cliffs however we didnt find a way up to the top then after five days we arrived at our first camp again when we went to bed we were very depressed the next morning professor challenger was very happy i have found a way to the top he said how i asked professor challenger pointed to the top of the tower yes i said we can get to the top of that tower but there is a gap between the tower and the plateau when we are on the top i will show you said professor challenger with the help of ropes we climbed to the top professor challenger looked at the tall tree on the top and said this tree will save us a bridge cried lord john exactly my friends a bridge said challenger and now our strong young friend will cut down the tree he then gave me an axe i began to cut down the tree it finally fell down and made a bridge for us the four of us then crossed we were in the wonderful new world it was a moment of victory we walked forward a little bit and then we heard a loud noise we returned to the edge of the cliff our bridge was gone then we saw gomez on the other side i pushed the tree down he shouted you can never get down now youll die up there i am lopezs brother the man lord john shot five years ago now i can die happy gomez began to go down the tower but lord john shot him we were certainly trapped we called zambo and with the ropes we pulled up some food the next morning we made our camp then we began our exploration of the plateau which we called maple white land lord john walked in front after we walked for a couple of minutes he stopped look at this he said these are the tracks of the biggest bird in the world not a bird said professor challenger what then asked lord john a dinosaur professor challenger answered we continued walking and came to an opening in the forest there in front of us were five of the most incredible creatures in the world two adults and three young ones they had skin like a reptile they looked like gigantic kangaroos lord john held his gun the two professors were excited and happy unconsciously they held each others hand and watched like two young children what will they say in england about this professor summerlee asked i know exactly what they will say professor challenger replied theyll say that we are frauds and if we take photographs theyll say that they are fakes said challenger and if we bring back a dinosaur said summerlee well then perhaps theyll believe us said challenger iguanodons said summerlee you can find their fossil footprints all over the south of england they lived there millions of years ago but conditions changed here conditions havent changed and these animals have lived we continued walking finally we came to a very large hole at the bottom of this hole was a small area of water around this water were the pterodactyls nests it was a horrible thing to see professor challenger went too close and they saw us they began to attack us we were very fortunate to survive that night in our camp lord john came to talk to me malone he said do you remember the place where those pterodactyls were very clearly it was a kind of volcanic hole yes exactly it had a blue colour yes but why oh nothing nothing he answered and walked away chapter six i was the hero the next day we stayed in the camp we were very tired from our adventures that night we heard horrible cries from the forest what was that i said quietly weve just heard replied challenger the sounds of a prehistoric tragedy some carnivorous dragon has killed an iguanodon then summerlee raised his hand quiet he cried i hear something some giant creature was coming towards our camp i think its going to jump into our camp i said preparing my rifle dont shoot said lord john quietly if it jumps into our camp itll kill us all said summerlee i have an idea cried lord john then he did something incredibly courageous he picked up a burning torch from the fire then he went quickly out of the area of our camp he ran towards the creature in that moment we could see it in the light it was all covered with blood a moment later the horrible creature ran away i knew it said lord john laughing that monster is afraid of fire the next day we found pieces of iguanodon on the ground the two professors examined them carefully in my opinion said professor challenger that horrible creature was an allosaurus that evening we returned to the camp and began to discuss our future plans tomorrow said professor summerlee we should try to leave this land what said professor challenger we must explore it i am surprised at you professor summerlee professor challenger responded professor summerlee if we are killed nobody in london will ever know about our discoveries we can return to london and then prepare a larger expedition now we must leave this plateau perhaps youre right answered challenger but first we must at least make a map of maple white land that will take too much time said summerlee there are no high mountains how can we see all of the plateau then i had an idea there was a very large tree near us i can go up to the top of this tree i said there i can see all of the plateau and make a map i began to climb the tree after a minute or two i saw something incredible a face the face of a horrible red apeman was looking at me it made angry noises at me but then it disappeared quickly i was shocked but i decided to continue to climb when i arrived at the top i looked around in the distance i saw a lake then i drew a map of maple white land when i came down again i described the apeman to my friends perhaps said challenger it was a kind of primitive man between ape and man the missing link we must discover more about it no said summerlee we must leave this land now we have the map we can try to return to civilisation that night i was too excited to sleep after my adventure i thought about gladys she wanted me to be a hero i could go to explore the central lake alone i could go during the night and be back before morning i left the camp quietly and walked towards the lake there was a bright moon and i could see well i arrived at the edge of the lake at one oclock i climbed up on a large rock and looked around i could see some cliffs on the other side of the plateau there were a series of caves in these cliffs now i could see lights in them so there were humans on the plateau i could see many creatures in the lake one had a long neck and swam in the water then i heard the sound of a large animal walking very near me i saw it it was very familiar to me but why then i remembered it was the creature in maple whites drawing a stegosaurus when i looked at my watch again it was two oclock it was time to return to the camp i walked and thought about my great discoveries then after a few minutes i heard something behind me the sound came closer i turned and saw that horrible monster the allosaurus i decided to run but the creature began to run too he came closer i was terrified i screamed and then i heard a crash i was falling down into a deep hole and then everything became dark i was unconscious for a few minutes when i woke up i smelled something horrible around me there were large pieces of old meat i was in a trap for dinosaurs a trap made by humans i slowly climbed out of the hole and continued my walk to the camp suddenly i heard the sound of a rifle i ran towards the camp and shouted nobody answered when i arrived i saw blood on the ground all my friends were gone i was alone in that world but then i remembered zambo i went to the edge of the cliff zambo was still there at his camp waiting for us there was an indian with him zambo climbed up to the top of the tower of rock when he was opposite me i threw a letter to him for the indian to take to the nearest village maybe he could bring ropes to help us climb down chapter seven prisoners of the apemen i went back to our camp and tried to get some rest it was horrible to try and sleep here but it was safer than the jungle the thought that i could die in this place made me very unhappy the light from zambos fire was the only hope of escape from this dangerous world the next morning sir john woke me up quick quick young man he said what what is it i cried dont stop to think or talk just get the rifles and some food he responded in a moment we had everything and began running away finally we found a place to hide and stopped to rest i told him quickly about my adventures the night before but what happened to you i asked him well he began early yesterday morning hundreds of apes started jumping down from the trees above us they captured us all and took us to where they live they tied summerlee and me up but strangely enough challenger looked a lot like the king of the apemen they gave him special treatment he stayed with the king and ate fruit you see this plateau is divided between the apemen and the indians the caves you saw with lights belong to the indians theres a constant war between the two groups in fact yesterday the apemen brought back twelve prisoners they pulled the arms off of two of them and killed them it was a horrible thing to see we also discovered that they have a special ceremony they take their prisoners to the edge of the cliff and then they throw them off that is what happened to james clover maple whites friend yesterday they pushed four of the indians off the cliffs early this morning i escaped and went to our camp there i got you and the guns and here we are after we rested and talked we ran quickly to where the apemen lived we arrived and hid behind some trees i saw something that i will never forget there was an open area of grass near the edge of the cliffs the small houses of the apemen were in the trees and they were made of leaves in this area there were about one hundred apemen in front of them there was a little group of indians and professor summerlee then i saw two other strange individuals one of them was professor challenger and the other was the king of the apemen both of them were short with big chests and large heads they were both covered with hair the big difference between the two was that the professors hair was black and the kings hair was red then the apemen took one of the indians and pushed him off the cliffs they waited for their next victim this time it was summerlee two of the apemen caught him by the arms challenger turned to the king he tried to convince him not to kill summerlee the king pushed challenger away and then in that moment lord john shot him shoot them shoot young man shoot he cried professor challenger and i helped summerlee to run away lord john continued to shoot the apemen we ran and ran finally we arrived at our camp we thought we were safe but then we heard the sound of feet lord john went outside with his rifle and found the surviving indians they were very frightened one of them we thought was their chief we could not stay in the camp the apemen knew where it was we left with the indians and found another place to hide that night before we slept professor challenger came to me mr malone he said very seriously you wont write that i looked like the king of the apemen professor ill only write the truth i answered very good said professor challenger and went to sleep the next morning we decided to go to the indian caves we left the forest and walked across an open area when we arrived at the lake our indian friends began to shout with joy a large number of canoes were coming towards us when they arrived on land an older indian came and embraced the young chief they had spears and bows and arrows they were there to save their young chief from the apemen then the young chief began to talk to his men he told them that now was the time to attack and defeat the apemen for the last time they were all together and they had the help of these strange men with great magic our rifles we too decided to go with them the next day to fight the apemen that evening we made our camp by the lake we saw many strange creatures in the water with long necks one of them came out of the water onto the beach plesiosaurus its a plesiosaurus cried summerlee my dear challenger were the luckiest zoologists that have ever lived lord john was not interested in the wonderful animals again he noticed the blue colour of the ground near some volcanic holes the next day more indians came now there were about four or five hundred of them we all went towards the forest to fight our war against the apemen before we arrived the apemen attacked us in the open it was easy to defeat them when we went in the forest it was more difficult but with the help of the rifles in the end the indians won after the battle challenger turned to us and said weve seen one of the typical great battles of history what my friends is the victory of one nation over another nation its not important the result is always the same the most important victories of human history were different they were the victories of primitive man over tigers of primitive man over apemen now the future on this plateau belongs to man chapter eight back to london after the victory the indians invited us to stay with them in their caves lord john did not think this was a good idea so we made our camp near their caves we now had time to observe the animals of the lake and the plateau there were many fascinating things to see but we wanted to go back home the indians never helped us it was clear that they wanted us to stay with the magic of the rifles they felt safe every time we asked them for rope or wood to build a bridge they just smiled finally the young chief came to us he gave us a piece of bark we took it back to our camp and studied it its very important i said he was very serious when he gave it to us maybe its a joke summerlee suggested its clearly some kind of writing said challenger it looks like a puzzle said lord john then he grabbed the piece of bark ive got it he cried how many marks are there eighteen well there are eighteen caves above us he pointed to the caves when he gave it to me i said well then its certain this is a map of the caves heres a cross what is the cross for its next to a cave that is longer than the other ones its a cave that goes to the other side of the cliff i cried i believe our young friend has solved the problem challenger said we got some torches and went to explore the cave we didnt light the torches at first we walked in the dark because we did not want the indians to see us after walking a long way we lit the torches and walked quickly then we arrived at a wall of rock we all became sad maybe this is the wrong cave i said no young man lord john said this is the right cave i looked at the mark on the map again and i cried with joy follow me follow me i shouted we ran back in the cave here i said is where we lit the torches but the cave has two arms we didnt see the right one we walked back a short distance and found a large black opening we went quickly down this arm of the cave after a while we saw a light we ran towards it we were at an opening on the cliff face its the moon cried lord john he was right we looked down from the opening and saw that we were nearer to the ground than we were to the top it wasnt going to be easy to get down but with our rope we could do it we then returned to our camp the next evening we secretly took our things to the cave professor challenger wanted to bring a large box but we managed to get it down we arrived at our old camp there was zambo and about twenty indians they helped us to get back to para i will not describe our voyage back to england i will only say that the news of our great discoveries reached england before our arrival we received many telegrams asking us for information but we decided not to tell the newspapers anything about our discoveries first we wanted to give a complete description of our discoveries to the members of the zoological institute about five thousand people came to the queens hall to hear about our adventures it was a wonderful evening when we arrived in the room the audience cheered for a long time then professor summerlee began his presentation he talked about the new insects and plants he told everyone about the prehistoric animals from the jurassic period he described the iguanodon the pterodactyls the allosaurus and the stegosaurus he also talked about the apemen and the indians of the plateau at the end of his talk a scientist named professor illingworth stood up this is all very wonderful certainly he said but they have no real proof the audience began to shout and professor challenger stood up well sir professor challenger said summerlee has his collection of plants and insects doesnt that convince you no it doesnt we have some photographs photographs can be faked professor illingworth said do you want to see the creatures for yourself professor challenger asked yes of course professor illingworth answered and you will accept that as proof certainly answered illingworth at that moment professor challenger made a signal zambo and i came up to the stage we carried a large heavy box which we put down professor challenger took off the cover he looked into the box and said come out you pretty thing then a young pterodactyl jumped up onto the edge of the box everybody was shocked some ladies screamed suddenly the pterodactyl flew up over the heads of the audience it flew around in large circles shut the windows shut the windows professor challenger shouted but there was an open window and the pterodactyl flew out now everybody believed us and the crowd carried us out of the hall on their shoulders we were heroes but what about gladys now i really was a hero well when i arrived in england there was no telegram from her i was very worried and went directly to her house when i went inside she was at the piano gladys i cried gladys she looked at me with surprise she was different gladys i cried whats wrong youre my gladys gladys hungerton no she said im gladys potts this is my husband life is certainly absurd i said hello to a short man with red hair i told my husband about us gladys continued we have no secrets anyway you left me for your adventure so i dont think you really loved me very much i turned to leave but then i decided to ask gladyss husband a question how did you win her i asked did you go to the north pole did you travel with pirates thats a little personal he replied well just one more question then i continued whats your job i work in an office he replied i left gladys and her new husband i felt angry but i also laughed at the absurdity of the situation i will now describe one more scene before i finish yesterday professor summerlee professor challenger and i had dinner at lord johns house after dinner lord john spoke to us well he said theres one thing i want to tell you do you remember that i noticed a strange blue colour around the volcanic holes well ive seen volcanic holes like that only in south africa near the great diamond mines of kimberley then he opened a little box and took out about thirty stones well i found these near the hole where we saw the pterodactyls i didnt tell you about them earlier because i wanted to be certain anyway an expert looked at them he said they have a price of at least two hundred thousand pounds of course we will divide this money equally well challenger what will you do with your fifty thousand i think professor challenger said that ill build a private museum that has always been one of my dreams and you summerlee ill stop teaching and work on all my collections he replied ill use my part of the money lord john said to prepare another expedition to our plateau and you young man of course will use your money to get married not now i said sadly but if you want me ill be happy to come with you lord john said nothing but he offered me his hand the end
