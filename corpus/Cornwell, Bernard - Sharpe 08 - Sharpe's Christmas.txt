 sharpes christmas by bernard cornwell part one the two riflemen crouched at the edge of the field one a darkhaired man with a scarred face and hard eyes eased back the cock of his rifle aimed but then after a few seconds lowered it too far away he whispered the second was taller than the first and like his companion wore the faded green jacket of the th rifles but instead of a baker rifle he carried a curious volley gun of seven barrels no good trying with this he whispered hefting the huge gun only works at close range if we get too close theyll run the first man said where can they run to its a field for gods sake so we just walk up and shoot him unless you want to strangle the sod major richard sharpe lowered his rifles flint come on then he said and the two men stood and walked gingerly towards the three bullocks you think theyll charge us pat sharpe asked theyre gelded sir sergeant major patrick harper offered got about as much spark as three blind mice they look dangerous to me sharpe said theyve got horns but theyre missing their other equipment sir they cant sing the low notes if you follow me harper said then pointed to one of the bullocks hes got some fat on him sir hell roast just fine the chosen bullock unaware of its fate watched the two men i cant just shoot it sharpe protested its christmas dinner sir harper encouraged his commanding officer proper roast beef plum pudding and wine weve got the plums and weve got the wine sir so all we need is the beef and the suet where do you get suet off the bullock of course its sort of stacked around the kidneys so it is but youd best shoot the poor beast first its kinder sharpe walked closer to the animal it had large brown sad eyes i cant do it pat one shot sir imagine its a frenchman sharpe lifted the rifle cocked it and aimed straight between the bullocks eyes the animal gazed at him ruefully you do it sharpe said to harper lowering the gun with this harper held up the volley gun ill blow its head off we dont want its head do we sharpe said just its rumps and suet go on do it not very accurate sir not a volley gun good for killing frogs it is but not for slaughtering cattle so have the rifle sharpe said offering the weapon harper gazed at the rifle for a second but did not take it the thing is sir the huge irishman said that i drank a drop too much last night my hands are shaky see best that you do it sir sharpe hesitated the light company had set their hearts on a proper christmas dinner bloody roast beef gravy thick enough to choke a rat and a brandysoaked pudding clogged with plums and suet its daft isnt it he said i wouldnt think twice if it was a frog its only a cow bullock sir whats the difference you cant milk this one sir right sharpe said and aimed the rifle again just hold still he ordered the bullock then crept a halfpace closer so that the guns blackened muzzle was only a few inches from the coarse black hair i shot a tiger once he said go on sir kill it sharpe gazed into the beasts eyes he had put wounded horses out of their misery and shot enough rabbits in his time but somehow he could not squeeze the trigger and then he was saved from having to shoot at all because a small high eager voice hailed him from the fields far side mr sharpe sir mr sharpe sharpe lowered the rifles cock then turned to see ensign charles nicholls rustling over the grass nicholls had only just arrived in spain and went everywhere at a tumultuous pace as if he feared the war might get away from him slow down mr nicholls sharpe said its colonel hogan sir ensign nicholls panted he wants you sir he says its the frogs sir he says weve got to stop some frogs sir and its urgent sharpe slung the rifle on his shoulder well do this later sergeant major he said yes sir of course we shall the bullock watched the men go then lowered its head to the grass were you going to shoot it sir nicholls asked excitedly what do you think i was going to do sharpe asked the boy strangle it i couldnt shoot one nicholls admitted id feel too sorry for it he gazed at sharpe and harper in admiration and no wonder for there were no two men in wellingtons army who were more admired or feared it was sharpe and harper who had taken the french eagle at talavera who had stormed through the breach of blood at badajoz and cut the great road at the rout of vitoria nicholls hardly dared believe he was in their battalion you think were going to fight sir he asked eagerly i hope not sharpe said no sir nicholls sounded disappointed its christmas in three days sharpe said would you want to die at christmas i dont suppose i would sir nicholls admitted the ensign was seventeen but looked fourteen he wore a secondhand uniform coat on which his mother had sewn loops of tarnished gold lace then turned up the yellowtipped sleeves so they did not fall down over his hands i was worried nicholls had explained to sharpe when he arrived at the battalion just a week before that i would miss the war awful bad luck to miss a war sounds like good luck to me no sir a fellow must do his duty nicholls had said earnestly and the ensign did try very hard to do his duty and was never discouraged when veterans of the regiment laughed at his eagerness he was sharpe thought like a puppy wet nose tail up and raring to bare his milk teeth at the enemy but not at christmas sharpe thought not at christmas he hoped hogan was wrong and that the frogs were not moving for christmas was no time to be killing you probably wont have to fight colonel hogan said then sneezed violently he pummeled his nose with a giant red handkerchief then blew scraps of snuff from the map it could be a rumour richard nothing but rumour did you shoot your bullock never got round to it sir and how did you know we were going to shoot one anyway it am the peers chief of intelligence hogan said grandly and i know everything or almost everything what i dont know richard is whether these frogs are going to use the east road or the west so i have to cover both or rather the spaniards will block the east road and you and your merry men will guard the west here he stabbed a finger down and sharpe peered at the map to see a tiny mark close to the french frontier and next to it in hogans extravagant handwriting the name irati youll like irati colonel hogan said its a nothing place richard hovels and misery thats all it is and all itll ever be but thats where youre going because maybe the french were going there wellingtons victory at vitoria had thrown napoleons armies out of spain but a handful of french forts still remained south of the frontier and hogans spies had learned one of those garrisons was about to attempt an escape into france the garrison planned to march at christmas in the hope that their enemies would be too bloated with beef and wine to fight but hogan had got wind of their plans and was setting his snares on the only two routes that the escaping garrison could use one the eastern road was by far the easier for it entered france through a low pass and hogan guessed it was that route the french would choose but there was a second a tight hard steep road and that had to be blocked as well so the prince of waless own volunteers sharpes regiment would climb into the hills and spend their christmas at a place of hovels and misery called irati theres more than men in the fort at ochagavia hogan told sharpe and we dont want boney to get those men back richard you have to stop them if they use the western road sir which they probably wont hogan said confidently but if they do richard stop them kill me some frogs for christmas thats why you joined the army isnt it to kill frogs so go and do it i want you out of here in an hour in truth sharpe had not joined the army to kill frogs he had joined because he was hungry and on the run from the constables and once a man had taken the shilling and pulled on the kings coat he was reckoned safe from the law and so private richard sharpe had joined the rd fought with them in flanders and india and at assaye a bloody battlefield between two rivers where a small british army had trounced a vast indian horde he had become an officer that was almost ten years ago and he had spent a good many of those years fighting the french in portugal and spain only now he fought in a dark green coat for he was a rifleman though by an accident of war he now found himself commanding a battalion of redcoats they had once been called the south essex but now they were the prince of waless own volunteers though on this dank grey morning they were anything but willing they were comfortable in their spanish billets they liked the local girls and none was of a mind to go soldiering in a cold spanish winter sharpe ignored their displeasure men did not join the army to be comfortable but to fight they marched on the hour men swinging east out of the town and down into the valley it had begun to rain heavily filling the small ditches that edged the fields and flooding the furrows left in the road by the big guns no one else in the army was moving just sharpes regiment that was going to plug a gap in the high mountains to stop the frogs escaping not that sharpe believed he would fight this christmas even hogan was not certain the french would march and if they did they would probably choose the other road the main road so all sharpe expected was a long march and a cold christmas but king george wanted him to be at irati so to irati he would go and god help the frogs if they went as well colonel jean gudin watched as the tricolor was lowered the fort at ochagavia that he had commanded for four years was being abandoned and it hurt it was another failure and his life had been nothing but failure even the fort at ochagavia was a failure for as far as gudin could see it guarded nothing true it dominated a road in the mountains but the road had never been used to bring supplies from france and so it had never been haunted by the dreaded partisans who harried all the other french garrisons in spain time and again gudin had pointed this out to his superiors but somewhere in paris there was a pin representing the garrison of ochagavia stuck into a map of spain and no one had been willing to surrender the pinprick until now when some bureaucrat had suddenly remembered the forts existence and realised it held good men who were needed to defend the homeland those men now made ready for their escape three hundred were gudins garrison and the others were fugitives who had taken refuge in ochagavia after the disaster at vitoria some of those refugees were dragoons but most were infantrymen from the th regiment who paraded in the forts courtyard beneath their eagle and under the eye of their irascible chef de battalion colonel caillou behind the th clustered around two horsedrawn wagons was a crowd of women and children the women caillou rode his horse to gudins side i thought we agreed to abandon the women i didnt agree gudin said curtly caillou snorted then glared at the shivering women they were the wives and girlfriends of ochagavias garrison and between them had almost as many children some no more than babes in arms theyre spaniards he snapped not all of them gudin said some are french but french or spanish they will slow us down caillou insisted the essence of success gudin is to march fast audacity speed there lies safety we cannot take women and children if they stay gudin said they will be killed thats war gudin thats war caillou declared in war the weak die we are soldiers of france gudin said stiffly and we do not leave women and children to die they march with us gudin knew that all of them soldiers women and children alike might die because of that decision but he could abandon these spanish women who had found themselves french husbands and given birth to halffrench babies if they were left the partisans would find them they would be called traitors they would be tortured and they would die no gudin thought he could not just leave them and maria is pregnant he added nodding towards an ammunition cart on which a woman lay swathed in grey army blankets i dont care if shes the virgin mary caillou exploded we cannot afford to take women and children caillou saw that his words were having no effect on the greyhaired colonel gudin and the older mans stubbornness inflamed caillou my god gudin no wonder they call you a failure you go too far gudin said he outranked caillou but only by virtue of having been a colonel longer than the infantryman i go too far caillou spat in derision but at least i care more for france than for a pack of sniveling women if you lose my eagle gudin he pointed to the tricolor beneath its statuette of the eagle ill see you face a firing squad gudin did not bother to reply but just walked his horse towards the gate he felt an immense sadness caillou was right he thought he was a failure it had all begun in india years before when seringapatam had fallen and since then nothing had gone right he had not received one promotion in all those years but had gone from one misfortune to the next until now he was the commander of a useless fort in a bleak landscape and if he could escape that would be a victory especially if he could take caillous precious eagle safe across the pyrenees but was even an eagle worth the life of so many women and children he smiled down at his sergeant you can open the gate and once weve left sergeant light the fuses the women sir the sergeant asked anxiously they are coming theyre coming pierre the dragoons left first it was dusk gudin planned to march all night in the hope that by dawn he would have left any partisans far behind until then he had hardly been worried by the fearsome spanish guerilleros but those savage men had few french enemies left in spain and were closing on the remaining enemy fortresses like vultures scenting death gudin had spread a rumor that he intended to march his garrison to join the beleaguered french troops in pamplona and he hoped that might keep the partisans away from the road that led northwards but he doubted the rumor would work his best hope lay in marching at night and god help any of his men or women who could not keep up for they would face a terrible slow death some would be burned alive some flayed some but no it did not bear thinking about it was not war as gudin understood it it was butchery and what galled gudin most was that the guerilleros were only doing to the french what the french had done to the spaniards the infantry marched through the gate behind their eagle the women followed gudin stayed to watch the sergeant light the fuses then he spurred away from his doomed fort he paused a halfmile up the road and turned to watch as the fire in the fuses reached the charges set in the forts magazines the night blossomed red and a moment later the sound of the explosions punched through the damp darkness flames and smoke boiled above the forts remains as the heavy guns were tumbled from their emplacements another failure gudin thought watching the great fire rage if my eagle is lost colonel caillou said i shall blame you gudin so pray that the british have no blocked the road gudin answered the fort was a dark mass of stone in which streaks of fire glowed bloody red its partisans i worry about not the british caillou sneered if the british are on the road then general picard will come from behind and they will be squeezed to death for that was the plan general picard was marching south from st jean pieddeport he would climb the french side of the pyrenees to make sure the frontier pass was open for gudins men and all gudin needed to do was survive the forty kilometres of tortuous winter road that twisted up from ochagavia to the pass where general picard waited at a place of misery in the mountains at a place called irati sharpe said its not such a bad place and it was true that in the fading evening light irati was picturesque it was a village of small stone houses little more than huts that lay in a sheltered valley at the junction of two high streams and clustered about a big tavern the casa alta that provided shelter for folks traveling the high pass cant see why anyone would want to live here though he added theyre mostly shepherds said captain peter dalembord shepherds thats fitting for christmas sharpe said i seem to remember something about shepherds shepherds and wise men isnt that right quite right sir dalembord said he could never quite get used to the idea that sharpe had received no education at all other than being taught to read while he was a prisoner in india a fellow used to read the christmas story to us in the foundling home sharpe remembered a big fat parson he was with funny whiskers looked a bit like that sergeant who caught a bellyful of cannister at salamanca we had to sit and listen and if we yawned the bugger used to jump off the platform and clout us round the face with the holy book one minute it was all peace on earth the next you were flying across the floor with a thick ear but at least you learned your bible stories not there i didnt i learned those in india i worked with a scottish colonel who was a biblethumper sharpe smiled at the memory he was walking north climbing the road that led from irati towards the nearby french frontier he had already found a place south of the village where the battalion could stop the escaping garrison and he wanted to be certain that no frogs were lurking at his rear you liked india dalembord asked it was a bit hot sharpe said and the food was funny but yes i liked it in india i served under the best colonel i ever had wellesley dalembord asked not nosey no sharpe laughed he was good nosey but just as cold then as he is now no this man was a frog long story dally and i dont want to bore you but i served with the enemy for a bit in india on purpose it was all official colonel gudin he was called sharpe smiled remembering he was very good to me colonel gudin he even wanted me to go back to france with him and i cant say i wasnt tempted dalembord smiled he wished sharpe would tell the story of colonel gudin but he knew it was hopeless trying to get reminiscences out of major sharpe he had seen other men try to learn how sharpe had taken the french eagle at salamanca but sharpe would just shrug and say anyone could have done it it was just luck really he happened to be there and the thing was looking for a new owner like hell dalembord thought sharpe was quite simply the best soldier he had ever known or would know sharpe stopped at the head of the pass and pulled a telescope from a pocked of his green jacket the telescopes outer barrel had an ivory cover and an inscribed gold plate that read in french to joseph king of spain and the indies from his brother napoleon emperor of france sharpe trained the expensive glass northwards to search the misted slopes across the border he saw rocks stunted trees and the glint of a cold stream tumbling from a high place and beyond a fading succession of mountain peaks a chill damp hard land he thought and no place to send soldiers at christmas time not a frog to be seen sharpe said happily and was about to lower the glass when he saw something move in a cleft of rock on a distant slope the road ran through the cleft and he held his breath as he stared at the narrow gap what is it dalembord asked sharpe did not answer he just gazed at the split in the grey stone from which an army was suddenly appearing at least it looked like an army rank after rank of infantry trudging northwards in dun grey coats and they were coming from france he handed the telescope to dalembord tell me what you see dally dalembord aimed the glass then swore quietly a whole brigade sir coming from the wrong direction too sharpe said without the telescope he could not see the distant enemy but he could guess what they were about the garrison would be escaping on this road and the french brigade had been sent to make sure the frontier was open for them theyll not make it this far tonight sharpe said the sun had already sunk beneath the western peaks and the night shadows were stretching fast but theyll be here tomorrow dalembord said nervously aye tomorrow christmas eve sharpe said an awful lot of them dalembord said barrels sharpe answered barrels sir dalembord gazed at sharpe as though the major had gone mad that tavern in irati dally has to be full of barrels i want them here tonight all of them because tomorrow there would be an enemy behind and an enemy in front and a road to hold and a battle to win at christmas time part two general maximillien picard was an unhappy man his brigade was late he had expected to be at irati by midday but his men had marched like a herd of lame goats by nightfall they still had one steepsided valley to cross and a precipitous hill to climb and so he punished them by making them bivouac in the valley he knew they would hate him for that but let them most were conscripts who needed to be toughened and a night among the cold rocks would help scour the mothers milk from their gullets the only fuel for fires was a few stunted trees in the hollows where the winters first snow had drifted but most of the conscripts had no idea how to light a fire from damp tough wood and so they suffered their only food was rings of hard bread they carried on strings about their necks but at least the stream offered plenty of clean cold water another fortnight and itll be frozen said picard as bad as russia consented major santon his chief of staff nothing was as bad as russia picard said though in truth he had rather enjoyed the russian campaign he was among the few men who had done well but he was accustomed to success not like colonel gudin whose garrison he now marched to rescue gudins a useless piece of gristle picard said i never met him lets hope you meet him tomorrow but knowing gudin hell mess things up picard leaned to his fire and lit a pipe i knew him way back he promised well then but ever since india picard shrugged hes unlucky thats what gudin is unlucky and you knew what the emperor says about luck its the only thing a soldier needs luck can turn santon observed not for gudin picard said the mans doomed if the th hadnt taken refuge with him wed have left him to rot in spain santon looked up the dark northern slope lets hope the british arent waiting for him up there picard sneered let them what will they send one battalion you think we cant blast our way through a battalion well put our grenadiers up front and let them shoot some rosbifs for breakfast then well occupy irati whats there nothing santon said a few shepherds so its mutton and shepherd girls for christmas picard said a last taste of spain eh the general smiled in anticipation irati might be a miserable hovel on the frontier but it was an enemy hovel and that meant plunder and picard rather hoped there would be rosbifs guarding the small village for he reckoned his conscripts needed a fight most were city boys too young to shave and they needed a taste of blood before wellingtons army spilled across the pyrenees into the fields of france give a young soldier the taste of victory picard reckoned and it gave him a hunger for more that was the trouble with colonel gudin he had become used to defeat but picard was a winner he was a short man like the emperor and just as ruthless a soldier of france who had led a brigade through the slaughtersnows of russia and left a trail of cossacks to mark his passing in the morning if any rosbifs dared oppose him he would show them how a veteran of the russian campaign made war he would give them a christmas to remember a christmas of blood in a high hard place for he was general maximillien picard and he did not lose doesnt seem right somehow sharpe said fighting at christmas tomorrows christmas sir harper said as if that made todays fight more acceptable if we do fight today keep an eye on young nicholls i dont want to lose another ensign sharpe said hes a nice wee lad harper said and ill keep an eye on him so i will ensign nicholls was standing at the centre of sharpes line beneath the regiments twin colours the prince of waless own volunteers were paces back from the frontier that was marked only by a cairn of stones just far enough back so that any frenchman coming from the south could not see them beyond the crest behind them on the spanish side of the frontier the pass ran gently down towards the village while in front of the battalion the slope fell away steeply the road zigzagged up that slope and the enemy brigade would have a foul time climbing into sharpes muskets itll be like shooting rats in a pit harper said happily and so it would but the enemy brigade could still be a nuisance its very presence meant sharpe had to keep his battalion on the frontier leaving only a picquet to guard the road south of the village captain smith commanded that picquet and he would give sharpe warning if the escaping french garrison came into sight but what would sharpe do then if he marched his men south the french brigade would climb the slope and take him in the rear while if he stayed on this high crest the garrison troops would appear in the valley behind him he just had to hope that the garrison did not come today there was still no sign of the french who had camped in the deep valley beyond the frontier they would be bitterly cold by now cold and scared and damp and unhappy while sharpes men were as comfortable as they could be in this miserable place except for the sentries they had spent the night inside iratis firewarmed houses where they had made a decent breakfast from twicebaked bread and sour salt beef sharpe stamped his feet and blew on his cold hands when would the french come he was not really in any hurry for the longer they delayed the more hope he had of keeping them out of the village all day but he had a soldiers impatience to get the grim business done grim at least for the french for sharpe had set them a trap on the road the road twisted down from the frontier into a small hanging combe that overlooked the deeper valley where the french had spent their uncomfortable night in that smaller valley which the dawn now touched with a grey damp light there were twentyone big wine barrels the barrels were arranged in several groups of three and each group blocked the narrow track up which the french must come above the barrels hidden among the rocks were fifteen riflemen the french hated riflemen they did not use the rifle reckoning that it took too long to load but sharpe had learned to love the weapon it might be slow in battle but it could kill at give times the range of a smoothbore musket and he had more than once seen a handful of riflemen turn a battles fate sharpe turned and stared south he could not see irati for the village was well over a mile away and his picquet a halfmire further away still and he suddenly worried that he would not hear captain smiths warning shots but it was too late to change the arrangements so stop worrying he told himself no point in fretting about what you cannot change enemy sir harper said softly and sharpe wheeled around to gaze down the road the french had come not many yet just a half company of grenadiers the elite of the enemy infantry because they wore high bearskin hats with a yellow grenade badge though none he saw through his telescope flaunted the high red plume on their hats french grenadiers were very protective of that plume and on campaign they liked to keep it in a leather tube attached to their bayonet sling thirty he counted the men as they appeared forty fortyfive all grenadiers pat sending their best up front are they got them worried we have sharpe said the grenadiers had stopped at the sight of the barrels some of them gazed up the steep slope beyond but the prince of waless own volunteers were well hidden and sharpe and harper were concealed behind the frontier cairn an officer came to the front of the grenadiers stared at the barrels for a minute then shrugged and walked forward its his lucky day sharpe said the grenadiers hung back as their officer approached the strange obstacle he was cautious as any man would be on the spanish frontier but the barrels looked innocent enough he stooped to the nearest sniffed at the bung then drew his sword and worked the tip of its blade into the cork plug he levered the tight bung free and then stooped to sniff again hes found the wine sharpe said lets hope they stop and drink it sir the grenadiers assured that only barrels of cheap spanish tinto barred their path surged forward more soldiers were appearing over the lower crest and they too rushed to join the unexpected booty men tipped the first three barrels over and stabbed at their lids with drawn bayonets while a group of grenadiers ran to take possession of the second line of barrels for what they are about to receive sharpe said two of the second line of barrels contained nothing but stones but the third the middle barrel was halffilled with gunpowder from sharpes spare ammunition it was mixed with small sharp stones and above it balanced on a stave that rifleman hagman had carefully nailed into place was a coiled strip of burning slowmatch none of the grenadiers noticed the small holes that had been drilled into the barrel to feed oxygen to the fuse they just smelt wine and so kicked over the barrel for a second sharpe thought the trap had failed then suddenly the narrow valley vanished in a cloud of greywhite powder smoke pierced with livid flame the smoke churned in the small combe hiding the carnage made by the explosion then as the damp wind began to carry the powder smoke northwards the sound rolled up the slope it was like a clap of thunder magnified by the echo that beat back from the valleys far side once the echo had gone there was just a strange silence in the hills poor bastards harper said for the smoke was clearing and he could see the bodies scattered on the road some were still some crawled blindly some just twitched then the rifles opened fire sharpes riflemen did not miss their mark at that close range they fired from behind the rocks high on either side of the small valley first they picked off the surviving officers then the sergeants by the time each greenjacket had fired two rounds the french had vanished from the small valley they had fled back over its lip leaving behind a dozen dead and a score of wounded men the battle for irati had begun in one way colonel jean gudin had been untypically lucky for not one partisan had troubled his column on its dark road north but in every other way his usual ill fortune had prevailed first one of the dragoon horses had stumbled on a frozen rut in the road and broken its leg by itself it was no great accident and the poor beast was put out of its misery swiftly enough but in the dark the commotion caused a long delay the carcass was finally hauled from the road and the column had trudged on only to have the dragoon vanguard take a wrong turning a few kilometres further on that at least was not gudins fault any more than an injured horse was his fault but it was typical of his luck it was almost dawn by the time the column had turned itself about and found the right track winding up towards the high pass by then gudin had surrendered his horse to one of his lieutenants who had a fever and could hardly walk colonel caillou was fuming at the delay he had never he claimed in all his service as a soldier seen such ineptitude a halfwit could do better than colonel gudin we are supposed to be at the pass by midday he insisted we shall be lucky to be there by nightfall gudin ignored the colonels ranting there was nothing to be done except press on and be thankful that the guerilleros were all asleep in their beds in three days time gudin reflected he could be back at a depot in france he would be safe and so long as no british troops waited at the frontier he should save caillous eagle and so spare himself the firing squad it was just after dawn that the next accident occurred the column was dragging two wagons one carrying the heavily pregnant maria and the second loaded with what small baggage the garrison had managed to rescue from the fort the axle of that second wagon broke and suddenly the horses were dragging stumps of splintering wood across the rutted road gudin sighed there was nothing for it but to abandon the wagon with all its precious possessions small things but the property of men who owned little he did let his men rifle through the baggage to retrieve what they could carry and all the while caillou cursed him and said it was timewasting gudin knew that was true and so before all the packs could be hauled off he ordered the wagon to be shoved off the road with it went his books not many but all of them dear to gudin they included his diaries from india the careful record of those long hot years when he had thought he could drive the british out of mysore but the redcoats had won and nothing had been the same since gudin often thought of india he missed it the smells the heat the colour the mystery he missed the gaudy panoply of indian armies marching he missed the sun and the savagery of the monsoon in india he thought i had a future but after it none and sometimes when he was feeling sorry for himself he blamed it all on one young man whom he had liked an englishman called sharpe it had been sharpe who had caused that first great defeat though gudin had never blamed him for he had recognised that private richard sharpe had been a natural soldier how the emperor would love sharpe so much luck now there was another sharpe an officer in spain whose named haunted the french and gudin sometimes wondered if it was the same man though that seemed unlikely for few british officers came from the ranks and besides this spanish sharpe was a rifleman and gudins sharpe had been a redcoat yet still gudin hoped it was the same man for he had liked young richard sharpe though in truth he suspected that he was long dead not many europeans had survived india the fever got them if the enemy did not gudin walked on his diaries left behind musing on india and trying to ignore colonel caillous insults the pregnant girl was crying and the garrison surgeon a fastidious parisian who had hated serving in the pyrenees claimed she would die if he did not cut her open the baby is sideways he told gudin it should be headfirst if you cut her shell die said gudin so the surgeon despised soldiers women shell die if i dont cut her just keep her alive as far as irati gudin said and there you can operate if she lives that long the surgeon muttered and just then a dull rumble sounded from the mountains ahead it sounded like distant thunder but there were no storm clouds over the peaks and a second after the rumble had faded the small wind brought the crackle of musketry you see caillou spurred back down the column with a look of spiteful triumph theres enemy ahead we dont know that gudin said that sound could have come from anywhere theyre waiting for us caillou said pointing dramatically towards the hills and if wed abandoned the women wed be there already its your doing gudin i promise if my eagle is lost the emperor will know its your doing you must tell the emperor whatever you wish gudin said in resignation so leave the women here now leave them caillou insisted march to the guns colonel get there before dark i will not leave the women gudin said i will not leave them and we shall be at irati long before nightfall it is not so far now colonel gudin sighed and walked on his heels were blistering but he would not retrieve his horse for he knew the lieutenants need was greater than his nor would he abandon his mens women and so he kept going and tried to blot out caillous nagging voice and the awful haunting screams of the pregnant girl he was not a prayerful man but as he climbed towards the distant sounds of the guns gudin did pray he prayed that god would send him a victory just one small victory so that his career would not end in failure or a firing squad a christmas miracle that was all he asked just one small miracle to set against a lifetime of defeat general maximillien picard bulled his way through the panicked troops to stand at the mouth of the small valley he could see the dead grenadiers the smashed barrels and beyond them the other barrels waiting in the road a rifle bullet snapped past his head but picard ignored the threat he was charmed there was no one alive who could spoil that luck santon he snapped sir major santon resisted the urge to crouch one company up here they are to destroy the barrels with volley fire you understand yes sir and while theyre doing that send the voltigeurs up the slopes the general waved to where puffs of white smoke betrayed the position of the riflemen he did not know they were riflemen and if he had he might have shown more caution but he believed the ambush had been set by partisans but whoever it was they would soon be chased out of their lairs by the french light infantry do it now picard snapped we dont have all day he turned away and a bullet plucked at his cloak flicking it out like a banner caught by the wind picard turned back looked to find the newest patch of musket smoke and lined a finger to it bastards he said as he walked away bastards who would now get a lesson for christmas bugler sharpe called and the thirteenyearold boy came running out of the battalion to stand behind his major sound the retreat sharpe ordered and saw patrick harper lift a quizzical eyebrow the frogs will send their voltigeurs up the valley sides sharpe explained no point in our riflemen hanging around while they do that the lads have done the damage the bugler took a deep breath then blew hard the call was a triple call of nine notes the first eight stuttering on one note the last flying high up the scale the sound of the bugle echoed from the distant hills and sharpe gazing through his telescope saw the cloaked french general turn back again lad sharpe told the bugler the bugle call was sending two messages first it was telling the riflemen to abandon their positions and climb back to the ridge but it was also telling the french that they faced an enemy more formidable than partisans they were facing trained infantry veteran troops and when sharpe was certain that the frenchman was staring up at the ridge in an effort to catch sight of the bugler he turned and shouted at the prince of waless own volunteers talion by the right forward a pause march they stamped forward in perfect order a line of men two ranks deep beneath their bright colours talion sharpe shouted as they reached the ridges crest halt fix bayonets sharpe was putting on a display for the french the enemy had been bloodied they had been panicked and now they faced a long steep climb up a bare cold hill to where they could see the redcoats of britain and the long glitter of seventeeninch bayonets ensign nicholls came to stand by sharpe what are we doing sir were giving the frogs an invitation mr nicholls seeing if theyre brave enough to come up and play will they i doubt it lad sharpe said i doubt it why not sir because theyre about to be given a demonstration lad thats why sergeant major sir harper acknowledged three rounds sergeant major platoon fire and i want it fast yes sir the range was much too great for a smoothbore musket but sharpe did not have a mind to kill any more frenchmen today he had already killed too many for his liking christmas should be peace on earth not broken bodies on a hard road so he would show the french exactly what waited for them at the hilltop he would show them that they faced veterans who could fire their muskets faster than any other troops on earth he would show them that to climb the hill was to enter hell and with any luck they would decline the invitation stand back mr nicholls sharpe said and steered the ensign back through the waiting ranks now sergeant major harper ordered the men to remove their bayonets and load their muskets and when they were ready he took a deep breath number four company he shouted number five company fire the two centre companies fired together the muskets slammed back into their shoulders and a dirty fill of powder smoke spat across the crest no other orders were given but as soon as the centre companies had fired the platoons on either side pulled their triggers each company was split into two platoons and each platoon waited for the one inside them to fire before firing themselves to the watching french it must have looked as though the smoke was rippling out along the high red line but any troops could fire one round in a pretty ripple what would but fear into the french was the speed with which the second bullet was fired sharpe noted with approval that the centre companies were all reloaded before the ripple of musket fire had reached the battalions outer flanks those flanks fired and within a heartbeat the centre companies had fired again and again the ripple spread outwards as the men in the centre dropped their muskets heavy butts onto the stony ground and ripped the top from new cartridges with their teeth the second staggered volley of musket balls whistled out into the void and then the third followed without a pause it had been a marvelous display the best infantry in the world showing what it did best and if that promise of slaughter did not give the enemy pause then nothing would but picard was not a man to heed a warning and sharpe watching from the crest saw the french preparing to come forward again and just then far to the south from where the picquet watched the road leading into spain a musket fired and sharpe spun around he knew the other enemy was coming part three captain dalembord sharpe shouted sir you take over here dally sharpe said and ill take your horse the french brigade was forming a column it could mean only one thing that they planned to attack straight up the hill but before advancing their leading rank fired musket volleys at the fifteen remaining wine barrels that blocked the road the remnant of sharpes ingenious and deadly trap none of the barrels contained gunpowder for sharpe had possessed only a limited supply but the french were not to know that their volleys cleared the road while their skirmishers climbed the small valleys side to chase away riflemen who had already retreated it would take an hour sharpe reckoned before this brigade was in a fit state to advance and when they did he doubted it would be with much enthusiasm for they knew what was waiting for them but another thousand frenchmen were coming from the south in their desperate attempt to escape from spain and those men knew they must fight through the pass if they were ever to reach home and their desperation could make those thousand men far more dangerous than the brigade sharpe now rode back through the village to where a picquet watched the enemy approaching from the south theyre still a long way off sir captain smith reported nervously worried that he had summoned sharpe too soon you did the right thing sharpe reassured him as he drew out his telescope whats happening back there sir smith asked we showed the frogs a trick or two but they still seem to want a fight but dont worry they wont be spending their christmas here he could see the french refugees now there were mounted dragoons up front infantry behind and one wagon no guns and a crowd of women and children in the middle thats good sharpe said quietly good sir smith asked theyre bringing their women captain and they wont want them hurt will they it might even persuade them to surrender sharpe paused his eye caught by a metallic gleam above the infantrys dark shakos and theyve got an eagle sharpe said excitedly that would make a nice christmas present for the battalion wouldnt it a french eagle i could fancy that he collapsed the glass and wondered how much time he had the column was still a good two hours marching away which should be enough just watch them he told smith then he pulled himself back into dalembords saddle and rode back to the frontier it was all a question of timing now if the brigade attacked the hill at the same time as the garrison approached the village then he was in trouble but when he was back at the northern ridge he saw to his relief that the enemy had already cleared the road of the barrels and that their voltigeurs were spreading out on the slope to herald the attack the voltigeurs job was to advance in a loose scattered line and harass the redcoats with musket fire to prevent this sharpe sent his own skirmishers into battle mister dalembord light company out pick off those voltigeurs the french were brave sharpe thought as brave as could be but also stupid they knew volley fire waited for them but their general would not back down without more blood and sharpe was ready to give it to him he had already guessed that the enemy was inexperienced because the voltigeurs were not forcing home their attack but trying to stay out of range of the deadly rifles they were just children he thought snatched from a depot and marched to war it was cruel the french column advanced behind the voltigeurs it looked formidable but columns always did this one was thirty files wide and sixty ranks deep a great solid block of men who had been ordered to climb an impossible slope into a gale of fire it would be murder not war but it was the french commander who was doing the murdering sharpe called in his light company then sent them back to join smiths picquet if the french dragoons rode ahead of the approaching garrison then the riflemen could pick off the horsemen but you stay here sharpe told dalembord ive got a job for you the column lost its cohesion as it tried to cut across the corners of the zigzagging road they were getting close now little more than a hundred paces away and sharpe could see the men were sweating despite the days cold they were wearing too and whenever they looked up they saw nothing except a group of officers waiting on the crest the line of redcoats had pulled back out of sight of the enemy and sharpe did not plan to bring them forward until the very last moment cutting it fine sir dalembord observed give it a minute yet sharpe said he could hear the drums in the columns centre now thought whenever the drummers paused to let the men shout vive lempereur the response was feeble these men were winded wearing and wary and only fifty paces away now sergeant major sharpe said and he stepped back through the advancing ranks and tried not to feel sorry for the frenchmen he was about to kill fire harper shouted and this time the whole line fired in unison so that their bullets smacked home in one lethal blow platoon fire harper shouted before the echo of the volley had died away from the centre sharpe could see nothing of the enemy now for they were hidden behind a thick cloud of greywhite powder smoke but he could imagine the horror probably the whole french front rank was dead or dying and most of the second rank too and the men behind would be pushing and the men in front stumbling on the dead and wounded and then just as they were recovering from the first volley the rolling platoon fire began aim low harper shouted aim low the air filled with the rottenegg stench of powder smoke the mens faces were flecked with burning powder scraps while the paper cartridge wadding spat out behind each bullet started small flickering fires in the grass on and on the volleys went as men fired blindly down into the smoke pouring death into a small place and still they loaded and rammed and fired and sharpe did not see a single man in his own regiment fall he did not even hear a french bullet it was the old story a french column was being pounded by a british line and british musketry was crushing the columns head and flanks and flecking its centre with blood sharpe had posted a man wide of the line so that he could see past the smoke theyre running sir theyre running the man shouted excitedly running like hell cease fire sharpe bellowed cease fire and slowly the smoke cleared to show the horror on the winter grass blood and horror and broken men a column had met a line sharpe turned away mister dalembord sir take a white flag and ride to the southern road find the garrison commander tell him we broke a french brigade and that well break him in exactly the same manner if he doesnt surrender sir sir please sir that was ensign nicholls jumping up and down beside dalembord can i go with him sir please sir ive never seen a frog not close up sir theyve got tails and horns dalembord said and smiled when nicholls looked alarmed if you can borrow a horse sharpe told the ensign you can go but keep your mouth shut let mister dalembord do the talking yes sir nicholls said and ran happily away while sharpe turned back to the north the french had broken and run and he doubted they would be back but he was not willing to care for their wounded he had neither the men nor the supplies to do that so someone would have to go down to the enemy under a flag of truce and offer them a chance to clear up the mess they had made just in time for christmas colonel caillou watched the two redcoated horsemen approach under their flag of truce and felt an immense rage surge inside him gudin would surrender he knew it and when that happened caillou would lose the eagle that the emperor himself had presented to the th he would not let it happen and so in a blind fury he drove back his spurs and galloped after gudin gudin heard him coming turned and waved him back but caillou ignored him instead he drew his pistol go back he shouted in english to the approaching officers go back dalembord reined in his horse do you command her monsieur he asked caillou in french go back caillou shouted angrily we do not accept your flag you hear me we do not accept it go he leveled the pistol at the younger officer who held the offending flag of truce a white handkerchief tied to a muskets ramrod go caillou shouted then spurred his horse away from gudin who had moved to intervene its all right charlie dalembord said he wont shoot its a flag of truce he looked back to caillou monsieur i insist upon knowing if you command here just go caillou shouted but at that moment nichollss horse stumbled a pace forward and caillou overwhelmed with rage for the anticipated shame of surrender pulled the pistols trigger the white flag toppled slowly nicholls stared at caillou with a look of astonishment on his young face then he turned in puzzlement to gaze at dalembord dalembord reached out a hand but nicholls was already falling the bullet had broken through one of the gold laces his mother had sewn onto his jacket and then it had pierced his young heart caillou seemed suddenly shocked as if he had only just realized the enormity of his crime he opened his mouth to speak but no words came instead a second pistol sounded and caillou just like nicholls toppled dead from his horse colonel gudin put his pistol back in its holster i command here he told dalembord in english to my shame sir i command here you have come to offer terms i have come to fetch your surrender sir dalembord said and saw from gudins face that he would get it the battle was over sharpe heard of nichollss death while he was still watching the french take their dead from the northern slope he swore when he heard the news and then he stalked back to the village with pure bloody murder in his head a ground of unarmed french soldiers stood nervously outside the tavern and he pushed his angry way through them and then kicked open the door what bastard frenchman dared killed my officer he shouted storming into the room with one hand on the hilt of his heavy cavalry sword a tall greyhaired french officer stood to face him the man who killed your officer is dead monsieur the frenchman said i shot him sharpe stopped and stared his hand fell from the sword and his mouth dropped open for a second he seemed unable to speak but then he found his voice colonel gudin he asked in amazement gudin smiled oui caporal sharpe im a major now sir sharpe said and he stepped forward with his hand outstretched but gudin ignored the hand and instead clasped sharpe in both arms and kissed him on both cheeks dalembord watched smiling i knew it was you gudin said his hands still on sharpes shoulders im proud of you sharpe so very proud there were tears in the colonels eyes and for your officer who died i am sorry there was nothing i could do the door from the kitchens opened and daniel hagman poked his head through need more towels captain he said to dalembord what the hell are you doing dan sharpe asked delivering a baby sir hagman said as if that was the most natural thing in the world for a rifleman to be doing on christmas eve isnt the first baby ive done sir the frog doctor was going to cut her open and that would have killed her but ill see her right its no different from slipping a lamb into the world thank you sir he took the proffered rags from dalembord and ducked back into the candlelit kitchen sharpe sat dalembord and gudin had started on the wine so he poured himself a mug and took a long drink so what am i going to do with you he asked his old colonel gudin spread his hands i could choose to fight you i suppose but if i do i lose so i fear i am your prisoner again the colonel looked at dalembord he took me prisoner in india and he was only a corporal then that was a long time ago sir a long time ago sharpe poured more wine and pushed the wineskin towards the colonel and how have you been since sir not well sharpe not well gudin confessed you see i am still a colonel just as i was then it seemed that after seringapatam i could do nothing right im sure thats not true sir you were the best officer i ever had gudin smiled at the compliment but i have had no luck sharpe no victories so tell me about it sir its the night before christmas a good night for a story so tell me so gudin did general maximillien picard sulked he sat by a miserable fire in the deep cold valley listening to the moans of his wounded and knew that he had been well beaten he had scented defeat from the moment he had seen the demonstration volley the british had flaunted from their high ridge but picard had always thought he was a lucky man and he had hoped that his good luck would serve to drive his column up the hill and through the thin british line but the column had been shattered and his conscripts instead of tasting victory were now more fearful than ever he drank from a brandy flask it was three oclock on christmas morning but he could not sleep the skies had cleared so that the christmas stars were bright but general picard felt nothing but gloom gudins doomed he said to his chief of staff major santon if we couldnt break those bastards what hope does he have none sir santon said i dont mind losing gudin picard said but why must we lose caillou now theres a soldier for you and if we lose caillou santon you know what else we lose the eagle sir the eagle picard said and flinched we will have lost one of the emperors eagles his eyes filled with tears i do not mind defeat santon he said untruthfully but i cannot bear the loss of an eagle it will be taken to london and flaunted in front of that fat prince and eagle of france gone to captivity santon said nothing for there was nothing to say to a soldier of france there was no shame like losing an eagle the birds might be nothing more than little bronze statuettes poised on a staff from which the tricolour flew but they had all been touched by the emperor and they were all sacred to france and in the dark hills above them an eagle was in desperate danger i can bear anything picard said except that then from above them all hell broke loose to the defeated french brigade in the deep valley it sounded like a battle to end the world true there was no artillery firing but the experienced soldiers claimed they had never heard musketry like it the volleys were unending and the crash of those musket blasts was magnified and multiplied by the valleys echoing walls they could hear faint screams and shouts and sometimes a bugle call but above it all and never ending the hammer sound of muskets there was volley after volley so many that after a while the sound became continuous a deep grinding sound like the creak of a hinge on the gate of hell we should go up and help picard said rising to his feet we cant sir santon insisted and he pointed up to the crest where a line of british soldiers still stood guard the moon was unsheathed from the clouds and any frenchman trying to climb the slope would be a sitting target for those riflemen gudin must fight on his own santon said and gudin must have been fighting for the musketry instead of fading grew in intensity picard reckoned it must be caillou who fought for surely poor old gudin could never fight a battle like this every now and then a brief glow showed in the sky betraying where a group of muskets flamed together and soon the heavy foulsmelling smoke spilled over the passs lip to drift down the slope and still the splintering volleys ground on up in the pass sharpe loaded his rifle he did it quickly trained to the intricate motions by a lifetime of soldiering and when the gun was loaded he raised it to his shoulder held the muzzle high into the sky and pulled its trigger faster he shouted faster and all around him redcoats and greenjackets peppered the sky they fired volley after volley at the stars and in between the volleys they whooped and screamed like demons i pity any poor angel up there tonight sir patrick harper said to captain dalembord hell lose a few wingfeathers so he will and then harper fired his volley gun at the moon and down in the valley the deafened french gasped thinking that at last the artillery was joining the fight faster sharpe shouted vite vite a group of french soldiers pulled their triggers scattering a volley towards the snow on the highest peaks daniel hagman walked calmly through the chaos and noise its a girl sir he shouted at colonel gudin a girl gudin said i thought on christmas day it might be a boy its a pretty little girl sir and shes just fine and so is her mother the women are looking after her and shell be ready to move in a while just a while sharpe had overheard the news and grinned at gudin a cold night to be born colonel but shell live sharpe theyll both live thats what matters sharpe fired his rifle at the stars i was thinking of the baby jesus colonel his birth must have been cold as hell gudin smiled i think palestine is a warm country sharpe like india i doubt the first christmas was cold at least he never joined the army sir he had more sense sharpe rammed another bullet in his rifle then walked down the boisterous line of soldiers redcoats and frenchmen were mixed together all of them firing like maniacs into the starbright sky faster sharpe shouted come on now faster youre celebrating christs birth make some effort vite vite it took a halfhour before maria and her newborn child could be laid in the wagon where they were cushioned with blankets and swathed in sheepskins the new baby had gifts a riflemans silver button a broken ivory boothook that a redcoat had lifted from the battlefield of vitoria and a golden guinea that was a present from peter dalembord when the mother and child were comfortable the wagon driver whipped his horses northward and all the spanish women and children whom gudin had tried so hard to save fell in behind the lumbering vehicle they climbed the gentle pass and the french troops who had been shooting at the stars fell in around them as the wagon passed a hundred frenchmen joined the women all of them from gudins garrison and their colonel was the very last man to join the procession here sir sharpe said and he stepped forward and offered colonel gudin the eagle gudin stared at the trophy are you sure sharpe sharpe grinned ive already captured one sir i dont need another gudin took the eagle then hugged sharpe and kissed him farewell after the war sharpe he said huskily i shall see you after the war i hope so sir i do hope so there was one last charade to mount the men guarding the frontier ridge fired their muskets then ran in pretended panic as gudins small procession approached and from the valley below general picard watched in amazement as a small group of frenchmen appeared at the ridges crest they were only a few men a mere handful less than a tenth of those he had expected but they had fought their way through they had even brought a wagon through and then picard saw a golden glint shine above the dark shapes who fired back at the ridge behind them and he raised his telescope and stared intently trying to track down the elusive gleam and suddenly there it was it was the eagle he could see its spread wings and its banded flag theyve brought the eagle picard shouted theyve saved the eagle and his defeated men began to cheer the firing in the high pass died slowly to leave a layer of gunsmoke lingering above the road the riflemen and redcoats grinned they had enjoyed the nonsense none had wanted to spend christmas in this high country that was so far from their beef and plumpudding but the expedition had turned into a game it was a pity about ensign nicholls of course but what had he expected everyone knew that mister sharpe was fatal for ensigns but at least mister nicholls was to be buried in france sharpe had insisted on that the boy had come to fight the french and for all eternity he would hold a tiny scrap of captured french soil but no one else had died no one else had even taken a wound and the regiment had turned back a whole french brigade while in the village under the guard of the grenadier company french prisoners waited to be marched back into spain and captivity but one hundred frenchmen went free one hundred frenchmen their women their children their colonel and an eagle they went free because sharpe to help an old friend had given that friend a victory and sharpe now watched gudins men go down the slope and he saw the men of the defeated brigade run up to greet them he heard the cheers and in the silver moonlight framed in the lens of his telescope he saw the brigade officers cluster around colonel gudin unlucky gudin who on christmas morning had saved an eagle and fought his way to freedom colonel jean gudin a hero at last do you think theyll ever find out that it was all faked harper asked whod ever believe it sharpe asked no one i suppose harper said and then after a pause a happy christmas to you sir and to you patrick i suppose itll be mutton for dinner i suppose it will well buy a few sheep and you can kill them not me sir you sir sharpe laughed and then turned south towards the village it was christmas morning a crisp clean new christmas morning and his men were alive an old friend was a hero and there would be mutton for dinner it was sharpes christmas
