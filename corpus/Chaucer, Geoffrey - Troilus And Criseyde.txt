owene brother dere now herkeneth with a gode entencioun for now wol i gon streight to my matere in whiche ye may the double sorwes here of troilus in loving of criseyde and how that she forsook him er she deyde it is wel wist how that the grekes stronge in armes with a thousand shippes wente to troyewardes and the citee longe assegeden neigh ten yeer er they stente and in diverse wyse and oon entente the ravisshing to wreken of eleyne by paris doon they wroughten al hir peyne now fil it so that in the toun ther was dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee a gret devyn that cleped was calkas that in science so expert was that he knew wel that troye sholde destroyed be by answere of his god that highte thus daun phebus or apollo delphicus so whan this calkas knew by calculinge and eek by answere of this appollo that grekes sholden swich a peple bringe thorugh which that troye moste been fordo he caste anoon out of the toun to go for wel wiste he by sort that troye sholde destroyed ben ye wolde whoso nolde for which for to departen softely took purpos ful this forknowinge wyse and to the grekes ost ful prively he stal anoon and they in curteys wyse hym deden bothe worship and servyse in trust that he hath conning hem to rede in every peril which that is to drede the noyse up roos whan it was first aspyed thorugh al the toun and generally was spoken that calkas traytor fled was and allyed with hem of grece and casten to ben wroken on him that falsly hadde his feith so broken and seyden he and al his kin at ones ben worthy for to brennen fel and bones now hadde calkas left in this meschaunce al unwist of this false and wikked dede his doughter which that was in gret penaunce for of hir lyf she was ful sore in drede as she that niste what was best to rede for bothe a widowe was she and allone of any freend to whom she dorste hir mone criseyde was this lady name aright as to my dome in al troyes citee nas noon so fair for passing every wight so aungellyk was hir natyf beautee that lyk a thing immortal semed she as doth an hevenish parfit creature that doun were sent in scorning of nature this lady which that alday herde at ere hir fadres shame his falsnesse and tresoun wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere in widewes habit large of samit broun on knees she fil biforn ector adoun with pitous voys and tendrely wepinge his mercy bad hirselven excusinge now was this ector pitous of nature and saw that she was sorwfully bigoon and that she was so fair a creature of his goodnesse he gladed hir anoon and seyde lat your fadres treson goon forth with mischaunce and ye yourself in ioye dwelleth with us whyl you good list in troye and al thonour that men may doon yow have as ferforth as your fader dwelled here ye shul han and your body shal men save as fer as i may ought enquere or here and she him thonked with ful humble chere and ofter wolde and it hadde ben his wille and took hir leve and hoom and held hir stille and in hir hous she abood with swich meynee as to hir honour nede was to holde and whyl she was dwellinge in that citee kepte hir estat and bothe of yonge and olde ful wel beloved and wel men of hir tolde but whether that she children hadde or noon i rede it naught therfore i late it goon the thinges fellen as they doon of werre bitwixen hem of troye and grekes ofte for som day boughten they of troye it derre and eft the grekes founden no thing softe the folk of troye and thus fortune onlofte and under eft gan hem to wheelen bothe after hir cours ay whyl they were wrothe but how this toun com to destruccioun ne falleth nought to purpos me to telle for it were a long digressioun fro my matere and yow to longe dwelle but the troyane gestes as they felle in omer or in dares or in dyte whoso that can may rede hem as they wryte but though that grekes hem of troye shetten and hir citee bisegede al aboute hir olde usage wolde they not letten as for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute but aldermost in honour out of doute they hadde a relik hight palladion that was hir trist aboven everichon and so bifel whan comen was the tyme of aperil whan clothed is the mede with newe grene of lusty ver the pryme and swote smellen floures whyte and rede in sondry wyses shewed as i rede the folk of troye hir observaunces olde palladiones feste for to holde and to the temple in al hir beste wyse in general ther wente many a wight to herknen of palladion servyse and namely so many a lusty knight so many a lady fresh and mayden bright ful wel arayed bothe moste and leste ye bothe for the seson and the feste among thise othere folk was criseyda in widewes habite blak but nathelees right as our firste lettre is now an a in beautee first so stood she makelees hir godly looking gladede al the prees nas never seyn thing to ben preysed derre nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre as was criseyde as folk seyde everichoon that hir behelden in hir blake wede and yet she stood ful lowe and stille alloon bihinden othere folk in litel brede and neigh the dore ay under shames drede simple of atyr and debonaire of chere with ful assured loking and manere this troilus as he was wont to gyde his yonge knightes ladde hem up and doun in thilke large temple on every syde biholding ay the ladyes of the toun now here now there for no devocioun hadde he to noon to reven him his reste but gan to preyse and lakken whom him leste and in his walk ful fast he gan to wayten if knight or squyer of his companye gan for to syke or lete his eyen bayten on any woman that he coude aspye he wolde smyle and holden it folye and seye him thus god wot she slepeth softe for love of thee whan thou tornest ful ofte i have herd told pardieux of your livinge ye lovers and your lewede observaunces and which a labour folk han in winninge of love and in the keping which doutaunces and whan your preye is lost wo and penaunces o verrey foles nyce and blinde be ye ther nis not oon can war by other be and with that word he gan cast up the browe ascaunces lo is this nought wysly spoken at which the god of love gan loken rowe right for despyt and shoop for to ben wroken he kidde anoon his bowe nas not broken for sodeynly he hit him at the fulle and yet as proud a pekok can he pulle o blinde world o blinde entencioun how ofte falleth al theffect contraire of surquidrye and foul presumpcioun for caught is proud and caught is debonaire this troilus is clomben on the staire and litel weneth that he moot descenden but alday falleth thing that foles ne wenden as proude bayard ginneth for to skippe out of the wey so priketh him his corn til he a lash have of the longe whippe than thenketh he though i praunce al biforn first in the trays ful fat and newe shorn yet am i but an hors and horses lawe i moot endure and with my feres drawe so ferde it by this fers and proude knight though he a worthy kinges sone were and wende nothing hadde had swiche might ayens his wil that sholde his herte stere yet with a look his herte wex afere that he that now was most in pryde above wex sodeynly most subget unto love forthy ensample taketh of this man ye wyse proude and worthy folkes alle to scornen love which that so sone can the freedom of your hertes to him thralle for ever it was and ever it shal bifalle that love is he that alle thing may binde for may no man fordo the lawe of kinde that this be sooth hath preved and doth yet for this trowe i ye knowen alle or some men reden not that folk han gretter wit than they that han be most with love ynome and strengest folk ben therwith overcome the worthiest and grettest of degree this was and is and yet men shal it see and trewelich it sit wel to be so for alderwysest han therwith ben plesed and they that han ben aldermost in wo with love han ben conforted most and esed and ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed and worthy folk maad worthier of name and causeth most to dreden vyce and shame now sith it may not goodly be withstonde and is a thing so vertuous in kinde refuseth not to love for to be bonde sin as himselven list he may yow binde the yerde is bet that bowen wole and winde than that that brest and therfor i yow rede to folwen him that so wel can yow lede but for to tellen forth in special as of this kinges sone of which i tolde and leten other thing collateral of him thenke i my tale for to holde both of his ioye and of his cares colde and al his werk as touching this matere for i it gan i wol therto refere withinne the temple he wente him forth pleyinge this troilus of every wight aboute on this lady and now on that lokinge wherso she were of toune or of withoute and upon cas bifel that thorugh a route his eye perced and so depe it wente til on criseyde it smoot and ther it stente and sodeynly he wax therwith astoned and gan hire bet biholde in thrifty wyse o mercy god thoughte he wher hastow woned that art so fair and goodly to devyse therwith his herte gan to sprede and ryse and softe sighed lest men mighte him here and caughte ayein his firste pleyinge chere she nas nat with the leste of hir stature but alle hir limes so wel answeringe weren to womanhode that creature was neuer lasse mannish in seminge and eek the pure wyse of here meninge shewede wel that men might in hir gesse honour estat and wommanly noblesse to troilus right wonder wel withalle gan for to lyke hir meninge and hir chere which somdel deynous was for she leet falle hir look a lite aside in swich manere ascaunces what may i not stonden here and after that hir loking gan she lighte that never thoughte him seen so good a sighte and of hir look in him ther gan to quiken so greet desir and swich affeccioun that in his herte botme gan to stiken of hir his fixe and depe impressioun and though he erst hadde poured up and doun he was tho glad his hornes in to shrinke unnethes wiste he how to loke or winke lo he that leet himselven so konninge and scorned hem that loves peynes dryen was ful unwar that love hadde his dwellinge withinne the subtile stremes of hir yen that sodeynly him thoughte he felte dyen right with hir look the spirit in his herte blissed be love that thus can folk converte she this in blak likinge to troylus over alle thyng he stood for to biholde ne his desir ne wherfor he stood thus he neither chere made ne worde tolde but from afer his maner for to holde on other thing his look somtyme he caste and eft on hir whyl that servyse laste and after this not fulliche al awhaped out of the temple al esiliche he wente repentinge him that he hadde ever yiaped of loves folk lest fully the descente of scorn fille on himself but what he mente lest it were wist on any maner syde his wo he gan dissimulen and hyde whan he was fro the temple thus departed he streyght anoon unto his paleys torneth right with hir look thurghshoten and thurghdarted al feyneth he in lust that he soiorneth and al his chere and speche also he borneth and ay of loves servants every whyle himself to wrye at hem he gan to smyle and seyde lord so ye live al in lest ye loveres for the conningest of yow that serveth most ententiflich and best him tit as often harm therof as prow your hyre is quit ayein ye god wot how nought wel for wel but scorn for good servyse in feith your ordre is ruled in good wyse in nouncerteyn ben alle your observaunces but it a sely fewe poyntes be ne nothing asketh so grete attendaunces as doth youre lay and that knowe alle ye but that is not the worste as mote i thee but tolde i yow the worste poynt i leve al seyde i sooth ye wolden at me greve but tak this that ye loveres ofte eschuwe or elles doon of good entencioun ful ofte thy lady wole it misconstrue and deme it harm in hir opinioun and yet if she for other enchesoun be wrooth than shalt thou han a groyn anoon lord wel is him that may be of yow oon but for al this whan that he say his tyme he held his pees non other bote him gayned for love bigan his fetheres so to lyme that wel unnethe unto his folk he fayned that othere besye nedes him destrayned for wo was him that what to doon he niste but bad his folk to goon wher that hem liste and whan that he in chaumbre was allone he doun upon his beddes feet him sette and first be gan to syke and eft to grone and thoughte ay on hir so withouten lette that as he sat and wook his spirit mette that he hir saw a temple and al the wyse right of hir loke and gan it newe avyse thus gan he make a mirour of his minde in which he saugh al hoolly hir figure and that he wel coude in his herte finde it was to him a right good aventure to love swich oon and if he dide his cure to serven hir yet mighte he falle in grace or elles for oon of hir servaunts pace imagininge that travaille nor grame ne mighte for so goodly oon be lorn as she ne him for his desir ne shame al were it wist but in prys and upborn of alle lovers wel more than biforn thus argumented he in his ginninge ful unavysed of his wo cominge thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe and thoughte he wolde werken prively first to hyden his desir in muwe from every wight yborn aloutrely but he mighte ought recovered be therby remembring him that love to wyde yblowe yelt bittre fruyt though swete seed be sowe and over al this yet muchel more he thoughte what for to speke and what to holden inne and what to arten hir to love he soughte and on a song anoonright to biginne and gan loude on his sorwe for to winne for with good hope he gan fully assente criseyde for to love and nought repente and of his song nought only the sentence as writ myn autour called lollius but pleynly save our tonges difference i dar wel sayn in al that troilus seyde in his song lo every word right thus as i shal seyn and whoso list it here lo next this vers he may it finden here cantus troili if no love is o god what fele i so and if love is what thing and whiche is he if love be good from whennes comth my wo if it be wikke a wonder thinketh me whenne every torment and adversitee that cometh of him may to me savory thinke for ay thurst i the more that i it drinke and if that at myn owene lust i brenne fro whennes cometh my wailing and my pleynte if harme agree me wherto pleyne i thenne i noot ne why unwery that i feynte o quike deeth o swete harm so queynte how may of thee in me swich quantitee butif that i consente that it be and if that i consente i wrongfully compleyne ywis thus possed to and fro al sterelees with inne a boot am i amid the see bytwixen windes two that in contrarie stonden evermo allas what is this wonder maladye for hete of cold for cold of hete i deye and to the god of love thus seyde he with pitous voys o lord now youres is my spirit which that oughte youres be yow thanke i lord that han me brought to this but whether goddesse or womman ywis she be i noot which that ye do me serve but as hir man i wole ay live and sterve ye stonden in hire eyen mightily as in a place unto youre vertu digne wherfore lord if my servyse or i may lyke yow so beth to me benigne for myn estat royal here i resigne into hir hond and with ful humble chere bicome hir man as to my lady dere in him ne deyned sparen blood royal the fyr of love wherfro god me blesse ne him forbar in no degree for al his vertu or his excellent prowesse but held him as his thral lowe in distresse and brende him so in sondry wyse ay newe that sixty tyme a day he loste his hewe so muche day by day his owene thought for lust to hir gan quiken and encrese that every other charge he sette at nought forthy ful ofte his hote fyr to cese to seen hir goodly look he gan to prese for therby to ben esed wel he wende and ay the ner he was the more he brende for ay the ner the fyr the hotter is this trowe i knoweth al this companye but were he fer or neer i dar seye this by night or day for wisdom or folye his herte which that is his brestes ye was ay on hir that fairer was to sene than ever were eleyne or polixene eek of the day ther passed nought an houre that to himself a thousand tyme he seyde good goodly to whom serve i and laboure as i best can now wolde god criseyde ye wolden on me rewe er that i deyde my dere herte allas myn hele and hewe and lyf is lost but ye wole on me rewe alle othere dredes weren from him fledde both of the assege and his savacioun ne in him desyr noon othere fownes bredde but argumentes to his conclusioun that she on him wolde han compassioun and he to be hir man whyl he may dure lo here his lyf and from the deeth his cure the sharpe shoures felle of armes preve that ector or his othere bretheren diden ne made him only therfore ones meve and yet was he wherso men wente or riden founde oon the beste and lengest tyme abiden ther peril was and dide eek such travayle in armes that to thenke it was mervayle but for non hate he to the grekes hadde ne also for the rescous of the toun ne made him thus in armes for to madde but only lo for this conclusioun to lyken hir the bet for his renoun fro day to day in armes so he spedde that alle the grekes as the deeth him dredde and fro this forth tho refte him love his sleep and made his mete his foo and eek his sorwe gan multiplye that whoso toke keep it shewed in his hewe bothe eve and morwe therfor a title he gan him for to borwe of other syknesse lest of him men wende that the hote fyr of love him brende and seyde he hadde a fever and ferde amis but how it was certayn can i not seye if that his lady understood not this or feyned hir she niste oon of the tweye but wel i rede that by no maner weye ne semed it as that she of him roughte nor of his peyne or whatsoever he thoughte but than fel to this troylus such wo that he was wel neigh wood for ay his drede was this that she som wight had loved so that never of him she wolde have taken hede for whiche him thoughte he felte his herte blede ne of his wo ne dorste he not biginne to tellen it for al this world to winne but whanne he hadde a space fro his care thus to himself ful ofte he gan to pleyne he sayde o fool now art thou in the snare that whilom iapedest at loves peyne now artow hent now gnaw thyn owene cheyne thou were ay wont eche lovere reprehende of thing fro which thou canst thee nat defende what wol now every lover seyn of thee if this be wist but ever in thyn absence laughen in scorn and seyn lo ther gooth he that is the man of so gret sapience that held us lovers leest in reverence now thonked be god he may goon in the daunce of hem that love list febly for to avaunce but o thou woful troilus god wolde sin thou most loven thurgh thi destinee that thow beset were on swich oon that sholde knowe al thy wo al lakkede hir pitee but al so cold in love towardes thee thy lady is as frost in winter mone and thou fordoon as snow in fyr is sone god wolde i were aryved in the port of deth to which my sorwe wil me lede a lord to me it were a gret comfort than were i quit of languisshing in drede for by myn hidde sorwe yblowe on brede i shal biiaped been a thousand tyme more than that fool of whos folye men ryme but now help god and ye swete for whom i pleyne ycaught ye never wight so faste o mercy dere herte and help me from the deeth for i whyl that my lyf may laste more than myself wol love yow to my

til neigh that he in salte teres dreynte al was for nought she herde nought his pleynte and whan that he bithoughte on that folye a thousand fold his wo gan multiplye biwayling in his chambre thus allone a freend of his that called was pandare com ones in unwar and herde him grone and say his freend in swich distresse and care allas quod he who causeth al this fare o mercy god what unhap may this mene han now thus sone grekes maad yow lene or hastow som remors of conscience and art now falle in som devocioun and waylest for thy sinne and thyn offence and hast for ferde caught attricioun god save hem that biseged han our toun and so can leye our iolyte on presse and bring our lusty folk to holinesse these wordes seyde he for the nones alle that with swich thing he mighte him angry maken and with an angre don his sorwe falle as for the tyme and his corage awaken but wel he wist as fer as tonges spaken ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse than he ne more desired worthinesse what cas quod troilus or what aventure hath gyded thee to see my languisshinge that am refus of euery creature but for the love of god at my preyinge go henne away for certes my deyinge wol thee disese and

armed save his heed ful richely and wounded was his hors and gan to blede on whiche he rood a pas ful softely but swych a knightly sighte trewely as was on him was nought withouten faile to loke on mars that god is of batayle so lyk a man of armes and a knight he was to seen fulfild of heigh prowesse for bothe he hadde a body and a might to doon that thing as wel as hardinesse and eek to seen him in his gere him dresse so fresh so yong so weldy semed he it was an heven upon him for to see his helm tohewen was in twenty places that by a tissew heng his bak bihinde his sheld todasshed was with swerdes and maces in which men mighte many an arwe finde that thirled hadde horn and nerf and rinde and ay the peple cryde here cometh our ioye and next his brother holdere up of troye for which

that troilus persone she knew by sighte and eek his gentillesse and thus she seyde al were it nought to done to graunte him love yet for his worthinesse it were honour with pley and with gladnesse in honestee with swich a lord to dele for myn estat and also for his hele eek wel wot i my kinges sone is he and sith he hath to see me swich delyt if i wolde utterly his sighte flee peraunter he mighte

forbede dronkenesse he nought forbet that every creature be drinkelees for alwey as i gesse eek sith i woot for me is his distresse i ne oughte not for that thing him despyse sith it is so he meneth

wol ye wel biginne now doth him sitte gode nece dere upon your beddes syde al there withinne that ech of yow the bet may other here and with that word he drow him to the fere and took a light and fond his contenaunce as for to loke upon an old romaunce criseyde that was troilus lady right and cleer stood on a ground of sikernesse al thoughte she hir servaunt and hir knight ne sholde of right non untrouthe in hir gesse yet nathelees considered his distresse and that love is in cause of swich folye thus to him spak she of his ialousye lo herte myn as wolde the excellence of love ayeins the which that no man may ne oughte eek goodly maken resistence and eek bycause i felte wel and say youre grete trouthe and servyse every day and that your herte al myn was sooth to seyne this droof me for to rewe upon your peyne and your goodnesse have i founde alwey yit of whiche my dere herte and al my knight i thonke it yow as fer as i have wit al can i nought as muche as it were right and i emforth my conninge and my might have and ay shal how sore that me smerte ben to yow trewe and hool with a myn herte and dredelees that shal be founde at preve but herte myn what al this is to seyne shal wel be told so that ye noght yow greve though i to yow right on yourself compleyne for therwith mene i fynally the peyne that halt your herte and myn in hevinesse fully to sleen and every wrong

ye ialousye is love and wolde a busshel venim al excusen for that o greyn of love is on it shove but that wot heighe god that sit above if it be lyker love or hate or grame and after that it oughte bere his name but certeyn is som maner ialousye is excusable more than som ywis as whan cause is and som swich fantasye with pietee so wel repressed is that it unnethe dooth or seyth amis but goodly drinketh up al his distresse and that excuse i for the gentilesse and som so ful of furie is and despyt that it sourmounteth his repressioun but herte myn ye be not in that plyt that thanke i god for

the sighte of troilus and sorowfully she sighte and thilke foles sittinge hir aboute wenden that she wepte and syked sore bycause that she sholde out of that route departe and never pleye with hem

right swich to seen in hir visage as is that wight that men on bere binde hir face lyk of paradys the image was al ychaunged in another kinde the pleye the laughtre men was wont to finde on hir and eek hir ioyes everychone ben fled and thus lyth now criseyde allone aboute hir eyen two a purpre ring bitrent in sothfast tokninge of hir peyne that to biholde it was a dedly thing for which pandare mighte not restreyne the teres from his eyen for to reyne but nathelees as he best mighte he seyde from troilus thise wordes to criseyde lo nece i trowe ye han herd al how the king with othere lordes for the beste hath mad eschaunge of antenor and yow that cause is of this sorwe and this unreste but how this cas doth troilus moleste that may non erthely mannes tonge seye for verray wo his wit is al aweye for which we han so sorwed he and i that into litel bothe it hadde us slawe but thurgh my conseil this day fynally he somwhat is fro weping now withdrawe and semeth me that he desyreth fawe with yow to been al night for to devyse remede in this if ther were any wyse this short and pleyne theffect of my message as ferforth as my wit can comprehende for ye that been of torment in swich rage may to no long prologe as now entende and herupon ye may answere him sende and for the love of god my nece dere so leef this wo er troilus be here gret is my wo quod she and sighte sore as she that feleth dedly sharp distresse but yet to me his sorwe is muchel more that love him bet than he himself i gesse allas for me hath he swich hevinesse can he for me so pitously compleyne ywis his

pandarus allas why do ye so syn wel ye woot the tyme is faste by that he shal come arys up hastely that he yow nat biwopen thus ne finde but ye wol have him wood out of his minde for wiste he that ye ferde in this manere he wolde himselve slee and if i wende to han this fare he sholde not come here for al the good that pryam may despende for to what fyn he wolde anoon pretende that knowe i wel and forthy yet i seye so leef this sorwe or platly he wol deye and shapeth yow his sorwe for to abregge and nought encresse leve nece swete beth rather to him cause of flat than egge and with som wysdom

bothe of oon assent so shapeth how distourbe your goinge or come ayen sone after ye be went wommen ben wyse in short avysement and lat sen how your wit shal now avayle and what that i may helpe it shal not fayle go quod criseyde and uncle trewely i shal don al my might me to restreyne from weping in his sighte and bisily him for to glade i shal don al my peyne and in myn herte seken every veyne if to this soor ther may be founden salve it shal not lakken certain on myn halve goth pandarus and troilus he soughte til in a temple he fond him allone as he that of his lyf no lenger roughte but to the pitouse goddes everichone ful tendrely he preyde and made his mone to doon him sone out of this world to pace for wel he thoughte ther was non other grace and shortly al the sothe for to seye he was so fallen in despeyr that day that outrely he shoop him for to deye for right thus was his argument alwey he seyde he nas but loren waylawey for al that comth comth by necessitee thus to be lorn it is my destinee for certaynly this wot i wel he seyde that forsight of divyne purveyaunce hath seyn alwey me to forgon criseyde sin god seeth every thing out of doutaunce and hem disponeth thourgh his ordenaunce in hir merytes sothly for to be as they shul comen by predestinee but nathelees allas whom shal i leve for ther ben grete clerkes many oon that destinee thorugh argumentes preve and som men seyn that nedely ther is noon but that free chois is yeven us everichoon o welaway so sleye arn clerkes olde that i not whos opinion i may holde for som men seyn if god seth al biforn ne god may not deceyved ben pardee than moot it fallen though men hadde it sworn that purveyaunce hath seyn bifore to be wherfor i seye that from eterne if he hath wist biforn our thought eek as our dede we have no free chois as these clerkes rede for other thought nor other dede also might never be but swich as purveyaunce which may not ben deceyved nevermo hath feled biforn withouten ignoraunce for if ther mighte been a variaunce to wrythen out fro goddes purveyinge ther nere no prescience of thing cominge but it were rather an opinioun uncerteyn and no stedfast forseinge and certes that were an abusioun that god shuld han no parfit cleer witinge more than we men that han doutous weninge but swich an errour upon god to gesse were fals and foul and wikked corsednesse eek this is an opinioun of somme that han hir top ful heighe and smothe yshore they seyn right thus that thing is not to come for that the prescience hath seyn bifore that it shal come but they seyn that therfore that it shal come therfore the purveyaunce wot it biforn withouten ignoraunce and in this manere this necessitee retorneth in his part contrarie agayn for needfully bihoveth it not to be that thilke thinges fallen in certayn that ben purveyed but nedely as they seyn bihoveth it that thinges whiche that falle that they in certayn ben purveyed alle i mene as though i laboured me in this to enqueren which thing cause of which thing be as whether that the prescience of god is the certayn cause of the necessitee of thinges that to comen been pardee or if necessitee of thing cominge be cause certeyn of the purveyinge but now ne enforce i me nat in shewinge how the ordre of causes stant but wel wot i that it bihoveth that the bifallinge of thinges wist biforen certeynly be necessarie al seme it not therby that prescience put falling necessaire to thing to come al falle it foule or faire for if ther sit a man yond on a see than by necessitee bihoveth it that certes thyn opinioun soth be that wenest or coniectest that he sit and fertherover now ayenward yit lo right so it is of the part contrarie as thus i seye that if the opinioun of thee be sooth for that he sit than seye i this that he mot sitten by necessitee and thus necessitee in either is for in him nede of sittinge is ywis and in thee nede of sooth and thus forsothe ther moot necessitee ben in yow bothe but thou mayst seyn the man sit not therfore that thyn opinioun of sitting soth is but rather for the man sit ther bifore therfore is thyn opinioun sooth ywis and i seye though the cause of sooth of this comth of his sitting yet necessitee is entrechaunged bothe in him and thee thus on this same wyse out of doutaunce i may wel maken as it semeth me my resoninge of goddes purveyaunce and of the thinges that to comen be by whiche reson men may wel ysee that thilke thinges that in erthe falle that by necessitee they comen alle for although that for thing shal come ywis therfore is it purveyed certaynly nat that it comth for it purveyed is yet nathelees bihoveth it nedfully that thing to come be purveyed trewely or elles thinges that purveyed be that they bityden by necessitee and this suffyseth right ynow certeyn for to destroye our free chois every del but now is this abusion to seyn that fallinge of the thinges temporel is cause of goddes prescience eternel now trewely that is a fals sentence that thing to come sholde cause his prescience what mighte i wene and i hadde swich a thought but that god purveyth thing that is to come for that it is to come and elles nought so mighte i wene that thinges alle and some that whylom been bifalle and overcome ben cause of thilke sovereyn purveyaunce that forwot al withouten ignoraunce and over al this yet seye i more herto that right as whan i woot ther is a thing ywis that thing mot nedefully be so eek right so whan i woot a thing coming so mot it come and thus the bifalling of thinges that ben wist bifore the tyde they mowe not been eschewed on no syde than seyde he thus almighty iove in trone that wost of al this thing the soothfastnesse rewe on my sorwe or do me deye sone or bring criseyde and me fro this distresse and whyl he was in al this hevinesse disputinge with himself in this matere com pandare in and seyde as ye may here o mighty god quod pandarus in trone ey who seigh ever a wys man faren so why troilus what thenkestow to done hastow swich lust to been thyn owene fo what parde yet is not criseyde ago why list thee so thyself fordoon for drede that in thyn heed thyn eyen semen dede hastow not lived many a yeer biforn withouten hir and ferd ful wel at ese artow for hir and for non other born hath kinde thee wroughte alonly hir to plese lat be and thenk right thus in thy disese that in the dees right as ther fallen chaunces right so in love ther come and goon plesaunces and yet this is a wonder most of alle why thou thus sorwest sin thou nost not yit touching hir goinge how that it shal falle ne if she can hirself distorben it thou hast not yet assayed al hir wit a man may al by tyme his nekke bede whan it shal of and sorwen at the nede forthy take hede of that that i shal seye i have with hir yspoke and longe ybe so as accorded was bitwixe us tweye and evermor me thinketh thus that she hath somwhat in hir hertes prevetee wherwith she can if i shal right arede distorbe al this of which thou art in drede for which my counseil is whan it is night thou to hir go and make of this an ende and blisful iuno thourgh hir grete mighte shal as i hope hir grace unto us sende myn herte seyth certeyn she shal not wende and forthy put thyn herte a whyle in reste and hold this purpos for it is the beste this troilus answerde and sighte sore thou seyst right wel and i wil do right so and what him liste he seyde unto it more and whan that it was tyme for to go ful prevely himself withouten mo unto hir com as he was wont to done and how they wroughte i shal yow telle sone soth is that whan they gonne first to mete so gan the peyne hir hertes for to twiste that neither of hem other mighte grete but hem in armes toke and after kiste the lasse wofulle of hem bothe niste wher that he was ne mighte o word outbringe as i seyde erst for wo and for sobbinge tho woful teres that they leten falle as bittre weren out of teres kinde for peyne as is ligne aloes or galle so bittre teres weep nought as i finde the woful myrra through the bark and rinde that in this world ther nis so hard an herte that nolde han rewed on hir peynes smerte but whan hir woful wery gostes tweyne retorned been theras hem oughte dwelle and that somwhat to wayken gan the peyne by lengthe of pleynte and ebben gan the welle of hire teres and the herte unswelle with broken voys al hoors forshright criseyde to troilus thise ilke wordes seyde o iove i deye and mercy i beseche help troilus and therwithal hir face upon his brest she leyde and loste speche hir woful spirit from his propre place right with the word alwey up poynt to pace and thus she lyth with hewes pale and grene that whylom fresh and fairest was to sene this troilus that on hir gan biholde clepinge hir name and she lay as for deed withoute answere and felte hir limes colde hir eyen throwen upward to hir heed this sorwful man can now noon other reed but ofte tyme hir colde mouth he kiste wher him was wo god and himself it wiste he rist him up and long streight he hir leyde for signe of lyf for ought he can or may can he noon finde in nothing on criseyde for which his song ful ofte is weylaway but whan he saugh that specheles she lay with sorwful voys and herte of blisse al bare he seyde how she was fro this world yfare so after that he longe hadde hir compleyned his hondes wrong and seyde that was to seye and with his teres salte hir brest bireyned he gan tho teris wypen of ful dreye and pitously gan for the soule preye and seyde o lord that set art in thy trone rewe eek on me for i shal folwe hir sone she cold was and withouten sentement for aught he woot for breeth ne felte he noon and this was him a preignant argument that she was forth out of this world agoon and whan he seigh ther was non other woon he gan hir limes dresse in swich manere as men don hem that shul be leyd on bere and after this with sterne and cruel herte his swerd anoon out of his shethe he twighte himself to sleen how sore that him smerte so that his sowle hir sowle folwen mighte theras the doom of mynos wolde it dighte sin love and cruel fortune it ne wolde that in this world he lenger liven sholde thanne seyde he thus fulfild of heigh desdayn o cruel iove and

ylived hadde i hadde been er this of calidoine and arge a king criseyde and so hope i that i shal yet ywis but he was slayn allas the more harm is unhappily at thebes al to rathe polymites and many a
