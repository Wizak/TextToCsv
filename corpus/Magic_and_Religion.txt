martyrdom of dasius c the ride of the beardless one index i science and superstition we all know what we mean by science science is organised common sense her aim is the acquisition of reasoned and orderly knowledge presented with a collection of verified facts it is the part of science to reduce them to order and to account for their existence in accordance with her recognised theory of things if the facts cannot be fitted into the theory it must be expanded or altered for we must admit that if the facts are verified there is need for change and expansion in the theory the colligation of facts demands hypotheses and these may not at the moment of their construction be verifiable the deflections of a planet from its apparently normal course may be accounted for by the hypothesis of the attraction of another heavenly body not yet discovered the hypothesis is legitimate for such bodies are known to exist and to produce such effects when the body is discovered the hypothesis becomes a certainty on the other hand the hypothesis that some capricious and conscious agency pushed the planet into deflections would be illegitimate for the existence of such a freakish agency is not demonstrated our hypotheses then must be consistent with our actual knowledge of nature and of human nature and our conjectured causes must be adequate to the production of the effects thus science gradually acquires and organises new regions of knowledge superstition is a word of much less definite meaning when we call a man superstitious we usually mean that evidence which satisfies him does not satisfy us we see examples daily of the dependence of belief on bias one man believes a story about cruelties committed by our adversaries another disbelieving the tale credits a narrative about the misconduct of our own party probably the evidence in neither case would satisfy the historian or be accepted by a jury a man in a tavern tells another how the boers retreating from a position buried their own wounded i dont believe that says the other then you are a proboer the sceptic reasoned from his general knowledge of human nature the believer reasoned from his own prejudiced and mythopoeic conception of people whom he disliked if the question had been one of religion the believer might be called superstitious the sceptic might be called scientific if he was ready to yield his doubts to the evidence of capable observers of the alleged fact superstition like science has her hypotheses and like science she reasons from experience but her experience is usually fantastic unreal or if real capable of explanation by causes other than those alleged by superstition a man comes in at night and says he has seen a ghost in white that is merely his hypothesis the existence of ghosts in white is not demonstrated you accompany him to the scene of the experience and prove to him that he has seen a post not a ghost his experience was real but was misinterpreted by dint of an hypothesis resting on no demonstrated fact of knowledge the hypotheses of superstition are familiar thus an event has happened say you have lost your buttonhook you presently hear of a death in your family ever afterwards you go anxiously about when you have lost a buttonhook you are confusing a casual sequence of facts with a causal connection of facts sequence in time is mistaken for sequence of what we commonly style cause and effect in the same way superstition cherishes the hypothesis that like affects like thus the sun is round and a ball of clay is round therefore if an australian native wishes to delay the course of the round sun in the heavens he fixes a round ball of clay on the bough of a tree or so books on anthropology tell us acting on the hypothesis that like affects like a man makes a clay or waxen image of an enemy and sticks it full of pins or thorns he expects his enemy to suffer agony in consequence and so powerful is suggestion that if the enemy knows about the image he sometimes falls ill and dies this experience corroborates the superstitious hypothesis and so the experiment with the image is of worldwide diffusion everything is done or attempted on these lines by superstition men imitate the killing of foes or game and expect as a result to kill them in war or in the chase they mimic the gathering of clouds and the fall of rain and expect rain to fall in consequence they imitate the evolution of an edible grub from the larva and expect grubs to multiply and so on all this is quite rational if you grant the hypotheses of superstition her practices are magic we are later to discuss a theory that men had magic before they had religion and only invented gods because they found that magic did not work still later they invented science which is only magic with a legitimate hypothesis using real not fanciful experience in the long run magic and religion are to die out perhaps and science is to have the whole field to herself this may be a glorious though a remote prospect but surely it is above all things needful that our science should be scientific she must not blink facts merely because they do not fit into her scheme or hypothesis of the nature of things or of religion she really must give as much prominence to the evidence which contradicts as to that which supports her theory in each instance not only must she not shut her eyes to this evidence but she must diligently search for it must seek for what bacon calls instantice contradictorim since if these exist the theory which ignores them is useless if she advances an hypothesis it must not be contradictory of the whole mass of human experience if science finds that her hypothesis contradicts experience she must seek for an hypothesis which is in accordance with experience and if that cannot be found she must wait till it is found again science must not pile one unverified hypothesis upon another unverified hypothesis till her edifice rivals the tower of babel she must not make a conjecture on p and on p treat the conjecture as a fact because if one storey in the cardcastle is destroyed by being proved impossible all the other storeys will come tumbling after it seems hardly necessary but it is not superfluous to add that in her castle of hypotheses one must not contradict and therefore destroy another we must not be asked to believe that an event occurred at one date and also that it occurred at another or that an institution was both borrowed by a people at one period and was also possessed unborrowed by the same people at an earlier period we cannot permit science to assure us that a certain fact was well known and that the knowledge produced important consequences while we are no less solemnly told that the fact was wholly unknown whence it would seem that the results alleged to spring from the knowledge could not be produced this kind of reasoning with its inferring of inferences from other inferences themselves inferred from conjectures as to the existence of facts of which no proof is adduced must be called superstitious rather than scientific the results may be interesting but they are the reverse of science it is perhaps chiefly in the nascent science of the anthropological study of institutions and above all of religion that this kind of reasoning prevails the topic attracts ingenious and curious minds system after system has been constructed unstinted in material elegant in aspect has been launched and has been wrecked or been drifted by the careless winds to the forlorn shore where bryants ark with all its crew divine or human lies in decay no mortal student believes in the arkite system of bryant though his ark on the matchboxes of messrs bryant and may perhaps denotes loyalty to the ancestral idea the world of modern readers has watched sun myths and dawn myths and storm myths and wind myths come in and go out autant en emporte le vent totems and taboos succeeded and we are bewildered by the contending theories of the origins of taboos and totems deities of vegetation now are all in all and may it be far from us to say that any one from ouranos to pan from the persian king to the horses of virbius is not a spirit of vegetable life yet perhaps the deity has higher aspects and nobler functions than the pursuit of his vapid vegetable loves and these deserve occasional attention the result however of scurrying hypotheses and hasty generalisations is that the nascent science of religious origins is received with distrust we may review the brief history of the modern science some twenty years ago when the principles of sociology by mr herbert spencer was first published the book was reviewed in mind by the author of primitive culture that work again was published in in appeared the golden bough by mr j g frazer and the second edition of the book with changes and much new matter was given to the world in here then we have a whole generation a space of thirty years during which english philosophers or scholars have been studying the science of the origins of religion in the latest edition of the golden bough mr frazer has even penetrated into the remote region where man neither had nor wanted any religion at all we naturally ask ourselves to what point we have arrived after the labours of a generation twenty years ago when reviewing mr spencer mr tylor said that a time of great public excitement as to these topics was at hand the clamour and contest aroused by mr darwins theory of the origin of species and the descent of man would be outdone by the coming war over the question of the evolution of religion but there has been no general excitement there has been little display of public interest in these questions they have been left to the curious and the learned classes not absolutely identical mr frazer indeed assures us that the comparative study of human beliefs and institutions is fitted to be much more than a means of satisfying an enlightened curiosity and of furnishing materials for the researches of the learned but enlightened curiosity seems to be easily satisfied and only very few of the learned concern themselves with these researches which mr tylor expected to be so generally exciting a member of the university of oxford informed me that the study of beliefs and of anthropology in general is almost entirely neglected by the undergraduates and when i asked him why he replied there is no money in it another said that anthropology had no evidence in the language of the economists there is no supply provided at oxford because there is no demand classics philology history physical science and even literature are studied because there is money in them not much money indeed but a competence if the student is successful for the study of the evolution of beliefs there is no demand or very little yet says mr frazer well handled it may become a powerful instrument to expedite progress if it lays bare certain weak spots in the foundations on which modern society is built we all desire progress in the right direction we all pine to lay bare weak spots and yet we do not seem to be concerned about the services which might be done for progress by the study of the evolution of religion it is indeed a melancholy and in some respects thankless task says mr frazer to strike at the foundations of beliefs in which as in a strong tower the hopes and aspirations of humanity through long ages have sought a refuge from the storm and stress of life thankless indeed these operations are yet sooner or later mr frazer adds it is inevitable that the battery of the comparative method shouldbreach these venerable walls mantled over with the ivy and mosses and wild flowers of a thousand tender and sacred associations at present we are only dragging the guns into position they have hardly yet begun to speak mr frazer is too modest he has dragged into position a work of immense learning and eloquent style in three siege guns we may say three volumes of the largest calibre and they have spoken about words no man to continue the metaphor is better supplied than he with the ammunition of learning with the knowledge of facts of every kind yet the venerable walls with their pleasing growth of ivy mosses wild flowers and other mural vegetation do not to myself seem in the least degree impaired by the artillery and i try to show cause for my opinion why is this and why is the portion of the public which lives within or without the venerable walls mainly indifferent several sufficient reasons might be given in the first place many people have or think they have so many other grounds for disbelief that additional grounds provided by the comparative method are regarded rather as a luxury than as supplying a felt want again but very few persons have leisure or inclination or power of mind enough to follow an elaborate argument through fifteen hundred pages not to speak of other works on the same theme once more only a minute minority are capable of testing and weighing the evidence and criticising the tangled hypotheses on which the argument rests or in which it is involved but there is another and perhaps a sounder argument for indifference the learned are aware that the evidence for all these speculations is not of the nature to which they are accustomed either in historical or scientific studies more and more the age insists on strictness in appreciating evidence and on economy in conjecture but the study of the evolution of myth and belief has always been and still is marked by an extraordinary use or abuse of conjecture the perhapses the we may supposes the we must infers are countless as in too much of the socalled higher criticism hypothesis is piled by many anthropologists upon hypothesis guess upon guess while if only one guess is wrong the main argument falls to pieces moreover it is the easiest thing in certain cases to explain the alleged facts by a counter hypothesis not a complex hypothesis but at least as plausible as the many combined conjectures of the castle architects though perhaps as far from the truth and as incapable of verification of these statements examples shall be given in the course of this book we are all we who work at these topics engaged in science the science of man or rather we are painfully labouring to lay the foundations of that science we are all trying i to expedite progress but our science cannot expedite progress if our science is not scientific we must therefore however pedantic our process may seem keep insisting on the rejection of all evidence which is not valid on the sparing use of conjecture and on the futility of piling up hypothesis upon unproved hypothesis to me it seems as i have already said that a legitimate hypothesis must colligate the facts that it must do so more successfully than any counter hypothesis and that it must for every link in its chain have evidence which will stand the tests of criticism but the chief cause of indifference is the character of our evidence we can find anything we want to find people say not only the man in the street but the learned say among reports of the doings of savage and barbarous races we find what we want and to what we do not want we are often blind for example nothing in savage religion is better vouched for than the belief in a being whom narrators of every sort call a creator who holds all in his power i take the first instance of this kind that comes to hand in opening mr tylors primitive culture the being is he whom the natives of canada call andouagni without however having any form or method of prayer to him the date of this evidence is it is obvious that andouagni to take one case out of a multitude was not invented in the despair of magic mysticism has been called the despair of philosophy and mr frazer as we shall see regards religion as the despair of magic by his theory man originally without religion and trusting in magic found by experience that magic could not really control the weather and the food supply man therefore dreamed that there were other beings like himself but far stronger who unseen controlled what his magic could not control to these mighty beings man now addressed himself beseeching them of their mercy to furnish him with all good things but nobody beseeched andouagni to do anything the canadians had no method or form of prayer to him therefore andouagni was not invented because magic failed and therefore this great power was dreamed of and his mercy was beseeched with prayers for good things that was not the process by which andouagni was evolved because nobody prayed to him in nor have we reason to believe that any one ever did from every part of the globe but chiefly from among very low savage and barbaric races the existence of beings powerful as andouagni but like him not addressed in prayer or but seldom so addressed is reported by travellers of many ages races creeds and professions the existence of the belief in such beings often not approached by prayer or sacrifice is fatal to several modern theories of the origin and evolution of religion but these facts resting on the best evidence which anthropology can offer and corroborated by the undesigned coincidence of testimony from every quarter are not what most students in this science want to find therefore these facts have been ignored or hastily slurred over or the beliefs are ascribed to european or islamite influence yet first christians or islamites with the god they introduced would introduce prayer to him and prayer in many cases there is none next in the case of andouagni what missionary influence could exist in canada before thirdly if missionaries amateur or professional there were in canada before they would be catholics and would introduce not a creator never addressed in prayer but crosses beads the madonna the saints and such catholic rites as would leave material traces in spite of all these obvious considerations i am unacquainted with any book on this phase of savage religion and scarcely know any book except mr tylors primitive culture in which the facts are prominently stated the evidence for the facts let me repeat is of the best character that anthropology can supply for it rests on testimony undesignedly coincident given from most parts of the world by men of every kind of education creed and bias contradictory evidence the denial of the existence of the beliefs is also abundant to such eternal contradictions of testimony anthropology must make up her mind we can only test and examine in each instance the bias of the witness if he has a bias and his opportunities of acquiring knowledge if the belief does exist it can seldom attest itself or never by material objects such as idols altars sacrifices and the sound of prayers for a being like andouagni is not prayed to or propitiated one proof that he is not of christian introduction we have thus little but the reports of europeans intimately acquainted with the peoples savage or barbaric and if possible with their language to serve as a proof of the existence of the savage belief in a supreme being a maker or creator of things this fact warns us to be cautious but occasionally we have such evidence as is supplied by europeans initiated into the mysteries of savage religion our best proof however of the existence of this exalted usually neglected belief is the coincidence of testimony from that of the companions of columbus and the earliest traders visiting america to that of mr a w howitt a mystes of the australian eleusinia or of the latest travellers among the fangs the remote masai and other scarcely contaminated races if we can raise at least a case for consideration in favour of this nonutilitarian belief in a deity not approached with prayer or sacrifice we also raise a presumption against the theory that gods were invented in the despair of magic as powers out of whom something useful could be got powers with good things in their gift things which men were ceasing to believe that they could obtain by their own magical machinery the strong primal gods unvexed by prayer were not invented as recipients of prayer to ignore this chapter of early religion to dismiss it as a tissue of borrowed ideas though its existence is attested by the first europeans on the spot and its originality is vouched for by the very absence of prayer and by observers like mr a w howitt miss kingsley and sir a b ellis who proposed but withdrew a theory of loangods is not scientific my own early readings in early religion did not bring rue acquainted with this chapter in the book of beliefs when i first noticed an example of it in the reports of the benedictine mission at nursia in australia i conceived that some mistake had been made in by the missionary who sent in the report but later when i began to notice the coincidence of testimony from many quarters in many ages then i could not conceal from myself that this chapter must be read it is in conflict with our prevalent theories of the development of gods out of worshipped ancestral spirits for the maker of things not approached in prayer as a rule is said to exist where ancestral spirits are not reported to be worshipped but science in other fields specially studies exceptional cases and contradictory instances and all that seems out of accord with her theory in this case science has glanced at what goes contrary to her theory and has explained it by bias in the reporters by error in the reporters and by the theory of borrowing but such coincidence in misreporting is a dangerous thing for anthropology to admit as it damages her evidence in general again the theory of borrowing seems to be contradicted by the early dates of many reports made prior to the arrival of missionaries and by the secrecy in which the beliefs are often veiled by the savages as also by the absence of prayer to the most potent being we are all naturally apt to insist on and be prepossessed in favour of an idea which has come to ourselves unexpectedly and has appeared to be corroborated by wider research and perhaps above all which runs contrary to the current of scientific opinion we make a pet of the relatively new idea let it be the origin of mythology in a disease of language or the vast religious importance of totems or our theory of the origin of totemism or the tremendous part played in religion by gods of plants we insist on the idea too exclusively we find it where it is not in fact we are very human very unscientific very apt to become oneidead it is even more natural that we should be regarded in this light by our brethren estil embetant avec son etre supreme whose own systems will be imperilled if our favourite idea can be established i risk this interpretation when i keep maintaining what that the chapter of otiose or unworshipped superior beings in the early history of religion deserves perusal not to cut its pages to go on making systems as if it did not exist is i venture to think less than scientific and borders on the superstitious for to build and defend a theory without looking closely to whatever may imperil it is precisely the fault of the superstitious khond who used to manure his field with a thumb or a collop from the flank of a human victim and did not try sowing a field without a collop of mans flesh to see what the comparative crops would be or science of this kind is like don quixote who having cleft his helmet with one experimental swordstroke repaired it but did not test it again like other martyrs of science i must expect to be thought importunate tedious a fellow of one idea and that idea wrong to resent this would show great want of humour and a plentiful lack of knowledge of human nature meanwhile i am about to permit myself to criticise some recent hypotheses in the field of religious origins in the interests of anthropology not of orthodoxy golden bough i xxi g b i tylor prim cult ii citing thevet singularitez de la france antarctique paris ch journal of anthropological institute octdec and ns ii nos p max mueller hibbert lectures p ii the theory of loangods or borrowed religion the study of the origins of religion is impeded by the impossibility of obtaining historical evidence on the subject if we examine the religious beliefs of extant races the lowest in material culture the best representatives of palaeolithic man we are still a long way from the beginnings of human speculation and belief man must have begun to speculate about the origins of things as soon as he was a reasoning animal if we look at the isolated and backward tribe of central australia the arunta we have the advantage of perhaps the best and most thoroughly scientific study ever made of such a race the book by messrs spencer and gillen here we watch a people so primitive that they are said to be utterly ignorant of the natural results in the way of progeny of the union of the sexes yet on the same authority this tribe has evolved an elaborate and granting the premises a scientific and adequate theory of the evolution of our species and the nature of life an original stock of spirits is constantly reincarnated spiritual pedigrees are preserved by records in the shape of oval decorated stones and it seems that a man or woman of today may be identified as an incarnation of a soul whose adventures in earlier incarnations can be traced back to the alcheringa or mythical heroic age of the people their marriage laws are already in advance of those of their neighbours the urabunna and their only magistracy of a limited and constitutional kind descends in the male line thus the arunta are socially in advance of the pictish royal family in scotland whose crown descended in the female line no king being succeeded by his son manifestly the religious or nonreligious ideas of such a people unclothed houseless ignorant of metals and of agriculture and without domesticated animals though they are must be ideas with a long history behind them the arunta philosophy is a peculiar philosophy worked out by thoughtful men and elaborated so artfully that there seems neither room for a god nor for the idea of a future life except the life of successive reincarnations it is therefore impossible for us to argue that mankind in general began its speculative career with the singular and apparently godless philosophy of the arunta their working science is sympathetic magic to the great spirit with a trace of belief in whom they are credited they are not said to pray and he seems to be either an invention of the seniors for the purpose of keeping the juniors and women in order or a being originally of higher character belief in whom has died out among the adults to him we return in another essay as historical information about the early or late evolution of the idea of a superior not to say supreme being is thus unattainable thinkers both ancient and modern have derived the idea of god from that of ghost the conception of a powerful spirit of a dead father worshipped by his children is supposed to have been gradually raised to the power of a god against this theory i have elsewhere urged that superior beings are found among races who do not worship ancestral spirits and again that these superior beings are not envisaged as spirits but rather as supernormal magnified men of unbounded power an idea often contradicted in savage as in greek mythology and of limitless duration the reply to me takes the form of ignoring or disabling the evidence or of asserting that these superior beings are loangods borrowed by savages from europeans or islamites it is to the second theory that these savage superior beings are disguised borrowings from missionaries explorers traders or squatters that i now address myself these beings certainly cause difficulties to the philosophy which derives gods in the last resort from ghosts it is probable that these difficulties have for some time been present to the mind of mr e b tylor one may drop academic titles in speaking of so celebrated a scholar when mr tylor publishes the gifford lectures which he delivered some years ago at aberdeen we shall know his mature mind about this problem meanwhile he has shown that the difficulty the god where no god should be is haunting his reflections for example his latest edition of his primitive culture contains as we shall show interesting modifications of what he wrote in the second edition there are three ways in which friends of the current theory that gods are grownup ghosts may attempt to escape from their quandary the low races with the high gods are degenerate and their deity is a survival from a loftier stage of lost culture mr tylor however of course knows too much to regard the australians in the stone age as degenerate the evidence is bad or fr mueller is that of prejudiced missionaries but mr tylor knows that some of the evidence is excellent and at its best does not repose on missionary testimony the high gods of the low races are borrowed from missionary teaching this is the line adopted by mr tylor i recently pointed out in the making of religion the many difficulties which beset the current theory i was therefore alarmed on rinding that mr tylor had mined the soil under my own hypothesis his theory of borrowing which would blow mine skyhigh if it exploded is expounded by mr tylor in an essay the limits of savage religion published in the journal of the anthropological institute vol xxi i propose to examine mr tylors work and to show that his own witnesses demonstrate the unborrowed and original character of the gods in question mr tylor first opposes the loose popular notion that all over north america the indians believed in a being named kitchi manitou or great spirit a notion which i do not defend he says the historical evidence is that the great spirit belongs not to the untutored but to the tutored mind of the savage and is preserved for us in the records of the tutors themselves the jesuit missionaries of canada now as to the word manitou spirit mr tylor quotes le jeune by this word manitou i think they understand what we call an angel or some powerful being again the montagnets give the name manitou to everything whether good or bad superior to man therefore when we speak of god they sometimes call him the good manitou while when we speak of the devil they call him the bad manitou when then ninety years later in pere lafitau dilates on the great spirit the great manitou we are to see that in ninety years the term which the indians used for our god their translation of le bon dieu has taken root become acclimatised and flourished lafitau according to mr tylor has also raised the huron word for spirit oki to okki with a capital o which he calls le grand esprit the elevation is solely due to lafitau and other christian teachers if all this were granted all this is far indeed from proving that the idea of a beneficent creator was borrowed by the indians from the jesuits between and mr tylors own book primitive culture enables us to correct that opinion here he quotes captain smith from an edition of the history of virginia of smith began to colonise virginia in he says edition of their chief god they worship is the devil him they call okee okki and serve him more of fear than love mr tylor cites this as a statement by a halfeducated and wholeprejudiced european about savage deities which from his point of view seem of a wholly diabolic nature the word oki mr tylor goes on apparently means that which is above and was in fact a general name for spirit or deity the chief deity of the virginians then in before missionaries came with his temples and images was a being whose name apparently meant that which is above moreover father brebeuf describes an oki in the heavens who rules the seasons is dreaded and sanctions treaties consequently lafitau did not in first make oki a spirit into okki a god that had been done in virginia before any missionaries arrived by the natives themselves long before for this we have and mr tylor has cited the evidence of smith before jesuits arrived what is yet more to the purpose william strachey a successor of smith writing in tells us that okeus as he spells the word was only a magisterial deputy of the great god the priests tell them who governs all the world and makes the sun to shine creatyng the sun and moone his companions him they call ahone the good and peaceable god requires no such duties as are paid to okeus nor needs to be sacrificed to for he intendeth all good unto them he has no image strachey remarks that the native priests vigorously resisted christianity they certainly borrowed neither okeus nor ahone the beneficent creator who is without sacrifice from jesuits who had not yet arrived do we need more evidence if so here it is speaking of new england in winslow writes about the god kiehtan as a being of ancient credit among the natives he made all the other gods he dwells far westerly above the heavens whither all good men go when they die thus mr tylor himself loc cit summarises winslow and quotes they never saw kiehtan but they hold it a great charge and dutie that one age teach another and to him they make feasts and cry and sing for plentie and victorie or anything that is good thus kiehtan in was not only a relatively supreme god but also a god of ancient standing borrowing from missionaries was therefore impossible mr tylor then added in brintons etymology is plausible that this kiehtan is simply the great spirit kittanitowit great living spirit an algonquin word compounded of kitta great manitou spirit termination wit indicating life but all this etymology mr tylor omitted in his edition of probably no longer thinking it plausible he did however say in ii another famous native american name for the supreme deity is oki not content with okeus capital o and all before the arrival of missionaries not content with kiehtan whose etymology in apparently means great spirit before the arrival of jesuits in new england mr tylor in primitive culture adds to these deities the greenlanders torngarsuk or great spirit his name is an augmentative of torngak spirit in demon before the arrival of missionaries for says mr tylor he seems no figure derived from the religion of scandinavian colonists ancient or modern he so clearly held his place as supreme deity in the native mind that as cranz the missionary alleges many greenlanders hearing of god and his almighty power were apt to fall on the idea that it was their torngarsuk who was meant now in mr tylor dropped out he seems no figure derived from the religion of scandinavian colonists ancient or modern and he added that torngarsuk was later identified not with our god but with our devil a foible characteristic i may say as mr tylor said concerning captain smith and oki of a halfeducated and wholeprejudiced european for the algonquin indians mr tylor cited father le jeune when the missionary talked to them of an almighty creator of heaven and earth they began to say to one another atahocan atahocan but his name had fallen into contempt and a verb nitatahocan meant i tell an old fanciful story in thevet credits the canadian indians with belief in a creator andouagni not approached with prayers none of these beings can have been borrowed from europeans it will presently be seen that between and mr tylor became sceptical as to the records of a great spirit in america but he retained oki in the sense of supreme deity here then from virginia to greenland mr tylor presented in evidence for a being of supreme power called bynames which perhaps mean great spirit in his essay of he does not refer to his earlier work and his evidence there for a great spirit nor tell us why he has changed his mind he now attributes the great spirit to missionary influence we naturally ask in what respect he has found the early evidence on which he previously relied lacking in value mr tylor in primitive culture gives a yet earlier reference than the others for a virginian creator he cites heriot an author of again they believe in one who made all things but pay him no honour writes pere lallemant in in a region where il ny ait point eu de religieux in mr tylor said it has even been thought that the whole doctrine of the great spirit was borrowed by the savages from missionaries and colonists but this view will not bear examination after due allowance made for misrendering of savage answers and importation of white mens thoughts it can hardly be judged that a divine being whose characteristics are so unlike what european intercourse would have suggested and who is heard of by such early explorers among such distant tribes could be a deity of foreign origin in this view will not bear examination is deleted why and the deity we are told could hardly be altogether of foreign origin he could not be when found by the first european discoverers and had the creed been borrowed prayer to the being would have been borrowed with it now in his essay of mr tylor never i think alludes to his own evidence of or even of in favour of a red indian creator evidence earlier than the jesuits and of le jeune in the essay of that authentic evidence of such early explorers among such distant tribes to a savage conception of the creator is not cited the coincidence of testimony is the strongest possible evidence to the nature and unborrowed character of the being such coincidence is in fact mr tylors own touchstone of trustworthy testimony yet in the jesuits receive the whole credit of introducing the idea it would be interesting to know why the early evidence has suddenly become untrustworthy the essay of ought of course to be regarded as only a sketch yet we are anxious to learn the reasons which made mr tylor leave his evidence out of sight though republished by him only the year before he put forth his tractate in favour of borrowing from jesuits i turn to another point on which i cannot accept mr tylors arguments in his essay of mr tylor dates the mandan deluge legend as not before why because catlin in found iron instruments used ritually in the native mystery play of the flood they were supposed to represent the tools employed in making the vessel wherein the only man escaped drowning but the mandans did not get iron tools before the indians however we reply had canoes before they had iron tools and in modern times might naturally employ iron instead of flint instruments discarded in the mystery play they might do this in spite of the marked preference for stone tools in ritual perhaps they had none it must here be observed that catlin does not use the word ark as mr tylor does for the vessel of the only man catlin always says the big canoe even if we admit which we do not that the mandans necessarily borrowed their deluge legend from whites it does not follow as mr tylor argues that because the great spirit appears in the deluge legend he cannot claim greater antiquity than in the first place as in mr tylors earlier statement canadians algonquins virginians massachusetts and greenlanders had a great spirit before christian influences began the mandans may have been equally fortunate nor does it seem safe to argue like mr tylor that if the great spirit figures in a hypothetically borrowed myth therefore the conception of a great spirit was necessarily borrowed at the same time that more recent myths are constantly being attached to a preexisting god or hero is a recognised fact in mythology nor can mythologists argue that biblical myth is a modified survival of savage myth and that such natural and obvious savage myths as the kneading of man out of clay the origin of death the fall and the tradition of the deluge are necessarily borrowed by savages from the bible this is indeed to argue in a vicious circle again was the australian and american myth of a race of wise birds earlier than man borrowed from the famous chorus in the birds of aristophanes is the arunta theory of evolution borrowed from darwin or their theory of reincarnation from buddhism borrowing of ideas seems only to be in favour when savage ideas resemble more or less those of christianity mr tylor remarks that prince maximilian who knew mandanese better than catlin found among them no great manitou so called but he did find a creator whose name means lord of earth was he borrowed from the whites finally on this point would savages who remained so utterly unchristian as the mandans adopt from missionaries just one myth the deluge and make that the central feature in their national ritual indeed this seems very improbable conduct nothing is more conservative than ritual that is notorious we do not follow mr tylor into south america if our case is proved by his own not repudiated authorities for north america that suffices us we turn to australia let us first take the typical australian case of baiame peiamei or baiamai at present alleged by mr howitt and others to be the moral creative being of many tribes and served without sacrifice in their mysteries mr tylor first finds him mentioned as a creator by mr horace hale whose book is of next in baiame was spoken of by a native to some german moravian missionaries as a being who according to their sorcerers or doctors made all things but was easy to anger and was to be appeased by dances thus he was accepted by the most notoriously conservative class the class most jealous of missionary influence the sorcerers omitting for the moment a later description of baiame as seen by a black devotee in a vision we turn to mr tylors theory of the origin of this god mr ridley who began his missionary career in victoria in gives a pleasing account of baiame as a creator with a paradise for the good according to mr ridley baiame is discovered by mr greenway to be derived from baia to make and he concludes that for ages unknown the blacks have called god the maker mr tylor now asks was baiame who is he avers near so prominent a divine figure among the australians known to them at all a few years earlier he decides that before baiame was unknown to wellinformed white observers this of course would not prove that baiame was unknown to the blacks as for the observers who are three in number one buckley the convict in spite of his thirtytwo years with the blacks is of no real value we cannot trust a man who lied so freely as to say that in australia he speared salmon and often saw the fabled monster the bunyip buckley could not read and his book was made up by a mr morgan out of rough notes and memoranda and by conversation if then as buckley says they have no notion of a supreme being p we may discount that buckleys idea of such a being was probably too elevated moreover he never mentions the confessedly ancient native mysteries in one of which among certain tribes the being is revealed mr tylors next wellinformed observer before mr backhouse a quaker takes his facts straight from the third witness mr threlkeld he admits it for some of them and it is true in this matter of all of them buckley being out of court and backhouse being a mere copy of mr threlkeld what has mr threlkeld to say what follows is curious mr threlkeld does not name baiame but speaks of a big supernatural black man called koin who carries wizards up to the sky inspires sorcerers walks about with a firestick and so on to honour him boys front teeth are knocked out in the initiatory stages as soon as i read this passage i perceived that mr threlkeld was amalgamating such a goblin as the kurnai call brewin with the high god of the mysteries in when mr howitt with mr fison wrote kamilaroi and kurnai he knew no higher being among that tribe than the goblin brewin but being initiated later mr howitt discovered that the god of the mysteries is munganngaur our father this shows the slight value of negative evidence women know about brewin the goblin master of sorcerers but the knowledge of munganngaur is hidden from them under awful penalties not only i but mr horace hale came to this opinion that koin is a goblin baiame a god as we shall see in the same way where baiame is supreme daramulun is sometimes a goblin or fiend mr threlkeld very properly did not use the name of the fiend koin as equivalent to god in his translation of the gospel of st luke into the native tongue he there used for god eloi and no doubt did the same in his teaching he also tried the word jeliovakabirun neither word has taken with the blacks neither word occurs in their traditions the word though forced on them has not been accepted by them that looks ill for the theory of borrowing here then of mr tylors three negative witnesses who before knew not baiame mr threlkeld alone is of value as mr hale says mr threlkeld was the first worker at the dialects of those baiameworshipping tribes the kamilaroi of the wellington valley in victoria but whence did mr hale get what mr tylor cites his knowledge in of baiame he an american savant on an exploring expedition could not well find out esoteric native secrets i shall prove that mr hale got his knowledge of baiame from mr tylors own negative witness mr threlkeld mr hale says that when the missionaries first came to wellington baiame was worshipped with songs there was a native famous for the composition of these songs or hymns which according to mr threlkeld were passed on c mr hale thus declares mr tylor probably overlooked the remark that when the missionaries first came to wellington where baiame is the creator they found baiame there before them then why did mr threlkeld not name baiame i think because mr hale says that baiames name and sacred dance were brought in by natives from a distance and when he is writing had fallen into disuse had then a missionary before evolved baiame from kamilaroi baia to make for that is mr tylors theory of the origin of the word baiame and taught the name to distant natives as a word for his own god and had these proselytising distant dancing natives brought baiames name and dance to wellington are missionaries dancing masters they would teach prayer and kneeling or give rosaries dances are no part of our religion to demonstrate missionary influence here we must find a missionary not mr threlkeld who was studying and working on the kamilaroi tongue before there was no such missionary finally mr hale runs counter to mr tylors theory of borrowing from whites though mr tylor does not quote his remark the ideas of baiame may possibly be derived from europeans though says mr hale the great unwillingness which the natives always evince to adopt any custom or opinion from them militates against such a supposition so strong is this reluctance to borrow ideas from the whites that the blacks of the centre have not even borrowed the idea that children are a result of the intercourse of the sexes here then in part of the district studied by mr threlkeld in an american savant who certainly received the facts from mr threlkeld testifies to baiame as recently brought from a distance by natives but as prior to the arrival of missionaries and most unlikely to have been borrowed whence then came baiame mr tylor thinks the evidence points rather to baiame being the missionary translation of the word creator used in missionary lesson books for god but by when baiame is confessedly so prominent a divine figure mr threlkelds were the only translations and grammatical tracts in the kamilaroi tongue now mr threlkeld did not translate creator or anything else by baiame he used eloi and jehovahka and the natives would have neither of these words where is mr tylors reason then for holding that before for it must be prior to that date if it is going to help his argument any missionary ever rendered creator by baiame he has just argued that no observer then knew the name baiame so no observer could have introduced a name baiame which he did not know yet there was the name mr hale found it there mr tylors argument seems to be that mr ridley in and again in printed extracts in which occurs baiamegod from the missionary primers prepared for the kamilaroi we might have expected mr tylor at least to give the dates of the missionary primers that ex hypothesi introduced baiame before he gives no dates and the primers are of and are written by mr ridley who cites them thus they must be posterior to the baiame of and baiame was prior to missionaries at wellington at the time when mr tylor first notes his appearance thus by mr tylors own evidence baiame is not shown to be a missionary importation the reverse as to australia it is not denied by mr tylor that practically all over the continent the blacks possess religious mysteries of confessed antiquity it is not denied that the institution of these mysteries is now in many cases attributed by the blacks to a moral creative being whose home is in or above the heavens it is not denied that his name now usually means in different dialects maker baiame master biamban and father papang and many other words it is not denied that the doctrine of this being is now concealed from children and women and revealed to lads at the bora or initiatory mystery but on the other hand as i understand mr tylor while initiatory rites are old they certainly existed when dampier touched at the australian coast in the names of their institutor father maker his moral excellencies and his creative attributes are all due to missionary influence the original founder of the bora in premissionary days would only be a dead headman or leader now religiously regarded to this we first demur it is not shown it is denied by waitz and it is not even alleged by mr herbert spencer that the australians steadily propitiate or sacrifice at all to any ghosts of dead men how can they the name of the dead is tabooed and even where there is in one instance an eponymous human patronymic of a tribe that patronymic alters in every generation now among such a ghostworshipping people as the zulus the most recently dead father gets most worship in australia where even the recent ghosts are unadored is it likely that some remote ghost is remembered as founder of the ancient mysteries this is beyond our belief though the opinion is or at least was that of mr howitt the mere institution of female kin among some of these tribes though paternity is recognised makes against an ancient worship of a male ancestor where even now ancestors are unworshipped as to the aspect of this god baiame mr tylor presently cites a story told to mr howitt by a native of how with his father he once penetrated in the spirit to baiames home and found him to be a very great old man with a long beard and with crystal pillars growing out of his shoulders which support a supernal sky his people birds and beasts were around him mr tylor says these details are it will have been noticed in some respects of very native character while in others recalling conventional christian ideas of the almighty the christian idea is naturally that of the old man of blake and michael angelo hartley coleridges old man with the beard is it likely that the savages had seen any such representations again is the idea of baiame as an old man not natural to a race where respect of age is regularly inculcated in the mysteries and prevails in practice among the kamilaroi about bundurra turramulan another name for this or a lower god is represented at the mysteries by an old man learned in all the laws as early as collins found that the native word for father in new south wales was applied by the blacks as a title of reverence to the governor of the nascent colony it is used now in many native tribes as the name of their supreme being and mr tylor thinks it of missionary origin manifestly this idea of age and paternity in a worshipped being is congenial to the natives is illustrated in their laws and customs need not be borrowed and is rather inevitable the vision of baiame we may add was narrated to mr howitt by a native fellowinitiate to lie in such cases is an unheardof thing says mr howitt the vision was a result of the worldwide practice of crystal gazing the seers father handed to him a crystal when i looked at it says the narrator all manner of visions appeared including that of baiame it is manifest we think that when the natives attach the attributes of fatherhood and antiquity to baiame they need not be borrowing from christian art notions so natural nay so inevitable in their own stage of society though in many cases reckoning kinship through women they quite undeniably recognise paternity in fact thus the paternal title had no need to be borrowed as a word of reverence it was so used before missionaries came mr howitt who is deeply initiated writes beyond the vaulted sky lies the mysterious home of that great and powerful being who is bunjil baiame or taramulan in different tribal languages but who in all is known by a name the equivalent of the only one used by the kurnai which is mangunngaur our father now not to multiply evidence which is provided by other observers as to central australia not so central as the arunta country and the north mr tylor is confronted with this problem have all the tribes who regard a powerful being baiame or another as founder of their ancient mysteries borrowed his name and attributes since or so from whites with whom they were constantly in hostile relations is it probable that having hypothetically picked up from christians the notion of a moral father in heaven their priests and initiators instantly disseminated that idea over most of the continent and introduced it into their most secret and most conservative ceremonies would they be likely to restrict so novel a piece of european information to the men mr dawson in his aborigines of australia p writes the recent custom of providing food for it a corpse is derided by intelligent old aborigines as white fellows gammon thus do they estimate novelties yet in mr tylors theory it is the most conservative class of all the medicinemen and learned elders everywhere rivals and opponents of christian doctrine who pick up the european idea of a good powerful father or master borrow a missionary name for him we have shown that the name baiame is not of missionary origin and introduce him in precisely the secret heart of the mysteries this knowledge is hidden under terrible penalties from women and children to what purpose do missionaries teach only the old rams of the flock and neglect the ewes and lambs obviously the women and children must know any secret of divine names and attributes imparted by missionaries again it is not probable that having recently borrowed a new idea from the whites the blacks would elaborately hide it from its authors the europeans so well is it hidden that till he was formally initiated mr howitt had no suspicion of its existence mr tylor may rest in his hypothesis of borrowing but for the reasons assigned we think it impossible in our and his selected north american cases and inconceivable as an explanation of the australian phenomena finally mr tylor candidly adduces a case in which mr dawson taking great and acknowledged trouble to collect evidence learned from the blacks that they had believed in a benevolent being pirnmeheal whose voice is the thunder before they knew of the existence of europeans who have given them a dread of pirnmeheal we add mr howitts testimony to a supreme being ruling from omeo to shoalhaven river from the coast to yass gundagai concerning whom old men strenuously maintained that it was so before the white men came they themselves now aged having only learned the secret when they were initiated and made men at about the age of fourteen in the same essay of mr howitt tells of a native whose grandfather initiated him as to an allseeing personality bunjil up there who would mark his conduct this was said before the white men came to melbourne bunjil said william beiruk a black was called our father before white men came to melbourne i might give other evidence in favour of the unborrowed character of australian belief in some such being as baiame thus mrs langloh parker the careful collector of australian legendary tales was herself interested in the question she approached the subject as a disciple of mr herbert spencer who allows hardly a germ of religion to the australians on hearing what she did hear as to baiame from the tribesmen she asked one of them whether the idea was not borrowed from europeans the old warrior answered that if it were so the young men would know most about baiame but they know nothing apparently because the old rites of initiation have fallen into disuse nor are they much more familiar with christian doctrine this black man had logic in him mrs langloh parker came contrary to her prepossessions to the same opinion as our best authority mr howitt that the australian belief is unborrowed this lady who has taken very great pains in criticising and collecting her evidence kindly sent me an essays of mr mannings from the journal of the royal society of new south wales vol xvi p mr manning was an early settler in the north border of the southern colony about he was in europe and met goethe whose undiminished curiosity he being then about eightyfive induced him to bid mr manning examine australian beliefs he did but lost his notes made in in these notes which he later recovered mr manning used christian terminology instead of making a verbatim report struck by the certainly singular savage idea of a son begotten in some cases in others a kind of emanation of the superior being he employed theological phrases the son in his story sprang from a liquid like blood which boyma baiame placed in a vessel within a crystal oven the myth of such a birth as mr hartland remarks is familiar to zulus and red indians it is therefore not likely to be of european origin but mr mannings evidence despite its terminology so far agrees with mrs langloh parkers account of the extant baiame belief as to make a case for further inquiry so mr hartland concedes i ask for no more thus mr manning has ballima mrs langloh parker has bullimah for a kind of floral paradise of souls very beautifully described in the ladys more australian legendary tales both authorities mention prayers for the dead mrs langloh parker quotes what mr hartland calls very interesting funeral rites and prayers for the dead he adds we want to be assured whether these are usual by means of an accurate description of the customary ceremonies and that she does not give us i shall make inquiry but what does it matter whether the rites in the overthrow of native manners are now usual or not baiame is unknown to the new generation as we have seen prayers to him then cannot be usual the point is that mr manning in and mrs langloh parker in both mention the prayers for the dead certainly not borrowed from protestants there is a similar account only that of an unnamed runaway convict who lived with the black fellows in northwestern australia by a mythical contradiction the soul of the hero eerin prayed for in mrs langloh parkers tale now inhabits a little bird another curious point needs to be considered by the advocates of the theory of borrowing mr hartland offers some deserved censures on mr mannings terminology in his report of australian religion mr manning says they believe in the existence of a son of god equal with him in omniscience and but slightly inferior to his father in any attribute him they call grogoragally his divine office is to watch over all the actions of mankind and to bring to life the dead to appear before the judgment seat of his father who alone pronounces the awful judgment of eternal happiness in heaven ballima or eternal misery in oorooma hell which is the place of everlasting fire gumby the son acts as mediator for their souls to the great god to whom the good and bad actions of all are known as mr hartland truly says this is not an accurate scientific account even mr mannings capital letters are censured probably the native theologian really said something like this boyma baiame big man very budgery man him sit on big glass stone him son grogoragally can see everything and go everywhere see budgery man like him see bad man plenty too much devil devil likes budgery man no likes bad man he growl too much budgery man die grogoragally tell boyma boyma say take him ballima way plenty budgery place bad man die boyma say take him oorooma way plenty too hot him growl there grogoragally plenty strong him not so strong as boyma this or something like this would be the actual statement of the dusky theologian it is easily rendered into mr mannings terminology but at the same time the native in his rude lingua franca or pidgin english could hardly do justice to his creed it was his creed mr hartland himself recognises the original character of the native version of the supernatural birth here are certainly biblical analogies as mr tylor recognises but they are as certainly unborrowed now let us fancy that a traveller not a greek scholar is stormdriven to a hitherto unknown island he finds a race of heathen white men he describes their religion despite their polytheism they have certainly been visited by christian missionaries or are descended from a christian colony they believe in a supreme being whom they call zeus he has a son named apollon or phoebus apollon who is allknowing and allseeing he acts as a kind of mediator between zeus and men to whom as one of the native hymns says he delivers the counsels of the father and his unerring will this apollo is consulted through an hysterical woman who lives in a cave after being convulsed like other savage mediums she speaks in a kind of verse her advice is often obscure and ambiguous but generally of a moral tendency this son of zeus is believed to be the only god who really knows the future and the will of his father there is another son hermes one of whose duties is to conduct the souls of the dead into the presence of their judge who is not zeus but another god there is also a son of apollo whom i take to be only a kind of double of that god he sometimes appears to his worshippers as a serpent his name is asclepius this reminds us of what winslow writes about the red indians of new england they have a supreme being kiehtan whose son hobamok appears in their assemblies as a serpent ridley has the same story about the blacks of australia i infer then that the natives of this island have inherited or been taught some elements of christianity as in the case of apollo the mediator between zeus and men and hermes the guide of souls as they call him psychopompos in their language but they have mixed up all this with degrading superstitions of course our traveller has arrived among greeks and quotes the homeric hymn to apollo but the greeks being prior to christianity did not borrow from it as our traveller supposes on the other hand the greek beliefs which he describes resemble australian and american beliefs more closely than australian and american beliefs resemble the creed taught by missionaries yet neither mr tylor nor any other friend of the borrowing theory asserts that the australians or americans borrowed their tenets from greece the truth seems to be that where a supreme being is regarded as too remote and impassive he is naturally supplied with a deputy ahone has oki kiehtan has hobamok boyma has grogoragally baiame has tundun or in places daramulun nyankupon in west africa has bobowissi sometimes as in the australian nooreles case these active deputies are sons of the supreme being no borrowing is needed to explain ideas so natural to early men believing in a supreme being remote and retired little concerned with mundane affairs and acting through a deputy or deputies in other cases as of the finnish num or the zulu unkulunkulu or the algonquin atahocan the being is quite neglected in favour of spirits who receive sacrifices of meat or grease human minds work on similar lines without borrowing which is only alleged in the case of christianity to account for the beliefs which do not fit the ghost theory of modern speculators the essential point of mr mannings report injured as it is by his impossible terminology is the extreme secrecy maintained on these points by his savage informants they used to believe that the world would perish if the women heard of their dogmas thus a man said to mr howitt whose competence as a witness is indisputable if a woman were to hear these things or hear what we tell the boys i would kill her one of mr mannings witnesses slunk into a wooden fireplace whence he whispered his beliefs he had previously examined doors and windows in search of listeners a man who reported these creeds would if they became divulged among the women be obliged to kill his wife if the religious ideas were borrowed from missionaries the women would know them as well as the men they would not be reserved for initiates at the mysteries through which mr howitt derived his most esoteric knowledge of creeds whereof in he was absolutely ignorant if the beliefs were of missionary origin the young men not the old men would know most about baiame for similar beliefs in northwest central queensland i may cite mr both the being mulkari is described by mr both as i a benevolent omnipresent supernatural being anything incomprehensible mulkari is the supernatural power who makes everything which the blacks cannot otherwise account for he is a good beneficent person and never kills any one his home is in the skies he was also a medicineman has the usual low myths about him and invented magic so writes dr both who knows the local pitta pitta language and is not a missionary dr both is pursuing his researches and his remarks are only cited provisionally awaiting confirmation sometimes european observers do not see the trend of their own reports in mr eyre described the origin of creation as narrated to him by australian blacks on the murring river a being noorele with three unbegotten sons lives up among the clouds he is all powerful and of benevolent nature he made the earth trees water c he receives the souls ladko shades umbra of the natives who join him in the skies and will never die again yet mr eyre adds a deity a great first cause can hardly be said to be acknowledged what is noorele if not a great first cause among some tribes bunjil merely a title of authority meaning master lord headman is a name of the superior being abundance of the mythology of bunjil often ludicrous or degrading the being showing as a supernormal medicineman may be found in mr brough smyths great collections but no evidence can be better than that of native poetry which proves a higher aspect of bunjil a woiworung bard of old made a song which moved an aged singer to tears by the melancholy which the words conveyed to him it was an inspired song for the natives like ourselves would think tennyson inspired and tupper not so usually the spirits inspire singers this song was inspired by bunjil himself who rushes down into the heart of the singer just as apollo did of old it is a dirge of the native race we go all the bones of all are shining white in this dulur land the rushing noise of bunjil our father sings in my breast this breast of mine the missionaries do not inspire these songs they put them down the white man says mr howitt knows little or nothing of the black fellows songs one of mr mannings informants was angry when asked for the hymn to baiame boyma he said that mr manning knew too much already i have dwelt specially on australia because there as the natives do not worship ancestral spirits the names of the dead are tabooed their superior being cannot have been evolved out of ghost worship i have expressly avoided the evidence of missionaries except the early jesuits because missionaries are believed by some writers to be biassed on this point though in fact on other points they are copiously cited by anthropologists as mr tylor finds the saintly and often martyred jesuits of worth quoting i have therefore admitted father le jeunes testimony to the existence of atahocan before their arrival in america with father brebeufs oki or un oki whose anger is feared and who sanctions treaties it is impossible to me to understand how the savages could borrow from europeans the beliefs which the europeans found extant when they arrived i have not touched the case of africa in the making of religion pp i argued against sir a b elliss elaborate theory of borrowing a god in the case of the tshispeaking races i did not know that this exact writer had repudiated his theory which was also rejected by miss mary kingsley as to australia in face of the evidence which settled mr howitts doubts as to the borrowing of these ideas can any one bring a native of age and credit who has said that baiame under any name was borrowed from the whites mr palmer is perfectly satisfied that none of these ideas were derived from the whites he is speaking of the tribes of the gulf of carpentaria far away indeed from victoria and new south wales there is no greater authority among anthropologists than waitz and waitz rejects the hypothesis that the higher australian religious beliefs were borrowed from christians to sum up we have proved by evidence of and that a sort of supreme creative being was known in north america before any missionary influence reached the regions where he prevailed as to the australian god baiame we have shown out of the mouth of mr tylors own witness mr hale that baiame preceded the missionaries in the region where literary evidence of his creed first occurs we have given mr hales opinion as to the improbability of borrowing we have left it to mr tylor to find the missionary who before translated creator by the kamilaroi word baiame while showing the difficulty i think the impossibility of discovering any kamilaroi philologist before mr threlkeld and mr threlkeld certainly did not introduce baiame we have proved that contrary to mr tylors theory of what a missionary can do mr threlkeld could not introduce his own names for god eloi and jehovahka into kamilaroi practice we note the improbability that highly conservative medicinemen would unanimously thrust a european idea into their ancient mysteries we have observed that by the nature of mr tylors theory the hypothetically borrowed divine names and attributes must if taken over from missionaries have been well known to the women and children from whom they are concealed under dreadful penalties we have demonstrated the worthlessness of negative evidence by proving that the facts were discovered on initiation by a student mr howitt confessedly in the first rank though he during many years had been ignorant of their existence we show that the ideas of age and paternity in an object of reverence are natural and habitual to australian natives and stood in no need of being borrowed we suggest that the absence of prayer to a powerful being is fatal to the theory of borrowing we show that direct native evidence utterly denies the borrowing of divine names and attributes and strenuously asserts that before europeans came to melbourne they were revealed in the secret doctrine of ancient initiatory rites this evidence again removed the doubts which mr howitt had entertained on the point and mr palmer and mr dawson agree with mr howitt mr ridley mr guenther and mr greenway all experts all studying the blacks on the spot in the study waitz is of the same opinion australian religion is unborrowed it is rare in anthropological speculations to light on a topic in which verifiable dates occur the dates of the arrivals of missionaries and other europeans the dates of mr hales book of mr threlkelds books of mr ridleys primer are definite facts not conjectures in the air while this array of facts remains undemolished science cannot logically argue that the superior beings of low savage belief are borrowed from christian teachers and travellers that idea is disproved also by the esoteric and hidden nature of the beliefs and by the usual though not universal absence of prayer the absence of prayer again and of sacrifice proves that gods not bribed or implored were not invented as powerful givers of good things because good things were found not to be procurable by magic this condition of belief is not what a european whatever his bias expects to find he does not import this kind of ideas if they are all misreports due to misunderstandings in america and australia from to what is the value of anthropological evidence it ought to be needless to add that when good observers like miss kingsley find traces of jesuit or other missionary teaching in regions as africa or canada where jesuits actually taught in the past i accept their decision my arguments against the theory of borrowing apply chiefly to cases where the beliefs reported were found already extant by the first white observers to tribes where missionaries like mr threlkeld could not introduce their names for deity and to tribes which jealously conceal their theology from the whites natives of central australia london with a case of ignoring the evidence i deal in the following essay magic and religion op

the sin of rebellion the idea which inspires this text probably is that a person who seeks to obtain his ends by witchcraft is rebelling against the deity or deities through whom alone these ends should be sought witchcraft is also an insult and injury to the official priests who regard the witch as the surgeon regards the bonesetter or as the geologist regards the dowser or waterfinder who uses the diviningrod magic or witchcraft falls into two main classes the former is magic of the sort used by people who think that things accidentally like each other influence each other you find a stone shaped like a yam and you sow it in the yam plot you find a stone like a duck and expect to have good duckshooting while you carry the stone about in a bag in the same way the part influences the whole you burn some of a mans hair and so he catches a fever imitation works in the same manner you imitate the emergence of grubs from the larvae and you expect grubs to emerge all magic of this kind is wrought by material objects sticks stones hair and so forth which sometimes have been charmed by songs chanted over them among the arunta of central australia in many respects a backward people we do hear of an evil spirit influencing the material object which has been charmed we also hear of spirits which instruct men in medical magic but as a rule the magic is materialistic it really does produce effects by suggestion a man dies and a woman is won if they know that magic is being worked to kill or woo the second sort of magic acts by spells which constrain spirits or gods to do the will of the magician this magic involves itself in religion when the magical ceremonies are so to speak only symbolic prayers expressed in a kind of signlanguage but if the idea is to put constraint by spells on a god or spirit then the intention is magical and rebellious though the official priest of a savage god may use magic in his appeal to that deity he is not a wizard it is the unofficial practitioner who is a witch just as the unqualified medical practitioner is a quack in the same way if a minister of the kirk was clairvoyant or secondsighted that was a proof of godliness and inspiration but if a lay parishioner was secondsighted he or she was in danger of the stake as a witch or wizard these briefly stated are the points of contrast and points of contact between magic and religion the question has recently been raised by mr frazer in the new edition of his golden bough whether magic has not everywhere preceded religion have men not attempted to secure weather and everything else to their desire by magic before they invented gods and prayed to them for what magic as they learned by experience failed to provide this question cannot be historically determined if we find a race which has magic but no religion we cannot be certain that it did not once possess a religion of which it has despaired i once knew a man who as a child suffered from toothache he prayed for relief it did not come he at once about the age of eight abandoned religion what a child may do in the way of despair of religion a childlike race may do therefore if we find a race with magic but without religion we cannot scientifically say that the race has never possessed a religion thus the relative priority of religion or magic cannot be ascertained historically again all depends on our definition of religion if we are to pursue a speculation rather airy and unbottomed on facts mr frazer defines religion as a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man which are believed to direct and control the course of nature and of human life i but clearly this definition does not include all that we usually mean by religion if men believe in a potent being who originally made or manufactured the nature of things or most things i am warned not to use the word creator that is an idea so far religious that it satisfies by the figment of a supernatural agent the speculative faculty clearly the belief in such a being is a germ whence may spring the ideas of duty towards and an affection for the being nobody can deny that these are religious ideas though they do not appeal in mr frazers definition the believers in such a being even if they never ask him for anything cannot be called irreligious at a period of his life when coleridge never prayed he would have been much and not unjustly annoyed if mr frazer had called him irreligious a man may believe in god and yet trust him too utterly to address him in petitions for earthly goods and gear thy will be done may be his only prayer yet he does not lack religion he only lacks it in the sense of mr frazers definition if that definition is granted mr frazer is prepared to produce a backward race houseless without agriculture metals domestic animals and without religion in mr frazers sense they have magic but they have no religion says mr frazer who presently informs us that the firstborn child of every woman was eaten by the tribe as part of a religious ceremony so they have a religion and a bloody religion it is that people is the australian among whom while magic is universally practised religion in the sense of a propitiation or conciliation of the higher powers seems to be nearly unknown nobody dreams of propitiating gods or spirits by prayer or sacrifice we are presently to see that mr frazer gives facts which contradict his own statement but first i must cite all that he says about australian religion in the southeastern parts of australia where the conditions of life in respect of climate water and vegetation are more favourable than elsewhere some faint beginnings of religion appear in the shape of a slight regard for the comfort of departed friends thus some victorian tribes are said to have kindled fires near the bodies of their dead in order to warm the ghost but the recent custom of providing food for it is derided by the intelligent old aborigines as white fellows gammon some tribes in this southeastern region are further reported to believe in a supreme spirit who is regarded sometimes as a benevolent but more frequently as a malevolent being brewin the supreme being of the kurnai was at first identified by two intelligent members of the tribe with jesus christ but on further reflection they thought he must be the devil but whether viewed as gods or devils it does not seem that these spirits were ever worshipped it is worth observing that in the same districts which thus exhibit the germs of religion the organisation of society and the family has also made the greatest advance the cause is probably the same in both cases namely a more plentiful supply of food due to the greater fertility of the soil on the other hand in the parched and barren regions of central australia where magic attains its highest importance religion seems to be entirely wanting the traces of a higher faith in australia where they occur are probably sometimes due to european influence i am strongly of opinion says one who knew the aborigines well that those who have written to show that the blacks had some knowledge of god practised prayer and believed in places of reward and punishment beyond the grave have been imposed upon and that until they had learned something of christianity from missionaries and others the blacks had no beliefs or practices of the sort having heard the missionaries however they were not slow to invent what i may call kindred statements with aboriginal accessories with a view to please and surprise the whites sometimes too the reported belief of the natives in a great or good spirit may rest merely on a misunderstanding mr lorimer fison informs me in a letter dated june that a german missionary mr siebert resident in the dieri tribe of central australia has ascertained that their mura mura which mr gason explained to be the good spirit is nothing more or less than the ancestors in the dream times there are male and female mura mura husbands wives and children just as among the dieri at the present day mr fison adds the more i learn about savage tribes the more i am convinced that among them the ancestors grow into gods this is all that mr frazer has here to say about the religious belief of the australians he has found in the museum of the past a people with abundance of magic yet with no religion or not enough to affect his theory that religion was everywhere second in order of time to magic i am very content to meet him on australian ground there we find abundance of testimony to the existence of a belief speculative moral and emotional but not practical the beings of this belief are not propitiated by sacrifice and very seldom by prayer but they are makers friends and judges mr tylor accepts i think the evidence for the beliefs as at present found but presumes many of their characteristics to be of european importation against that theory i have argued in the preceding essay giving historical dates mr frazer omits and ignores the evidence for the beliefs he denies to the australians more than some faint beginnings of religion and puts down traces of a higher faith as probably sometimes due and perhaps it sometimes is to european influence for this theory mr curr is cited having heard the missionaries they were not slow to invent what i call kindred statements with aboriginal accessories with a view to please and surprise the whites to please and surprise the whites the natives concealed their adaptations of christian ideas in the mysteries to which white men are very seldom or were very seldom admitted is this likely i believe that the exclusive rule is now relaxed where the natives are practically paid to exhibit one bora was under european patronage and the old men and children were fed on european supplies but when mr howitt was initiated by the kurnai and so first learned the secret of their religion the old men desired to be satisfied that i had in very deed been fully initiated by the brajerak black fellows in their kuringal he therefore retired to a lonely spot far from the possibility of a womans presence and exhibited the token of his previous initiation by the murrings hitherto long as the kurnai had known me these special secrets of the tribe had been kept carefully from me by all but two one of whom was now dead the inmost secret was the belief in munganngaur the great father of the tribe who was once on earth and now lives in the sky he is rather the beneficent father and the kindly though severe headman of the whole tribe than the malevolent wizard such as are other of the supernatural beings believed in by the australian blacks mr frazer cites mr howitt thus some tribes in this southeastern region are further reported to believe in a supreme spirit who is regarded sometimes as a benevolent but more frequently as a malevolent being what has become of mr howitts evidence after initiation by the kurnai evidence published in how can the blacks invent beliefs to please the whites when they only reveal them to mr howitt after he has produced a bull roarer as a token of initiation mr frazer then writes brewin the supreme being of the kurnai was at first identified by two intelligent members of the tribe with jesus christ but on further reflection they thought he must be the devil this is cited from a work of messrs fison and howitts kamilaroi and kurnai p it must have escaped even mr frazers erudition that mr howitt says when i wrote of brewin in my paper on some australian beliefs i was not aware of the doctrines as to munganngaur these the kurnai carefully concealed from me until i learned them at the jeraeil or mysteries had mr frazer observed this remark of mr howitts he could not have cited without comment or correction mr howitts earlier and confessedly erroneous opinion that brewin is the supreme being of the kurnai to mr howitts correction in of his mistake of mr frazer as far as i observe makes no allusion mr frazer must either have overlooked all the evidence for an australian belief ruinous to his theory of the origin of religion ruinous if australia represents the earliest known stages of religion or he must have reasons not produced for thinking all that evidence too worthless to deserve confutation or even mention we are anxious to know his reasons for on other matters he freely quotes our witnesses yet i cannot think mr frazer consistently so severe as to australian evidence he has a picturesque theory that the origin of the passover was a rite in which masked men ran about through hebrew towns in the night butchering all the first born of israel no people we exclaim ever did such a thing in proof of the existence of the custom mr frazer adduces an australian parallel in some tribes of new south wales the firstborn child of every woman was eaten by the tribe as part of a religious ceremony mr frazers authority is a communication by mr john moore davis and was published in twentythree years ago by mr brough smyth here is what mr davis says in parts of n s w such as bathurst goulburn the lachlan or macquarie it was customary long ago for the firstborn of every lubra to be eaten by the tribe as part of a religious ceremony and i recollect a black fellow who had in compliance with the custom been thrown when an infant on the fire but was rescued and brought up by some stockkeepers who happened accidentally to be passing at the time the marks of the burns were distinctly visible on the man when i saw him the evidence is what the society for psychical research calls remote in the event was already long ago the testimony is from we know not how remote a hand the black sufferer as a baby at the time could not remember the facts the stockkeepers who were present are not named nor do we even know whether mr davis was informed by them or heard their story at third or fourth hand we do not know whether they correctly interpreted the alleged sacrifice in a religious ceremony by a people said to be almost or quite irreligious of all the firstborn children of women mr frazer has circulated inquiries as to australian customs and has published the results in the journal of the anthropological institute he does not appeal to the answers in corroboration of mr daviss remarkable story imbued with the superstition of psychical research i once investigated the famous australian tale of fishers ghost i sent for the court archives the ghost led to a trial for murder and i received these and a contemporary plan of the scene of the murder and the apparition these documents left me doubtful about the ghost of fisher may i not say that similar researches and good corroborative evidence are needed before we accept a settlers tale of an australian sacrifice long ago as confirming a theory of a hebrew yearly massacre of all the firstborn moreover if mr moores evidence is good as to a sacrifice why is the latest evidence of mr howitt and all my other witnesses as to australian religion not worth mentioning why is it so bad that mr frazer goes back to mr howitts evidence of before he knew the secret and is silent about mr howitts evidence of we may quote sir alfred lyall one effect of the accumulation of materials has been to encourage speculative generalisations because it has provided a repertory out of which one may make arbitrary selection of examples and precedents to suit any theory has mr frazer escaped this error i cannot think that he has escaped and the error is fatal he cites mr howitt mr palmer mr oldfield mr dawson and mr cameron whom i am about to quote all of whom speak to a native religion of the kind for which i contend their witness is enough for him in other matters but as to this matter these witnesses for some reason are absolutely ignored i myself have omitted the affirmative evidence of mr oldfield and mr foelsche as to religion because i think it contaminated although in part corroborated but my witnesses all cited for other points by mr frazer are not even mentioned on the point where if their reports be correct they seem rather to invalidate his central theory that religion was invented in the despair of magic as to that despair it does not exist the religions of babylon greece and egypt lived side by side with superabundant magic the australians when their magic fails merely say that some other black fellow is working stronger countermagic however that is a different question the question at present is why does mr frazer not cite and confute the evidence of witnesses whom he quotes on other points evidence fatal to his theory why does he ignore it among so many witnesses distrustful of facts that surprise them anxious to explain by borrowing all cannot be biassed if they were why is not the testimony of witnesses with the opposite bias also discredited or ignored why is it welcomed mr frazer prefers the opinion of mr siebert a german missionary that the dieri propitiate ancestral spirits to the opinion of mr gason that the being of their belief is a good spirit who made them i do not know which of these gentlemen is right possibly both views are held by different native informants but mr sieberts ancestral spirits come through mr fison who says the more i learn about savage tribes the more i am convinced that among them ancestors grow into gods so natural a process where the names of the dead are tabooed oh no we never mention them their names are never heard so they grow into gods mr fison is a spencerian so for all that i know may mr siebert be if so both have a theory and a bias yet they are cited it is only witnesses who hold that the australians certainly not as a rule ancestor worshippers believe in a kind of god who are not deemed worthy of mention on this point though quite trustworthy on other points i cannot understand this method the historian has a theory he searches for contradictory facts the chemist or biologist does not fail to mention facts hostile to his theory we are not asking mr frazer to accept the testimony of mr howitt mr cameron mr ridley mr greenway mr gason mr hale archdeacon guenther the benedictines of nursia mr dawson mr eyre mr roth mrs langloh parker or to accept the opinion of waitz mr howitt and others as to unborrowed australian religion their testimony may be erroneous when it is proved erroneous i shall abandon it but perhaps anthropologists may be allowed to be curious as to the reasons for which this and similar testimony is ignored the reason cannot be that there is contradictory evidence for some observers deny magic to the tribes whom they know yet mr frazer has no doubt as to the prevalence of magic though one of his witnesses mr foelsche gives no magic but gives religion whether viewed as gods or devils mr frazer says of southeast australian beings it does not seem that these spirits were ever worshipped he has ignored the evidence that they are worshipped if the rites of the bora are worship but if they are not worshipped so much the worse for his theory gods in his theory were invented just to be worshipped to these mighty beings man now addressed himself beseeching them of their mercy to furnish him with all good things as against the correctness of my witnesses i only know the mass of evidence by white observers who have detected no religion among these savages but i do not necessarily accept the negative evidence because the beliefs are reported by the affirmative witnesses to be guarded with the utmost secrecy it is not every inquirer who has the power of eliciting beliefs which for many reasons are jealously guarded many englishmen or lowlanders are unable to extract legends of fairies ghosts and secondsight from gaelic highlanders on the other hand they are kind enough to communicate to me plenty of their folklore the urkus were very shy and frightened when asked about their religion says mr pope hennessy in his notes on the jukos and other tribes of the middle benae thus i prefer the affirmative evidence of europeans who have won the confidence of the australians and have been initiated to the denials of observers less fortunate as for their theory that the religious practices if they exist are borrowed from christians i have stated my case in the preceding essay there could be no stronger evidence than the absence of prayer that the australian religion is not borrowed this argument ought especially to appeal to mr frazer his definition of religion is that of euthyphro in the platonic dialogue of that name socrates sacrificing is giving to the gods and piety is asking from them euthyphro yes socrates socrates upon this view then piety is a science of asking and giving euthyphro you understand me capitally socrates mr frazer agrees with euthyphro but if we find that the most backward race known to us believes in a power yet propitiates him neither by prayer nor sacrifice and if we find as we do that in many more advanced races in africa and america it is precisely the highest power which is left impropriated then we really cannot argue that gods were first invented as powers who could give good things on receipt of other good things sacrifice and prayer sir alfred lyall here agrees with mr frazer the foundation of natural religion is the principle of do ut des i give that you may give and the most ingenious researches into the evolution of primitive ideas will hardly take us beyond or behind it my researches do not pretend to be i ingenious it is a mere question of facts have mr howitts tribes the idea of a power a very great power which is interested in conduct sanctions conduct but is not asked for material benefits have or had all the american and african peoples whom i have cited a highest power often unconciliated if so why did they invent these beings certainly not to play with them at the game of do ut des yet that game was the origin of religion according to sir alfred and mr frazer the facts must be mentioned must be disproved before the theory of do ut des can be established even if we accepted the theory of euthyphro and of mr frazer it is beset by difficulties religion is the despair of magic says the theory magic is found by the higher minds to be a failure rain is not produced nor sunshine nor food as a result of magic consequently invisible powers like himself but far stronger are invented by man they are immortal and are asked to take mans immortal spirit home to them yet they are mortal themselves they are so dependent on man these beings which are far stronger that man actually has to sacrifice his kings to them annually to keep these far stronger beings in vigour i am willing to suppose with mr frazer a very gradual process of evolution in religious thought man began by thinking his own magic all powerful he found that a failure and came to rest as in a quiet haven after a tempestuous voyage in a new system of faith and practice a substitute however precarious for that magical sovereignty over nature which he had reluctantly abdicated to be sure he had not abdicated greek and babylonic magic are especially notorious but let us fancy that man at large but gradually reached the conception of powers far higher than himself they were very limited powers at first they helped him but he had to help them to the extent sometimes of killing his kings annually to keep them in health this is mr frazers position but if our australian evidence is correct this theory is baseless that is why our evidence cannot be neglected it is another difficulty that the more man ought to be finding out the fallacy of magic the less does he find it out mr frazer chooses the arunta of central australia as a people wholly without religion but universally magicians i have frequently read the account of arunta magic by messrs spencer and gillen but i never found that it included a belief like this a man god draws his extraordinary power from a certain sympathy with nature he is defined not as an incarnation of a god of an order different from and superior to man but as only a superior sorcerer where most men are sorcerers he is not merely the receptacle of a divine spirit we have just been told that he is not the receptacle of a divine spirit at all and we shall take it to be so his whole being body and soul is so attuned to the harmony of the world that a touch of his hand or a turn of his head may send a thrill vibrating through the universal framework of things but you will look in vain for this portentous belief among the arunta who not having found out the fallacy of magic have not invented beings superior to man for this sorcerer of the very highest magic you have to go to the civilisation of japan or to the peoples on the congo much more civilised than the aruntathese peoples by mr frazers theory had experience and intelligence enough to find out the fallacy of magic and had gods in great plenty but they have carried the belief in magic in a magician much superior to his neighbours to a pitch infinitely beyond the arunta yet the arunta have no gods with whom to draw comparisons invidious and unfavourable to magicians they have it is said no gods at all just as magic thus reaches its highest power according to mr frazer where there is most religious competition while the reverse should be the case by his theory so religion flourishes most in australia exactly where by mr frazers theory the circumstances are most unfavourable to religion and most favourable to magic magic by the hypothesis must prosper most its fallacy must be latest discovered it must latest give place to religion where it appears to be most successful and vice versa yet mr frazer assures us that in australia magic flourishes alone where every circumstance demonstrates its failure and religion begins to blossom precisely where magic must seem to its devotees a relative success before examining this apparent inconsistency let us note mr frazers inadvertent proof that his irreligious australians are religious one part of the business of magic is to produce rain in season sun in season and consequently an abundant food supply the dieri of central australia need especially excellent magic in a dry season their lot is a hard one having no religion they ought of course to work by mere materialistic magic like the arunta but they oddly enough call upon the spirits of their remote ancestors which they call mura mura to grant them power to make a heavy rain and then men inspired by the mura mura work magic or pray in signlanguage as you please now the mura mura the raingivers by evidence which mr frazer himself has published is a good spirit not a set of remote ancestral spirits the witness is mr gason than whom says mr frazers authority dr stirling no man living has been more among blacks or knows more of their ways if on this excellent evidence the australian dieri call for rain to a good spirit then they have religion which mr frazer denies but if mr siebert a german missionary is right and mr frazer as we saw prefers his view to that of mr gason then the mura mura are only ancestral spirits yet to demand the aid of remote ancestral spirits by prayer is religion in fact mr frazer had said of the powerful beings of the southern australians it does not seem that these spirits are ever worshipped but prayer is worship and the dieri pray whether to a good spirit or to ancestral spirits potent over the sky and dwelling therein if this is not religion by mr frazers own definition namely a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man which are believed to direct and control the course of nature what is religion yet in australia nobody dreams of propitiating gods or spirits by prayer and sacrifice says our author none the less they call upon the spirits of their remote ancestors which they call mura mura to grant them power to make a heavy rain after ceremonies magical or more prayers in signlanguage the mura mura at once cause clouds to appear in the sky they see the signs which their worshippers are making here then we have prayer to powers superior to man whether to the good spirit or to ancestral spirits and that on evidence collected by mr frazer occurs in a country where fourteen pages earlier he had assured us that nobody thinks of propitiating gods or spirits by prayer and sacrifice sacrifice happily there is none the dieri have not degenerated to sacrificing human victims like the greeks the scene is central australia where the pitiless sun beats down for months together out of a blue and cloudless sky on the parched and gaping earth consequently rainmaking magic must perpetually prove a failure therefore i presume the dieri have been driven into religion by discovering the fallacy of magic this would be a logical argument but mr frazers argument is the converse of what i suggest and contradicts his theory he dubiously grants the existence of possible faint germs of religion in the southeastern parts of australia where the conditions of life in respect of climate water and vegetation are more favourable than elsewhere it is worth observing that in the same regions which thus exhibit the germs of religion the organisation of society and the family has also made the greatest advance the cause is probably the same in both cases namely a more plentiful supply of food due to the greater fertility of the soil now according to mr frazers whole argument the confessed failure of magic is the origin of religion but in central australia where magic notoriously fails most conspicuously to supply water and vegetation magic flourishes to the entire exclusion of religion except among the dieri on the other hand in southeastern australia where magic if practised is abundantly rewarded by more water and more vegetation there these proofs of the success of magic are probably the cause of the germs of religion but by mr frazers hypothesis what must be the apparent success of magic in securing a more plentiful supply of food ought to encourage the belief in magic and prevent religion from even germinating on the other hand the successful result of magic for to what else can a people of sorcerers attribute the better food supply has been probably the cause of the first germs of religion how can these things be all this time one tribe of central australia the arunta remains resolutely godless in spite of all temptations to join denominations of a religious character for the arunta live in the worst country the most rainless and therefore their magic is most manifestly a failure yet unlike the natives of southeastern australia where magic is most successful the arunta cling to magic and have developed no religion if so as of all rainmaking magic theirs is about the most unsuccessful they must be very stupid or they would detect the failure and fly to religion a quiet haven after a tempestuous voyage the arunta are very far from stupid they have the most complete and adequate of savage metaphysics if then they have not approached superior powers in face of the failure of their magic it may be that they have tried and discarded religion religion for the women and the children magic for men appears to be the arunta motto not so very uncivilised this i suggest because mr frazer tells us that at the initiatory rites of the arunta the women and children believe that the roaring noise of the wooden slat tied to a string and swung about is the voice of the great spirit twanyirika a great spirit above all if spelled with capital letters is rather a religious conception this spirit the women are told lives in wild and inaccessible regions both uninitiated youths and women are taught to believe in the existence of twanyirika so write messrs spencer and gillen our only sources a brief note is all that these inquirers give in their copious book to the great spirit this belief they say is fundamentally the same as that found in all australian tribes now in the tribes reported on by mr howitt the spirit whose voice is the sound of the slat or bull roarer called the tundun and by other names is the son or other deputy of baiame or some such powerful good being munganngaur pirnmeheal bunjil noorele or by whatever style he may be called one of his duties is to superintend the bora or mysteries of the tribes the wiraijuri believe that their type of twanyirika was destroyed for misconduct by his superior baiame this sinful great spirit was called daramulun but in other tribes daramulun is apparently the superior and goes on existing he is says mr howitt the great master the father the sky dweller the institutor of society the power whose voice calls to the rain to fall and make the grass green he is the moral being for whom the boys are made so that daramulun likes them a process involving cries of nga good so says mr howitt his attributes and powers where he is supreme are precisely those of baiame who by mr ridley and many others is spoken of as a maker if i may not say creator it was in two years before publishing his gurre kamilaroi in which baiame was used for god that mr ridley asked a kamilaroi man do you know baiame he said kamil zaia zummi baiame zaia winuzgulda i have not seen baiame i have heard or perceived him they hear him in the thunder among this tribe daramulun was not the superior he was author of disease and medical skill of mischief and wisdom also he appears in the form of a serpent at their assemblies like asclepius and the american hobamok though mr ridley is a missionary i venture to cite him because his evidence goes back nearly fifty years to a time when the blacks had less contact with europeans moreover mr ridley is corroborated by mr howitt and other laymen while mr frazer even prefers the evidence of a german missionary to that of mr gason a lay englishman of the greatest experience mr howitt finds among the kurnai tundun as the patron of the mysteries and the bull roarer like twanyirika in mr mannings tribe the same role is taken by moodgeegally under the control of boyma we have thus five or six parallels to the twanyirika of the godless arunta and all are subordinate to a higher power if then as messrs spencer and gillen tell us the belief in the arunta twanyirika the great spirit is fundamentally the same as that found in all the australian tribes twanyirika ought to have a much more powerful benevolent superior in that case the arunta would incline to think there is a god or something very like one as clough says if so as they do not propitiate him they did not conceive him as a partner in the game of do ut des but our only witnesses messrs spencer and gillen are extremely reticent about twanyirika nothing is said about his having a superior and i assume that he has none it seems to follow that he is a mere mumbo jumbo or bogle devised by the men to keep the women and children in order but in southeastern australia if i may trust mr howitts evidence to which mr frazer does not here allude the counterpart of twanyirika is a mere servant of a much higher being everywhere called by names meaning our father therefore either our father baiame munganngaur and the rest have been developed out of a sportive bugbear like twanyirika or twanyirika if he really has no superior is a rudimentary survival of a belief like that in munganngaur and his subordinate tundun in the former case twanyirika a germ of the more advanced religion of southeastern australia was not invented as a power behind nature who might be useful if propitiated as in mr frazers theory in the latter case the arunta do not represent man prior to religion as mr frazer holds but man who has cast off religion but mr frazer does not seem to notice this dilemma the evidence for what most people call religion among the australian natives is so far from scanty that one finds it when looking for other matters as i am going to show true in the following report the religion does not answer to mr frazers definition no powerful being is here said to be conciliated or propitiated he is only said to exist and favour morality but mr frazers definition if pressed produces the effect of arguing in a vicious circle his theory asserts that powerful beings are only invented by man in view of mans tardy discovery that his own magic is powerless the invented beings are then propitiated for selfish ends and that by the definition is religion if we produce as we do evidence that the belief in powerful beings has been evolved and yet that these beings are certainly not propitiated by sacrifice and seldom if ever by prayer that they are only won by conduct and by rites not involving sacrifice mr frazer can reply perhaps but by my definition that kind of belief is not religion then what is it what else can you call it its existence if proved is fatal to mr frazers theory of the origin of religion in the despair of magic because the faithful of the belief of which i speak do not usually implore the god to do for them what magic has failed to do their belief satisfies their speculative and moral needs it does not exist to supply their temporal wants yet it is none the less but much the more a religion on that account except by mr frazers definition if religion is to be defined as he defines it a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man and so on religion can only have arisen as it does in his theory setting aside a supernormal revelation but if we do not deny the name of religion to the speculative belief in a power superior to man and to the moral belief that he lends a supernormal sanction to conduct and to the emotional belief that he loves his children then the belief is religion but something other than religion as defined by mr frazer nobody will deny the name of religion to such a belief mr frazer says i would ask those who dissent from my conclusions to make sure that they mean the same thing by religion that i do for otherwise the difference between us may be more apparent than real i mean by religion what mr frazer means and more the conciliation of higher powers by prayer and sacrifice is religion but it need not be the whole of religion the belief in a higher power who sanctions conduct and is a father and a loving one to mankind is also religion few if any will dispute the fact but this belief if unaccompanied as in australia by prayer and sacrifice cannot be accounted for on mr frazers theory that religion was invented for worldly ends after the recognised failure of magic which aimed at the same ends fruitlessly it is only by limiting his definition of religion as he does that he can establish his theory of the origin of religion it is only by omitting mention of the evidence for what nobody else can deny to be religion that he can secure his theory i return to my additional evidence for australian religion as will be seen it does not come within mr frazers definition but will anybody deny that the belief is religious the evidence is that of mr a l p cameron and contains a brief comparative glossary of words used by different tribes of new south wales to indicate the same objects mr cameron had been interested in the black fellows since at least when their numbers were much larger than at present he had seen gatherings of from to the tribes chiefly in question dwelt along the murrumbidgee and murray rivers and do not include the kamilaroi the kurnai and coast murring of whom mr howitt speaks as to religion ghosts of the dead are believed to visit the earth and to be frequently seen the blacks will often resort to peculiar devices to avoid mentioning the names of the dead a practice hostile to the development of ancestor worship no ghost of a man can grow into a god if his name is tabooed and therefore forgotten the people of all these tribes appear to have a belief in a deity and in a future state of some kind the wathi wathi call this being thathapali the tatathi call him tulong mr cameron could not obtain translations of these names any more than we know the meaning of the names apollo or artemis the being is regarded as a powerful spirit or perhaps a supreme supernatural being they say that he came from the far north and now lives in the sky he told each tribe what language they were to speak he made men women and dogs and the latter used to talk but he took the power of speech from them the tatathi do not care to speak much of tulong and say that he does not often come to the earth although it seems that in many of the australian tribes there is only a very dim idea as to the attributes of the supreme being and of a future state yet in the tatathi and its allied tribes there is certainly a belief not only in a future state of existence but also in a system of rewards and punishments my tatathi informant stated that one of the doctors ascended long ago through the sky and there saw a place where wicked men were roasted mr cameron of course had the strongest suspicions of a place so ostensibly christian to this we return these tribes practise the bora rites or initiatory mysteries if women witness them the penalty is death the penalty for revealing the secrets is probably the same mr cameron unlike mr howitt has not been initiated and does not know the full secret the presiding being like the twanyirika of the arunta is called thuremlin who i conjecture is daramulun in his subordinate capacity their belief in the power of thuremlin is undoubted whereas the arunta adults do not appear to believe in twanyirika a mere bugbear of the women and children the bull roarer is kalari or among the tatathi kalk or kallak that is to say word concerning the instruction given to the boys and described by mr howitt mr cameron not being initiated gives no information as to the future life mr cameron received his account from a tribesman named makogo an intelligent member of the wathi wathi tribe the belief was that current before his people came into contact with europeans and makogo expressed an opinion that whether right or wrong they would have been better off now had their beliefs never been disturbed probably makogo was right the beliefs were in a future state of reward or punishment european contact does not import but destroy the native form of this creed the wathi wathi belief answers in character to the creeds expressed in the egyptian book of the dead the fijian hymns the famous orphic gold talisman of petilia the red indian belief published by kohl and to many other examples the way of souls as in these ancient or savage beliefs is beset by dangers and temptations to which the egyptian book of the dead is a guidebook if any one desires to maintain that this australian idea held before contact with europeans and now to some extent abandoned after that contact is of christian origin we know this argument he must suppose that the wathi wathi adapted the idea from our old lyke wake dirge when brig o dread is over and past every night and all to whinny muir thou comest at last and christ receive thy saul a weak point there is the soul of the wathi wathi after death is met by another soul who directs him to the road for good men but the natives had no roads the opponent will reply they have trade routes and markets however and barter of articles made in special localities goes on across hundreds of miles of country let us allow that the wathi wathi may know a clean path or track from a dirty one the soul meets a dirty and a clean path the good soul being instructed chooses the dirty path the other path is kept clean by bad spirits in order to induce the unthinking to follow it as bunyans mr ignorance unwarily chose a bypath into hell the soul next meets a woman who tries to seduce him he escapes her lures and comes to two women who try to trip him by whirling a rope one of them is blind and the soul evades her next comes a deep narrow gap in which flames rise and fall the good soul watches the fall of the flames and leaps across there is no brig o dread bed indian souls cross by a log which nearly spans the abyss two old women meet the good soul and take him to the deity thathapuli he tests the souls strength and skill by making him throw a nullanulla when the wathi wathi see a shooting star they believe it to be the passage of such a nullanulla through space and say thathapuli is trying the strength of some new spirit the soul of a bad man if it escapes the traps set for it is sure to fall into the hell of fire many of the natives have had their beliefs modified by contact with the whites and i feel doubtful says mr cameron whether the pit of fire was not of this kind and questioned my informant very closely on the subject but he assured me that there was no doubt whatever that the above was the exact belief before the settlement of the country by the white men it is the standing reply of believers in the borrowing theory that a native crossexamined will always agree with whatever the european inquirer wishes him to say the natives examined by mr cameron mrs langloh parker mr howitt mr manning and others were exceptions they would not allow that their beliefs were borrowed this particular form of native belief is exactly analogous to that of ancient egypt of greece of fiji and so on not to the doctrine of our missionaries the believers in borrowing must therefore say that the wathi wathi stole heaven hell and the ways thither from missionaries and adapted them accidentally coinciding with egyptians greeks red indians fijians aztecs and the rest as to a gulf to be crossed and temptations on the way to the abode of the powerful being and the souls of the good the native proverbial explanation of a shooting star establishes as historical fact their belief in thathapuli and his home for good spirits mr frazer has six pages on beliefs about shooting stars one case is to our point the yerrunthally of queensland think that the souls of the dead climb to a place among the stars by a rope when they let the rope fall it appeared to people on earth as a shooting star now if the evidence of mr palmer in the journal of the anthropological institute is good evidence for this australian belief why is the evidence of mr howitt and mr cameron in the same serial to an unborrowed australian religion in this case with thathapuli and his home for good souls unworthy even of mention we fall back on sir alfred lyall i think that one effect of the accumulation of materials has been to encourage speculative generalisation because it has provided a repertory out of which one may make arbitrary selection of examples and precedents to suit any theory here i have the pleasure of agreeing with this great authority mr frazer has chosen australia as the home of magic as a land where magic is but religion has not yet been evolved as i have shown in this and the preceding paper there is abundance of evidence for an unborrowed australian religion i shall abandon the evidence so soon as it is confuted but i cannot reject it while the witnesses are treated as good on many other points but are unmentioned just when their testimony if true seems inconsistent with a theory of the priority of magic to religion by the concurring testimony of a crowd of observers writes mr tylor it is known that the natives of australia were at their discovery and have ever since remained a race with minds saturated with the most vivid belief in souls demons and deities what can a young student commencing anthropologist think when he compares mr tylors concurring testimony of a crowd of observers of australian religion with mr frazers remark that there are some faint beginnings of religion in southern australia but that traces of a higher faith where they occur are probably sometimes due to european influence though the people mr tylor says were in all things so saturated with the most vivid belief in souls demons and deities at their discovery there is no use in building a theory of the origin of religion on the case of australia till we are at least told about the concurring testimony of a crowd of observers that mr frazer has some reason for disregarding the testimonies which i have cited that he must have grounds for doubting their validity i feel assured but the grounds for the doubt are not apparent and to

many recent theories concerning the origin of religion certainly the most impressive is mr frazers hypothesis as to the origin of the belief in the divinity of christ unlike several modern speculations mr frazers is based on an extraordinary mass of erudition we are not put off with vague and unvouchedfor statements or with familiar facts extracted from the collections of mr tylor lord avebury and mr herbert spencer mr frazer does not collect knowledge as his babylonian kings are supposed by him to have been sacrificed by proxy no writer is so erudite and few are so exact in their references while venturing to differ from mr frazer i must often as it were make use of his own ammunition in this war let me say sincerely that i am not pitting my knowledge or industry against his i rather represent the student who has an interest in these subjects and peruses the golden bough not as the general reader does but with some care and with some verification of the citations and sources it is first necessary to state as briefly as possible mr frazers hypothesis as to the origin of the belief in the divinity of our lord or at least as to what he thinks a very powerful factor in the evolution of that creed the babylonians he holds and their persian conquerors were wont yearly at a vernal feast to dress a condemned criminal in the royal robes to enthrone him to obey him to grant him access to the ladies of the royal harem and then at the end of five days to strip whip and hang him the reason why they acted thus mr frazer guesses was that the condemned man acted as proxy for the divine king of babylon who in an age less civilised had been sacrificed annually so mr frazer conjectures the king was thus sacrificed as a being of divine or magical nature a mangod and the object according to mr frazer was to keep providing the god or magical influence resident in him with a series of fresh human vehicles it appears or may appear to be mr frazers opinion though the point is stated rather casually and late in the long argument that the king himself was believed to incarnate a known and recognised god of vegetation a personal principle of vegetable life the kings proxy therefore the condemned criminal is sacrificed by hanging in a character at once royal as representing the king and divine since the king incarnates a god all this occurs by one of the theories advanced at about the time of year in which our easter falls at a feast called zakmuk in babylonian in persian by the theory sacaea a period of hard drinking and singular licence the jews by the theory or by one of the theories had probably no such feast or custom before they were carried into exile in babylonia but from the babylonians and persians mr frazer holds that they probably borrowed the festival which they styled purim and also borrowed the custom historically unheard of among them of crowning stripping flogging and hanging a mockking a condemned criminal in march it does not appear that this man in judaea was allowed to invade the harem for example of herod as in the case of the persian royal harem the jews also are conjectured to have borrowed a practice presumed by mr frazer to have perhaps prevailed at babylon of keeping a pair of condemned criminals one of them was hanged the other was set free for the year the first died as an incarnation of the god of vegetable life the second set free represented in a pseudoresurrection the first and also represented i understand the revival of the god of vegetable life the first man was called haman probably in origin humman a deity of the vanquished foes of babylon the elamites the second man in hebrew mordecai probably represented merodach or marduk the supreme god of the victorious babylonians each man had a female consort probably in babylon a sacred harlot haman had vashti probably an elamite goddess mordecai had esther doubtless ishtar the venus of the babylonian creed these ladies do not occur in any account of the babylonian or persian feasts nor in the gospels their existence is a conjecture the victims as descending from the babylonian and persian criminals who stood both for the king and also at least in some parts of the theory for a god of vegetation were conceived of as divine since christ by what looks like a chapter of accidents was put to death as one of these mockkings he inherited their recognised divinity and his mission which had been mainly that of a moral lecturer at once was surrounded by a halo of divinity such in brief if i follow mr frazer is the contention which i must repeat is presented as the combination of many hypotheses into a single theory offered for criticism to myself after studying mr frazers theory with such care as it deserves an hypothesis of its evolution presents itself before writing the first edition of the golden bough mr frazer had become acquainted with a statement which dio chrysostom a greek rhetorician of the first century puts into the mouth of diogenes the cynic in an imaginary dialogue with alexander the great in this essay diogenes is made to tell alexander about the persian custom of yearly dressing up a condemned criminal in royal robes at the feast called sacaea allowing him to live like a king for five days giving him the entree of the royal harem and then stripping scourging and hanging or crucifying him the resemblance of dios words to the account of the mockery of christ is very remarkable mr frazer tells us that he saw this resemblance in but could not explain it in he became acquainted with a legend written in greek of the martyrdom of st dasius a roman christian soldier in moesia ad according to this legend dasius was drawn by lot as the yearly victim who the story says was made to represent king saturnus for a month of military revelry and then was sacrificed or obliged to slay himself beside saturns altar at the close of the saturnalia dasius declined the part and was put to death here then in moesia if we believe the legend of st dasius was a mockking personating a god sacrificed to a god and therefore himself it may be regarded as divine at the other extreme in jerusalem was christ who after mock royal honours was scourged crucified and acquired a halo of divinity the middle term was the criminal who in the character of a mockking was stripped scourged and hanged in the persian feast there was no trace in persia of sacrifice of a victim in the technical sense or of any halo of divinity but mr frazer was familiar with barbaric kings who are or were put to death to save them from dying naturally or after a fixed term of years in his opinion they are killed to provide the god whom they incarnate with a fresh vehicle combining all these facts and strongly drawn by the resemblance of dios anecdote to the narratives of the crucifixion mr frazer adopted the argument that the criminal executed at the sacaea in babylon had once been like the saturn sufferer in moesia a divine victim not at first hanged but sacrificed yearly to redeem the life of the persian king who in earlier ages must himself have been a yearly sacrifice the divinity inherited by the criminal from that divine king was transmitted by a succession of executed malefactors to the victim of calvary the ingenuity of the idea is undeniable but it appears to me that the authors mind was throughout unconsciously drawn to the crucifixion this attraction became a mental prepossession in a recent work fact and fable in psychology boston us professor jastrow has illustrated mental prepossession by a common and trivial experience a beginner in the art of bicycling is unconsciously drawn into collision with every obstacle on the road which his conscious self is doing its best to avoid in the same way i fancy our authors mind was led straight to an explanation of the halo of divinity round the cross instead of to what was needed first an explanation of the persian custom isolated and examined only in the light of its attendant circumstances as described in our very scanty information had our author examined the circumstances of the persian custom with an intellect unattracted by the hope of throwing new light on the crucifixion and uninfluenced by a tendency to find gods of vegetation almost every where he would have found i think that they admit of being accounted for in a simple manner granting that our information is true there was as far as we are informed no sacrifice at the sacaea and in that persian festival nothing religious the religious element has to be imported by aid of remote inference daring conjecture and even i venture to say some disregard of documentary history the consequence as i shall try to show is that the theory has in the regent morays words to pass over the bellies of innumerable obstacles by aid of a series of conjectures increasing in difficulty thus the readers powers of acquiescence are strained afresh at the introduction of each new trial of his faith if one stage out of so many stages of remote inference and bold presumption is unstable the whole edifice falls to the ground meanwhile we shall have to offer a simple explanation of the circumstances of the sacaean victim only in a single instance demanding the use of one of mr frazers own conjectures itself a legitimate hypothesis the remainder of this essay is concerned with an examination of the difficulties of his theory and of the bridges of hypothesis by which the yawning chasms are to be crossed v the approaches to mr frazers theory i the evolution of gods rites so remarkable as those of the pair of criminals supposed to have played their parts in babylon and jerusalem each with his female mate are not historically known but are part of mr frazers theory and have analogies in folklore institutions so unparalleled as a whole in our knowledge of human religion cannot have been evolved except through a long series of grades of development mr frazer traces these grades throughout the pages of his book there are in accordance with the method large sections of the work devoted to illustrative examples of matters which do not bear directly on the main stream of the argument and these are apt by the very abundance of their erudition to distract attention from the central hypothesis to that i try to adhere through its numerous ramifications to account then for these hypothetical rites of the double pairs of divinised human beings we are to suppose that before attaining the earliest germs of religion men were addicted to magic a theory which we have already examined in the essay magic and religion they believed that by imitating the cosmic processes they could control or assist them thus the arunta of central australia have magical rites by which they assist the development of larvae into grubs increase and improve the breed and reproductive energies of kangaroos foster the growth of edible tubers and bring down rain these rites are harmless and involve no sacrifices human or animal for the arunta we are to believe have no god to accept offerings but as men advanced from almost the lowest savagery they gradually attained to higher material culture developing the hitherto unknown arts of agriculture developing also religion in the despair of magic developing gods and evolving social and political rank with kings at the head of society in disgust with their old original magic by which they had supposed that they controlled cosmic forces and animal and vegetable life they invented gods and spirits who as they fancied did really exercise cosmic control these gods they propitiated by prayer and sacrifice but though it was in the despair of magic that men invented gods and religion yet as men will they continued to exercise the magic of which they despaired they persisted like the godless arunta in imitating the processes of nature in the belief which after all they had not abandoned that such imitation magically aided the efforts of nature or of the gods of nature men now evolved three species of god from one or other of which descends the godhead of the persian criminal whipped and hanged and the divinity of christ first there were gods of an order different from and superior to man second there were men in whom these superior gods became incarnate third there were men who were merely better magicians than their neighbours sensitives who trembled at a touch of nature and at whose touch nature trembled it is not in thought difficult to draw a firm line between these two kinds of mangods though magic and religion overlap and shade into each other the distinction of the two types the man incarnating god and the sorcerer with no god to incarnate is absolutely essential and must be kept firmly in mind mr frazer says in what follows i shall not insist on it on this essential distinction essential it is for the second sort the magical sort of mangod may by mr frazers theory be prior to all religion he is only a high kind of sorcerer a dealer in magic and spells the other kind of mangod comes in after magic is despaired of and gods are invented i shall insist on the distinction the growth of society was advancing and developing at the same time as religion and agriculture the original sorcerer or medicineman or magicworker through his influence on his neighbours was apt to acquire leadership and to accumulate property as indeed i myself remarked long ago in an essay on the origin of rank in mr frazers theory these magicmen finally develop into both kings or chiefs and mangods i have observed that there is often a lay or secular king or chief a warleader beside them his position if it becomes hereditary is apt to end in leaving the mangodking on one side in a partly magical partly religious but not secular kingship whence it may evolve into a priesthood carrying the royal title the man is more or less a mangod more or less a priest more or less a controller of cosmic processes but is still a titular king of course all sorts of varieties occur in these institutions the general result is the divinity of kings and their responsibility for the luck of the state and for the weather and crops if the luck the weather and the crops are bad the public asks who is to be punished for this under a constitution such as our own the public notoriously makes the government responsible for the luck a general election dismisses the representatives of the party in power but four hundred years ago and previously executions took the place of mere loss of office the heads of the boyds of morton or of gowrie fell when these nobles lost office in the earlier society with which we are dealing the king as responsible for the weather and crops is sometimes punished in bad times the banjars beat the king till the weather changes elsewhere the king is imprisoned or in a more constitutional manner merely deposed there are traces of actually killing the unlucky and responsible monarch in sweden he is said in a time of public distress to have been not only killed but sacrificed to odin this is not however an historical statement ii the alleged mortality of gods there were other magicoreligious reasons for killing kings mr frazer writes lacking the idea of eternal duration primitive man naturally supposes the gods to be mortal like himself here is i venture to think a notable fault in the argument early men contrary to mr frazers account suppose themselves to be naturally immortal the myths of perhaps all races tell of a time when death had not yet entered the world man was born deathless death came in by an accident or in consequence of an error or an infraction of a divine command to this effect we have zulu australian maori melanesian central african vedic aryan kamschadal and countless other myths not to speak of the first chapters of genesis in the thought of immortality early man is cradled his divine beings are usually regarded as prior to and unaffected by the coming of death which invades men but not these beings or not most of them indeed some low savages have not yet persuaded themselves that death is natural amongst the central australian natives say spencer and gillen there is no such thing as belief in natural death however old or decrepit a man or woman may be when this takes place it is at once supposed that it has been brought about by the magic influence of some enemy and it is avenged on the enemy as in the bloodfeud these australians in mr frazers opinion though not in mine are primitive thus far from lacking the idea of eternal duration of life primitive man has no other idea not that he formulates his idea in such a term as eternal mariner says indeed concerning the tongan supreme being taliytooboo of his origin they had no idea rather supposing him to be eternal but in tongan the metaphysical idea of eternity is only expressed in the meaning of the gods name waittheretooboo this god occasionally inspires the how or elective king but the how was never sacrificed to provide the god with a sturdier incarnation a process which mr frazers theory of the divinity of christ demands as customary being eternal taliytooboo was independent of a human vehicle these facts must be remembered for it is indispensable to mr frazers theory to prove that the immortals are believed to a sufficient extent to be mortal hence the supposed need of killing divine kings their vehicles primitive man according to mr frazer thinks his gods mortal but primitive man by his initial hypothesis had no gods at all mr frazer clearly means that when man was no longer primitive he conceived the gods to be mortal like himself i have elsewhere given many examples of the opposite belief among races of many grades of culture from the australian blacks to the immortal gods of homer the point will be found to be important later and i must firmly express my opinion that so long as people believe their gods to be alive and testify that belief by prayers hymns and sacrifices it is impossible to argue from a few local and contradictory and easily explicable myths that these peoples believe their gods to be dead or in danger of dying here i think the common sense of students will agree with me however as this general and pervading belief in the mortality of the gods is absolutely essential to mr frazers argument perhaps the point had better be settled as examples of belief in the fact that the god is dead we have the greenlanders the greenlanders believed that a wind could kill their most powerful god and that he would certainly die if he touched a dog mr tylor on the other hand tells us that to i the summerland of the greenland deity beneath the sea greenland souls hope to descend at death let us trust that no dogs are admitted this greenland divine being torngarsuk i so clearly held his place as supreme deity in the native mind that as cranz the missionary relates many greenlanders hearing of god and his almighty power were apt to fall on the idea that it was their torngarsuk who was meant the greenland deity was unborrowed he seems no figure derived from the religion of scandinavian colonists ancient or modern from cranzs evidence and much more might be cited the most powerful god of the greenlanders was not dead nor likely to die in spite of the apprehensions of certain greenlanders communicated to a person not named by mr frazer but quoted in a work of at the best the greenland evidence is contradictory all greenlanders did not agree with mr frazers greenland authority nor was the accuser of the brethren currently believed to be deceased when the ancient folksong assures us that some say the deils deid the deils deid the deils deid some say the deils deid and buried in kirkcaldy some say hes risen again risen again risen again some say hes risen again to dance the hieland laddie risen again he was and did dance the hieland laddie at gledsmuir and falkirk the volkslied scientifically represents the conflict of opinion as unsettled despite the testimony of the grave of satan at the lang toun of kirkcaldy like the grave of zeus in crete mr frazer then ought not i think to assume a general belief in the mortality of greenland gods in face of contradictory but uncited evidence a north american indian told colonel dodge that the great spirit that made the world is dead long ago he could not possibly have lived so long as this now this was the ipse dixit and personal inference of a vague modern north american indian living in an age which as mr frazer remarks must breach those venerable walls of belief to prove his case mr frazer needs to find examples of the opinion that the great spirit was believed to be dead if he grants that there ever existed an american belief in a great spirit among the american indians as first studied by europeans i have elsewhere argued that the supreme being of most barbaric races is regarded as otiose inactive and so may come to be a mere name and byword like the huron atahocan who made everything and the unkulunkulu of the zulus who has been so thrust into the background by the competition of ancestral spirits that his very existence is doubted in process of time we have come to worship the spirits only because we know not what to say about unkulunkulu we seek out for ourselves the spirits that we may not always be thinking about unkulunkulu in the same way throughout the beliefs of barbaric races the competition of friendly and helpful spirits pushes back such beings as the australian baiame and munganngaur who exist where sacrifice to ancestral spirits has not yet been developed and the canadian andouagni of thus a modern north american indian may infer and may tell colonel dodge that the creator is dead because he is not in receipt of sacrifice or prayer but the cult of such high beings where it existed and still exists in north america the cult of tirawa with whom the pawnees expect to live after death of the blackfoot napi of ahone okeus kiehtan and the rest proves belief in gods who are alive and who are not said to be in any danger of death a tribe of philippine islanders told the spanish conquerors that the grave of the creator was on the top of mount cabunian so the philippine islanders did believe in a creator the grave may have been the result of the usual neglect of the supreme being already explained or may have meant no more than the grave of zeus in crete while zeus was being worshipped all over the greek world heitsi eibib of the hottentots had a number of graves accounted for by the theory of successive lives and deaths but so had tammuz and adonis yearly lives and deaths yet the god was en permanence the graves of greek gods maybe due to euhemerism a theory much more ancient than euhemerus people who worship ancestral spirits sometimes argue like mr herbert spencer that the gods were once spirits of living men and show the mens graves as proofs the bricks are alive to testify to it but that the greeks regarded their gods as mortal cannot be seriously argued while they are always styled the immortals in contrast to mortal men and while apollo who had a grave daily inspired the pythia her death did not hurt apollo she was not sacrificed for the benefit of apollo the grave of zeus was shown to visitors in crete as late as about the beginning of our era but was it shown as early as the time of homer euhemerus was prior to our era the egyptian gods were kings over death and the dead with tombs and mummies in every province but they were also deathless rulers of the world and of men if ra rises in the heavens it is by the will of osiris if he sets it is at the sight of his glory king of eternity great god whoso knoweth humility and reckoneth deeds of righteousness thereby knows he osiris this is a living god and seb and nut can scarcely die despite myth and ritual the gods of egypt lived till they fled from the folding star of bethlehem as to the legend of great pan is dead in the reign of tiberius mr frazer mentions a theory that not pan but adonis or tammuz was dead he was always dying the story is pretty but is not evidence about ad there was a turkish story of the death of the king of the jinn the jinn are not gods but fairies and we have heard of fairy funerals concerning the high gods of babylon it is especially needful for mr frazer to prove that they were believed to be mortal and in danger of death for dr jastrow denies that they are mortal the privilege of the gods is immortality but mr frazers hypothesis derives the doctrine of the divinity of christ from the opinion that he represented in death a long line of victims to a barbarous superstition and that superstition was in mr frazers conjecture that a substitute died for the king of babylon and that the king of babylon died to reinforce the vitality of a mortal god of babylon whose life required a fresh human incarnation annually to prove the babylonian belief in the mortality of the deities mr frazer writes the high gods of babylon also though they appeared to their worshippers only in dreams and visions were conceived to be human in their bodily shape human in their passions and human in their fate for like men they were born into the world and like men they loved and fought and even died how many of them died if they were dead in religious belief how did they manage to attend the great assembly of the gods which as we have seen formed a chief feature of the feast of zakmuk and was held annually in the temple of marduk at babylon did marduk die if so why is he addressed as o merciful one who lovest to give life to the dead marduk king of heaven and earth the spell affording life is thine the breath of life is thine thou restorest the dead to life thou bringest things to completeness supposing again that the king was really sacrificed to keep a god in good condition why only one sacrifice there were at least scores of gods all of them if i understand mr frazer in the same precarious condition of health they appear he might argue to have been especially subject to hepatic diseases o supreme mistress of heaven may thy liver be pacified says a hymn to ishtar of course every one sees that thy liver is only a phrase for thy wrath the liver as in our phrases pluck and lilylivered being taken for the seat of the pluck of men it is manifest that the babylonian gods are not dead but living otherwise they could not attend the yearly divine assembly nor could they be addressed in prayer moreover if they could only be kept alive by yearly sacrificing their human vehicles great holocausts of human vehicles would have been needed every year one man for one god and their name was legion once more if men believed that gods could die unless kept alive by sacrifices of their human vehicles we must say of the greeks that they did not strive officiously to keep alive their deities had the greeks known that this was in their power to do then apollo dionysus cronos zeus hermes aphrodite ares had not died yet die they did if the graves of each of these mortals prove the prevailing belief in their decease mankind according to mr frazer believed in mighty beings who breathed into mans nostrils and made him live he implored them to bring his immortal spirit to some happier world where he might rest with them and so on yet lacking the idea of eternal duration primitive man naturally supposed the gods to be mortal like himself mr frazer has we see also told us that they did not believe their gods to be mortal probably then the belief in their immortality was a late stage in a gradual process yet it had not prevailed when the grave of zeus was shown about the beginning of our era man then believed that he could keep one out of the crowd of gods alive though he implored them to keep him alive by sacrificing his rightful king once a year thereby overthrowing dynasty after dynasty and upsetting the whole organisation of the state all this we must steadfastly believe before we can accept mr frazers theory of the origin of the nicene creed it is a large preliminary demand the gods keep on being immortals and this we must insist on in view of mr frazers theory that mangods who are slain are slain to keep alive the god who is incarnate in them of which he does not give one example his instances of beliefs that the high gods are dead notoriously contradict the prevalent belief that they are deathless and the prevalent belief regulates religion however mangods certainly die and some south sea islanders by a scientific experiment demonstrated that captain cook was no god because he died when stabbed which a genuine god would not have done this of course proves that these benighted heathen knew the difference between an immortal god and a deathly man as well as did anchises in the homeric hymn to aphrodite iii religious regicide peoples who think that all the luck depends on their kingmangod the second sort the superior sorcerer with no god in him hold we are to believe that his luck and cosmic influence wane with his waning forces therefore they kill him and get a more vigorous recipient of his soul not of a god and of his luck of kingkilling for this reason mr eraser gives i think one adequate example of the transmission of the soul of the slain divinity to his successor he has no direct proof though souls of incarnating gods are transmitted after natural deaths now this is a very important part of the longdrawn argument which is to suggest that christ died as a mockking who also represented a god first we have seen that there are two kinds of mangod in one kind a real god of an order different from and superior to man is supposed to become incarnate the other kind of mangod is only a superior sensitive and sorcerer now jesus by mr frazers theory died as representative of a god therefore as one of the first two kinds of mangods but mr frazer does not here as i said produce one solitary example of a mangod proved to be of the first class a king in whom an acknowledged god is incarnate being slain to prevent his inspiring god from waning with the mans waning energies many examples of that practice are needed by the argument i repeat that not one example is produced in this place mr frazers entire argument depends on his announced failure to insist on the distinction between two sorts of mangods which he himself has drawn so i keep on insisting again it can hardly be said that any examples are produced of a king of the second sort a mangod who is really no god at all but a sensitive sorcerer or magicman being slain to preserve the vigour of his magic the examples to be cited all but universally give no proof of the idea of preserving mans magical vigour from the decay of old age the cases given as a rule are mere instances of superannuation it is possible would that it were easy to pension off aged professors in the scottish universities but to pension off a king merely means a series of civil wars the early middle ages tonsured weak kings how tempting to represent this dedication of them to god as a mitigation of sacrifice kings in fact among some barbaric races are slain merely by way of superannuation nay the practice is not confined to kings it is usual among elderly subjects let us take mr frazers examples a congo people believe that the world would perish if their chitome or pontiff died a natural death so he was clubbed or strangled by his successor but what god is incarnate in the chitome none is mentioned the king himself is regarded as a god in earth and all powerful in heaven the ethiopian kings of meroe were worshipped as gods but were ordered to die by the priests on the authority of an alleged oracle of the gods whenever the priests chose that they first showed any signs of decay we may conjecture we have no evidence except that the priests put an end to the king whenever they chose and far from alleging the kings decay or bad crops as the regular recognised reason they alleged a special oracle of the gods when the king of unyoro in central africa is old or very ill his wives kill him an obvious reason readily occurs it is the wives not a god who need a more spirited person alleging an old prophecy that the throne will pass from the dynasty if the king dies a natural death but it is not here shown that this king is a mangod of either species and the prophecy does not concern injury to a god or to magical rapport the king of kibanga on the upper congo is killed by sorcerers when he seems near his end so are old dogs and cats and horses in this country and peasants are even thought to provide euthanasia for kinsfolk near their end if the king of kibanga is a mangod mr frazer does not say so if wounded in war the king of gingero is killed by his comrades or kinsfolk even if he be reluctant the reason alleged is that he may not die by the hands of his enemies did saul brutus and many other warriors who refuse to survive wounds and defeat die as mangods is the king of gingero a mangod chaka king of the zulus used hairdye having a great aversion to grey hairs the zulus a warlike people would not elect or accept a greyhaired king and though i know no instance of slaying a zulu king because he was old mr isaacs says that grey hair is always followed by the death of the monarch even if an historical example were given a warlike race merely superannuates a disabled warleader in the only safe way at last we reach a kingmangod in sofala who according to dos santos was the only god of the caffres and was implored to give good weather a modern zulu told dr callaway that when people say the heaven is the chiefs they do not believe what they say the sofalese or rather their neighbours were perhaps more credulous and it appears to have been a custom or law among them that a blemished king should kill himself though a reforming prince denounced this as insanity and altered the law we are told that the kinggod of the sofalese was under this law and a neighbouring king who is nowhere said to have been a mangod was but what god if any was incarnate in this mangod if he was a mangod like his neighbour the spartans were warned by an oracle against a lame king as the mackenzies were warned by the brahan seer against a set of physically blemished lairds the seers prophecy was fulfilled we do not hear that the spartans killed any lame king the king of the eyeos is warned to kill himself warned by a gift of parrots eggs when the people have conceived an opinion of his illgovernment his wives strangle him and his son succeeds or did so before when the king refused to die at the request of his ministers to make a case it must be shown that the king was a mangod of one or other variety he is in fact merely king while popular holding the reins of government no longer than whilst he merits the approval of his people the old prussians were governed by a king called gods mouth if he wanted to leave a good name behind when weak and ill he burned himself to death in front of a holy oak in quilacare in southern india the king cut himself to pieces before an idol after a twelve years reign we are not told that he was an incarnation of the god if any incorporated in or represented by the idol the king of calicut on the malabar coast used to cut his throat in public after a twelve years reign about this was commuted if any man could cut his way through or guardsmen to kill the king he succeeded three men tried but numbers overpowered them other examples are given in which every regicide might become king if he could like macbeth it was held at passier that god would not allow the king to be killed if he did not richly deserve it these kings are not said to incarnate gods ibn batuta once saw a man throw a rope into the air and climb up it another man followed and cut the first to pieces which fell on the ground were reunited and no harm done this veracious traveller also saw a man at java kill himself for love of the sultan thereby securing liberal pensions for his family as his father and grandfather had done before him we may conjecture that formerly the sultans of java like the kings of quilacare and calicut were bound to cut their own throats at the end of a fixed term of years but that they deputed the duty to one certain family we may conjecture but considering the lack of evidence and the stories that ibn batuta freely tells i doubt ibn at the court of delhi saw cups and dishes i at a wish appear and at a wish retire did the sultan of java incarnate a god this case is so extremely involved and hypothetical it concerns sparta where i never heard that the king was a mangod that the reader must be referred to the original meanwhile the list of instances is numerically respectable but are the instances to the point do they prove a practice of killing a royal mangod for the purpose of helping a god incarnate in him or even of preventing his magical power or mana in new zealand from waning they rather prove regicide as a form of superannuation or as the result of the machinations of priests or of public discontent above all they do not demonstrate that the king is ever killed as an incarnation of a deity who needs a sturdier person to be incarnate in so recalcitrant is the evidence that of all mr frazers kings who are here said to be gods or to incarnate gods not one is here said to be put to death by his worshippers and of all his kings who are here said to be put to death not one is here said to incarnate a god such are the initial difficulties of the theory to which we may add that elderly men are notoriously killed by many savages just because they are elderly whether they are kings or commoners mr frazers point is that christ died in a halo of divinity visible wherever men had heard the old old story of the dying and rising god but apart from other objections already urged mr frazers present instances do not contain one example of a dying and rising god stated to be represented by a living man who is therefore killed even if there are one or two cases of a slain king who is a medicineman sorcerer or cosmic sensitive thus the argument fails from the first christ is to be reckoned divine as representing a king who was killed as an incarnation of a god but of regicide for this reason no proof is afforded as far as i can see iv annual religious regicide next we arrive at an absolutely necessary hypothesis which i find it difficult to accept in some places it appears that the people could not trust the king to remain in full mental and bodily vigour for more than a year hence at the end of a years reign he was put to death and a new king appointed to reign in his turn a year and suffer death at the end of it when the time drew near for the king to be put to death in babylon this appears to have been at the end of a single years reign he abdicated for a few days during which a temporary king reigned and suffered in his stead later we read of the time when the real king used to redeem his own life by deputing his son to reign for a short time and die in his stead the hypothesis is then that at babylon the king used to be sacrificed once a year later he appointed a son or some other member of the royal family or some one else to die for him while last of all a criminal was chosen is not this a startling hypothesis yet on it the whole argument about the divinity of christ depends mr frazer overestimates human ambition we wonder that moray lennox and morton pined to be regents of scotland yet at least they had a faint chance of escaping death within the year but the kings of babylon had no chance they were sacrificed annually mr frazer asks us to suppose that any men of royal race anywhere men free and noble not captives not condemned criminals would accept a crown followed in days by a death of fire a child knows that no men have ever acted in this way even if they were so incredibly unlike all other human beings as to choose a years royalty followed by burning to death how was the succession regulated even the primitive arunta naked savages in central australia have a kind of magistrate merely a convener called the alatunja the head man of a local totemic group he is an hereditary official inheriting in the male line does any one believe that a poor black man would accept the alatunjaship if he knew he was to be roasted and so die at the end of a year now the babylonians or rather the persians were infinitely more civilised than the arunta their kings were hereditary kings how then would mr frazers system work the king is sacrificed his eldest son succeeds is sacrificed next year they soon work through the royal family thus in scotland darnley is sacrificed next year you sacrifice the baby james vi next year you begin on the hamiltons chatelherault lasts a year then arran then lord john then lord claude beginning in you work out that result in then you start on the lennox stewarts you have lennox offered up in his son charles in and by the end of the century you have exhausted the female and illegitimate branches of the royal family you can only sacrifice males and these must be adults for each sacrificed man by mr frazers theory has to consort before his death with a lady probably a sacred harlot mr frazer perhaps will say these babylonian kings were polygamous and had large families of sons but think of the situation when the king comes to providing a son as a substitute to reign for a few days and be sacrificed in his stead he may be a young king just married even if he could count on a male baby or a score of them annually they would be of no use they could not consort with the sacred harlot which is indispensable so after the young king is sacrificed we are in a quandary we must overlook primogeniture and begin sacrificing the kings brothers they will not last long we fall back on the cousins soon we need a new dynasty now no government could be carried on in the circumstances imagined by mr frazer the country would not stand it no individual king would ever accept the crown human beings never had such a preposterous institution but if they had not mr frazers whole theory of the crucifixion is baseless for it all hangs on the yearly sacrifice of the divine king in babylon where there is no historical evidence of annual regicide we must appeal to our general knowledge of human nature the reply is that the thing is impossible moreover that sacrifice is wholly without evidence the only reason for believing that the kings of the great babylonian empire or even the kings of babylon when it may have been a small autonomous town were sacrificed once a year is the faint testimony existing to show that once a year at a persian feast a mockking was hanged to account for that hanging mr frazer has to invent the hypothesis that real kings in olden times were annually sacrificed the only corroboration of actual fact is in the savage instances of king killing not annual which we have explained as in most cases a rude form of superannuation in no case as certainly the deliverance of a recognised god incarnate in the king there are also instances in folklore of yearly mock executions of a king of the may or the like and a dubious case in lower moesia these do not prove annual sacrifices of actual kings in the past if they prove any sacrifice at all in these circumstances i venture to hold science requires us if we must explain the alleged yearly hanging of a mockking at babylon to look for a theory an hypothesis which does not contradict all that we know of human nature for all of human nature that we know is contradicted by the fancy that the kings of babylon were once sacrificed annually i shall later produce a theory which at least does not run counter to the very nature of man and so far is legitimate and scientific mr frazer says that his theory will hardly appear extravagant or improbable when we remember that in ngoio the chief who puts on the cap of royalty one day is by the rule killed the next day so nobody puts on the cap and nobody would have put on the babylonian crown under the condition of being roasted to death at the end of the year if the theory were correct the king incarnating a god would be slain yearly but he would not like that and would procure a substitute who would yearly be slain a as a proxy of the king or b as the god of vegetation incarnate in the king or as both yet i repeat not a single instance has been given of a king who is slain for magicoreligious reasons and who is also the incarnation of any god whatever the slain kings in the instances produced were as a rule superannuated because they were old or got rid of because they were unpopular or because a clerical cabal desired their destruction or for some other reason at most and rarely because they were outworn sensitives we know scores of cases of godpossessed men but none are killed because they are godpossessed the argument has thus made no approach to mr frazers theory of the origin of the belief in the divine character of christ and of his doctrine at this point mr frazers theory turns from godmankings slain to preserve their mana or cosmic rapport to persons who suffer for these kings not one single historical proof that there ever was such a custom is adduced all is a matter of inference and conjecture there is we saw a region ngoio in congo where the throne is perpetually vacant because whoever occupied it was killed the day after coronation day no substitute is suggested and no one sits in the siege perilous there are cases of temporary kings as king february for three days in cambodia the temporary king being of a cadet branch of the royal family he is not killed in siam a temporary king for three days conducted a quete or jocular pillaging like our robin hood in scotland this is an example of the period of licence when law is in abeyance and the importance of this period we shall later prove the mockking also ploughed nine furrows and stood later with his right foot on his left knee he did the same thing on a later occasion and omens were drawn from his steadiness he was supposed if firm to conquer evil spirits and had another quete in upper egypt a king of unreason for three days holds mock tribunals then is condemned and his shell is burned probably as i shall show to mean that the gambol has been shown and is over there are two or three similar cases and mr frazer suggests that the mockking is invested with the divine or magical functions of the real king but the local pacha on the nile has no such functions and his august representative wears a tall fools cap none are put to death the upper egyptian case alone and dimly if at all suggests the proxy supposed as in ibn batutas tale interpreted by mr frazer to die for the king next we approach instances of sons of kings who are sacrificed but these are cases of sin offerings as when the king of moab sacrificed his son on the wall and even if the lads were substitutes for their royal fathers there is no presumption raised that the fathers were habitually killed year by year to keep their cosmic rapport unimpaired or to release the god incarnate within them a custom of which i find no example at all one instance of what he conjectures to be a proxy sacrifice for a king mr frazer finds in a festival at babylon called the sacaea to this we return in due order we must first examine cases of similar customs or inferred customs in greece and borne meanwhile we hope to have shown that mr frazers theory of the origin of the belief in the divinity of christ already rests on three scarcely legitimate hypotheses first there is the hypothesis that kings were slain to release a known deity incarnate in them and to provide a better human vehicle of this rite no instances were given next there is the hypothesis that the king of babylon was annually sacrificed and succeeded by a new king who was sacrificed at the end of the year historical evidence does not exist and the supposed custom is beyond belief thirdly we are to believe in proxies or substitutes who die annually for the king of this practice no actual example is adduced here perhaps the reader may be invited to ask himself whether he believes that there ever was anywhere a custom of yearly killing the king the head of the state if he cannot believe this in the entire lack of proof he may admire the faith which can move this mountain in the interests of mr frazers conclusions for my part i may say that i was so hypnotised after first reading through the long roll of mr frazers sad stories of the deaths of kings that i could only murmur but there is no historical evidence for the yearly babylonian or rather persian regicides then i woke out of the hypnotic trance i shook off the drowsy spell of suggestion and exclaimed the king is killed annually next i asked myself whether mortal men would take the crown and how the arrangement would work and alas it was my belief in mr frazers theory that was shattered but the general reader perusing an argument of pages may fall under the hypnotic spell of numerous cases though none are to the point and may accept an hypothesis however violently opposed to his knowledge of human nature to that test we are in a case like this compelled to appeal however little we may value common sense in other fields of speculation ours is the field of normal human nature motive and action in which every man may be a judge i cannot but think that the author of the theory would have been stopped by considerations so obvious and obstacles so insuperable but first he had the remote analogy of the aztec warprisoner who personated a god and to a god was sacrificed that example is of no real service the man was a captive and could not help himself he was not king of anahuac moreover he was sacrificed he was not put to a death of special shame again there was the saturnian victim if we believe the legend about to be narrated but he too was sacrificed he was not stripped scourged and hanged our author however was fascinated by the cross at the end of the long vista of the argument in place therefore of seeking or at least in place of finding a simple explanation of the persian custom or leaving it unexplained he accepted the impossibility of the annual regicide at babylon and was launched into a new wilderness of conjectures and inferences to explain the absence in the persian case of sacrifice and religion the presence of a merrymaking and a hanging v the saturnalia we are next to look for an historical case of the yearly sacrifice not of a king but of a mockking the argument thus carries us to the roman feast of the saturnalia this festival in late times held in december so closely resembled our christmas in jollity that pliny like some of us used to withdraw to the most retired room in his laurentine villa to escape the noise mr frazer does not remark the circumstance but in rome before the empire or earlier the saturnalia seem to have been a feast of one day only among our ancestors says macrobius the saturnalia were completed in a single day though he does not seem very certain of his fact livy says the saturnalia were instituted as a festal day after the time of caligula the saturnalia endured for five days precisely like the feast of the sacaea at babylon of which we are fated to hear a great deal it would thus appear that the saturnalia were originally a feast of one day later lengthened to five days and again to seven days by the time of writers like lucian and martial the feast continued for a week and lucian represents cronos saturn as a jolly old king of unreason the rich helped the poor people made presents to each other a christmas carol philosophy as dickens calls it prevailed the masters served the slaves at table all was licence and riot wax candles were given as presents cerea like those on our christmas trees these cerea according to macrobius were thought by some antiquaries to be substitutes for human sacrifices originally it was said the pelasgi before migrating to italy received an oracle from dodona greek too patri pempete phoota send a man to the father that is to the god cronos or in italy saturn but by a pun on the greek phoota they were induced to substitute lights the wax candles now it is a really astonishing thing that if actual human sacrifices were offered after our era at the saturnalia no roman antiquary and there were plenty of antiquaries should mention the fact while discussing the theory that cerea were commutations of sacrifice if now and then under the empire a survival or recrudescence of human sacrifice was heard of in a rural district the antiquaries would catch at it greedily as a proof that wax tapers really were commutations of human sacrifice which some doubted that rural recrudescences do occur we know from the recent case of burning an irish peasant woman to death to deliver her from a fairy mr frazer however believes that survivals of human sacrifices at the saturnalia did really occur he is tempted to surmise that the king of the revels who answered to our twelfth night king or queen of the bean may have originally personated saturn himself in the following page we read that the victim cut his own throat on the altar of the god whom he personated the only known or alleged instance of human sacrifice at the saturnalia follows in ad when the persecution under diocletian began one dasius a christian soldier in lower moesia is said to have been the victim whom the soldiers yearly chose for the mockking of a month not a week the saturn of the occasion why a month if the ancient feast lasted but a day and later but a week after being a merry monarch for thirty days he should have cut his own throat at the altar of saturn greek kronos in the greek mss dasius declined the crown and was knocked on the head on november by a soldier apparently a christened man named john the saturnalia at rome lasted at least under the empire from december to december dasius must have been executed for his refusal announced before his months reign only a week is elsewhere known should have begun on november if the regnal month ended on december thus the festive saturnalian kings at rome may be guessed to descend from a custom at rome unknown but surviving among the soldiers of killing a mockking saturnus dasius was no slave or criminal but himself a soldier the revels of a month in place of a day or a week must also one presumes be a survival though a day was the early limit the date of the mss about dasius mr frazer does not give but he thinks that the longest ms is probably based on official documents to the mss i shall return the grotesque figure of carnival destroyed at the end of a modern roman feast which does not fall in december is also a survival of a slain mockking who personated saturn so mr frazer suggests though in ancient rome even this carnival practice is to us unknown it will already have been observed that even if the romans were in some remote age wont yearly to sacrifice a mockking who represented a god they did not do so at easter as in the case of christ did not do so in spring and did not scourge the victim their rite if it really corresponded to that of the soldiers who slew dasius began in november and ended in december lasting thirty days or teste macrobio originally lasting one day if the slaying of dasius really occurred and was a survival of a custom once prevalent as in ancient anahuac then the early saturnalia lasted for a month from november to december but roman antiquaries knew nothing of this the month date is remote indeed from easter so mr frazer must try to show that originally the saturnalia were a spring festival like carnival to make the carnival and saturnalia coincide mr frazer points out that if the saturnalia like many other seasons of licence was always observed at the end of the old year or the beginning of the new one it must like the carnival have been originally held in february or march at the time when march was the first month of the roman year thus in conservative rural districts the saturnalia would continue to be held in february not as at rome in december though roman writers do not tell us so and though nonroman pagan peoples held festival at the winter solstice the soldiers who killed poor dasius were ultraconservative but they killed him in november when their month of saturnalia began not in february when as they held by old usage their saturnalia should have been kept the hypothesis may be stated thus in rural districts the older and sterner practice of murder may long have survived in rural districts the saturnalia continued to be held in februarymarch not in december therefore the soldiers who kept up the older and sterner practice of remote districts where the saturnalia fell in februarymarch killed dasius in november meanwhile so wedded were the rural districts to saturnalia in februarymarch that the feast continued in these months under the church and became our carnival the eclectic soldiers in lower moesia kept up the old killing and full month of revelry though we never hear of a full month in older or later rome but they accepted the new date november not kept in rome and december though in their remote rural homes the saturnalia were in februarymarch doubtless their officers insisted on the new official date while permitting the old month of revel and the human sacrifice yet apparently of old there was but one day of revel but is the story of st dasius a true story the editor and discoverer of the greek text in which the legend occurs at full length professor franz cumont of ghent at first held that as far as the sacrifice of the military mockking goes the story is false i have already observed that mr frazer says nothing about the date of the greek ms containing the longest legend of dasius m cumont does the ms is of the eleventh century of our era and the original narrative he thinks was done into greek out of the latin which may have been based on official documents before the end of the seventh century ad by some one who knew latin ill wrote execrable greek did not understand his subject and was far from scrupulous these sentiments of m cumont set in a new and lurid light as mr frazer says of something else the only evidence for the yearly military sacrifice of a mockking of the saturnalia our author was unscrupulous for he makes dasius profess the nicene creed before it was made as to the thirty days revel m cumont supposes that to be a blunder of our author who did not know that the saturnalia only occupied a week m cumont held that the king of the feast had not to slay himself but only to sacrifice to saturn in fact bassus his commanding officer does ask him in the legend to sacrifice to our gods whom even the barbarians worship dasius the ms says refused and was knocked on the head by a soldier named john john was likely to be a christian and m cumont suggests that the ignorant translator of the latin took sepultus est he was buried by a soldier named john for pulsus or depulsus est he was knocked on the head greek ekrousthei in fact the greek translator of the seventh century retouched his latin original a plaisir human sacrifices says m cumont had been abolished since hadrians time the soldiers if they sacrificed a mockking broke an imperial edict our evidence then would seem if m cumont is right to be that of an unfaithful and not very scrupulous translator and embellisher of a latin text he informs us by the way that similar noisy performances went on in his own christian period not in december but on new years day the saturnalia were thus pushed on a week from december we do not learn that they were transferred to or retained at februarymarch the moral lesson of the legend is that we must not be noisy on new years day thus m cumont did not at first accept the evidence for the annual sacrifice of a mockking representing the god saturn but m parmentier suggested that an old cruel rite might have been introduced by oriental soldiers into moesia ad thanks to the licensed ferocity of the persecutions under diocletian the victim dasius was a christian and the author of his legend told the tale to illustrate the sin of revelry on new years day but what led to the revival of the cruelty m parmentier quoted the story of our babylonian festival the sacaea in which a mockking was scourged and slain this or a similar rite the roman legions finally confused with their own saturnalia both as to date and as to characteristics the oriental soldiers of the roman empire imported into the army this oriental feast and sacrifice just as they brought monuments of mithraworship into moesia in an hour of military licence and of persecution the cohorts in moesia may actually have tried to sacrifice a christian private as a representative of king saturn so far the sacrifice is an asiatic importation not a roman survival but m cumont after reading m parmentier returned from his disbelief in the veracity of the dasius legend he thought that the extension of the saturnalia from one day to five days after caligula might be due to an imitation introduced by eastern slaves in rome an influential class of the five days feast of the babylonian sacaea but thirty days as in moesia are not five days he also inclined to accept the recently proposed identification of the sacaea with a really old babylonian feast called zagmuk or zakmuk and with the jewish purim an identification which we shall later criticise as to the imperial edict forbidding human sacrifice m cumont now suggested that it had become a dead letter and impotent in the general decadence of monstrous cruelties flourished and the saturnalia were marked by gladiatorial combats thus in remote moesia the half oriental soldiery might really sacrifice a christian for the safety of his comrades under arms so far the sacrifice of dasius looks rather like a cruelty introduced into decadent rome and at the goodhumoured saturnalia by oriental legionaries than like a roman survival or recrudescence of a regular original feature of the saturnalia in any case the stripping and scourging of the sacaean mockking his hanging and his simulated resurrection at which we shall find mr frazer making a guess are absent while the date of the alleged transaction novemberdecember does not tally with purim or eastertide or the date of the sacaea the duration of the dasius feast thirty days is neither roman nor oriental thus far from illuminating the oriental practice the rite reported in moesia does but make the problem more perplexing the evidence has all the faults possible and the conjecture that the greek writer invented the sacrifice to throw discredit on the new year revels of his contemporaries may be worth considering perhaps i may hint that i think the historical evidence of the author of the dasius legend so extremely dubious that i might have expected mr frazer to offer a criticism of its character the general reader can gather from the golden bough no idea of the tenuity of the testimony which of course is at once visible to readers of french and greek we address ourselves to scholars and for scholars mr frazer has provided the necessary citations but my heart inclines to regard the needs of the general reader cf man may no vi the greek cronia from rome we turn to greece cronos in greece answered more or less to saturn in rome though how much of the resemblance is due to roman varnishing with greek myth i need not here discuss now the athenian festival of cronos fell neither in november december february nor march but in july therefore mr frazer needs to guess that the july feasts of cronos were once or may have been a spring festival like the carnival and like the saturnalia which by another hypothesis were originally in february or march though of this we have no proof indeed it is contrary to use and wont for a populace to alter a venerable folkfestival because of an official change in the calendar if the romans for unknown ages had kept the saturnalia in spring they would not move the date of their gaieties and cut off three weeks or twentynine days of their duration because the new year was shifted from march to january in scotland all through the middle ages and much later the year began in march but yule was not shifted into march it remained and remains like the saturnalia at the winter solstice as proof that the attic feast of cronos supposed to answer to the saturnalia was originally in spring not in july mr frazer writes a cake with twelve knobs which perhaps referred to the twelve months of the year was offered to cronos by the athenians on the fifteenth day of the month elaphebolion which corresponded roughly to march and there are traces of a licence accorded to slaves at the dionysiac festival of the opening of the wine jars in the month of flowers preceding it was a proper season for licence the possible meaning of the cake does not go for much and cronos is not dionysus there was a spring festival of cronos at olympia and aug mommsen thinks that the athenian cronos feast was originally vernal though athenian tradition thought it was a harvest feast the attic customs then do not suit mr frazers argument but he has another greek instance sacrificers called kings offered to cronos at olympia in spring and why should they not once have been sacrificed like dasius only in spring not in november this evidence is an inference from a presumed survival of human sacrifice to cronos who certainly received many such offerings we are not told we do not know why the athenian cronia were shifted from march to july or when but let no arbitrary proceedings of the kind prevent them from being equated with the saturnalia only known to us in fact as a december festival not as a vernal rejoicing it is singularly unlucky that the july date of the athenian cronia does tally with the junejuly date of the persian sacaea as given by mr frazer and probably given correctly in his second volume but in his third volume he awakes to the desirableness of placing the sacaea about eastertide not in july and so loses any benefit which his argument might have acquired from the coincidence in date of the attic harvest feast cronia and the persian that date is originally established how deeply this is to be regretted we shall see later for periods of licence like the sacaea usually occur just after harvest the real time of the cronia liberty to slaves of feasting with their masters was a feature of the harvest cronia as of many other harvest rejoicings but the conjecture that the cronia originally were a vernal feast removes them from such merrymakings of harvest licence as the sacaea in junejuly on the other hand the conjecture that the sacaea were vernal brings them into touch with eastertide and with the other conjecture that kings were once sacrificed at the conjecturally vernal cronia and so has its value for mr frazers argument vii the sacaea we are still trying to find an historical case of a man who is sacrificed in the character of a god and a king the argument next introduces us to the sacaea at babylon when the mockking was hanged the persian feast which as we saw m parmentier following herr meissner is inclined to identify with the ancient babylonian zagmuk or zakmuk and with the jewish purim this identification this theory that zakmuk sacaea and the jewish purim are all the same feast is essential to mr frazers theory but before his theory was published meyer in the new volume of his history of antiquity had declared that the identification is impossible philologically and as a matter of fact geschichte des alterthums it would be interesting to know the meaning of the word sacaea or sacea or sakia which hyde translates convivial drinking drinking healths compotatio propinatio we remember the persian butler called a saki in omar khayyam the eternal saki from the bowl has poured myriads of other bubbles and will pour if the winepourer the saki of omar is etymologically connected with the sakaea or sacaea then the feast means a wineparty the greeks however connected the sacaea with the sacae an oriental tribe of the great race stretching from the black sea to dacia indeed in strabos time the feasters at the sacaea dressed as scythians sacae and drank as horace tells us that the scythians were used to drink this occurred at zela a town of pontus where a love goddess in persian anaitis of the type of the babylonian ishtar was adored mr frazer even conjectures that her high priest or a substitute who played the king of the sacaea was yearly sacrificed here perhaps as tammuz no record of the fact has reached us the interesting point about this derivation of sacaea from the tribe of the sacae is that the festival was believed says strabo to commemorate a great victory of the persians over the sacae in precisely the same way the persian feast of the magophonia was supposed to commemorate a victory over and massacre of the magi purim again was held to commemorate a triumph of the jews over the persians and a massacre of the persians in three cases then sacaea magophonia and purim a feast which was a secular drinking bout preserve the memory of a bloody victory i do not observe that mr frazer notices this coincidence but manifestly this kind of feast is not a feast of the death of a mockking still less if possible a religious festival of the death and resurrection of a vernal god yet there really was if we accept rather poor evidence not a sacrifice but an execution of a mockking a criminal at the sacaea as held in babylon i quote our authorities first comes athenaeus who is writing about feasts of unreason at which in various regions the slaves are waited upon by their masters he says nothing of the execution of a mockking he remarks berosus in the first book of his history of babylon says that on the sixteenth day of the month lous there is a great festival celebrated at babylon which is called sakeas and it lasts five days and during these days it is the custom for the masters to be under the orders of their slaves and one of the slaves puts on a robe like the kings being called zoganes and is master of the house and ctesias also mentions this festival in the second book of his history of persia ctesias flourished rather earlier than berosus who is about bc thus athenaeus is silent about the execution of a mockking though doubtless he had the book of berosus before him and dio chrysostom who does speak of the execution and he alone does so says nothing about berosus or any other authority i cite the observations of dio chrysostom he puts them into the mouth of the cynic diogenes who is lecturing alexander the great to tame his pride and who tells illustrative anecdotes some of them absurd much as mr barlow was used to instruct masters harry sandford and tommy merton dio then makes diogenes say that at the sacaea they take one of the prisoners condemned to death and seat him upon the kings throne and give him the kings raiment and let him lord it and drink and run riot and use the kings concubines during these days and no man prevents him from doing just what he likes but afterwards they strip and scourge and crucify or hang greek ekremasan him he dies not as a victim by sacrifice but as a criminal by a cruel and degrading form of capital punishment according to dio any condemned criminal would serve the turn but mr frazer suggests that perhaps the profession of victim was hereditary such is the story which dio makes diogenes tell alexander in a humorous apologue against royal pride you will soon be growing a crest like a cock says diogenes in dios essay i cannot think that evidence found only in a literary tour de force and put into the mouth of a professed humourist proves historically that the mockking was actually hanged once a year at a feast described by athenaeus strabo and hesychius who never mention so strange an affair as the hanging the reader will not find that mr frazer suggests all these doubts indeed the student who avoids footnotes will believe that the tale of the hanging is according to the historian berosus who as a babylonian priest spoke with ample knowledge now granting that there really was a yearly execution at babylon of a criminal a mockking why was he put to death we know what mr frazers theory needs it needs historical examples of men who by being sacrificed as victims obtain a divine character as representing the god to whom they are sacrificed the theory also demands that these victims shall be arrayed and crowned as kings it is desirable too that they should perish about our eastertide and that they should be supposed to rise again the solitary example of a saturnalian victim in moesia did not fulfil these conditions he was arrayed as a king indeed and was sacrificed if we believe the legend of st dasius but he was not stripped and scourged and he died not at easter but in november if he had not refused the part thrust on him he would have died in december there was no word about his resurrection it was found necessary to suggest that originally the saturnalian victim died in februarymarch but this was not proved the other historical case the mockking of the sacaea also does not fulfil the conditions required he is robed and crowned and scourged but he is not sacrificed we have no hint of a resurrection none of a religious character attaching to the feast none of a divine character attaching to the victim the feast is traditionally a revel commemorative of a victory the victim is a condemned criminal as to the date of the death mr frazer has two contradictory theories by the first which is correct the victim died probably in junejuly if not certainly in september by the second the month date of the death is fixed provisionally in marchapril let me add that to suit mr frazers theory the victim must not only have been divine at the origin of the institution but must have been recognised as divine at the time of the crucifixion of our lord otherwise our lords death in the character of the victim could lend him no halo of divinity spencer and gillen natives of

sacaean criminal divine as our historical evidence does not meet mr frazers needs as the sacaean victim is not regarded as divine as he is no victim but a criminal as he is not sacrificed as the feast is not religious but a secular merrymaking as no resurrection is mentioned as the historical date does not fit eastertide mr frazer has to invent theories which will prove far more than the facts alleged by dio chrysostom berosus in athenaeus strabo and hesychius or will prove that originally the facts were the opposite of those historically recorded through his whole argument mr frazer seems to me to present two distinct theories alternately and only at the close can i detect any attempt at reconciliation a third theory distinct from either appears to be rejected indeed mr frazers task is not easy he may say that the sacaean victim represents the king and that the king being by the hypothesis divine the victim is divine also but he needs moreover a resurrection of the dead man hence the theory that the victim represents not only the king but a god of the type of tammuz or adonis at the feasts of that god a god of vegetable life there was wailing for his death rejoicing for his resurrection at babylon this occurred in junejuly but there is no evidence that a human victim was slain for tammuz none that he was scourged and hanged how are the two theories the victim as divine king the victim as tammuz to be combined their combination is necessary for the king is needed to yield the royal robes while tammuz is needed to yield the resurrection and the fast preceding the feast before purim a fast of wailing for tammuz we hear of no fast before the sacaea but if purim be borrowed from the sacaea which is indispensable to the theory the sacaea too must have been preceded by a fast though it is unrecorded clearly the king theory alone or the tammuz theory alone will not yield the facts necessary to the hypothesis consequently the two theories must be combined the king must not only be divine be a god he must also be a god of vegetation a god of the tammuz type who has a resurrection now we have no evidence or none is adduced to prove that the king whether babylonian or persian was ever deemed to be an incarnation of tammuz or any such vegetable deity without sound evidence to that effect the theory cannot move a step we have abundance of babylonian sacred and secular texts not one is adduced to prove that the king incarnated any god especially tammuz mr frazer then after putting forward alternately the king theory and the tammuz theory does finally if i understand him combine them he talks of the human god the saturn zoganes tammuz or whatever he was called thus the victim is the king and we get the royal robes and the five days of royalty the king is also tammuz unless i fail to grasp the meaning the victim too is tammuz and we get the fast though we hear of none before the sacaea the feast and the resurrection but this is a late and rather casually introduced theory quite destitute of evidence as regards the kings being recognised for tammuz previously throughout two volumes the victim had alternately derived his necessary divinity from the king and from the tammuz god he derived more as king he had the entree of the royal harem as tammuz he was the consort of a woman probably a sacred harlot who represented the great semitic goddess ishtar or astarte his union with her magically fertilised the crops a similar duty in the dreamtime of mr frazers hypotheses had been that of the majesty of babylon originally we may conjecture such couples exercised their function for a whole year on the conclusion of which the male partner the divine king was put to death but in historical times it seems that as a rule the human god the saturn zoganes tammuz or whatever he was called enjoyed his divine privileges and discharged his divine duties only for a short part of the year namely five days at the sacaea the divine duties of the early kings of babylon if i understand mr frazer were to stand for the powers that make for the fertility of plants and perhaps also of animals are we to conceive that these pleasing exercises with the lady of the divine pair were all the duties of the early kings of babylon in that case who carried on the civil and military control of the empire of course if the early king did nothing at all but associate with the human goddess who shared his bed and transmitted his beneficent energies to the rest of nature then he may have been a mangod a tammuz if the texts say so and his substitute might die at once as royal proxy to save the kings life and also as tammuz moreover it would not matter a pins fee whether such a king died or not only no man could take the billet of king thus it may be mr frazers intention to combine in one the two theories of the victim as tammuz and as royal proxy in that case his two apparently inconsistent theories are one theory but if i apprehend it correctly it is a very audacious theory where have we a proven case of a king who incarnates a god of vegetation plays the part of making for the fertility of plants by the assistance of the human goddess who shares his bed and transmits his beneficent energies to the rest of nature and who is sacrificed annually does this divine voluptuary also keep a royal harem or is that essential and more or less attested part of the sacaea a later excrescence without some historical evidence for such a strange array of facts including the yearly sacrifice of the monarch i must hesitate to think that mr frazers theory of a king who is both king and tammuz and has later a substitute who is both tammuz and king is a practical hypothesis explanatory of the halo of divinity which was shed around the cross of calvary i cannot accept as evidence for a combination of facts separately so extraordinary a series of inferences and presumptions from rural or barbaric revels in spring or at harvest the existence of a king or queen of the may or of the bean on twelfth night with occasional or even frequent mock destructions of the monarch of a playful day cannot be used as proof that early babylonian kings consorted for a year with a human goddess and then were burned to death as gods of vegetable produce especially when there is no historical testimony and only inference from myth in favour of any human goddess or of a burned king we have not meanwhile even any testimony to show that in any time in any place any human victim was ever slain let alone a king and a king annually as tammuz we have only a guess founded on the weakest possible basis that of analogy the analogy says mr frazer of lityerses and of folkcustom both european and savage suggests that in phoenicia the cornspirit the dead adonis may formerly have been represented by a human victim this can hardly persuade me that the kings of babylon were annually sacrificed as tammuz or as adonis while admitting that mr frazer may really mean to combine his two theories the victim as king the victim as tammuz and while he certainly makes his victim both a king and a god i shall take the freedom to examine his theory in the sequence of the passages wherein it is proposed and request the reader to decide whether there be one theory or two theories but first have we any examples of a sacrifice by hanging not by burning the human victim for the sacaean victim though confessedly hanged is said by mr frazer to be sacrificed i sacrifice by hanging does it exist let us look at actual human victims actually known to have been slain in the interests of agriculture are or were these human victims put to the infamous death of malefactors like the mockking of the sacaea they were not cases are given in vol ii p et seq the indians of guyaquar used to sacrifice human blood and the hearts of men when they sowed their fields in the aztec harvest festival a victim was crushed between two great stones perhaps to represent the grinding of the maize the mexicans sacrificed young children older children and old men for each stage of the maizes growth we are not told how they were sacrificed the egyptians burned redhaired men and scattered their ashes with winnowing fans this burning is a usual feature of sacrifice and is not hanging or crucifying the skidi or wolf pawnees burned a victim to tirawa the power above that moves the universe and controls all things but the victim was a deer or a buffalo there were also occasional human sacrifices before sowing the victim had his head cleft with a tomahawk and was then riddled with arrows and afterwards burned in some cases he was tied to a cross before being slain with an axe a sioux girl was burned over a slow fire and then shot with arrows her flesh for magical purposes was squeezed over the newly sown fields west african victims were killed with spades and hoes and burned in newly tilled fields at lagos a girl was impaled among sacrificed sheep goats yams heads of maize and plantains hung on stakes though impalement is a form of capital punishment probably the girls blood was expected to fertilise the earth we have no proof that crucifixion was used in babylon or the same motive might be alleged for the mockking at the sacaea it may be doubted whether crucifixion was an oriental mode of punishment says mr frazer he does not say that it was an oriental form of sacrifice the marimos kill and burn a human victim and scatter the ashes on the ground to fertilise it the bagolos hew a slave to pieces some tribes in india chop victims up the kudulu allow to a victim all the revels women and all of the sacaean mockking and then cut a hole in him and smear his blood over an idol this is sacrifice not capital punishment the khonds slew their revered and godlike victim in a variety of ways strangling him in a tree burning and chopping up that his flesh might be sown on the fields the head bowels and bones were burned such are the examples of a real human victim slain for the good of the crops in six out of fourteen cases the victims ashes blood or flesh is used magically to fertilise the fields and probably this is done in several other instances in seven cases burning occurs in two sacrifice to a god or idol occurs in one only is the mode of death a recognised form of capital punishment therefore mr frazer does not seem to me to be justified in taking for and describing as sacrifice the capital punishment inflicted at the sacaea on a mockking who notoriously was a criminal condemned to death and who was hanged not sacrificed to be sure mr frazer tries to turn this point and how perhaps ancient kings of lydia were once burned alive on pyres as living embodiments of their god for the lydian like the macedonian and many other royal houses claimed descent from heracles who being on fire already under the shirt of nessus homeopathically burned himself croesus defeated was about to die by fire but not out of his own head cyrus was going to burn him alive like jeanne darc cranmer wishart and others this cruel infliction by a foreign enemy hardly proves a lydian custom nor are lydians exactly babylonians again if an old prussian king wished to leave a good name behind him he burned himself before a holy oak crummies is not a prussian nor were the kings of babylon once more movers thought that the divine pair who figured by deputy at the sacaea were semiramis and sandan or sardanapalus which divine pair the kings proxy and one of the kings concubines or the tammuz man and the sacred harlot sandan was thought to be heracles by the greeks and his effigy was perhaps burned on a pyre at his festival in tarsus now the persians according to agathias worshipped sandes sandan and perhaps the babylonians did so also though really that agreeable byzantine minor poet agathias cannot be called a good witness next k o mueller thinks that sandan sandes may have been burned in a mystery play in nineveh mueller giving free licence to his fancy as he admits movers too thought that at the sacaea the zoganes represented a god and paired with a woman who personated a goddess and movers thinks that the sacaean victim was originally burned for these exquisite reasons that the lydian monarchs claimed descent from heracles who was burned that cyrus wanted to burn croesus alive that old prussian kings who wished to leave a good name burned themselves that movers thought that sandan or sardanapalus might have figured at the sacaea as zoganes that agathias mentioned sandes as a babylonian deity and that movers thinks that the man who acted the god was burned mr frazer suggests that perhaps the mockking of the sacaea was burned once upon a time but we only know that he was scourged and hanged so perhaps mr frazer suggests he was both scourged hanged and burned afterwards or perhaps hanging or crucifixion may have been a later mitigation of his sufferings a pretty mitigation and why was flogging added one had liefer be burned like a god and a king than be first whipped and then crucified as a malefactor of the lowest and most servile kind losing too the necessary suggestion of sacrifice and divinity implied in being burned besides apart from this theory of a cruel and debasing mitigation there is no evidence at all except what proves that the mockking at the sacaea was first stripped of his royal robes then whipped then hanged if he dies as god or king why is he stripped of his royal robes the man was hanged was capitally punished which as a condemned criminal he richly deserved and there is an end ont as dr johnson rudely remarked now we must not forget that mr frazer has announced this i sacrifice of a divine king as his theory but we need not i may even say must not accept the theory because first mr frazer gives many examples of persons believed each to contain a god either temporarily or permanently but in not one single case is the person said to be killed for the benefit of the god whom he contains secondly there was historically no sacrifice in the case of the sacaean mockking the mockking then if he has any divinity has it not as a sacrifice for he is not sacrificed nor as representing a king who incarnates a god for no kings or others thought to incarnate gods whether temporarily or permanently are proved to be slain for the benefit of that god nor are any kings who are actually slain slain by hanging the death of a man as a god belongs if to anything to quite another festival that of tammuz or adonis and to quite another set of ideas we have no proof indeed that a man was ever hanged or sacrificed as an embodiment of adonis or tammuz but mr frazers theory of the reason for the crucifixion on calvary demands the sacrifice of a human victim who is ex officio a god is sacrificed in that character and is feigned to rise again he must also be royal to account for the scarlet robe and crown of thorns of the great victim ii stages in mr frazers theory let us now trace the stages of mr frazers theory that the sacaean victim is both god and king first in order of statement comes the description of the sacaea combined from athenaeus who mentions no victim and dio chrysostom who does we learn from mr frazer not from dio that the victim dies in the kings stead but we must not forget that the king is slain in his character of a god his death and resurrection as the only means of perpetuating the divine life unimpaired being deemed necessary for the salvation of his people and the world that is mr frazers theory we have seen no proof of it we have remarked that sacrificed victims are not hanged that kings are not scourged that there is no evidence beyond conjecture for an earlier babylonian process of burning while conjecture also explains whipping and hanging as a mitigation or alleges that possibly the victim was hanged first and burned afterwards here the king is certainly not on the face of it a god of vegetation if anything he is more like the chitome in congo who was a pontiff his credulous people believed that the world would end if the chitome died a natural death so when he seemed likely to die he was clubbed or strangled he was sacrificed to no god whom he incarnated he was not clubbed once a year like the babylonian king of mr frazers theory he was given a rude euthanasia when he seemed likely to die does science ask us to believe that each babylonian king had the cosmic rapport of a congo savage pontiff and was sacrificed after a years reign because a savage pontiff in congo is put to death not annually but when he seems likely to die here whatever science may expect us to believe we are told by mr frazer that the king in babylon was annually sacrificed as a god indeed but not explicitly as a god of vegetation who has a resurrection a babylonian god of vegetation and a known god appears in ii this god is tammuz we hear that water was thrown over him at a great mourning ceremony at which men and women stood round the funeral pyre of tammuz lamenting the dead tammuz was probably represented in effigy water was poured over him and he came to life again mr frazer does not here plead for a human victim the festival doubtless took place in the month tammuz junejuly or in different places at different times from midsummer to autumn or from june to september as the late mr robertson smith calculated tammuz so mr sayce is cited is originally the spring vegetation which dies in his month tammuz or duuzu junejuly here then we have a death and resurrection of tammuz it occurs in junejuly or juneseptember and tammuz is undoubtedly the god of spring vegetation but mr frazer does not here tell us that the king of babylon is also tammuz tammuz is not whipped and hanged at the tammuz feast in july his dead body is probably a dummy in vol ii mr frazer returns to the victim the mockking of the sacaea but he says nothing here about the real king of babylon he wishes to show how and why the victim is divine now in ii we were told that the victim is divine because he represents a dying god for we must not forget that the king dies in his character of a god was mr frazer satisfied with this explanation given in ii apparently not for he gives a new explanation and a different one it seems worth suggesting that the mockking who was annually killed at the babylonian festival of the sacaea on the sixteenth day of the month lous may have represented tammuz himself here the tammuz dummy or effigy of ii is perhaps discarded still if a real live tammuz was burned on a funeral pyre his ashes might well be represented by a dummy it has not yet occurred to mr frazer as it does later to have the rearisen god personated by a living human counterpart mordecai in a later page of the dead tammuz haman the festival of the sacaea is now a tammuz festival a religious feast and indeed is identical with that of ii for it occurs in the month lous now lous says mr robertson smith answered to the lunar month tammuz and the month of tammuz was junejuly or juneseptember there could not surely be two tammuz feasts in the month tammuz we are therefore confronted by the singular facts that tammuz lay on a funeral pyre and also that as the sacaean victim who mr frazer thinks it worth suggesting personated tammuz he was at the same feast the sacaea whipped and hanged mr frazer goes on if this conjecture is right the view that the mockking at the sacaea was slain in the character of a god tammuz would be established but it was established already was it not on other grounds to mr frazers satisfaction in ii there the criminal victim died as a king and as a god for the king was a god and so was his proxy now on the other hand if mr frazers latest conjecture is right the victim dies as a real known god tammuz we keep asking was the king also an incarnation of tammuz may i not be excused for surmising that we have here an hypothesis in the making an hypothesis resting on two different theories if mr frazer holds that the king of babylon was also tammuz as the mockking was here was the opportunity for saying so and proving the fact from babylonian texts mr frazer here gives us a tammuz feast in which tammuz lies on a funeral pyre and also a tammuz feast in which the human representative of that deity is whipped and hanged while the dead tammuz was probably represented in effigy water was poured over him and he came to life again how in the person of mordecai these are the results of ii and of ii these things are confessedly conjectures but one thing is quite certain the sacaea wherein tammuz either lay on a funeral pyre and afterwards had water poured over him probably in effigy or was hanged was a festival of junejuly variations of calendars however might make the sacaea fall from midsummer to autumn or from june to september ii note of mr robertson smith these dates are remote from eastertide to this point mr frazer promises to return later he does so in the most disconcerting manner for when he returns the sacaea which were in the month tammuz junejuly startle us by being held in march or marchapril may i not say that i seem to detect traces of an hypothesis in the making and of discrepant theories we have already been rather puzzled by the tammuz on a funeral pyre who has cold water poured over him probably in effigy and also is honoured by being whipped and hanged in the person of a human representative a mockking at the same festival but perhaps there were two tammuz feasts in the month of tammuz and possibly the victim was whipped and hanged at one of them while his mortal remains were burned on the pyre at the other it is quite possible says mr frazer when explaining why a victim of a sacrifice was hanged not burned as is usual that both forms of execution or rather of sacrifice may have been combined by hanging or crucifying the victim first and burning him afterwards but he neglects the buxom opportunity of corroborating this conjecture by referring to the tammuz victim who had both a funeral pyre and a gibbet in ii iii a possible reconciliation there is perhaps a mode of reconciling the dates of the tammuz festivals at one of which tammuz was honoured with a pyre at the other in the person of his representative the sacaean mockking with a gibbet dr jastrow places a tammuz feast in the fourth month which if the babylonian year begins as mr frazer says it does with the month nisan means that the fourth month and a tammuz feast occurred in our junejuly but dr jastrow also writes that in the sixth babylonian month our augustseptember there was celebrated a festival to tammuz thus tammuz might have his gibbet in junejuly and his pyre in augustseptember but alas this will not do for the pyre is of junejuly nor can he have his gibbet in augustseptember as i had fondly hoped for he is to be identified with the mockking of the sacaea and the month of his hanging is tammuz lous or junejuly if mr robertson smith is right thus i really fail to believe that tammuz could have both a burning and a hanging in junejuly i hoped that dr jastrows two tammuz feasts had solved the problem but i hoped in vain iv the sacaea suddenly changes its date meanwhile even though we have allowed for two tammuz feasts are we also to admit a third tammuz feast at the march festival of the sacaea for in vol iii march has become the date of the sacaea rather to our surprise for the date had been junejuly now three tammuz feasts in six months seem one too many if not two consequently the arguments which in ii show the sacaean victim because he died in the month tammuz to represent the god tammuz fail perhaps if the victim really died in march at the babylonian zakmuk or zagmuku a feast in honour not of tammuz but of bau a goddess and later of marduk neither bau nor marduk is tammuz nor does the victim seem likely to represent tammuz after his death is shifted from the tammuz feasts of mayjune or junejuly julyaugust to march when the feast was really in honour not of tammuz but of bau or later of marduk all our difficulties indeed pale before the fact that the date of the sacaea when the possible tammuz victim was hanged is fixed twice once with much show of reason and with unconcealed delight in junejuly in the second volume while next it is argued from in the third volume as if the date were marchapril i conjecture therefore that the july date was not inconsistent with what is now mr frazers theory when he revised his second volume otherwise he would not have said that mr robertson smiths decision as to the july date supplies so welcome a confirmation of the conjecture in the text and then in iii have proceeded to argue on the presumption that mr robertson smiths calculations may be for the purposes of the theory disregarded and they are disregarded as we shall see if they were dubious they should never have been welcomed v various theories of the victim meanwhile for our own argument as to the precise nature of the babylonian kings divinity vegetable or not i do not think that we have yet found the king of babylon explicitly identified with a god of vegetation the victim remember was at first divine either as proxy of the king incarnating i think a god unknown or as full of cosmic rapport as a mangod of the second species next his divinity was established if mr frazer rightly conjectured that he represented tammuz himself next he was a criminal vicariously sacrificed for the saving of the kings life for another year next it would appear that the zoganes the same old victim during his five days of office personated not merely a king but a god whether that god was the elamite humman the babylonian marduk or some other deity not yet identified next the victim personated a god or hero of the type of tammuz or adonis and enjoyed the favours of a woman probably a sacred harlot in addition to the caresses of the royal seraglio next the indefatigable victim represented the king the human god the saturn zoganes tammuz or whatever he was called though all we know of the god zoganes is that zoganes was the title of the slave lord of the household at the persian sacaea it would thus appear almost as if all gods are one god to mr frazer by a kind of scientific henotheism humman or saturn zoganes or tammuz marduk or adonis any one of them or all of them will do for the king to incarnate or personate any one of them or all of them will figure as representatives of vegetable life in company with zeus and the horses of virbius we may conjecture that the horses by which virbius was said to have been slain were really embodiments of him as a deity of vegetation now let me too say we may conjecture mr frazer tells us that horses were excluded from the grove and sanctuary of virbius is it putting too great pressure on evidence to conjecture that the horses while being driven out were whipped now the horses embodied perhaps as we are told a deity of vegetation they were whipped and therefore it was usual to whip the representatives of a deity of vegetation this solves our problem why was the victim the divine victim whipped seriously have we not in all this book to do with that method of arbitrary conjecture which has ruined so many laborious philosophies of religion as to one essential conjecture that the babylonian or rather the persian kings represented a deity of vegetation i can offer only one shadowy testimony nebuchadnezzar for a while exhibited a caprice in favour of a purely vegetable diet this may have been a survival of a royal taboo as a god of vegetation a king would not eat vegetables any more than a savage usually eats his totem but some savages do eat their totems on certain sacred occasions and that may be the reason why nebuchadnezzar for a given period turned

purim it is necessary to get the death of the sacaean victim into touch with easter the sacaea when he died had been in junejuly in vol ii in mr frazers first edition before he evolved his theory when the theory is evolved in the second edition and third volume the sacaea prefer to occur in marchapril which gets the sufferings of the mockking into touch with the jewish purim and so within measurable distance of our passion week though the junejuly date of the first edition survives in the second volume of the new edition the change of date of the sacaea is arranged for by the plan rejected by meyer and jastrow of identifying the persian sacaea and the jewish purim with the ancient babylonian zagmuk or zakmuk a new year festival of marchapril to be sure if that be the date we seem bereft of our useful tammuz from whom in ii it was conjectured that the victim mockking derived his divinity an old superstitious belief which shed the halo of divinity on the victim of calvary for the tammuz feast was certainly in juneseptember however perhaps there were three tammuz feasts resurrection and all and mr frazers last choice of a date in marchapril has the immense advantage for his theory of getting us near eastertide but did the sacaea actually desert their old date junejuly to prove that we must identify the sacaea a persian with zakmuk a babylonian feast which really fell in march or april the old babylonian feast zakmuk is known to the learned through inscriptions we have seen that m cumont and herr meissner inclined to regard zakmuk as identical with the sacaea while the feast zakmuksacaea is supposed by mr frazer to be the origin of the jewish purim but the sacaea fell in the macedonian month lous as athenaeus tells us according to berosus a babylonian priest using the macedonian calendar and lous as mr robertson smith proved was our july zakmuk on the other hand fell in our marchapril and purim in our march neither of which is july when the sacaea were held now it is desirable for mr frazers argument that the sacaea should fall not in july as it did in ii but in or about eastertide mr frazer therefore shifts the sacaea from july to eastertide in face of difficulties all we know concerning zakmuk is that this feast originally a feast of bau says dr jastrow fell about the vernal equinox near the beginning of the old babylonian year that after a certain period it was held in honour of the chief god of babylon named merodach that a council of gods was thought to meet in merodachs temple under his presidency and that they determined the fate of the year especially the fate of the kings life the festival existed as early as bc whereas the sacaea so far as appears from our authorities does not date from before the persian conquest of babylon bc but in spite of dates it is desirable for mr frazers purpose to identify the persian sacaea with the babylonian zakmuk for if he succeeds in this then sacaea must fall when zakmuk fell and nearly when purim fell at or not so very far from eastertide but sacaea was eagerly welcomed by mr frazer as a july not a spring feast whereas in iii sacaea is identified with zakmuk which did fall in spring again we have not even a hint that any mockking or tammuz man or anybody was slain at the babylonian feast of zakmuk as a man was slain says dio at the sacaea however mr frazer tries to show that sacaea and zakmuk may be the same feast for sacaea and zakmuk are names that resemble zakmuk and zoganes we may reply that the word sacaea also rather closely resembles the name of the tribe of sacae from whom the persogreeks derived the word sacaea while the sacaea were held to commemorate a victory over the sacae again the word sacaea which was a drinking feast resembles the word saki persian for a pourer forth of wine i the word saki is arabic being the nomen agentis of the verb saki to water abreuver this root is common to several semitic languages eg hebrew and aethiopic and if we could prove the word sacaea to be of native babylonian origin it might very probably come from the same root mr denison ross informs me in any case we cannot build on resemblances in the sound of words that argument for the identification of zakmuk and the sacaea fails next mr frazer contends that since at zakmuk the gods determined the fate of the kings life it was a critical time for the king now the central feature of the sacaea appears to have been the hanging of the mockking for the saving of the real kings life here then are two critical hours for the king one at zakmuk when the gods settle his fate one at the sacaea when his life is saved by the execution of his proxy are not then these two critical periods one period and is not sacaea another name for zakmuk but mr frazer has also told us that the main feature of the sacaea was the death of a man who represented tammuz and was killed after doing sympathetic magic with a sacred harlot was there then in connection with this tammuz man a third tammuz feast in marchapril for there were two in juneseptember thus even if we could admit that because two periods are critical both are the same period yet as the victim of the sacaea was a tammuz man slain to do good to the crops we are unable to concede that he also died in the kings stead and to save his life unless the king was tammuz besides no authority tells us that either or both of this victims deaths occurred at the babylonian feast of zakmuk it occurred at the persian feast of the sacaea if at all indeed even if mr frazers two arguments for the identity of zakmuk and sacaea were persuasive and how persuasive they are we have seen there would remain a difficulty for berosus says as we saw that the sacaea fell on lous which is july whereas zakmuk fell in marchapril i historical difficulty this obstacle seems to be and really is insuperable but mr frazer undaunted writes the identification of the months of the syromacedonian calendar is a matter of some uncertainty as to the month lous in particular the evidence of ancient writers appears to be conflicting and until we have ascertained beyond the reach of doubt when lous fell at babylon in the time of berosus say bc it would be premature to allow much weight to the seeming discrepancy in the dates of the two festivals namely zakmuk and the sacaea henceforth mr frazers hypothesis seems to me to proceed on the fancy that sacaea and zakmuk are identical which is impossible since the sacaea fall in july or september and zakmuk in marchapril it is absolutely certain historically that sacaea and zakmuk cannot be identical they were as remote in date as they well could be for the conflicting evidence of ancient writers as to the date of the month of the sacaea namely the macedonian month lous lous mr frazer gives two references the first is to mr robertson smiths proof that lous is july that does him no good the second is to smiths dictionary of greek and roman antiquities in that work i read that the only doubt as to the month lous is whether it fell in july or september smiths dictionary is a book so common and accessible that i need not inflict on the reader the nature of the conflicting evidence it is enough to say that the month of the sacaea lous was almost certainly july but if not july was undeniably september now neither july nor september is eastertide or near it so that the effort to make the sacaea identical with zakmuk and therefore more or less coincident with purim and with our easter is an absolute failure the jews then could not as in mr frazers theory borrow abroad a july or september mockking and attach him to a vernal festival their purim thus as zakmuk is several months remote from the sacaea it is not identical with the sacaea mr frazer himself says if the sacaea occurred in july and the zakmuk in march the theory of their identity could not be maintained but he loses rather than gains if the sacaea were in september and that is the only possible alternative the game is over the mockking of babylon died if at all in july or september at the sacaea not at zagmuk or zakmuk in marchapril there is not a known hint that any mockking died in babylon about eastertide or earlier at the feast of zakmuk i confess that when i found mr frazer declining to allow much weight to the seeming discrepancy in the dates of the two festivals till it was ascertained beyond the reach of doubt when lous fell at babylon in the time of berosus i presumed that the apparently conflicting evidence of ancient writers meant a difference of opinion as to whether lous was a spring or a midsummer month but i looked at smiths dictionary and found nothing of the sort the difference of opinion the conflict of evidence is concerned see smith with the question whether lous was september as it seems to have been in the time of philip of macedon or whether it was july as in the time of plutarch neither opinion gives lous the faintest chance of being a spring month therefore the vernal zakmuk is not the sacaea therefore there is not the ghost of a reason for guessing that a mockking was hanged at zakmuk therefore zakmuk in april cannot lend a hanged mockking to purim in march therefore purim having no slain mockking cannot hand one on to eastertide which moreover does not occur at the same date as purim but some weeks later as may happen therefore the mockking if he had been divine which he was not and if he had been sacrificed which he was not could not have lent his halo of divinity to gild the cross at calvary but that he did so is mr frazers hypothesis sometimes ii persians are not babylonians the sacaea according to all our authorities was a persian not a babylonian feast we have not a tittle of evidence to show that the babylonians with whom zakmuk was a feast of old standing ever heard of the sacaea before they were conquered by the persians bc mr frazer admits this the babylonian custom so far as appears from our authorities does not date from before the persian conquest but probably it was much older why probably on the strength of this probably mr frazer calls the doings at the persian sacaea a babylonian custom it was a custom of the persian conquerors of babylon if we can believe dio chrysostom but we have no evidence that it was a babylonian custom yet it has just got to be a babylonian custom that mr frazer may attach it to a vernal babylonian feast zakmuk and so to purim and so to eastertide iii origin of purim about the real origin of purim a purely secular jollification preceded after a certain date by a fast we know nothing it is first mentioned in the book of esther which is so secular that the name of god is never mentioned in it scholars have debated as to the date of esther which mr frazer places in the fourth or third century bc some as kuenen place it later some think it historical as mr sayce does others regard it as a romance composed to supply an account of the origin of the feast of purim which we never hear of before the exile the account in esther is well known xerxes quarrelled with his queen vashti and after a series of experiments in wives selected esther cousin of an artful jew named mordecai this man discovered and through esther reported a conspiracy he later behaved with insolence to haman the vizier who settled with xerxes a kind of st bartholomews day for all the jews but xerxes was accidentally reminded of the services done by mordecai and asked haman how a grateful prince should reward an unnamed servant haman suggested the ride in royal splendour which mordecai enjoyed haman then erected a very tall gallows whereon to hang mordecai but esther got news of the intended massacre and as xerxes had promised to give her any gift she asked for she demanded the death of haman so haman was hanged and the jews were allowed to defend themselves they massacred an enormous number of their enemies and henceforth kept purim a feast of two days on adar march and wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur and pur that is the lot was cast before haman for a whole year from nisan to adar the word pur a lot does not occur in hebrew says mr frazer however the assyrian puhra means an assembly and there was an assembly of the gods at the feast of zakmuk why the jews went after an assyrian word we may guess but we also learn that pur or bur seems to be one wants to know if it really was an old assyrian word for stone and a stone may be used for a lot as the greek pseiphos a pebble also means a vote thus either the assyrian puhra or pur may have lent a name to the feast of purim i am no friend to etymological conjecture especially when two assyrian words put in rival claims to be each of them the origin of a jewish word mr frazer does not i think allude to the other guess connecting purim with the persian feast phurdigan phurim or purim we find purdaghan purdiyan and so forth this persian feast was a drinking bout and time of jollity so that hyde very naturally compares it to purim and to the old persian sacaea or sakea or sakia which means drinking together or drinking healths if sakia means a convivial feast in persian it fits very well the persian sacaea which were a time of jollity the learned may settle their etymological guesses among themselves but we are not obliged for want of another conjecture to fly to old assyrian for purim still less do we agree that mr frazer has made out a fairly probable case for holding that the jewish feast purim is derived from the babylonian new year festival of zakmuk no ease at all i venture to think is made out mr frazers assyrian etymologies are met by competing etymologies moreover we know next to nothing of the babylonian zakmuk but we do know that the persian sacaea sakea or sakia was like purim a period of hard drinking and wild licence which does not resemble a solemn religious festival of the supreme god marduk or a period of wailing for tammuz there is another coincidence unnoted i think by mr frazer but already noted by us herodotus our oldest greek source for the persians tells us that their chief feast was called magophonia and celebrated the massacre of the hostile magi strabo tells us that the sacaea were supposed to commemorate a massacre of intoxicated sacae purim is held to celebrate a massacre of the foes of the jews can these three feasts for a massacre coincide by accident it is not easy to see how this tradition attached itself to the slaying of a criminal either as kings proxy or as representative of tammuz iv is purim preexilian or postexilian in any case purim has not been successfully connected with zakmuk mr frazer however says that an examination of that the jewish tradition and of the manner of celebrating the feast renders it probable that purim is nothing but a more or less disguised form of the babylonian feast of the sacaea or zakmuk we have seen that stern dates do not allow us to identify sacaea with zakmuk the month lous is firm as the macedonian phalanx and will not masquerade as marchapril when zakmuk was held setting that aside there are good grounds for believing that purim was unknown to the jews until after the exile and yet that they learned to observe it during their captivity in the bast but their captivity in the east was the exile so how did they know nothing of purim at the very time when they also learned to celebrate that festival however it is reckoned fairly probable that the jews borrowed purim either directly from the babylonians or indirectly through the persian conquerors of babylon the only question is from which the jews probably borrowed purim in or after the exile but they also kept purim before the exile at least mr frazer thinks that the best solution it is jensens solution stated however only in letters to correspondents it really seems hardly consistent that mr frazer should both think purim probably a feast borrowed in or after the exile and also appear to approve a theory which regards the feast as familiar to the jews before the exile yet that is what he has apparently succeeded in doing he prefers jensens solution which is this a fast was held before the feast of purim why the best solution appears to be that of jensen that the fasting and mourning were originally for the supposed annual death of a semitic god or hero of the type of tammuz or adonis whose resurrection on the following day occasioned that outburst of joy and gladness which is characteristic of purim yes but the jews had that institution before the exile in the first days of his own captivity ezekiel was carried in the flesh or out of the flesh to the temple at jerusalem then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lords house which was towards the north and behold there sat women wailing for tammuz now jensens solution is that the fast at purim represents the wailing for tammuz or somebody of his type but if the jews did that as they did before the exile and if that was purim how did they also borrow purim after the exile especially as there are good grounds for believing that purim was unknown to the jews till after the exile how can both views be correct or is this march feast of the tammuz kind an addition to the old preexilian jewish tammuz feast moreover purim is probably according to mr frazer a mere disguised form of the sacaea which in his opinion is the same as zakmuk but the central feature of the sacaea appears to have been the saving of the kings life for another year by the vicarious sacrifice of a criminal yet its central feature is also the sorrow for the death and glee for the resurrection of a semitic god or hero of the type of tammuz or adonis following jensen how can the sacaea have two central features if it is only an affair of hanging a man to save the kings life why should the jews at jerusalem fast before the vicarious sacrifice of a criminal for the babylonian king they did fast we know and why should the victims resurrection if any on the following day occasion that outburst of joy and gladness which is characteristic of purim what had the jews to make with the resurrection of a proxy of the king of babylon mr frazer has not i think suggested that the kings of israel or judah were once annually sacrificed so why were the jewish women wailing at the north gate of the temple for tammuz as we know from ezekiel but tammuz was not a jewish king or if he was it should be stated also if the jewish ladies wailed and rejoiced for tammuz at the temple in jerusalem before the exile how can it be consistently maintained that they knew nothing of these rites till after the exile and then borrowed them from babylonians or persians if purim is a tammuz rite the jews had it before the exile as ezekiel proves if it is not a tammuz rite why is jensens the best solution for jensens solution is that the fasting and mourning were originally for the supposed annual death of a semitic god or hero of the type of tammuz or adonis whose resurrection on the following day occasioned that outburst of joy and gladness which is characteristic of purim then once more that outburst of joy and gladness for the rearisen tammuz was probably in the month tammuz our junejuly but now it is at purim that is in march how are mr frazers theories to be reconciled with each other and with the facts did the jews wail for tammuz in spring before the exile and after the exile adapt their old rite of a tammuz fast and feast to the vicarious sacrifice of a condemned criminal whether in july or in april in the interests of the king of babylon had they been wont to hang a man while they wailed for tammuz before the exile if so why did they hang him and what did they borrow during the exile or was all that they borrowed just the habit of crowning discrowning whipping and hanging a mockking as an addition to their preexilian tammuz fast and feast we have certainly no evidence that they did these cruel things before the exile and there is no evidence as we shall see that they yearly committed the same atrocity after the exile v theory of a human victim at purim as mr frazer is to make our lord one of the annual victims at purim he has to try to prove that the jews did annually hang or crucify a mockking supposed to be divine at purim to be sure neither prophet nor legislator neither ezekiel ezra nehemiah haggai nor zachariah says one word about this heathen abomination borrowed by the jews mr frazer therefore tries to prove that the man was hanged at purim by the evidence of traces of human sacrifice lingering about the feast of purim in one or other of those mitigated forms to which i have just referred such as the uncertain burning an effigy of a man at tarsus mr frazer is i think rather easily satisfied with this kind of testimony to human sacrifice every fifth of november a man called guy by the populace is burned in effigy but as we know the historical facts we do not though science in the distant future may regard this rite as a trace of druidical human sacrifice guy being a god of the dying foliage of november when st dasius was slain mr frazer explains the old custom of burning judas on easter saturday as all for the purpose of protecting the fields from hail and as really of pagan origin it maybe so the ashes are used in agricultural magic but we know that guy fawkes is not a relic of human sacrifice moreover it is natural to destroy a foe like haman or john knox or mr kruger in effigy the thing is often done the jews undeniably regarded haman on the authority of esther as an enemy of their race so they destroyed him in effigy in the fifth century of our era when the hatred between jews and christians had become bitter the jews in contempt of the christian religion attached the effigy of haman to a cross this insult was forbidden by the codex theodosianus similar doings without the cross prevailed at purim in the middle ages but how does this prove the hanging of a real haman victim before the rise of christianity it merely proves that after the strife between jews and christians began an effigy of haman the national enemy was crucified in contemptu christianae fidei as the edict says to annoy the christians but mr frazer has some positive grounds for thinking that in former times the jews like the babylonians from whom they appear to have derived their purim may at one time have burned hanged or crucified a real man in the character of haman we have seen that purim if it is a tammuz feast and fast was kept by the jews before they went to babylon but passing that what are the positive grounds merely that in ad some jews in syria being heated with wine after certain sports began to deride christianity and for that purpose bound a christian child to the cross at first they only laughed and jeered at him but soon their passions getting the better of them they illtreated the child so that he died under their hands mr frazer can hardly doubt that the sports were purim and that the boy who died on the cross represented haman granting that the sports were purim and that the christian child did duty for haman the purpose was to deride christians and even christ himself these motives did not exist before christianity so how does the anecdote of brutal and cruel mockery ending in murder afford positive grounds for the hypothesis that ever since the exile the jews in imitation of the sacaean proceedings in july or september yearly hanged a mockking in march vi contradictory conjecture mr frazer is so far from holding by these arguments for the practice of hanging a yearly victim at purim as to suggest a conjecture that the victim was not killed at purim at all but a month later if he thinks this possible what becomes of his positive grounds for holding that purim was the date of the hanging i have shown the value of the positive grounds for maintaining a theory that the jews before our era annually hanged a mockking as haman at purim mr frazer himself is so far from being convinced that the jews hanged a man at purim as to suggest the supposition that they did not do so if they did not it gets him out of the difficulty caused by the unlucky circumstance that our lord was crucified not at purim but a month after purim as we read in the gospels but alas if the jews did not on this theory hang a haman at purim what becomes of all mr frazers proofs that they did hang a haman at purim in the total absence of all evidence to that effect we may be sure that the jews did not borrow unrebuked by prophets and legislators a heathen brutality in march from a heathen brutality occurring if at all in july or september and if they did not christ was not the haman of a year which it is mr frazers contention that he may have been vii a new theory of the victim we have seen that purim is either an old jewish tammuz feast existing before the exile or a postexilian adaptation of a persian rite in which a condemned criminal died to save the kings life or both the victim next personates not merely a king but a god whether that god was the elamite humman the babylonian marduk or some other deity not yet identified but the victim represented the king no other god was mentioned again mr frazer says at the sacaean festival if i am right a man who personated a god or hero of the type of tammuz or adonis enjoyed the favours of a woman probably a sacred harlot who represented the great semitic goddess ishtar or astarte but did the king also stand for i a god or hero of the type of tammuz or adonis did he associate with sacred harlots and did he and the victim also personate a god whether that god was the elamite humman the babylonian marduk or some other deity not yet identified were the elamite humman and the babylonian marduk or merodach gods of vegetation marduk or merodach to be sure was the chief god of babylon a solar deity says dr jastrow but as mr frazer suggests that the supreme aryan god zeus may have derived his name the bright or shining one from the oak tree he being actually represented by an oak and oakwood producing bright sparks when used in firemaking why then another supreme god marduk may also be a god of vegetable life but like the horses of virbius the sacaean victim has been plausibly identified with tammuz or adonis it seems worth suggesting that the mockking who was annually killed at the babylonian festival of the sacaea on the sixteenth day of the month lous may have represented tammuz himself he also takes that role with his sacred harlot in iii it is therefore a little bewildering to find him appearing as humman or marduk or some other god unknown in iii how many single gods are rolled into one scourged and hanged in this most unhappy condemned criminal we have been told that marduk presided over a council of the gods at the zakmuk which is the sacaea but the hanged man very probably personates marduk mr frazer may think that when the supreme god is presiding over the olympian assembly in his temple it is a natural and pious compliment to whip and hang him in the person of his human representative this at least is the result of his theory in iii i do not feel sure that the supreme god whether marduk or humman would have taken the same favourable view of the tactless rite viii new german theory of purim i have hitherto but incidentally mentioned marduk and humman as competitors with tammuz and the king for the glory of receiving a vicarious whipping and hanging they are brought into this honourable position by an entirely new teutonic theory of purim not mr frazers it was lately an old jewish tammuz rite or quite a new adaptation of the sacaea but it is possible says professor noeldeke that we have here in purim to do with a feast whereby the babylonians commemorated a victory gained by their gods over the gods of their neighbours the elamites against whom they had so often waged war the jewish feast of purim is an annual merrymaking of a wholly secular kind and it is known that there were similar feasts among the babylonians from the babylonians then the jews borrowed purim a feast commemorative of a victory of the gods of babylon over the elamites but if that feast was religious the jews turned it into an annual merrymaking of a totally secular kind mr frazer if i do not misunderstand him does not accept the hypothesis of noeldeke he says however we can hardly deny the plausibility of the theory that haman and vashti on the one side and mordecai and esther on the other represent the antagonism between the gods of elam and the gods of babylon and the final victory of the babylonian deities in the very capital of their rivals but plausibility we shall see is remote from proof and how can mr frazer think this theory plausible if the sacaea really is a kingtammuz feast but if purim is now to be a rejoicing over a victory of the babylonian gods naturally endeared as these gods were to the jews why was the fast held before purim it was held according to jensens solution which is the best for the supposed annual death of a hero of the type of tammuz or adonis whose resurrection on the following day occasioned that outburst of joy and gladness which is characteristic of purim but if the outburst of joy and gladness characteristic of purim is a jubilation over a victory of the babylonian gods on noeldekes theory why is there a fast the fast of esther before purim which is a feast of the tammuz type to fast for the death of tammuz is a comely thing but why should jews of all people fast before a feast commemorative of a victory of the babylonian gods and why should the jews of all people scourge and hang at the same time the possible human representative of marduk the chief of the gods whose victory they for some reason are commemorating ix another new theory humman and the victim to be sure we are given our choice the victim may represent marduk the chief of the victorious gods but he may also represent humman one of the defeated gods in that case the vanquished hostile gods human representative may well be whipped and hanged in derision of the defeated deity humman but i do not observe that mr frazer offers this hypothesis which seems relatively plausible indeed i am fairly certain that mr frazer does not accept noeldekes theory that purim is a form of a babylonian rejoicing over a victory of their gods it cannot be both that and also a tammuz feast or a festival for the saving of the kings life by the vicarious hanging of a criminal we are next to see how haman mordecai vashti and esther are mixed up with the sacaea zakmuk purim marduk and humman zimmerns view of a

iii g b iii g b iii viii mordecai esther vashti and haman it may be asked how did humman or marduk come to appear as the god connected with the sacaea whereas tammuz had previously taken that part the answer is that humman and marduk came in when we were tentatively regarding purim not as a semitic tammuz feast nor yet as a persian punishment of a condemned criminal acting askings proxy but as a festival for the final victory of the babylonian deities marduk and the rest in the very capital of their rivals humman and his company this was a theory suggested by professor noeldeke it has etymological bases the name mordecai resembles marduk esther is like ishtar haman is like humman the elamite god and there is a divine name in the inscriptions read as resembling vashti and probably the name of an elamite goddess thus the human characters in esther are in peril of merging in babylonian and elamite gods but lest that should occur we ought also to remember that mordecai was the real name of a real historical jew of the captivity one of the companions of nehemiah in the return from exile to jerusalem again esther appears to me to be the crownname of the jewish wife of xerxes in the book of esther hadassah that is esther in the biblical story she conceals her jewish descent hadassah says noeldeke is no mere invention of the writer of esther hadassah is said to mean myrtle bough and girls are still called myrtle esther appears to have been an assumed name after a royal mixed marriage now if a real historical jew might be named mordecai which we know to be the case a jewess whether in fact or in this book of esther which says dr jastrow has of course some historical basis might be styled esther dr jastrow supposes from the proper names that there is a connection between purim the jewish feast accounted for in esther and some babylonian festival not that of zagmuku or zakmuk noeldeke says that no babylonian feast coinciding with purim in date has been discovered indeed this fact gives mr frazer some reason for various conjectures as the date of purim is not that of zakmuk but if mordecai be as it is an historical name of a real jew of the period while esther may be and probably is a name which a jewess might bear it is not ascertained that vashti really is the name of an elamite goddess yet vashti is quite essential as a goddess to mr frazers argument the derivation he says of the names of haman and vashti is less certain but some high authorities are disposed to accept the view of jensen that haman is identical with humman or homman the national god of the elamites and that vashti is in like manner an elamite deity probably a goddess whose name appears in inscriptions now suppose that we adopt mr frazers method about that unruly month lous the identification of the months of the syromacedonian calendar is a matter of some uncertainty as to the month lous in particular the evidence of ancient writers appears to be conflicting and until we have ascertained beyond the reach of doubt when lous fell at babylon in the time of berosus it would be premature to allow much weight to the seeming discrepancy in the dates of the two festivals following this method we might say the identification of haman and vashti with a probable elamite god and goddess is a matter of some uncertainty as to vashti in particular the opinion of modern writers seems to be conflicting and until we have ascertained beyond the reach of doubt that vashti was an elamite goddess and a goddess of what sort it would be premature to allow much weight to the conjecture and then we might go on to allow none at all but this would be too hard a method of dealing with mr frazers hypothesis we should merely be getting rid of his theory in the same way as his theory evades a definite historical obstacle it is clear from the facts about the names mordecai esther haman and vashti that to explain these as necessarily connected with purim zakmuk and the sacaea as a feast of rejoicing for a babylonian divine victory over elamite gods is a very perilous hypothesis among many others as hazardous or even more insecure mr frazer however is intent on connecting the characters of esther with babylonian and elamite gods they are essential to his theory that at the sacaea and purim there were a pair of human representatives of gods haman with a probable sacred harlot vashti doing duty for the dying mordecai with esther doing duty for the rearisen god of vegetation to this point we return now as to this festival of a resurrection of such a god we have seen that in vol ii it occurred in july to mr frazers content but when it had to occur in march in vol iii we were met by the difficulty of two or rather three feasts of this kind in the year perhaps we get rid of this obstacle in iii the resurrection is here that not of tammuz but of a hero of the same type is fixed by jensen at zakmuk and therefore by mr frazer though not by jensen at the sacaea in spring jensens theory is that the death and resurrection of a mythical being who combined in himself the features of a solar god and an ancient king of erech were celebrated at the babylonian zakmuk or festival of the new year and that the transference of the drama from erech its original seat to babylon led naturally to the substitution of marduk the great god of babylon for gilgamesh or eabani in the part of the hero jensen fortunately for his peace of mind apparently does not identify the zakmuk with the sacaea jensen constructs his scheme thus gilgamesh was a hero of erech who repelled the amorous advances of the goddess ishtar gilgamesh became extremely unwell his friend eabani also aroused the fury of ishtar and died gilgamesh procured his return from the world of the dead to the upper world the feast celebrating this resurrection was removed from erech to babylon instead of a mortal hero gilgamesh or eabani a being cold and chaste as joseph andrews the babylonians now cast marduk their supreme god for the part the feast was zakmuk of course this is precisely as if we said that an old feast of adonis was turned into a new feast of zeus whose coldness as regards goddesses was not proverbial like the frigidity of adonis gilgamesh eabani mr andrews and other notable examples the theory seems to lack plausibility but as jensen apparently does not identify zakmuk with the sacaea he escapes the curious theory of supposing that marduk late gilgamesh or eabani is whipped and hanged in the person of his human representative an unheardof way of honouring the personator of the supreme being however if we accept jensens theory and also like mr frazer identify zakmuk with the sacaea then remembering that eabani rose from the dead if he did and that marduk is now eabani and that the sacaean victim is or may be marduk and is also the king we get a reason for supposing that the victim too was feigned to rise from the dead in the person of mordecai marduk but why was the representative of marduk who in jensens theory represented eabani whipped and hanged the victim on this theory if we add it to mr frazers seems to me to personate the king of babylon marduk eabani or gilgamesh and thus to combine a god or hero of vegetation which eabani is bound to be with a mortal king and a supreme god and oh why is he whipped and hanged taking the theory of iii it seems to run thus in combination with all that has gone before the king was burned alive annually his royal substitute was next burned alive annually his criminal substitute was burned alive annually till this was commuted for whipping and hanging with or without burning the king before the feast of zakmuk was brought from erech to babylon had incarnated some god or other i presume of vegetation after the eabani feast at erech became the marduk feast at babylon the king i think but i may be wrong represented eabani plus marduk if he did so too does the victim at the sacaea but eabani in a babylonian poem has a resurrection though i cannot find it in jastrows account of the poem the victim then being a personation of eabani of marduk and of the king has a resurrection after he has been hanged under the name of humman a god of the elamites he owes that name mr frazer thinks to a popular misconception for he really is the king plus eabani plus marduk dying as king and as marduk under the alias of humman haman he is feigned according to the theory to rise under the name of marduk mordecai the mordecai of one year becomes the haman of the next is hanged and so on this is an hypothesis of some complexity an effort is needed to maintain the mental equilibrium as we contemplate this hypothesis however by thus amalgamating the ideas of jensen and of mr frazer one gets in the mock royalty from the king the scourging and hanging from the mitigation of burning alive the divinity of vegetation from eabani who lends that part of his attributes to marduk and the resurrection from eabani who in the babylonian poem rose again though i own that in dr jastrows account of the poem i am unable to discover this incident the spirit of eabani is conjured up indeed in the poem but there is a tone of despair in the final speech of eabani this is hardly a resurrection however i am but poorly seen in babylon and its poetry and no doubt eabani had his resurrection from that or a similar resurrection mr frazer deduces the probability that the sacaean victim in his resurrection was represented by mordecai he like haman had a sacred bride esther in the book of esther to be sure she is mordecais cousin and adopted daughter mr frazer knows better i esther loved by mordecai a clear reminiscence of the time when esther was the goddess bride of mordecai her cousin appears in modern jewish plays in which mordecai is the lover i hope merely platonic of esther and a very natural modern touch it is the pair were cousins and esther was extremely pretty in exactly the same way two little girls of my acquaintance dramatised bluebeard and made the brother who rescues mrs bluebeard in the tale the lover of mrs bluebeard she had preferred to marry bluebeard for his money on which in this most immoral drama mrs bluebeard and her lover her husbands slayer lived happily ever afterwards this is modern the original tale does not run thus again mr frazer says that the babbis maintain that xerxes only wedded a shadow esther while the real esther sat on the lap of mordecai a most natural shift to save esthers character in a case of mixed marriages so stesichorus and euripides long before gave a shadow helen into the arms of paris the real helen meanwhile saved her character by leading a life of remarkable purity in egypt these late shifts and evasions have no real bearing on the question of the original relations between esther and mordecai ii the persian buffoon mr frazer now harms his cause perhaps by proving that just as in esther mordecai had a royal ride so in persia a beardless and if possible oneeyed buffoon rode in mock royalty through the streets collecting money or goods exactly like our robin hood before and even after the scottish reformation it was une quete examples are endless after his second round he fled for the people might beat him if they caught him obviously in revenge i think for his robberies but mr frazer as usual supposes the right to beat the buffoon to point plainly enough to the harder fate of the sacrificed mockking no date is given for this persian custom but if it existed when the jews were in persia did it coexist with sacrifice of a mockking if not if it was a substitute for that obsolete cruelty why are the jews supposed to have borrowed the cruelty no longer practised this is a question of dates which may be implied but are not given though i understand mr frazer to mean that the buffoons ride is later than the origin of purim on the other hand lagarde one of the most learned of orientalists thinks that the ride of the beardless was already customary at the time when the stories about esther and purim were composed the persians says lagarde had the feast of farwardigan a feast of jollity the rich making presents to the poor as at purim they had also the feast of the massacre of the magi magophonia and thirdly they had the popular diversion of the bide of the beardless now the authors of the esther legend had these three colours on their palette and with these three painted not a portrait of one feast but a kind of mixed caricature for the jewish carnival the magophonia lent the colours of the massacre farwardigan lent the jollity and the presents the ride of the beardless lent the procession of mordecai in that case and if lagarde is right the jews found at babylon not a slaying of a mockking but the ride of the beardless so they did not borrow the slaying of a mockking but introduced into the esther legend an incident of a ride suggested by the ride of mordecai which mr frazer calls a degenerate copy of the original namely the reign and death of the mockking whether lagardes view be correct or not this part of the evidence is far too sandy a foundation for a theory about a matter of solemn importance the jews could not borrow the hanging of a victim from the sacaea if in their exile they only found the ride of the beardless one as in lagardes theory not that he mentions the sacaea mr frazer at all events sees a connection between purim and the ride of the beardless but the latter is popular not official in spite of the fact that the king takes most of the goods facetiously robbed as popular the ride is more primitive he thinks and shows its meaning better than the sacaea does so mr frazer says if there is any truth in the connection thus traced between purim and the ride of the beardless one we are now in a position to finally unmask the leading personages in the book of esther and show how marduk and humman got into the plot purim is not only the sacaea sacrifice and all but is also connected with the ride of the beardless one in which there was no sacrifice how this if true enables us to finally unmask the characters in esther is not at first very clear apparently the buffoonery of the beardless one who complained of the heat while the populace snowballed him in march was a magical ceremony to make hot weather by pretending that the weather in fact was hot therefore the hypothetical rites of haman vashti mordecai esther represent in the first pair the decaying in the second pair the reviving energies of vegetation past and present one pair mates and the male at least is slain the other pair mates and survives to encourage vegetable life by the hypothesis the first pair haman and vashti originally lived as man and wife for a whole year on the conclusion of which the male partner haman was put to death of course even if haman was the mockking slain at the sacaea which we do not grant his mockkingship was very brief however it lasted for a year originally we may conjecture the later fortunes of vashti are wrapped up in mystery but i cannot refrain from quoting one of my authors most eloquent passages on this obscure subject we do not hear that vashti was put to death in fact we do not hear anything about her at all from our one authority but i the nature of maternity suggests an obvious reason for sparing her a little longer till that mysterious law which links together womans life with the changing aspects of the nightly sky had been fulfilled by the birth of an infant god who should in his turn reared perhaps by her tender care grow up to live and die for the world as vashti except for her profession was not an habitual criminal let us hope that she was spared to look after the baby her issue if any and if male was apparently an hereditary criminal for otherwise he would not be hanged the victims were always condemned criminals the cruelty of thus deliberately breeding such a criminal class for the mere purpose of hanging them is shocking to the modern mind we wish to know whether the jewish hamans were also born and bred up to the business mr frazer does not tell us that this was the case or what became of vashtis female issue the ride of mordecai in royal raiment is connected with and explained if i follow my author by the ride of the persian beardless buffoon to be sure the buffoon rode naked on an ass mordecai rode in royal apparel of blue and white with a crown of gold but the buffoon is clearly later than the origin of purim in mr frazers opinion though not in that of lagarde so long as the temporary king was a real substitute for the reigning monarch and had to die sooner or later in his stead it was natural that he should be treated with a greater show of deference but mordecai who rode royally was the man who did not die haman died therefore mr frazer has to guess that the mordecai of one year died as the haman of the next ah me there are so many guesses in any case mordecai is nothing but a slightly altered form of marduk or merodach as is now generally recognised by biblical scholars nevertheless a real historical jew called mordecai occurs as we saw in ezra and nehemiah so the name was a jewish name odd as it appears now mordecai by the theory has to be whipped and hanged finally and that seems an odd compliment to merodach or marduk who as supreme babylonian god is presiding over the gods while his human substitute is being slain infamously but remember when whipped and hanged the mordecai of so to speak has become the haman of and some high authorities are disposed to accept the theory of jensen that haman is identical with humman or homman the national god of the elamites iii a helpful theory of my own if these high authorities are right i at last see my way clear haman or the victim of the sacaea is now neither the representative of the king of babylon nor of tammuz nor of both at once nor of marduk nor of eabani nor of gilgamesh he is now if noeldeke or jensen is right the representative of a conquered and hostile god humman of the elamites tout va bien the human representative of a hostile and defeated god may well have been whipped and hanged in derision i shall grant that humman was also the elamite god of vegetation tammuz or the like what else could he be and so had to fall as the leaves fall and also had to spring up as the flowers do and this both in junejuly and also in marchapril if all this is the case if the sacaean victim is haman and represents humman and if humman is a defeated elamite god and if purim is adapted from a babylonian feast of rejoicing for victory gained by the babylonian gods over the gods of their neighbours the elamites as noeldeke thinks possible then all is comparatively plain sailing but this is only if we follow jensen which i do not understand mr frazer to do indeed jensen is only responsible for identifying haman with humman jensen does not identify him with the sacaean victim it is mr frazer who does that the theory if haman is humman and is also the victim has now put on an aspect which i can almost accept if haman stands for humman and if humman is a vanquished god of the hostile elamites then we solve that hard problem namely why the human representative of a king or friendly god was whipped and hanged and mocked at the sacaea the victim i shall show did represent the rightful king but also personated the vanquished deity of a race long inimical but now subdued so his harsh treatment was if vulgar not unnatural but all this depends on following jensen which we are not to do mr frazer seems to hold that though according to the view of jensen which some high authorities are disposed to accept haman is identical with humman or homman the national god of the elamites yet originally this was not really the case let us suppose it to have been the case and i can suggest an excellent solution fatigued by the task of producing sons who had to be sacrificed yearly as his substitutes the king of early babylon at one time annually sacrificed as his proxy an elamite captive who to deride elamite religion was also the human representative of the elamite god humman and therefore was called humman or haman just so the aztecs sacrificed captives as representatives of their own gods but as relations between elam and babylon grew more peaceful elamite captives were scarce the king of babylon then substituted for an elamite warprisoner a condemned criminal who still represented the elamite humman or haman but also as in the original hypothesis represented the king of babylon we must next conjecture that humman himself was a god of vegetation indeed i can hardly suppose that any god whatever did not represent the principle of vegetable life so humman must not only die but have a resurrection as vegetable gods often do now thanks to my hypothesis all is clear and every difficulty is removed we once more see that the kings of babylon were sacrificed regularly every year let us say that they were burned as victims usually were indeed movers thought that at the sacaea also the man who played the god for five days was originally burnt at the end of them mr frazer himself suggests that in the progress of philanthropy the man who used to be burned was merely scourged and hanged or crucified by way of a later mitigation of his sufferings or perhaps he was hanged first and burned afterwards as in our good oldfashioned punishment for treason whereby many jesuits were cut down alive and many jacobites their bowels being burned before their living eyes but to burn a man only half hanged and still capable of feeling pain would not mitigate his sufferings my own theory pleases me better when tired of being sacrificed yearly the babylonian king provided a substitute in a son or other member of the royal family with what sad and ruinous results to the dynasty i have already shown let us suppose that the princely substitutes were also really sacrificed by burning but here the merit of my theory comes in and i hope shines forth wearied of sacrificing princes of his house the king substitutes elamite prisoners of war there is no objection to whipping and hanging them except the frivolous objection that they at once cease to be sacrifices and we can overcome that difficulty by supposing that they were hanged first and burned afterwards or wirryit at are stake like george wishart in st andrews and then burned this makes it needless to regard whipping and hanging as a mitigation the next step is when elamite wars cease and elamite captives are not procurable to substitute a condemned criminal who he also like the elamite prisoners is called humman and represents both the king of babylon and humman an elamite god of vegetation who like tammuz has his resurrection we thus get babylonian king incarnates the god of vegetation is therefore sacrificed annually to keep the god provided with a succession of fresh and sturdy subjects to be incarnated in the king is burned his sons or nephews are treated in the same way for the same reasons annually the king escapes an elamite warprisoner becomes the kings substitute he also represents the elamite god of vegetation in mockery of the elamites and their god he is scourged and hanged observe the aztec analogy though to be sure the aztec captive representing an aztec god is merely sacrificed but he represents a friendly god the substitute is next a condemned criminal he also is whipped and hanged like the elamite warcaptive he represents the king of babylon and dies for him he also dies as the elamite god of vegetable life and as such has a resurrection in the shape of mordecai who represents the babylonian supreme god marduk not tammuz or another and is not hanged till next year when he becomes haman or humman represents the king of babylon represents the elamite god of vegetation and is whipped and hanged after enjoying as king the caresses of the royal harem and as humman the embraces of a sacred harlot vashti who personates ishtar after being hanged and perhaps burned he has a pseudoresurrection in the marduk of that year the humman of the next and so on both at the sacaea and at purim this hypothesis appears to be in many ways an advance on any one of mr frazers hypotheses it allows us to keep up the jewish haman as personating humman which seems necessary for how otherwise is haman to be explained we are moreover enabled to understand how a victim who represented a vanquished elamite god also and at the same time represented a victorious babylonian king humman being by my hypothesis an elamite kind of tammuz all our anxieties about the appearance of marduk and humman where tammuz had previously done duty disappear purim which had been a tammuz feast if we accept jensens solution and also a feast where a man died for the king and then a feast of triumph for the victory of the babylonian gods and a wholly secular merrymaking though if purim is a jewish tammuz feast it had been according to ezekiel who perhaps knew best a religious rite of a false religion now becomes all these things at once though some may doubt how purim could be simultaneously both religious and secular but i would not abandon my theory merely because it involves a contradiction in terms add to all this that we can now have a tammuz death and resurrection in junejuly and another in marchapril and all is translucent at the summer festival we burn a dummy at the vernal feast we hang a man admirably as my hypothesis colligates the facts it is not the hypothesis of mr frazer though he thinks that we can hardly deny the plausibility of noeldekes theory that the sacaea is a triumph for the victory of the babylonian over the elamite gods and that purim is an adaptation of the sacaea mr frazer does not accept that idea noeldeke is plausible but not sound and this is ruinous to my hypothesis of the elamite warprisoner slain as humman merely in a stage of evolution between the sacrificed prince and the hanged criminal we have seen how admirably my humble suggestion worked out all round but it must be abandoned if noeldeke is wrong mr frazer thinks that the sacaea and purim did not as in noeldekes scheme mean originally a triumph of babylonian over elamite gods no elamite prisoner was hanged as i had sagely conjectured at any stage of the evolution of the sacaea what occurred was this at the sacaea there were originally two divine pairs let us say vashti and haman to represent the dying esther and mordecai to represent the renascent forces of vegetation there was nothing elamite in the business originally but it would be natural enough that in time an unfavourable comparison should be drawn between the two pairs and that people forgetting their real meaning and religious identity should see in their apparent opposition a victory of the gods of babylon over the gods of their eternal foes the elamites hence while the happy pair retained their babylonian names of marduk and ishtar the unhappy pair who were originally nothing but marduk and ishtar in a different aspect were renamed after the hated elamite deities humman and vashti thus the plausibility of noeldekes theory that purim was adapted from rejoicings for a victory of the babylonian gods over those of elam proves to be no more than merely plausible we are thus driven back to jensens solution that the fast and the rejoicings of purim are a festival of tammuz or of a god or hero of his type and they cannot then have been borrowed in babylon for the jews had the tammuz ritual before the exile and yet purim was probably borrowed at babylon it must apparently be meant that only the hanging of a mockking was really borrowed the victim may thus represent both the king of babylon and also the god of vegetation whom we are to suppose to be incarnated in the king but why should the jews borrow that and why did the prophets and legislators hold their peace and how do we know that the majesty of babylon incarnated a god of vegetation as i sometimes understand mr frazers whole theory it is this the victim of the sacaea represents the king who represents marduk humman tammuz or some other deity he gets his royal robes from the king his whipping and hanging from the commuted burning alive of the king his divinity from the king plus the god his resurrection from the king plus tammuz or eabani granting that eabani had a resurrection which i cannot find in dr jastrows account but to do a resurrection plausibly we need another man to take the part of the rearisen victim king and god now the victim for the year is really or is called marduk in one shape his representative in the resurrection is marduk in another shape each man being provided with a consort representing ishtar though i have yet to learn that she was the wife or mistress either of marduk or eabani but the populace not understanding the two marduks and two ishtars preferred to call the marduk who died humman after an elamite god and his sacred lady of pleasure vashti after a possible but dubious elamite goddess the marduk who did not die was still called marduk till next year and his consort till next year was called ishtar all this occurred at the sacaea which are zakmuk though jensen does not appear to see it and at purim which jastrow and noeldeke do not identify with zakmuk and in march not as chronology has it in july by pushing the proceedings forward only a month from purim to passover we can connect them with the crucifixion and account for the halo of divinity the theory seems too ramified it may very naturally be thought that i am introducing these complexities and these difficulties by dint of wilfully or unconsciously misrepresenting mr frazers argument but the argument i sincerely think is really a very tangled one it seems plain that originally the victim was only conceived of by mr frazer as dying to save the life of the king who otherwise would have been slain as a god on mr frazers hypothesis of religious regicide as he could not be trusted to remain in full bodily and mental vigour for more than a year the king was slain in his character as a god who could not be trusted for more than a year nothing was said to indicate that the mock king incarnated any special known god say tammuz that conjecture appeared later and the date of the sacrifice was in junejuly nothing was said even now about the victims sacred harlot the victim was content with the royal harem as late as iii the central feature of the sacaea seems to have been the saving of the kings life by the slaying of the victim and to that main end of the rite no sacred harlot was necessary but the date had now been moved from midsummer to early spring and into the neighbourhood of the feast of purim the religious character of the sacaea period of wailing and rejoicing in sympathy with a god tammuz now seemed to be overlooked for mr frazer says that the sacaea was a wild bacchanalian revel and that purim was the same men and women disguising themselves drinking and behaving wantonly but purim was connected through the book of esther with haman mordecai vashti and esther and now arose the idea of making haman the victim have a double who represented him in his resurrection the elamite god humman and the babylonian god mordecai crept in through the book of esther and through the very perilous effort to identify the sacaea with zakmuk and both with purim the book of esther also introduced two female characters and parts had to be found for them in the sacaea though our only authority mentions in connection with the sacaea no female characters whatever except the ladies of the royal harem by analogy and conjecture as to semiramis and her lovers parts were next found for the female characters of the book of esther as sacred harlots representing the goddess of love the consequent amours are supposed to stimulate the crops and in this part of the theory the conjecture that the victim really dies to save the life of the king does appear to be rather dropped out of sight though this idea is the real startingpoint of the whole speculation there is a come and go between the victim as king with the royal harem and the victim as tammuz with the sacred harlot conjectures about the victim as the elamite humman or as the babylonian marduk or as marduk representing eabani or representing gilgamesh flit like the weavers shuttle through the strangely woven warp and woof of the argument throughout we ask in vain for any proof that the king of babylon was ever at any time in any text regarded or spoken of as an incarnation of tammuz or of marduk or of humman or of gilgamesh or of eabani which the speculation requires meanwhile the known or at least the alleged facts are the mock royalty whipping and death of the man who yearly lorded it as king for five days in the persian palace at the sacaea a period of licence when every house had its slaveking the extraordinary complexities in a matter really very simple are caused by identifying the sacaea with purim and zakmuk in the teeth of chronology and by introducing into the sacaea without any historical evidence the characters of a hebrew historical romance about the origin of purim the tendency also to find gods of vegetation everywhere adds its bewildering enchantment till the spirit of system discovers gods of vegetation in the criminals who on very slender evidence are said to have been yearly whipped and hanged nay even the hypothetical male issue of the criminal by a hypothetical harlot becomes a hypothetical infant god is brought up as a criminal and ends as a mockking and a divine victim mr frazers whole argument of course clashes with the higher criticism of wellhausen who avers that the jews could keep no feasts in the exile and there learned the lesson of religious isolation on the other hand the jews by mr frazers theory did keep a feast and a very abominable feast and far from learning the lesson of religious isolation borrowed the most execrable heathen cruelties accompanied by ritual debaucheries so wellhausen must greatly err in his opinions which are much revered by the clergy of this island

the sacaea whipped and hanged though i have tried to argue against mr frazers theory of the cause of the sacrifice of the mock sacaean king i am not prepared to offer a dogmatic countertheory the sacaean case is unique is isolated we are acquainted with no other similar examples and thus a rite which has an isolated existence may have had a singular cause the cause may be hidden behind the scenes of history though i have not a firm hypothesis as to that cause i shall end this chapter by throwing out a conjecture for what it may be worth meanwhile it may be asked why i call the adventure of the sacaean mockking isolated and unique have we not other examples of temporary kings holding office for three or four days in a period of festivity and unreason certainly we have such kings but all of them scape whipping and hanging and none of them was a slave or a criminal these are not mere verbal and probably not mere accidental variations from the solitary sacaean type but we have the legend of st dasius yes but accepting the truth of that legend it rather adds to than diminishes the difficulty of getting a clue to the origin of the sacaean mockking and his doom let us tabulate the facts a sacaea b saturnalia a condemned criminal a freeman selected by lot king of a thirty days revel king of a five days revel is stripped and scourged is not stripped or scourged is hanged is sacrificed at the altar of saturn or sacrifices himself is guessed to represent a a represents saturn tammuz god or b the king of babylon or both has a pseudoresurrection has no known pseudoresurrection lies with a the royal does not lie with royal concubines b with a sacred concubines or with a sacred harlot harlot in a period of topsyturvy in a period of topsyturvy licence to slaves and free licence to slaves and free which is supposed to which is supposed to commemorate a victory over the commemorate the golden age of sacae saturn under a number the item that the sacaean mockking represents the king of babylon or tammuz or both number the mockkings pseudoresurrection and number his amour with the sacred harlot are all conjectures of mr frazers the real points of resemblance between the sacaean and the moesian victim are their mockery of royalty their death occurring in very different circumstances during a period of licence including the pretence of lordship by slaves in each household at babylon by free men at rome the points of difference are numerous and essential and the dates and durations of the babylonian and roman festivals vary widely thus i think the sacaean and moesian cases do not explain the meaning of what is a religious rite in moesia a secular custom as i believe in babylon again the differences make it hard to conjecture with mm cumont and parmentier that the moesian rite was introduced by oriental soldiers of rome accustomed to the babylonian sacaea but to suppose a native roman survival or recrudescence is also difficult because greek and roman poets historians antiquaries and essayists all writing on the saturnalia know of no such survival again if originally italian mockkings were sacrificed yearly in many places did they die as proxies for real local italian kings who would otherwise have been sacrificed this as we have seen is impossible men would never have accepted the crown on such conditions or did they die like the mexican victims as mangods slain for a real god saturn but the mexican victim was a captive free men would hardly draw lots for death there is no trace in roman folkcustom of any mock slaying of the actual roman saturnalian kings of the brawls in each household the saturnalia were so remote in lucians day from cruelty that dickens might have written as christmas papers lucians essays and letters on the subject universal kindness the scrooges feasting the trotty vecks of the period universal giving of presents and family games of forfeits and of chance played for nuts were the features of the saturnalia wine flowed like water but as to amorous licence at the saturnalia we only hear the complaint of the rich that the poor guests make too free with the ladies of the house the connection of the saturnalia with saturn recognised by the romans as that old savage the greek cronos may or may not have been original the saturnalia were not saturnine was the theory of a golden age under saturn not a reflection from the festive period the best day in the year says catullus which had become associated with the name of saturn our evidence for sacrifice or hanging of a mockking is so meagre and shadowy in one case the dubious dasius legend in the other what athenaeus cites from berosus coupled with what dio puts into the mouth of diogenes and with what strabo tells about the sacaea that the ground will not bear the weight of mr frazers highpiled eighteenstoried castle of hypotheses i do not even so absolutely impugn the truth of the two tales of the deaths of mockkings the undesigned coincidence of testimony i am willing to take for presumption of truth though of four ancient witnesses who speak of the sacaea only one dio alludes to the crowning robing stripping scourging and hanging of the mockking of the festival i periods of licence how are we to explain the obscure facts let us begin with a feature common to the moesian event of ad and to the sacaea both occur in a period of chartered licence when slaves play the masters and all is topsyturvy mr frazer has collected many examples of festivals of licence when laws lose their force the roman slaves at the saturnalia were not even reproved for conduct which at any other season might have been punished with stripes imprisonment or death now pass the conjecture that in just one known place babylon the stripes and death for the conduct usually punished with these penalties were inflicted after the period of licence on just one person and you get dios case of the mockking of the babylonian sacaea meanwhile observe that there was a zoganes or slavelord ruling in every babylonian household including that of the king each zoganes was royally attired and bore sway in the dwelling where except in the five days of licence he served but for all that was done in these five days only one man was punished and he was the kings zoganes athenaeus does not mention this hesychius is silent strabo does not even speak of the lordship of slaves our only evidence for the slaying of the kings zoganes is dio chrysostom putting the anecdote into a feigned discourse of diogenes the slaying occurs only in one place as the persians had only one king meanwhile let us study in various regions the periods of licence it seems as if human nature needed an annual burst mr frazer suggests as a magical motive that the farmers thought by swilling and guzzling just before they proceeded to sow the fields that they thereby imparted additional vigour to the seed in fact whether men fasted or feasted were chaste or amorous in all cases they acted for the benefit of the crops be it so but why should nonagricultural savages have periods of licence i venture to suggest that the agricultural motive in religion and ritual is at present rather overworked it is becoming as common an explanation of custom and belief as the recognition of the sun and the dawn everywhere used to be in mythology to show that a period of licence with express and purposeful breach of the most sacred laws may exist without an agricultural motive i shall prove later that it occurs among a nonagricultural set of savages and consequently when found among agricultural peoples may descend from some nonagricultural motive mr frazer himself elsewhere assigns a motive not necessarily agricultural for these chartered explosions of unlaw on the gold coast the period of licence precedes the annual ceremony of banishing the devil the season of the year is not given the feast of licence of the hos of northeast india is called by dalton a saturnale it is held in january when the granaries are full of grain and the people to use their own expression are full of devilry with prayers for a good new year the devil is beaten out of the bounds at the similar mundari festival the servants are feasted by their masters so far nothing is noted about swilling for the good of the crops that is not an excuse for the glass in the hindoo koosh a little licence exists at the end of harvest devils are driven out and then seed is sown in tonquin from january to february was a season of dormant law only treason and murder were taken account of and the malefactors detained till the great seal should come into operation again then offerings were made to evil spirits for it is usual and customary among them to feast the condemned before their execution the devils were then expelled in cambodia after the expulsion of devils diabolofugium gambling is universal in nepaul in october feasting and drinking occur and presents are made by masters to slaves there may be perhaps expulsion of devils for the army fire salutes in these cases of licence mr frazer thinks that men rejoice either before the expulsion of devils because that ceremony will carry off their sins or after the expulsion when their minds are at ease thus men enjoy these bursts either by the first hypothesis to improve the prospects of agriculture or on the second theory because a ceremony will cleanse the sins of the burst or because a ceremony has freed their minds from fear of devils when the harvest is just in then in fact men have plenty of food and as we saw are full of devilry so they play it off in at least four out of our seven cases fulness of bread and drink appears to me to account for the burst this also explains the zulu licence at the rejoicing for the first fruits a saturnalia people are not supposed to be responsible for what they say or do the same facts mark the pondo feast of first fruits in ashanti the harvest feast is in september during its continuance the grossest licence prevails theft intrigue and assault go unpunished and both sexes abandon themselves to their passions by an extraordinary coincidence which mr frazer does not quote on the fifth day of the ashanti harvest festival a criminal is sacrificed says sir a b ellis sent as a messenger to the deceased kings is the criminal attired as a mockking i would venture to suggest as a conclusion that people indulge in these lawless excesses not so much to improve the prospects of farming as because they are full of devilry and that often they are full of devilry because they have ended their labours and are full of meat and drink sine bacche et cerere friget venus they therefore permit themselves a regular debauch ranks are reversed slaves lord it over their masters laws are in abeyance in tonquin reviving law only takes notice of treason and murder in borne at the saturnalia and at purim among the jews however a kind of dickensite christianicy prevailed at the period of licence also in persia at the period called purdaghan which hyde compares to the sacaea and purim as does lagarde in writing on purim the reader will have observed that at not one of these many periods of licence in widely severed regions and grades of civilisation is a mockking put to death indeed nobody is put to death except in ashanti and nobody is scourged thus as i remarked before the case of the mockking at the babylonian sacaea is isolated as far as our knowledge goes ii the divine scapegoat in many cases however at expulsion of the devils the part of devil is played by a man who is driven away often he is beaten away now i have already said that by mr frazers theory as i understand it the mockking at the sacaea was sacrificed in a double role namely both as the kings proxy the king being a god and also as tammuz not to speak of marduk and humman to this of course i replied that no case seemed to be given of killing a king yearly to benefit a god that i could find no case of a king being killed by proxy that when kings really were killed it was not annually nor by the infamous death of a malefactor hanging that there was no proof of a man being killed as tammuz that tammuz is nowhere said to have been hanged or crucified or scourged that in no case known to me is sacrifice performed by hanging still less if possible by hanging after a whipping these arguments convince me that mr frazers theory if it is his theory is unconvincing but i am not quite sure that mr frazer really holds his sacaean victim to have played two parts at two distinct times of year now however in connection with human scapegoats our author does certainly make a victim double a part first it was usual to kill a beastgod or mangod to save his divine life from being weakened by the inroads of age next there were human scapegoats driven away with all evil on their heads but suggests mr frazer if it occurred to people to combine these two customs the result would be the employment of the dying god godman king or his proxy as a scapegoat he was killed not originally to take away sin but to save the divine life from the degeneracy of old age but since he had to be killed at any rate people may have thought that they might as well seize the opportunity to lay upon him the burden of their sufferings and sin in order that he might bear it away with him to the unknown world beyond the grave even so when a dublin mob was about to throw a man over from the gallery of the theatre some economist cried dont waste him kill a fiddler with him as proof that people might reason in this thrifty way we learn that on march a scapegoat man called old mars was beaten at borne and expelled mars of course was a god of vegetation and here the mangod old mars is both god and scapegoat but he is not sacrificed nor even hanged in athens during plague drought or famine two human scapegoats were done to death and mr frazer infers but doubtfully were stoned to death this also occurred yearly at the thargelia the stoning is a conjecture in greek cities of asia minor in times of calamity an ugly or deformed man was made to eat dried figs a barley loaf and cheese then he was beaten seven times in a special manner with squills and myrtle boughs was burned and the ashes were thrown into the sea the beating at once expelled evil influences and was good for the crops so in this ugly poor devil we must recognise a representative of the creating and fertilising god of vegetation i really must try to save him from this general doom these stupid cruelties if they had the usual agricultural motive worked magically not religiously worked by sympathetic magic not by divine interference this creature though supposed to be a god of vegetation was confessedly in appearance no adonis in rejecting the idea that this hideous wretch did duty as a god adonis so fair that he won and so cold that he rejected the love of the golden aphrodite i may justify myself by mr frazers example i argue that the deformed victim was if anything used in magic not in religion not as embodying a god in the same way mr frazer himself says of the rites of the dying god of vegetation all over western asia that the ritual was fundamentally a religious or rather a magical ceremony so was the beating and death of the ugly deformed man as to whom no evidence hints that he did duty for a god a merely magical ceremony now let us see where we are mr frazers point was to prove that a man whom he regarded as a proxy of a godking was put to death at a period of chartered licence to save the divine life but people also had human scapegoats so they perhaps argued this is my own suggestion as the proxy of the mangod himself ex officio a mangod has to be killed at any rate and as a scapegoat has to be thumped why not thump the mangod who has to die at any rate let him double the part nay as we are economising let him treble the part let him be beaten as a scapegoat be hanged as a proxy for the divine life of the king and also be hanged as tammuz but to prove that all this was deliberately thought out where have we a case of a scapegoat godman who is put to death we have none unless we let mr frazer persuade us that his ugly deformed person i a degraded and useless being must be recognised as a representative of the creative and fertilising god of vegetation whose reproductive powers are stimulated that these might be transmitted in full activity to his successor the new god or new embodiment of the old god who was doubtless supposed immediately to take the place of the one slain i must decline to obey mr frazers must and to recognise an adonis in the ugly deformed person next i demur to the idea that doubtless the dying deformed one handed over his powers to a new god thirdly if all this is meant to show that the sacaean criminal was not only a proxy saving the royal divine life and enjoying the royal harem and was a representative of tammuz enjoying a sacred harlot but was moreover a human scapegoat scourged as such and to stimulate his reproductive powers and to expel evil influences then i really cannot accept the portentous hypothesis no attested examples of human scapegoats at babylon are offered but that is a trifle if mr frazer really means to add the duties of a scapegoat and the consequent beating to the duties of proxy king and tammuz man in his chapter on the saturnalia he does not say so it does not appear then that he wishes to explain the scourging of the mockking at the sacaea by his theory of a human scapegoat and it does not appear that he ever explains the stripping of the royal robes from the unlucky man yet if the man really died as a mockking there must have been some reason for stripping him of his royal raiment we never hear that the representative of king saturnus was either stripped or whipped before being sacrificed nor do i remark that in anahuac the human victim who personated a god was stripped of the gods robes and ornaments why then was the sacaean victim and he alone as far as we know reduced from his royalty by being stripped before execution and also brought down to the estate of a slave by being scourged iii more periods of licence i am going with more than diffidence to offer a guess at the reasons asking it to be remembered that i do so merely because the case is isolated and cannot at present be illustrated by parallel ceremonies but first returning to the periods of licence i must show that they are not peculiar to agricultural races nor therefore necessarily instituted to aid the farmer this in itself is a great comfort for one wearies of being told that the crops are so eternally the cause of custom and rite among the arunta of central australia in many ways a backward race and not agricultural considerable licence is allowed on certain occasions when a large number of men and women are gathered together to perform certain corroborees or sacred dances so say messrs spencer and gillen the laws of marriage are then turned upside down a man is ordered to have relations with the woman who is his mura that is one to whom he may not under ordinary circumstances even speak or go near much less have anything like marital relations with every man is expected to send his wife to these dances for the express purpose of violating in this period of licence the most sacred laws of the tribe these backward persons the arunta have no native strong drink and cannot get intoxicated but what they can they do in the way of licence like more civilised races and necessarily not for agricultural reasons as they have no agriculture they break their most sacred law just as the jews at purim deliberately broke the law of moses conceivably then even stripping scourging and hanging a mockking at the sacaea may also have been done for some reason not agricultural what view did the persians themselves take of their festival i do not think that mr frazer insists enough on this point the persians regard the sacaea as commemorative of a great massacre of the sacae near the euxine in both forms of the persian legend in strabo their ancestors fell on the sacae when that tribe was hopelessly intoxicated drunk and frantic drowsy and asleep or dancing and maddened with wine the sacae were massacred and the sacaea a feast of licence was dedicated to the persian goddess anaitis obviously in memory of the intoxicated revels of the sacae or so tradition averred the persians thus by dint of a popular etymology sacaea from sacae accounted to themselves for the origin of a period of chartered licence in which says strabo both men and women dressed in the scythian habit drink and sport wantonly by night and day as in many other cases collected by athenaeus the lawless revel had its kings of unreason slaves acting as masters and kings just one of these kings the zoganes in the royal household was afterwards stripped scourged and hanged what could the reason be we have seen that in tonquin all crimes committed in the period of licence are overlooked except treason and murder we have been told that in the roman saturnalia a slave might do unreproved what at any other time would be punished with stripes imprisonment or death we have read that at the pondo period of licence nobody was later made responsible for his actions though at tonquin murder and treason were excepted the same irresponsibility pervades the zulu period of licence to reinforce this fact that the most sacred laws are purposefully broken at some periods of licence i cite the nanga orgies in old fiji the nanga is frequently spoken of as the mbaki or harvest people being full of devilry and food at harvest which perhaps they need not be in marchapril all distinctions of property were suspended at the nanga men and women in fantastic dresses publicly practised unmentionable abominations even the relationship of brother and sister seemed to be no bar to the general licence but after the nanga as before the nanga brothers and sisters might not even speak to each other this precisely answers to the australian incest with the mura brothers and sisters at the nanga were intentionally coupled the ceremonies included initiatory mysteries like the bora of the australian blacks as at the arunta corroborees the great point was to break the most sacred laws those of incest this peculiar burst then is in australia preagricultural though as in fiji it survives among an agricultural people iv the sacaea as a period of licence well the sacaea was such a period of licence each household was then ruled by a slave the zoganes as athenaeus quotes berosus the royal household was not an exception now to rule the royal household in the royal robes and above all to take liberties with the royal harem compare fijian and australian licence is treason one of the two crimes excepted from the saturnalian amnesty in tonquin to overlook treason would be for a persian monarch to set a dangerous precedent therefore the royal zoganes or slaveking of the five days revel unlike the zoganes of private houses would deserve death technically speaking at this point let me adopt mr frazers theory of a substitute a criminal already condemned to death is employed instead of a harmless slave as zoganes of the royal household and is then hanged in dozens of cases of summer gambols in european folklore the whitsuntide representatives of the tree spirit are put to a mock death these are in one or two instances called kings the regular may kings and may queens seem to escape the grass king merely hands his crown to the mayor these mock slayings of folklore actors may i think like handing the crown to the mayor merely mean that the actors reign is over this is not mr frazers opinion the summer monarchs when killed in sport are killed he thinks as their precursors were really slain for the god of vegetation o vegetation what crimes are wrought in thy name in any case the royal zoganes or criminal substitute for the slaveking of the royal household in babylon deserved a hanging to discourage the precedent of treason set by him in the period of licence only in the kings house was the reign of the zoganes high treason now before hanging him it was actually necessary to demonstrate by symbolic action that he was no real king but a common slave or criminal he was reduced to his true level by being stripped of his royal robes and by being whipped a specially servile punishment he was then hanged but to treat a real slave thus merely because as in every other household he played the zoganes or slave as master would be a shame the mans only fault was the accident thrust on him by custom of playing lord in the royal household of a jealous monarch so a criminal already condemned took the part and as the slave would have been he was finally reduced to his level by being stripped of his royal robes and scourged before suffering death technically for treason really for the crime on which he was originally condemned this mere guess at the origin of a unique custom has certain advantages it explains and i fail to see that mr frazer explains why the sacaean mockking unlike the saturn victim was stripped of his royal robes and whipped these sufferings proclaimed the man no king but a slave again his hanging was just what as condemned on a capital charge a lowborn malefactor might expect with the best will in the world no babylonian could follow mr frazer and take a hanged felon for a god or a divine sacrifice why only one man was thus treated though there was a zoganes or slavelord in every house is explained by the fact that there was only one royal house only one household in which the slavelords conduct was treason with paternal fondness i contemplate my own little guess but alas we are not told that the other slavelords at the sacaea actually invaded the ladies of the house so why should the slavelord of the royal household be allowed to do so how is my conjecture to weather this point of danger well we are never told as far as i am aware that a subject in the east enfeoffed himself of private demesne by invading the harem of the man to whose estate he was a pretender but in the case of royal demesne to invade the harem was the first step of a young pretender like absalom for the purpose of making known and strengthening his claim to the throne says movers remembering the tenacity of traditional usage sanctioning deadly sexual crimes in some periods of licence remembering that in them the primitive arunta deliberately break as did the jews at purim and the fijians the most sacred and stringent of their taboos shall we not allow sacaean custom to encroach for the purpose of making the royalty of the kings zoganes indisputable on the kings harem for in that way was oriental royalty proclaimed and asserted sir alfred lyall says we believe that a few unfortunate concubines would have been of no account at all for the due performance of a popular babylonian masquerade which might just as well mimic earthly kingship as symbolise divine mysteries and now we see a simple and conceivable reason why the mockking of the sacaea invaded the kings harem ruled all royally was crowned robed in the kings robes and then to restore his servile status and wipe away his royalty was stripped of the royal robes whipped as a slave was whipped and hanged as a condemned criminal deserved to be my guess unlike mr frazers hypothesis colligates all the facts it explains the stripping which mr frazer does not i think explain it explains the scourging and hanging which mr frazer is obliged to account for as a mitigation of burning it does not require us to believe what is incredible that of old the persian kings were sacrificed annually it accounts for the occurrence of the execution at a season of secular licence just as in ashanti it involves us in no double and to my thinking contradictory theory that the sufferer is both kings proxy and also a representative of tammuz or marduk or humman or gilgamesh or eabani but my guess is only a guess and is offered chiefly to prove that guessing is easy we cannot be certain about any explanation of a custom so remote so unparalleled and reported on evidence so late and so dubious as that of dio chrysostom some student may point out that though i boast of my theory as colligating all the facts i have left out the sacred harlot but she was only the child of an hypothesis of mr frazers a scientific hypothesis is not required to colligate more than the known facts in each case and i am by no means certain that the facts given by our only authority dio were

movers die phoenizier i seq samuel xvi cf xii herodotus iii josephus contra apion i x calvary it is fortunately not needful to dwell long on the disproval of mr frazers theory that his facts seem to shed fresh light on some of the causes which contributed to the remarkably rapid diffusion of christianity in asia minor the new faith had elements in it which appealed powerfully to the asiatic mind we have seen that the conception of the dying and risen god was no new one in these regions a man whom the fond imagination of his worshippers invested with the attributes of a god gave his life for the life of the world a chain of causes which because we cannot follow them might in the loose language of daily life be called an accidents determined that the part of the dying god in this annual play should be thrust on jesus of nazareth his death as the haman of the annual mystery play of the dying god impressed upon what had been hitherto mainly an ethical mission the character of a divine revelation culminating in the passion and death of the incarnate son of a heavenly father in this form the story of the life and death of jesus exerted an influence which it could never have had if the great teacher had died the death of a vulgar malefactor it shed round the cross on calvary a halo of divinity c but all this halo could only be shed if the victim was recognised by the world as dying in the character of a god and as rising again in the person of barabbas the mordecai of the year we know on the best historical evidence that there was no such recognition to the greeks foolishness and to the jews a stumbling block was the cross as st paul assures us moreover we know that ribaldry not reverence marked the multitude at the crucifixion by mr frazers theory barabbas represented the rearisen god the son of the father was barabbas revered no some pretended to salute his mock majesty and others belaboured the donkey on which he rode therefore by mr frazers own explicit statement the divine facts about barabbas were not recognised yet he was the counterpart of the sacred victim mr frazers theory demands i think the general recognition of the godhead of the yearly victim who gave christs mission the influence which it could never have had if the great teacher had died the death of a vulgar malefactor yet mr frazer himself assures us that the idea of the divinity of the victim may have been forgotten that his sacrifice might seem the execution of a criminal i cite the passage the divine character of the animal or man is forgotten and he comes to be regarded merely as an ordinary victim this is especially the case when it is a divine man who is killed for when a nation becomes civilised if it does not drop human sacrifices altogether it at least selects as victims only such wretches as would be put to death at any rate thus as in the sacaean festival at babylon the killing of a god may come to be confounded with the execution of a criminal yet within eighty pages mr frazer attributes the halo of divinity to the happy accident which enabled the victim to die as a recognised representative of a dying god mr frazer puts forth his hypothesis with great diffidence he thinks that he may have perhaps been led by the interest and importance of the subject somewhat deeper than the evidence warrants that is certain we have shown that the evidence in our opinion warrants none of the hypotheses no not one it is not proved that magic is older than religion it is disproved that general belief as distinguished from local legend in any age regards gods as mortal there is no evidence or none is given to show that a man has ever been sacrificed for the benefit of a god whom he incarnates there is no evidence that a real king was ever yearly sacrificed to benefit a god at babylon or in every citystate of early italy or anywhere the idea is incredible the evidence for any sacrifice of mockkings is historically of the weakest conceivable kind the deaths of the sacaean mockkings were infamous executions of criminals they were not sacrifices if they ever occurred at all the date of the festival at which if at all they perished cannot be made to fit in with purim or easter there is no evidence that the jews borrowed the custom of killing a yearly human victim or practised the habit if they did it was a month after purim if they did by mr frazers own statement the killing might be thought that of a vulgar malefactor and could not cast on all or on any one of the victims a halo of divinity finally our own history in the case of the earl of atholl who pretended to the crown at the murder of james i of scotland and in the case of sir william wallace who was accused of saying that he would be crowned in westminster hall proves that pretenders to royalty have been mocked by being indued with symbols of royalty wallace was crowned at his trial with laurel atholl was tortured to death with a redhot iron crown the victim of calvary was accused of aiming at a kingdom and like wallace and atholl was crowned with thorns the preliminary scourging is illustrated by the tyranny of verres in sicily may we not conclude that mr frazers light bridges of hypothesis have broken down the importance and interest of the subject have induced me to examine the hypotheses but it was needless one point has been clear from the beginning even if the sacaean victims were originally supposed to be gods they could not bequeath a halo of divinity to christ unless as late as the reign of tiberius their own godhead was still commonly recognised now it certainly was not recognised when mr frazer published the first edition of his golden bough he doubted that the sacaean victim could as civilisation advanced be identified with a god but before publishing his second edition mr frazer evolved his theory of the origin or partial origin of the belief in the divinity of christ as inherited from the criminal slaves at the sacaea in his second edition therefore the godhead of the sacaean victims is usually regarded as commonly recognised though mr frazer had doubted the possibility of this in his first and preserves the doubt in his second edition it is needless to say more mr frazer in vol iii had already shaken his own theory as given in vol iii i might have contented myself with comparing these two passages but in the interest of the nascent science of religion it seemed desirable to point out what i am constrained to think the errors of method that now prevail in the following essay criticism is applied to an hypothesis with which modern orthodoxy has no concern g b iii g b ii g b iii g b iii the passage in which mr frazer thus appears to demolish his own theory represents his opinion before his theory was evolved it appeared in his first edition but he retains it in his remodelled work g b iii g b iii see the contradictory attempts to get out of this difficulty in iii g b iii g b i xv xvi see also appendix c pp xi the ghastly priest the spirit of system of finding master keys for all the locks of old religion and mythology has confessedly been apt to misguide students macrobius was the father says mr frazer of that large family of mythologists who resolve all or most gods into the sun according to him mercury was the sun mars was the sun janus was the sun saturn was the sun so was jupiter also nemesis likewise pan and so on through a great part of the pantheon it was natural therefore that he should identify osiris with the sun mythology has been of late emancipated from the universal dominion of the sun but only to fall under that of gods of vegetation whether of vegetable life at large or of the corn spirit and the oak spirit in particular what mr frazer says about macrobius macrobius would retort on mr frazer thus according to him mars was a god of vegetation saturn was a god of vegetation of sowing so was zeus also hera and so on through a great part of the pantheon it was natural therefore that he should identify osiris with a god of vegetation and mr frazer does so far be it from me to say that mr frazer is wrong when his gods are gods of vegetation or even that macrobius is wrong when his gods are gods of the sun it appears to me that when a god had obtained a firm hold of public favour the public might accept him as a god of this that and the other aspect or phenomenon of nature still the new school of mythology does work the vegetable element in mythology hard nearly as hard as the solar element used to be worked aphrodite as the female mate of adonis gets mixed up with plant life so does attis with cybele so does balder so does death so does dionysus with undoubted propriety so does eabani so does gilgamesh so does haman so does hera so does iasion with demeter so does isis so does jackinthegreen so does kupalo so do linus and lityerses so does mamurius veturius so does merodach or marduk if he represents eabani or gilgamesh so does mars so does osiris so i think does semiramis so does tammuz so does virbius so does zeus probably so does a great multitude of cattle cats horses bulls goats cocks with plenty of other beasts the solar mythologists did not spare heroes like achilles they too were the sun but the vegetable school the covent garden school of mythologists mixes up real human beings with vegetation jesus christ derives his divinity or some of it as we have seen from a long array of criminals who were hanged partly as kings partly as gods of vegetation i do not feel absolutely assured that judas iscariot at his annual burnings in effigy escapes the universal doom any more than the ugly deformed person who was whipped and killed in old attica but an unexpected man to be a representative of a god of vegetation is the priest of the grove of diana near aricia he is known to all from the familiar verse of macaulay these trees in whose dark shadow the ghastly priest doth reign the priest who slew the slayer and shall himself be slain why mr frazer asks in effect had the priest of the grove of diana near aricia to slay his predecessor subject in turn to death at the hands of a new competitor for the office first let us ask what we know about this ghastly priest let us begin with the evidence of virgil in the sixth book of the aeneid line and so onwards virgil says nothing about the ghastly priest or in this place about diana or the grove near aricia virgil indeed tells us much about a bough of a tree a golden branch but as to the singular priest nothing but some four hundred years after virgils date say ad a commentator on virgil servius tries to illustrate the passage cited from the aeneid he obviously knows nothing about virgils mystic golden bough but he tells us that in his own time public opinion publico opinio placed the habitat of virgils bough in the grove haunted by the ghastly priest near aricia it is in fact not known whether virgil invented his bough with its extraordinary attributes or took it from his rich store of antiquarian learning it may have been a folklore belief like le rameau dor of madame daulnoys fairy tale virgils bough as we shall see has one folklore attribute in common with a mystic sword in the arthurian cycle of romances and in the volsunga saga i think that mr frazer has failed to comment on this point if i might hazard a guess as to virgils branch it is that of old suppliants approached gods or kings with boughs in their hands he who would approach proserpine carried in virgil a bough of pure gold which only the favoured and predestined suppliant could obtain as shall be shown in the four centuries between virgil and servius the meaning and source of virgils branch of gold were forgotten but people and servius himself knew of another bough near aricia and located conjecturally virgils branch of gold in that district servius then in his commentary on the aeneid after the manner of annotators in all ages talks much about the boughs of a certain tree in a certain grove concerning which virgil makes no remark virgil as we shall see was writing about a golden branch of very peculiar character knowing like the public opinion of his age something about quite other branches and nothing about virgils branch servius tells us that in the grove of diana at aricia there grew a tree from which it was unlawful non licebat to break a bough if any fugitive slave however could break a branch from this tree he might fight the priest taking his office if successful in the opinion of servius the temple was founded by orestes to the barbaric diana of the chersonese whence he had fled after a homicide that diana received human sacrifices of all strangers who landed on her coasts the rite of human sacrifice was in italy commuted servius thinks for the duel between the priest and the fugitive slave orestes having himself been a fugitive the process is first a greek wanderer on a barbarous coast is in danger of being offered as all outlanders were offered to the local goddess this rite was a form of xenelasia an antiimmigrant statute compare china the transvaal the agitation against pauper immigrants having escaped being sacrificed and having killed the king in an unfriendly land orestes flies to italy and appeases the cruel diana by erecting her fane at aricia but instead of sacrificing immigrants he or his successors establish a duel between the priest and any other fugitive slave why for the priest of the cruel diana was not accustomed to be sacrificed nor had he been a fugitive slave servius then not observing this goes off into an allegorising interpretation of virgils branch as worthless as all such interpretations always are the story about orestes appears to myself to be a late aetiological myth a story invented to explain the slaying of the slayer which it does not do in short it is an hypothesis the priesthood is open not to men flying the blood feud like orestes but only to runaway slaves the custom introduced by orestes was the sacrifice of outlanders not of priests the story has a doublette in pausanias according to pausanias hippolytus was raised from the dead and in hatred of his father and being a fugitive he went and reigned at the arician grove of the goddess for these reasons apparently statius calls the arician grove profugis regibus aptum a sanctuary of exiled princes orestes and hippolytus from suetonius we learn that the ghastly priest was styled rex nemorensis king of the wood and that the envious caligula thinking the priest had held office long enough set another athlete to kill him the title of king borne by a priest suggests of course the sacrificial king at borne also mr frazer adduces african kings of fire and water credited with miraculous powers over the elements they kill nobody and nobody kills them then we have jackinthegreen maytree the spirit of vegetation the may king and the queen of the may these titles as mannhardt observes imply that the spirit incorporate in vegetation is a ruler whose creative power extends far and wide possibly so now the king of the wood the ghastly priest lived in the grove of diana who among other things has the attributes of a treespirit may not then the king of the wood in the arician grove have been like the king of the may an incarnation of the treespirit or spirit of vegetation given a female treespirit we should rather expect a queen of the wood and we assuredly do not expect a priest of diana to represent the supreme aryan god nay to incarnate him but this mr frazer thinks probable again since the king of the wood could only be assailed by him who had plucked the golden bough his life was safe from assault as long as the bough or the tree on which it grew remained uninjured here we remark the nimbleness of mr frazers method in vol i he had said tradition averred that the fatal branch in the grove near aricia was that golden bough which at the sibyls bidding aeneas plucked before he assayed the perilous journey to the world of the dead but i have tried to show that according to servius this identification of two absolutely distinct boughs neither similar nor similarly situated was the conjecture of public opinion in an age divided from virgils date by four hundred years in the space between vol i and i the averment of tradition as mr frazer calls it the inference of the curious as i suppose to the effect that virgils golden branch and the arician branch were identical has become matter of fact for mr frazer since the king of the wood could only be assailed by him who had plucked the golden bough he says with what follows but who has told us anything about the breaking by a fugitive slave near aricia of a golden bough nobody as far as i am aware has mentioned the circumstance after an interval of four hundred years the golden bough of virgil is only brought by servius into connection with the wood at aricia because servius and the public opinion of his age knew about a branch there and did not know anything about virgils branch of gold that branch is a safe passport to hades it is sacred not to a treespirit named diana but to infernal juno or proserpine it cannot be broken by a fugitive slave or anybody else no nor can it be cut with edge of iron none but he whom the fates call can break it it yields at a touch of the predestined man and another golden branch grows instantly in its place ipse volens facilisque sequetur si te fata vocant primo avulso non deficit alter aureus virgils bough thus answers to the magical sword set in a stone in the arthurian legends in a tree trunk in the volsunga saga as mr h s o everard reminds me all the knights may tug vainly at the sword but you can draw it lightly si te fata vocant if you are the predestined king if you are arthur or sigmund when aeneas bears this bough charon recognises the old familiar passport other living men in the strength of this talisman have already entered the land of the dead ille admirans venerabile donum fatalis virgae longo nunc tempore visum i have collected all these extraordinary attributes of virgils bough in origin a suppliants bough perhaps because as far as i notice mr frazer lays no stress on the many peculiarities which differentiate virgils bough from any casual branch of the tree at aricia and connect it with the mystic sword the general reader who seldom knows latin needs i think to be told precisely what virgils bough was nothing can be more unlike a branch any accessible branch of the arician tree than is virgils golden bough it does not grow at aricia it is golden it is not connected with a treespirit but is dear to proserpine i easily see of course that proserpine may be identified with a tree spirit virgils branch is not to be plucked by fugitive slaves it is not a challenge but a talismanic passport to hades recognised by charon who has not seen a specimen for ever so long it is instantly succeeded if plucked by another branch of gold which the arician twig is not so i really do not understand how mr frazer can identify virgils golden bough with an ordinary branch of a tree at aricia which anybody could break though only runaway slaves strongly built had an interest in so doing still less do i think that virgil meant to identify his branch of gold with mistletoe he does the reverse in a poetic simile he compares his bough to mistletoe a poet does not compare a thing to itself mr frazer cites the welsh for mistletoe pren puraur tree dor pur in places also mistletoe is used for divining rods which may be employed by goldhunters what wood is not thus used like other magical plants mistletoe is gathered at the solstices when fernseed is fabled to flame must not the golden bough like the golden fernseed be an emanation of the suns fire the older solar mythologists would have had not a doubt of it i must admit then that i cannot at present accept the identification of the branch of gold in virgil with any branch you please on a certain tree at aricia nor am i aware of any historical evidence that the grove there was an oak grove or the tree an oak tree or that the branch to be plucked was a mistletoe bough or that any branch for the purpose of the runaway slave was not as good as another that virgils branch of gold was mistletoe that the tree at aricia was an oak that the bough to be plucked by the person ambitious of being a ghastly priest was mistletoe seems if i follow mr frazer accurately to be rather needful to the success of the solution of his problem which he finally propounds he takes on his road the eddaic myth of balder which i do not regard as a very early myth but on that point there is great searching of hearts among scandinavian specialists no one now writes a scandinavian scholar to me puts any of the edda poems earlier than ad and most of them if not all are probably later than that we do not even know whether they were composed by christians or pagans as the icelanders never lost their interest in the old mythology it has never been sufficiently noticed that these poems are not religious in any sense all that their poets cared for was the story that it will ever be possible to say where the stories came from i doubt very much probably they represent the fusion of several quite different veins of legends heathen and christian the saga writers knew practically nothing about the old heathen worship and balder may never have been worshipped at all or if he was it is rather hopeless to conjecture in what capacity such are the opinions of mr w a craigie whose writings on the celtoscandinavian relations of the northern mythological literature are familiar to students we return to mr frazers handling of the balder story balder says the edda dreamed of death a goddess made everything in nature swear not to hurt him except a mistletoe plant which she thought too young to understand the nature of an oath loki learned this plucked the plant and when the gods were hurling things at balder asked the blind hoedur to throw the mistletoe it pierced and slew balder and his funeral was of a kind which may or may not have been used before the period of inhumation in howes or barrows balders dead body was burned on board his ship the hugest of all ships i had an impression that this was a not uncommon viking form of incremation but mr craigie thinks that it had quite gone out before the historic period in the legendary period he remembers but one case in ynglinga saga king haki being mortally wounded had his ship piled with the bodies and weapons of the slain a funeral pyre was erected on board and lit and the body of haki was borne forth to sea in the flaming vessel the thing was famous long after the story may be borrowed from the balder story or the balder story from that of king haki in any case balder was not sacrificed but cremated and the huge ship of course is a late viking idea an idea the reverse of primitive mr frazer however goes on apparently assuming that in the original form of the myth balder was sacrificed to a theory about certain religious or ritual fires which survive in folklore these fires are lit by peasants at various seasons but are best known at midsummer while a pretence of burning a man is made and this at a season when mistletoe is gathered as a magical healing herb not as a weapon of death he seems to think that balder was the spirit of the oak that human victims representing the oak and balder were of old periodically sacrificed and that people deemed that the oak could not be injured by axes before the mistletoe in which they thought lay its life was plucked off unluckily i see no evidence that people ever did entertain this opinion namely that the oak was invulnerable till the mistletoe was plucked mr frazer says the mistletoe was viewed as the seat of the life of the oak and so long as it was uninjured nothing could kill or even wound the oak he shows how this idea might arise the oak so people might think was invulnerable so long as the mistletoe remained intact but did the people think so pliny says a great deal about the druidical gathering of mistletoe which on oaks is very rarely to be met with the druids i presume never observed that oaks in general in fact by an overwhelming majority lived very well without having any seat of life mistletoe at all not noticing this obvious fact they reckoned it would appear that an oak with mistletoe on it con id not be cut till the mistletoe was removed perhaps they never tried pliny does not say that when the druid had climbed the tree and removed the mistletoe he next cut down the tree it does seem desirable to prove that people thought the life of an oak was in the mistletoe which they might gather without hurting the oak before we begin to build another theory on our theory that they did hold this opinion this new theory mr frazer goes forth to erect on the basis of the first theory the theory in brief comes to this that as balder was the spirit of the oak and was sacrificed of which i see no proof so human beings representing balder and the oak were sacrificed to reinvigorate vegetation the mistletoe which slew balder was the soulbox of both balder and of the oak and of the human victims who represented yearly the oak and balder about all this much might be said the killing of divine kings balder and others seems to me as i have already said in the majority of cases to be a mere rude form of superannuation we do not kill a commanderinchief or an old professor we pension them off but it is not so easy to pension off a king i think that most of the cases cited mean superannuation or dissatisfaction with the ruler not a magical ceremony to improve vegetation regicide is or was common says birrel there has beine in this kingdome of scotland are hundereth and five kings of quhilk there was slaine fiftysex often succeeded by their slayers like the ghastly priest i am not convinced that the ghastly priest represented vegetation and endured the duel ordeal as a commutation of yearly sacrifice though there is a kind of parallel in the case of the king of calicut but that modern mummers are put to death in a mock ceremony as mr frazer holds to quicken vegetation is proved by much folklore evidence if we admit which i think far from inevitable that the ghastly priest was once a kind of may king periodically slain and was analogous to balder and represented the life of an oak we are next invited to suppose that the tree at aricia was also an oak that the only branch on it to be plucked by the wouldbe successor was mistletoe and that the mistletoe was the soulbox of the tree and of the ghastly priest who could more easily be killed when his lifebox the mistletoe was damaged there is hardly a link in this chain of reasoning which to me seems strong i do not see that balder in the edda was sacrificed i do not see that the mistletoe was his soulbox i conceive that the use of so feeble a weapon to kill him is analogous to the slaying of an invulnerable hero in north american myth by the weapon of a bulrush an example of the popular liking for weakness that overcomes strength i find no evidence that the mistletoe was ever thought to be the soulbox of the oak none to prove that the tree at aricia was an oak nothing to show that the branch to be plucked was the branch of gold in virgil and nothing to indicate that virgils branch was the mistletoe to reach mr frazers solution that the ghastly priest was an incarnate spirit of vegetation slain after the plucking of mistletoe in order that he might be succeeded by a stronger soul more apt to increase the life of vegetation we have to cross at least six light bridges of hypothesis built to connect isolated facts to me these hypotheses seem more like the apparently solid spots in a peatbog on which whoso alights is let into the morass i feel like mr frazers cautious inquirer who is brought up sharp on the edge of some yawning chasm i ought to propose an hypothesis myself in doing so i shall confine myself the limitation is not unscientific to the known facts of the problem in the grove of diana a goddess of many various attributes was a priest of whom we know nothing but that he was a fugitive slave called king of the grove might be slain and succeeded by any other fugitive slave who broke a bough of the tree which the priests only known duty was to protect these are all the ascertained facts why had the priest to be a runaway slave mr frazer says he had to be a runaway slave in memory of the flight of orestes the traditional founder of the worship but the greek story of orestes and its doublette as to hippolytus are only aetiological myths fanciful reasons why attached to a latin usage neither orestes nor hippolytus was a slave like the ghastly priest the story about orestes a fugitive arises out of the custom of aricia and does not explain that custom mr frazer i presume admits this but thinks that the ghastly priest might perhaps at one time save himself by being a runaway but why a slave if i might guess i would venture to suggest that the grove near aricia may have been an asylum for fugitives as they say that borne originally was there are such sanctuaries in central australia here fortunately mr frazer himself supplies me with the very instances which my conjecture craves he cites mr turners samoa for trees which were sanctuaries for fugitives these useful examples are given not in the golden bough but in an essay on the origin of totemism in upolu one of the samoan islands a certain god vave had his abode in an old tree which served as an asylum for murderers and other offenders who had incurred the penalty of death i gather from mr turners nineteen years in polynesia p that the death penalty was that of the blood feud in his samoa mr turner writes concerning trees which were sanctuaries if that tree was reached by the criminal he was safe and the avenger of blood could pursue no farther but wait investigation and trial it is said that the king of a division of upolu called atua once lived at that spot after he died the house fell into decay but the tree was fixed on as representing the departed king and out of respect for his memory it was made the substitute of a living and royal protector it was called o le asi pulu tangata the asi tree the refuge of men this reminds me of what i once heard from a native of another island he said that at one time they had been ten years without a king and so anxious were they to have some protecting substitute that they fixed upon a large oa tree bischoffia javanica and made it the representative of a king and an asylum for the thief or the homicide when pursued by the injured in hot haste for vengeance there seem to have been three sanctuary trees one inhabited by a god vave one respected in memory of a king and one doing duty as a kind of figurehead or representative of a king if my guess that the tree in the arician grove was once a sanctuary or asylum for fugitives including fugitive slaves is plausible i cannot of course conjecture as to the reason of its protective sanctity it may have been one of the three samoan reasons which none of us could have guessed correctly or any other motive may have taken effect a fugitive slave of course was not awaiting trial and chance of acquittal by custom he would be restored to his masters tender mercies or live on under the tree but an unlimited asylum of fugitive slaves was an inconvenient neighbour to aricia hence it is physically conceivable but i lay no stress on it the asylum was at last limited to one fugitive slave at a time it was not like the forest in the indian fable populated by millions of hermits who cannot have been very solitary anchorites any fugitive slave who took sanctuary had to kill and dispossess the prior occupant there was only sanctuary for one at a time more would have been most inconvenient in any case the one solitary duty of the ghastly priest as far as we know was to act as garde champetre to one certain tree why this one tree we do not and cannot know i am averse to sir alfred lyalls plan of suggesting singular solutions arising out of some possible historical accident in the veiled past when the problem to be solved is a practice of wide diffusion the causes in such cases of wide diffusion cannot be regarded as mere freaks or recurring accidents but this affair of the tree and its inviolate branches is isolated unless we regard the tree as a taboo or sanctuary tree which it might be for many reasons as in samoa perhaps because it was the residence of a treespirit at all events the priests only known duty was to guard the tree then why had his wouldbe successor to break a bough before fighting obviously as a challenge and also as a warning the priest in office was to have a fair show some law was to be given him when he found a branch broken any branch he was in the position of the pirate captain on whom the black spot was passed he was in the situation of the king of the eyeos to whom a present of parrots eggs meant that it was time for him to go if the bough was mistletoe and if the fugitive slave like the druids in pliny had to climb for it then the ghastly priest had him at an avail it was any odds on the priest who could tree his man or cut him down as he descended however our authorities tell us about no bough in particular still less about mistletoe let me add that if the bough was mistletoe the sacred tree would need to be changed every time of which we hear nothing for it is not a case of uno avulso non deficit alter with mistletoe the bough was broken then as a taunt a challenge and a warning you cant keep your old tree make room for a better man that is the spirit of the business the fugitive utilised as a priest of the grove was slain when the better man appeared not that a new soul might keep the vegetation lively but merely because the best man attainable was needed to guard the taboo tree the sacred and priestly character of a runaway fighting slave does not to me seem pronounced we know not that he ever sacrificed ladies who wished to be mothers visited the shrine indeed as this diana was a goddess like lucina presiding over birth i do not deny that the priest might have worked miracles for them like the indian forest sages who do the miracle for childless rajahs but his one known duty guarding the tree was inconsistent with much attention to this branch of his sacred calling he prowled about with sword drawn always on the look out that is all we have not in this theory to invent a single fact or introduce a single belief where we do not know that it existed sanctuaries or asyla did exist we have given examples of sanctuary trees and the tree was a sanctuary for just one runaway slave at a time he could not run to burg as in our old and more merciful law if he wanted the billet of ghastly priest he had to fight for it lads youll need to fight before you drive ta peasties before fighting he had to get through the priests guard and break a branch of the tree which the priest protected the act being a warning as well as a challenge this hypothesis introduces no unknown and unproved facts and colligates all the facts which are known the title of king of the grove may mean no more than the title of cock of the north or it may be a priestly title not even so necessarily implying that the runaway slave embodied the ruling spirit of the vegetable department i have been favoured with objections to my guess first if i am right where is the sanction for the custom at which i conjecture well where is the sanction of the samoan customs they reposed on the residence of a god in a tree on respect for a king who had lived near a tree on a legal fiction the sanctuaries of the arunta ertnatulunga derive their sanction from hoards of churinga sacred objects of which till recently we knew nothing obviously i cannot say which of many conceivable and inconceivable primeval reasons gave a sanction to the treeasylum of aricia once instituted custom did the rest the tree was a sanctuary for one fugitive slave and next for another who could kill him secondly my guess is thought to disregard mr frazers many other analogies from folklore which analogies where else do we find a priestly fugitive slave who held his sacred office by the coir na glaive the eight of sword i am acquainted with no other example as i have shown already the kings who are killed admitting the arician fugitive to be a rex are killed for a considerable variety of reasons and are never shown to be killed that a sturdier vehicle may be provided for a vegetable deity while the kings said to incarnate a deity are never said to be killed for religious reasons if the reverse were the case then the arician fugitive the ghastly priest might take the benefit of the analogies i hope that my bald prosaic theory abjectly philistine as it is has the characteristics of a scientific hypothesis but like my guess as to the real reason for the death of the sacaean victim this attempt to explain the office of the ghastly priest is but a conjecture the affair is so singular that it may have an isolated cause in some forgotten occurrence i remember no other classical instance of a priest whose duty was to be always watching a single sacred tree a thing requiring a vigilance of attention not compatible with much other priestly work a post so unenviable that only a fugitive slave would be likely to care for the duties and perquisites naturally he would not know that he was an incarnation of the supreme aryan god whose life was in the mistletoe or golden bough and as he did not know he would not be proud of the title g b ii g b iii g b iii g b ii g b ii g b i

island g b ii g b iii compare i g b i strabo v spencer and gillen pp xii south african religion the provisional hypothesis by which i try to explain the early stages of religion may be stated in the words of a critic mr hartland apparently it is claimed that the belief in a supreme being came in some way only to be guessed at first in order of evolution and was subsequently obscured and overlaid by belief in ghosts and in a pantheon of lesser divinities i was led to these conclusions first by observing the reports of belief in a relatively supreme being and maker among tribes who do not worship ancestral spirits australians and andamanese and secondly by remarking the otiose unworshipped supreme being often credited with the charge of future rewards and punishments among polytheistic and ancestorworshipping people too numerous for detailed mention the supreme being among these races in some instances a mere shadow of a childrens tale i conjectured to be a vague survival of such a thing as the andamanese puluga or the australian baiame granting the validity of the evidence the hypothesis appears to colligate the facts there is a creative being not a spirit merely a being before ghosts are worshipped where ghosts are worshipped and the spiritual deities of polytheism have been developed and are adored there is still the unworshipped maker in various degrees of repose and neglect that the belief in him came in some way only to be guessed at is true enough but if i am to have an hypothesis like my neighbours i have suggested that early man looking for an origin of things easily adopted the idea of a maker usually an unborn man who was before death and still exists bound this being crystallised affection fear and sense of duty he sanctions morality and early mans remarkable resistance to the cosmic tendency his notion of unselfishness that man should so early conceive a maker and father seems to me very probable to my critics it is a difficulty but one of dr callaways native informants remarks when we asked by what was the sun made they said by umvelinqangi for we used to ask when we were little thinking that the old men knew all things what a savage child naturally asks about his yet more savage ancestors may have pondered no speculation seems more inevitable as soon as man was a reasoning being he must have wondered about origins he has usually two answers creation complete or partial and evolution like topsy he specs things growed when he does not guess that things were made by somebody as far as totemism is religious it accepts the answer of evolution men were evolved out of lower types beasts and plants their totems but these are not always treated with religious reverence as sometimes are such creative beings and fathers as baiame in many cases as i have kept on saying the savage creative being has a deputy often a demiurge who exercises authority where this is the case and where ancestorworship is the working religion the deputy easily comes to be envisaged as the first man unborn of human parents maker of things or of many things and culture hero mr tylor says in the mythology of kamchatka the relation between the creator and the first man is one not of identity but of parentage it is clear that in proportion to the exclusive prevalence of ancestorworship as a working religion the idea of the creator might be worn away and the first man might be identified with him it would not follow that the idea of creation was totally lost the first man might be credited with the feat of creation mr tylor observes that by these consistent manesworshippers the zulus the first man unkulunkulu is identified with the creator mr tylors statement of course involves the opinion that the idea of creation is present to the zulu mind unkulunkulu made things as baiame and puluga and other beings did like them he is no spirit but a magnified nonnatural man unlike them he is subject to the competition of ancestral ghosts the more recent the better in receipt of prayer and sacrifice having no special house which claims him as ancestor and being very remote he is now believed by many zulus to be dead his name is a fable like that of atahocan a thing to amuse or put off children with they are told to call on unkulunkulu when their parents want to send them out of the way all this is exactly what my theory would lead me to anticipate if the zulus had once possessed the idea of an unworshipped creative being and had lost it under the competition of worshipped near akin and serviceable ghosts their ancestral character would be reflected on him it is just as if the australian kurnai were to take to ancestorworship glorify tundun the son and deputy of munganngaur neglect munganngaur look on tundun as the creator and finally neglect him in favour of ancestral spirits less remote and more closely akin to themselves this process is very readily conceivable and from our point of view it would look like degeneration in religion under stress of a new religious motive the do ut des of sacrifice to ancestral ghosts that unkulunkulu should come to be thought dead is the less surprising as a zulu in bad luck will be so blasphemous as to declare that the ancestral spirits of his worship are themselves dead when we sacrifice to them and pray that a certain disease may cease and it does not cease then we begin to quarrel with them and to deny their existence and the man who has sacrificed exclaims there are no amadhlozi although others say there are but for my part i say that the amadhlozi of our house died for ever thus i can easily suppose that the zulus once had an idea of a creative being that they reduced him on the lines described to a first man that they neglected him in favour of serviceable ghosts and that they now think him extinct like the ghosts themselves when they cease to be serviceable mr hartlands theory is the reverse of mine he says in fact so far as can be gathered the very idea of creation was foreign to their minds the earth was in existence first before unkulunkulu as yet existed but heaven and the sun and all things were not in existence before unkulunkulu he made them according to other native witnesses and dr callaway in his first page says that the zulus regard unkulunkulu as the creator the evidence as mr hartland urges with truth is contradictory but its contradictions contradict his statement that the very idea of creation was foreign to their minds many witnesses attest the existence in the zulu mind of the idea of creation it was said at first before the arrival of missionaries if we asked by what were the stones made they were made by umvelinqangi the ancients used to say before the arrival of the missionaries that all things were made by umvelinqangi but they were not acquainted with his name the natives says dr callaway cannot tell you his name except it be umvelinqangi the sun and moon we referred to unkulunkulu together with all the things in this world and yonder heaven we referred to unkulunkulu we said all was made by unkulunkulu at first we saw that they were made by unkulunkulu but we worshipped those whom we had seen with our eyes the ghosts of their fathers so then we began to ask all things of the amadhlozi this convenient zulu umpengula mbanda states my very hypothesis but he seems to have been a christian convert and probably constructed his theory after he heard of the christian god we seek out the amadhlozi that we may not be always thinking about unkulunkulu so spiritualists are more interested in ghosts than in the christian god in process of time we have come to worship the amadhlozi only because we knew not what to say about unkulunkulu just as the spiritualist knows what to say about his aunt who speaks to him through the celebrated mrs piper dr callaway consulted a very old zulu ukoto whose aunt was the mother of king chaka utshaka mr rider haggard dates chaka about with him began seventy years of zulu conquest and revolution in which old ideas might be obliterated ukoto answered dr callaways inquiries thus when we were children it was said the lord is in heaven we heard it said that the creator of the world umdabuko is the lord which is above when i was growing up it used to be said the creator of the world is above so far we must either reject most respectable evidence going back to the earliest years of last century before the zulu period of revolution or dismiss mr hartlands opinion that the very idea of creation is foreign to the zulu mind a very old woman whose childhood was prior to chakas initiation of the revolutionary period of conquest being interrogated by the zulu umpengula said that when we asked of the origin of corn the old people said it came from the creator who created all things but we do not know him the old people said the creator of all things is in heaven the old woman then abounded in contradictions she said that unkulunkulu was the creator in heaven but only the day before she had denied this dr callaway thought not that her mind was wandering but that there appears in this account to be rather the intermixture of several faiths which might have met and contended or amalgamated at the time to which she alludes the early days of chaka primitive faith in a heavenly lord or creator the ancestorworshipping faith which confounds the creator with the first man the christian faith again directing the attention of the natives to a god who is not anthropomorphic she might also in a part of her tale allude to the fabled ascension of the father of king chaka prior to from my point of view dr callaways theory seems possible the memories and ideas of people who were ancient when chaka and this old woman were young before the zulus entered on a wolf age a war age went far back into the zulu past when their belief may have been nearer to that kind of savage deism which waitz regards as unborrowed and indigenous to africa another very old man ubebe who had fought against chaka said as to the source of being umdabuko i know only that which is in heaven the ancient men said umdakuko is above for the lord gives them life umdabuko source of life may be local or personal the place in which man was created or the person who created him here the umdabuko is called the lord which gives them life here too the evidence is of zulu antiquity the words of the ancients of chakas time the use of the same name for a person and a place is familiar to us in zeus and hades and we use heaven ourselves for god as in the will of heaven the old man uses umdabuko as a personal name elsewhere it is equivalent to uthlanga the impersonal metaphysical source of being not identical with umhlanga a bed of reeds from which mankind arose in zulu myth umhlanga is the place where they broke off or out came from uhlanga old ubebe said to umpengula do you not understand that we said unkulunkulu made all things that we see or touch and unkulunkulu he added was a man and now a dead man then he considered and added it is evident that all things were not made by a man who is dead they were made by one who now is he began with the creator vouched for by the other old people he relapsed into the confusion of him with the first man and either reverted to the original idea or to a natural reflection of his own dr callaway found ubebe declaring that tradition averred the maker to have been a man but that the missionaries averred the creator to be the heavenly lord the old men said that unkulunkulu was an ancestor and nothing more an ancient man who begat men and gave origin to all things in fact the primal being of lower savages andamanese and australians is a man without human limitations and creative my hypothesis like dr callaways is that ubebe and the rest wandered between three faiths a faith analogous to that of the andamanese and australians that faith modified by ancestorworship carried to a great pitch the creator being identified with the first man and the doctrine of the missionaries it is no wonder that these ancients are confused but perhaps my hypothesis which is dr callaways so far helps to explain their contradictions they talk of providence but i reckon there is one above he said the british agriculturist quite as confused as ubebe dr callaway interrogated another very old man ulangeni he denied that utikxo his name for god was a hottentot word introduced by missionaries misled by what dr callaway thinks their erroneous idea that the hottentot utikxo represented a lofty and refined theistic belief ulangeni utterly rejected with extreme contempt the idea that his tribe borrowed utikxo from a people broken and contaminated by the dutch we have learnt nothing of them in ulangenis opinion utikxo created unkulunkulu but being invisible was disregarded in favour of his visible deputy as munganngaur might come to be disregarded in favour of tundun and so they said unkulunkulu was god i am grateful to ulangeni for again anticipating my humble theory he gave a humorous account of the arrival of the first missionary unyegana gardiner of his jabbering of his promise to give news of utikxo and of the controversies of zulu theologians a native convert won the day and composed a hymn all this is recorded by umpengula with all respect for ulangeni he appears to have been in the wrong about utikxo kolb gives gounja ticquoa utikxo as the hottentot word for a supreme deity but if dr callaway is right kolb was in error nothing is more easy than to inquire of heathen savages the nature of their creed and during the conversation to impart to them great truths and ideas which they never heard before and presently to have these come back to one as articles of their own original faith but kolbs hottentots as dr callaway notes say that ticquoa is a good man they did not get that from kolb or any missionary as i have said it is the regular preanimistic savage theory as in australia and the andaman isles later investigations down to hahn tell us of tsui goab wounded knee a hottentot being who is only an idealised medicineman shaw says that the older kaffirs used to speak of umdali the creator but moffat found no trace of anything higher than morimo another mythical first ancestor who came out of the earth livingstone asserts just the reverse there is no necessity for beginning to tell even the most degraded of these people of the existence of god or of a future state the facts being universally admitted as to the bechuana morimo mr hartland gives the etymology of his name it is said to be derived from gorimo above with the singular prefix mo it would thus mean him who is above but why then did morimo come out of a hole in the earth was he once he who is above and was he confused with the first man the plural barimo seems to mean the spirits of the dead molsino teste cassilis is used for an ancestral ghost mr hartland is inclined to regard morimo not as a once supreme deity fading away but as a god in process of becoming i feel that i have no grounds whereon to base even a conjecture a curious piece of evidence by dr callaway is given in a note not in his book one zulu account is that unkulunkulu was created by utikxo now unkulunkulu was visible utikxo was invisible and so was more prominent and popular thus regarded unkulunkulu is the demiurge and deputy of utikxo as sometimes are daramulun tundun hobamok okee bobowissi the deputies of baiame munganngaur kiehtan ahone nyankupon and so on the idea is usual in savage theologies now dr callaway cites the evidence of another zulu i we had this word before the missionaries came we had god utikxo long ago for a man when dying would utter his last words saying i am going home i am going up on high for there is a word in a song which says guide me o hawk that i may go heavenward to seek the onehearted man away from doublehearted men who deal in blessing and cursing we see then that those people used to speak of a matter of the present time which we clearly understand by the word which the missionaries teach us so we say there is no god no new god who has just come to us dr callaway explains that god of whom the missionaries speak is not a new god but the same god of whom we spoke by the terms ukqamata and utikxo dr callaway could not produce this testimony or translate it owing to the archaisms and allusions demanding familiarity with ancient zulu songs till he got the aid of a kxosa kaffir i am apt to regard the archaic character of the piece as fairly good proof of genuine antiquity if the testimony is accepted it settles the question in my sense the zulu religion in its higher elements was a waning religion utikxo was with his one foot in the grave like john knox he was not as by mr hartlands theory a god in the making old hymns are our best authorities and the hymn proves a belief in a future far nobler than the transfiguration of zulu souls into serpents a deity is also attested by the witness but from the use of the word utikxo by this witness he may be speaking of ideas borrowed by hottentots from the dutch and by kaffirs from hottentots another odd example occurs elsewhere mr frazer quotes the king of sofala or of quiteva or the quiteva this king ranks with the deity in fact the caffres acknowledge no other gods than their monarch says dos santos but mr frazer omits the circumstance that the same author adds they acknowledge a god who both in this world and the world to come they fancy measures retribution for the good and evil done in this though convinced of the existence of a deity they neither adore nor pray to him here we have a belief in a future life and a god molunga analogous to that revealed in the archaic zulu hymn but dos santos only recognised as god a god who receives prayer and adoration hence he says that the kaffirs have no gods and also that they acknowledge a god unworshipped the name of that god molunga is the same i presume as mulungu who now in the world beyond the grave is represented as assigning to spirits their proper places to myself then zulu religion now almost exclusively ancestorworship does seem to contain a broken and almost obliterated element of belief in a high unworshipped god presiding over a future life obviously archaic hymns are better evidence with their native interpretation than the contradictory statements of individual zulus who speak dubiously of what the fathers used to say the analogy between the utikxo and mulungu belief also counts as corroboration while the unworshipped supreme being with a deputy or deputies utikxo unkulunkulu is a pervading feature of savage religion if philology could throw any certain light on the meanings of names like mulungu and so forth more sure ground might be reached again when the name of a relatively supreme being may be regarded as a plural like elohim the inference may be that many ancestral spirits are being blended or have been blended into one being the case of the mura mura of the australian dieri has met us already in the essay on magic and religion is it a case of they or he mulungu god a native told mr clement scott you cant put the plural as god is one spirits are spirits of people who have died mzima not gods on the other hand mr macdonald learned that people who have died become mulungu yet he is also regarded as a separate and supreme being who assigns their places to the spirits of the dead his very name is variously interpreted as sky or ancestor we may argue that mulungu is primal and that the spirits of the dead mzima are only the people of mulungu who was in the myth prior to death or we may argue that many mzima have been combined in a later conception of mulungu as a single being such beings do occur it is certain where spirits of the dead are held of no account in religion i fear that in the condition of the evidence students will take sides in accordance with their bias at least both parties will think that their opponents do so i have observed that many writers appear only to be aware of the existence of the religious bias which denotes lack of humour as to utikxo mr beiderbecke like dr callaway thinks that kaffirs living near hottentots borrowed their name for god tixo utikxo and dropped unkulunkulu among the ovaherero in a region which had not yet been under the influence of civilisation and christianity mr beiderbecke found that a god called karunga was believed in look at our oxen and sheep is it not karunga who has made us so rich as jehovah made the israelites mukuru was used by believers in kuringa as the name for the missionaries god mukuru is in otyiherero the name for god the derivation is unknown but omurunga the sacred fanpalm tree must be derived from omuru not omuru from omurunga the otyiherero word for spirit differs from both it is otyimbosi as a god karunga seems to have no sacrifices these are made to ancestral spirits karunga does not appear to be offended by sin but this seems merely to be inferred from his receiving no atonement as the spirits do when people are dying they say karunga has bid them come traces of him as a creator are very dubious but rain thunder and so on come from him as proverbial sayings prove and he is prayed to in time of danger the prayers may be postchristian the omuambo creation tale or one of the tales makes kalunga like morimo come out of the earth and create men and women he is no ghost they also had ghosts the witness said i but kalunga was quite a distinct and unique being my bias in favour of my own theory is unconcealed but i conceive that south african belief in a god a unique being indicates itself in mr beiderbeckes evidence there are different words for this being and for ghosts and spirits though in other cases philology finds cognate african words for both dr callaway concludes it appears that in the native mind there is scarcely any idea of deity if any at all wrapped up in their sayings about a heavenly chief when it is applied to god it is simply the result of teaching among themselves he is not regarded as the creator nor as the preserver of men but as a power it may be nothing more than an earthly chief still celebrated by name a relic of the king worship of the egyptians another form of ancestorworship only he is not worshipped dr callaway a most impartial inquirer has given several cases of very old zulus who in childhood heard from their elders about a creator a creative lord but this excellent collector had just a trifle of most justifiable bias he was arguing to prove that unkulunkulu uthlanga utikxo and the rest were not safe equivalents to be used by missionaries for god and they were not safe equivalents umpengula argued that point to perfection unkulunkulu he said was a name to deceive children with you must not come to us with a new great god and call him by the name of a being whom every adult zulu despises but that the name was despised say in by convinced manesworshippers by no means proves the nonexistence of a higher belief in the past mr ridley deemed baiame a fit name for the christian god probably it was imprudent to employ it in teaching natives urged by his justifiable objection to the use of native names to indicate the christian god dr callaway in the conclusion just quoted forgot or had abandoned his opinion that the evidence of old zulus represented a blending of beliefs beginning with a primitive faith in a heavenly lord or creator i entirely go with his conclusion that the natives at large of his generation did not regard the heavenly chief as the creator or preserver of men and that they had scarcely any notion of deity at all but on the evidence collected from very old people by dr callaway i feel disposed to think it probable enough that under stress of military life conquest and ancestorworship the zulus may have forgotten and almost obliterated the higher belief which the old men had heard of in their infancy if so the zulus fall into the general line of my argument their faint traditions as in the case of atahocan have dwindled to childrens tales they are not the theoplasm of a god who was in course of becoming but of course it may be argued that these faint rudiments came in with utikxo through the hottentots who picked them up in conversation with the dutch this process however does not apply to the belief in superior beings carefully concealed from the native women the children and the europeans by the australians nor does it apply to the american kiehtan ahone andouagni atahocan and many others such are the hesitating conclusions which i venture to draw from what we are told about religion among the peoples of south africa in favour of my theory is the fact that the oldest evidence that of persons born before the genius of chaka revolutionised zulu life agrees with what i expect to find a creative tradition the success of either of the competing theories that which sees elements of a high religion among low savages and that which denies the existence of these elements does not appear to me to affect our ideas about the truth of religion each theory regards religion as a thing evolved by mankind in accordance with their essential nature the only question is as to the sequence of stages of evolution suppose that the beginning of religion was as in my hypothesis regard for a maker and father who was credited with sanctioning morality and in some cases with rewarding or punishing the good or bad in a future life these ideas occur in modern religion but the circumstance that they also occurred in primitive religion would not prove modern religion to be true it would only prove that the men who evolved primitive religion were really human very like their descendants why not they did not produce the higher ideas pure or at least as we find them they are always contaminated soften overlaid by myths of every degree of absurdity and viciousness but it is to be observed that the faith of primitive man as far as it is represented by the evidence which i offer as to very backward man had not some of the worst elements of the creeds of more advanced races sacrifices there were none but when agriculture arose it brought with it hecatombs of human sacrifices especially if we agree with mr frazers theory stated in the golden bough so far it cannot be doubted that as man advanced in social progress he became more deeply stained with religious cruelty in similar fashion the religion of peace and goodwill came to be accompanied thanks to the nature of mankind by religious cruelties as barbarous as those of the aztecs tantae molis erat so hard has it

exercises even in these days of education there are still many persons who have heard of the man in the iron mask and would like to know who he was nobody of course reads the letters of junius but many would be glad to be certain as to who wrote them my riddle is infinitely more remote but it has this merit that i think i can unriddle it if ever you roamed on that moor of the cheviot hills which is near chatton park i think on lord tankervilles ground you may have noticed engraved on the boulders central cuplike depressions surrounded by incised concentric circles who hollowed out these devices why and in what age i remember putting these questions when i first saw the scalps of whinstone just swelling out of the turf among the heather on a beautiful day of september it was a lonely spot where victual never grew about us were the blue heights of the cheviots below us the fabulosus amnis of till that drowns three men to one drowned by tweed my friend told me that some said the stones were places of druid human sacrifice and others men of common sense held that the herdboys carved the circles out of sheer idleness but these answers will not pass there were no herdboys nor druids in central australia nor on the rio negro in brazil among the waimara indians nor in fiji nor in georgia of old nor in zululand where these decorative markings occur with others of primeval character in our own country they are found not only on scalps of rock but on the stones of druid circles from invernessshire to lancashire cumberland and the isle of man they also occur on great stones arranged in avenues on cromlechs one huge horizontal stone supported on others which are erect on the stones of chambered tumuli artificial mounds in yorkshire on stone kist or coffins in scotland ireland and in dorset on prehistoric obelisks or solitary standing stones in argyll on walls in underground picts houses in the orkneys and forfarshire in prehistoric scottish forts near old camps as well as on isolated rocks scalps and stones analogous double spirals occur at new grange in ireland at the entrance of the great gallery leading to the domed chamber in scandinavia in asia minor in china and zululand in australia india america north and south and in fiji now who made these marks when and why sir james simpson says they are archaeological enigmas which we have no present power of solving he cites some guesses the markings are archaic maps or plans of old circular camps and cities they are sundials but they occur in dark chambers of sepulchres or underground houses they stand for sun or moon or for lingam worship they are roman or they are phoenician a theory on which much learning has been wasted to all these guesses sir james simpson opposed the solution that the markings are merely decorative from the very earliest historic periods in the architecture of egypt assyria greece c down to our own day circles single or double and spirals have formed under various modifications perhaps the most common types of lapidary decoration it appears in polynesian tattooing this love of spirals and volutes but added sir james that they were emblems or symbols connected in some way with the religious thoughts and doctrines of those that carved them appears to me to be rendered probable at least by the position and circumstances in which we occasionally find them placed as on the lids of stone coffins and mortuary urns their date must be very remote they preceded writing and tradition they are found in company with polished neolithic stone weapons as in brittany without any remains of the metals save in one case of gold the markings are certainly in australia earlier than the use of metals sir james found by experiment that the markings could be made even on aberdeen granite with a flint celt and a wooden mallet he reckoned them earlier than the arrival of the celtic race and asked for evidence of their existence in africa america or polynesia he did not know the fijian example in williamss work on the fijians nor the american and australian examples sir james did not live to hear much about these mysterious marks in remote and savage lands but in professor daniel wilson discovered or rather reported his discovery of cups and rings on a granite boulder in georgia the designs are quite of the familiar orthodox sort and rocks covered with deep cupmarks occur in ohio now there are romantic antiquaries all for druids and phoenicians and there are sardonic antiquaries who like to rub the gilt off the gingerbread dr wilson was of the latter class and explained the cups as holes made by early men in grinding stone pestles the concentric rings may have been drawn round the cups for amusement this is clamping but early man did not use stone kists and the inner walls of sepulchres as grindstones yet on these the marks occur nor would he climb an almost inaccessible rock to find his grindstone yet the summit of such a rock has the decorations in the parish of tannadyce forfarshire we may therefore discard dr wilsons theory as a general solution of the problem sir james simpson left it with the answer that the marks are decorative plus religious symbolism his guess as i think i can prove or at least cause to seem probable was correct the cups and circles with other marks were originally decorative with a symbolical and religious meaning in certain cases how i have reached this conclusion i go on to show when you want to understand an old meaningless custom or belief found in the middle of civilisation you try to discover the belief or custom in some region where it possesses intelligible life then you may reckon that where you now find it without meaning it once meant what it now does where it is full of vitality or meant something analogous the place where the concentric circles and other markings have a living and potent signification i discovered by pure accident i had been reading the proofs of messrs spencer and gillens valuable book on the native tribes of central australia macmillan there i had noted plenty of facts about the native churinga or sacred things flat oval pieces of wood or stone covered with concentric circles cups and other decorations which are read or deciphered as records of the myths and legendary history of the native race these churinga are of various sizes down to a foot or less in length i did not think of them in connection with our cups circles and so forth on our boulders and standing stones but a friend chanced to come into my study who began to tell me about the singular old site dumbuck discovered by mr w a donnelly july under hightide mark in the clyde estuary near dumbarton the odd thing said my friend is that they have found small portable stones amulets marked in the same way as the cup and ring marked rocks and he began to sketch a diagram why thats a churinga said i a central australian churinga enlightened by messrs spencer and gillen my friend after being informed as to churinga told me that other examples had been dug up also by mr donnelly in an ancient fort near the other site at a place called dunbuie here then i had things very like churinga and of the same markings as our boulders kists and so on in two scottish sites where i understand neither pottery nor metal has yet been detected next i found that the marks which the australians engrave on their small churinga they also paint on boulders rockwalls and other fixtures in the landscape on sacred ground tabooed to women the startling analogy between australian and old scottish markings saute aux yeux on the cover of sir james simpsons book stamped in gold is a central set of six concentric circles surrounding a cup from the inmost circle a groove goes to the circumference of the outer circle the circles often occur without this radial groove and there the line gives a wriggle suggesting that the circle was evolved out of a spiral above and below this figure are a similar one with three and another with four concentric circles at each side are twocircled and onecircled specimens with the wriggled line and two cups and circles with no wriggle now compare fig p of messrs spencer and gillen here we have the churinga ilkinia or sacred rockdrawing in red and white of the honey ant totem in the warramunga tribe here are first seven concentric circles through the centre of which goes a straight line of the same breadth only found among the warramunga while to each extremity are added two concentric circles of small dimensions ending in a cross around as on sir jamess cover are smaller sets of less numerous concentric circles exactly like sir jamess except for the radial groove which ends in a wriggle again fig p we have two sets of concentric circles with white dots answering to cups and where the third set of circles should be is a volute as at new grange in ireland and in many other examples in our islands now in central australia the decorative motives or analogous motives of the permanent rockpaintings are repeated on the small portable churinga which are deciphered by the blacks in a religious or rather in a mythical sense it is therefore arguable that the small portable scottish cup and circle marked stones only recently discovered bore the same relation to the engravings on permanent stones scalps and boulders as do the australian churinga to the australian sacred rockpaintings they may have been portable sacred things i have been unable to visit dumbuck now in course of excavation and have only seen some casts and penandink sketches sent to me by mr donnelly but i have examined the similar objects from dunbuie in the museum at edinburgh the antiquaries looked dubiously on them because they had seen no such matters before they might have done so in ireland because a shell with a very modern scratched face was among the finds and because a few of the markings on one or two stones look recent and fresh but i argue that a dumbarton humourist wishing to hoax us monkbarnses would hardly salt an old site with objects unknown to scottish antiquaries yet afterwards discovered in central australia how could the idea occur to him a forger would forge things known such as flint weapons he would not forge novelties which later are found to tally with savage sacred things in actual use many of the dunbuie finds are engraved in mr millars paper on dunbuie but he has not engraved the most unmistakable churinga a small oval slab of stone with an ornament of little cups following its outline much as in an irish instance and provided like stone churinga in australia with a hole for suspension he does engrave certain hitherto unheardof articlesspearheads of slate two supplied with suspension holes one p has a pattern of the simplest like a childs drawing of a larch which recurs in australia that these slate spearheads pierced for suspension were used in war i doubt though some australians do use spearheads of a flinty slate and where flint is so scarce as in scotland hard slate may be used for example in north america i rather regard the slate weapons as amulets or churinga analogous to the very old and rare boomerangshaped churinga of the arunta lizard totem of central australia mr millar observes they have all been saturated with oil or fat as water does not adhere to them but runs off as from a greasy surface now the australian churinga are very frequently rubbed with red ochre and made greasy with hand grease a singular coincidence footmarks are among the sacred australian rockpaintings with a legendary sense they also occur engraved on rock in brittany ireland on the fairy stone ilkinia in glenesk and on the witches stone at monzie associated with cups and concentric circles these close analogies point all in one direction meaningless in europe what meaning have these designs in australia though certainty is impossible i take it that they were first purely decorative before the mythical and symbolical meaning was read into them by the savages they occur on the mystic bullroarers of central queensland but i do not learn that in queensland the circles and so on are interpreted or deciphered as among the arunta still they occur here in a religious connection the bullroarer being swung at the mysteries and they are carved on trees at mysteries held far south in new south wales but even in central australia the markings sometimes occur as purely decorative on one rock or other object while on others they are sacred and are interpreted as records of legends according to spencer and gillen there are ordinary rockpaintings and certain other drawings in many cases not distinguishable from some of the first series so far as their form is concerned but belonging to a class all of which are spoken of as churinga ilkinia and are regarded as sacred because they are associated with totems each local totemic group has certain of these specially belonging to the group and in very many cases preserved on rocksurfaces in spots which are strictly tabu to the women children and uninitiated men one of the commonest i represents a snake coming out of a hole in a rock which the wriggle out of the cup in our circlemarked stones would stand for fairly well some designs are only playwork others exactly similar on another spot have a definite meaning the meaning is read where the spot is sacred ground the concentric circles are believed on good ground to have been derived from an original spiral it is much more easy to imagine a series of concentric circles originating out of a spiral than to imagine a spiral originating out of a series of concentric circles in this country the spiral seems to be later than the circle these devices not only occur on fixed rocks and portable churinga they are also painted on the bodies of boys when initiated in the mysteries concentric circles with radiating lines preponderate in mr haddons decorative art of british new guinea he describes designs of concentric circles and spirals which are clearly derivatives of drawings of the human face thus our concentric circles and spirals may in the last resort have been derived from drawings of the human face though diablement changes en route what then however we interpret the origin decorative or symbolic of the sacred designs is their significance as understood by the arunta of central australia at the present time the arunta are totemistic that is they believe in close relations which bind up the groups of their society with certain plants and animals but they differ vastly from other totemistic races all over the world and even in australia so much do they differ that it may be doubted whether their totems can properly be called totems at all elsewhere a man of a given totem say the emu cannot marry a woman of that stock it is incest the children inherit their totem either from the mother or less frequently the father any local group in a given region contains persons of various totems people may not kill eat or make any use of the plants and animals which in each case are their totems among the arunta all is otherwise a childs totem may be that of his father of his mother or different from that of either parent a man may marry a woman of his own totem which elsewhere is incest and capitally punished thus father is a grub mother is a grub one child may be a grub another an emu moreover here totems are local almost every one in a given place will be for example a lizard or a plum tree usually people do eat their own totems though sparingly at magical rites intended to multiply the animal or plant with which it is associated in the interests of the general food supply the grubs work a rite to cause plenty of grubs and they give the other groups a lead by eating sparingly of the first fruits of the grubs this bears in my opinion no strong analogy to the socalled totemsacrament to work the magic the men of the grub or other totem must eat a little of it this probably confirms their relation to the grub but involves no religious element they do not adore the grub if any one likes to call this a totemsacrament he is rather easily satisfied nor does it agree with the notion that a mans totem is the receptacle of his life or soul if so why should he encourage his neighbour to kill and eat it nay he even helps them to destroy it whether arunta totemism is the most archaic kind from which all other totemism has varied or whether it is a private sport from the main stock does not concern us here and is matter of conjecture the arunta and other central australian tribes look back to a mythic past when ancestors closely connected with this or that plant or animal perhaps transformations of such animal or plant roamed the country in groups each of the same totem name each feeding freely on its own totem this was the alcheringa time and existing rites are explained by aetiological mythsstating how such or such a mummery still practised was originally practised in the alcheringa nothing of the sort of course need have been the case and such myths cannot tell us what the manners and customs of that dim age really were demeter was a woman of the greek alcheringa and the eleusinian rites were explained by the greeks as originating in her alcheringa adventures but these obviously were invented purely to account for the rites themselves not vice versa now among the arunta the blacks of today are regarded as reincarnations of the alcheringa fabulous ancestors each of these carried about both men and women churinga the portable decorated stones when an alcheringite died a rock or tree rose to mark the place but his or her spirit remained in the churinga plenty of churinga were dropped at different sites and round these now hover the spirits associated with them in one place is a crowd of wild cat ghosts at another a mob of frog or lizard or emu ghosts these want to be reincarnated consequently a woman who desires to have a baby goes to one of them in argyll she would slide down a cupmarked rock a woman who does not want to have a baby keeps away a childs totem is derived not from father or mother but from the totem of the ghosts at the place where the woman thinks she conceived it when the baby is born her relations hunt the spot and find for it the churinga left by the spirit which is reincarnated in it thus first there is the fabulous alcheringite himself a transformation of an emu lizard water fire or what not then there is his spirit haunting after his death a spot where churinga of his totem were deposited that spirit enters into and is born again from a passing woman and the spirits churinga is found and is henceforth the childs churinga an oval plate of stone with cup and ring or other decorations all these churinga are kept at sacred central stores caves or crevices each member of the tribe is represented by her or his churinga nanja in these repositories women may not go near these sacred stores nor may they see a churinga if they do their eyes are burned out with a fire stick a mans churinga is not to him like the egg in which was the life of the giant in the fairy tale if it comes to grief he does not die but expects bad luck as we do if we break a mirror not till he has been through the mysteries and the most cruel mutilations and just before he has been painted with the pattern on the sacred rock of his totem can a man see the storehouses of the churinga now in the witchetty grub totem this sacred painting tallies with the lines incised under concentric circles on the covering of a stone kist at tillicoutry there are circles above the lines in the australian example or rather circular dabs of paint called the decorated eyes painted on the rocks the corresponding patterns are incised on the portable churinga in scotland the patterns are incised both on fixed rocks and portable stones the latter at dumbuck and dunbuie i observe many patterns common to both regions there are the concentric circles the spiral the marks like horseshoes the tree pattern the witchetty grub pattern the volute the long sinuous snakelike pattern and a number of these recur in brazil on the banks of the rio negro now though we have those patterns on rocks in ohio brazil australia in this country in france in asia minor i only know the patterns on portable small stones in australia at dunbuie on the dumbuck site and i think in a cairn near lough crew in county meath the curious for this last case may consult proceedings of scottish society of antiquaries p where in figs and he will see what in australia would be called two stone churinga with any number of scotoaustralian patterns on large stones on one the pattern is like that of a stone from dunbuie in australia members of each totem decipher the marks purely conventional as representative of the totem and of adventures in the alcheringa time for example a mark like two croquet hoops or horseshoes is an old woman gathering frogs the concentric circles are frogs the dots round them are tracks of women dull often dirty stories are told about the adventures of the alcheringites commemorated by the patterns at the sacred patternpainted rocks magic ceremonies extremely puerile are performed to ensure a supply of the edible totem which the pattern represents some event occurred there in the alcheringa the rite repeats what in myth was then done and the stomachs of the men are rubbed with the churinga for luck such are the uses of the churinga did they once exist wherever the similarly decorated fixed rocks exist did the makers of the decorations in scotland decipher the churinga as the central australians do now were the dwellers by clyde much more advanced in culture than the australians totemists looking on their small decorated stones as associated with the spirits of alcheringa ancestors do women in argyll slide down a cupmarked rock in hope of offspring because totemistic ghosts once hovered round it eager to be reincarnated the fact of the sliding is attested by a chief of clan diarmid nobody can answer i have shown these decorated rocks and small stones to have a living significance a vital legendary symbolism in central australia i cannot prove that they had the same significance in county meath or dumbartonshire the australians may have begun with mere decoration and later added a symbolism suited to their amazing theory of life in our country the decorations may have quite a different symbolical sense but probably they had some sense otherwise why engrave them not only on rocks but on small stones pierced for suspension perhaps men believed in an alcheringa time on the clyde perhaps they multiplied salmon and deer by magical mummeries at the engraved rocks perhaps these were sacred places tabooed to women or quite a different set of fables and customs may have crystallised in scotland round marked rocks and inscribed small stones i cannot prove that as in australia clydesdale boys of old when initiated in the mysteries were painted with the pattern on their sacred totem rock and stone or wood churinga but if not these rites other rites were i conceive connected with the decorative patterns found in so many still savage countries one piece of evidence rather points in this direction the australian stone churinga are shaped like the wooden churinga and these are shaped like the tundun or bullroarer now the bullroarer which occurs in australia where stone churinga do not is a sacred oval piece of wood not to be seen by women which is whirled at the mysteries and makes a windy roaring noise the same object is used for the same purpose at the mysteries in america africa and of old in greece the roaring noise is taken to be the voice of tundun son of munganngaur our father in the heavens among the kurnai and of gods or culture heroes of other names in other tribes now in celtic scotland as also in england this instrument the tundun occurs as a mere toy in gaelic named strannam does it descend from a sacred object of savage mysteries and are the australian stone churinga in shape like the tundun and like the tundun tabooed to women mere lapidary modifications of the wooden tundun however this may be the strannam looks like a link in the long chain which binds us to the prehistoric past while correcting the proofsheets of this article i read in the glasgow herald january an article on dumbuck and dunbuie by dr munro the eminent authority on crannogs or piledwellings and generally on prehistoric scotland dr munro as i understand him does not regard dumbuck as an older than mediaeval site nor as a true crannog the incised stones he looks on either as of most singular character if genuine or as forgeries of today the opinion which he seems to prefer he was then unacquainted with similar objects in any part of the world i have here provided references to similar objects from central australia and i suggest examination of the apparently similar irish objects figured in proceedings of scottish society of antiquaries p figs and not having seen these stones i can only offer the hint suggested by the illustrations in proceedings why a forger should forge such unknown objects and place them at dunbuie in before the central australian stones had been described i cannot guess nor can i enough deplore the stupidity of the same hypothetical forger in not salting dunbuie and dumbuck with neolithic implements whether antique or made by some flint jack of today both his sins of omission and of commission donnent furieusement a penser dr munro however as i gather from his article on dumbuck in the reliquary april still declines to recognise the dumbuck decorated portable stones as of genuine antiquity for india see archaiclogical notes on ancient sculpturings on rocks in kumaon

discovered many other instances see also the golden bough iii et seq xiv firstfruits and taboos taboo is one of the few savage words which have struck root in england introduced from new zealand tapu and other polynesian islands it is used in english to denote a prohibition this that or the other thing or person or book is tabooed many of the ten commandments are in this sense taboos but in anthropological language taboo generally denotes something more than a prohibition it commonly means a prohibition for which to the civilised mind there is no very obvious meaning in this way the prohibitive commandments are not precisely taboos it is pretty obvious why we ought not to steal or kill though the raison detre of the seventh commandment is obscure to some advanced intelligences but the reasons why a sinclair must not cross the ord on a certain lawful day or why on another lawful day the fishermen of st andrews might not go afishing resemble many savage taboos in the lack of a manifest reason why secondly the infraction of the savage taboo generally unlike that of the decalogue carries its own punishment forbidden food is poison tabooed land is dangerous to tread upon to handle tabooed property may mean death nobody knows what awful cosmic catastrophe might occur if a tabooed woman saw the sun many words and names are taboo and no luck will come of using them for instance you must not name salmon pigs or the minister when out fishing in some parts of scotland in many cases the reason of this or that taboo is easily discovered a day is unlucky because all the fishers as at st andrews were lost on that day in a past century through a storm or the sinclairs on another day were cut off in an expedition most of us have our lucky or unlucky days clothes and other vanities again things are taboo for some reason in that kind of faith which holds that things connected in the association of ideas are mystically connected in fact you must not mention salmon lest they hear you and escape or tin in malay tin mining lest the tin should literally make itself scarce you may not name the fairies a jealous folk therefore you say the people of peace and so on but many other taboos have good practical reasons if women among ourselves were tabooed from salmonfishing eating oysters or entering smokingrooms all of which things are greatly to be desired the reason would be the convenience of the men who wish a sanctuary or asylum in the smokingroom and want to keep oysters and fishing to themselves it is pretty plain why the sight of the royal treasury is tabooed to a west african king to speak colloquially if admitted to see the hoards he would blue the lot a taboo often protects by a supernatural sanction the property and persons of the privileged classes if the umbrella of a bishop or a baronet were taboo it would not be taken away from the club by accident this simple explanation covers the case of many taboos brother and sister may scarcely ever see each other still less speak to or name each other where the law against brother and sister marriage or amour is the one most definite law of the community it is not therefore surprising says mr jevons that the earlier students of the custom of taboo regarded it as an artificial invention a piece of statecraft cunningly devised in the interests of the nobility and the priests this view is however now generally abandoned because taboo is most at home in communities which have no state organisation and flourishes where there are no priests or no priesthood above all the belief is not artificial and imposed but spontaneous and natural i hesitate about this theory taboo can hardly flourish more than it does in polynesia and west africa where there are kings and priests moreover though there are human societies without kings or priests as in australia there are no societies in which artificial rules are not propagated instituted and enforced by the adult males meeting in councils the arunta of central australia are of course far from primitive they have institutions ceremonies weapons rules and a complete system of philosophy which must have needed unknown ages to develop they have local headmen or alatunjas whose office passes always in the male line from father to son if the son be of age to succeed or if he is not to the brother on whose death it reverts to the son an alatunja dying without a son nominates a brother or nephew to succeed him messrs spencer and gillen know no equivalent to this law among other australian tribes and it indicates among the socalled primitive arunta a marked advance beyond other tribes in social evolution the alatunja is hereditary convener of council and if an able man has considerable power he is guardian of the sacra of the group determines the date of the cessation of closetime for certain sorts of game the date of the magical ceremonies for fostering the game or edible plants and directs the ceremonies in the councils called by the alatunja it appears that changes in stereotyped custom may be introduced men learned in the customs and skilled in magic settle everything definite proof of fundamental innovations thus introduced messrs spencer and gillen do not possess but tradition indicates alterations of custom and it is quite possible that a strong alatunja well backed might bring in even a radical reform there are also recognised grades of skill among the medicinemen and the dealers with spirits who must have their own share of social influence in brief though without priests or kings these backward tribes have councils and conveners and directors whose office is hereditary in the male line these persons through unknown ages have moulded customs and taboos which are just as much sanctioned by tradition and authority just as little spontaneous and universal as if kings and priests had invented them for purposes of statecraft mr jevons next argues that taboo cannot have been derived from experience it is prior to and even contradictory of experience in fine it is an inherent tendency of the human mind in the same way gibbons ancestor blue gown herald when among north american indians declared that heraldry is an inherent tendency of the human mind an innate idea an opinion is not necessarily erroneous because it is obsolete nor a view wrong because it is generally abandoned i am here supporting the generally abandoned hypothesis that many taboos at least are artificial and imposed against mr jevonss idea that the taboo like armorial bearings results from an inherent tendency of the human mind prior to and even contradictory of experience that a newborn baby is dangerous or that the water in which a holy person has washed is dangerous my private experience does not tell me in fact i never made either experiment never tubbed in the water previously used by a bishop but i am prepared to admit that neither babies nor bishops are proved by our experience to be dangerous that is not the question the savage argued not from unbiassed and impartial scientific experiment but from fancied experience thus mr jevons mentions a maori who died after rinding out that he had eaten unawares the remains of the luncheon of a holy person a chief there was experience produced by suggestion the suggestion was suggested in the interests of holy chiefs they were tabooed an inch thick as mr manning writes as to the baby the dyaks as in our own fairy belief hold that newborn children are the especial prey of evil spirits just as corpses were in scotland where if the door was left ajar the corpse sat up and mopped and mowed if the watchers left it and dined in the but an awful vacarme arose in the ben the minister entered stilled the tumult asked for the tongs and came back holding in the tongs a bloody glove this he dropped into the fire this kind of thing is contradictory to the experience of mr jevons but not to the fancied experience of dyaks scots and other races opinion therefore makes taboos in accordance with experience or what is believed to be experience and the belief is fortified by suggestion which produces death or disease when the taboo is broken on the analogy of infectious diseases the mischief of the tabooed thing is held to be contagious thus i cannot hold with mr jevons that the human mind is provided with an a priori categorical imperative that there are some things which must not be done a feeling independent of sense experience if the choice of what things are not to be done seems to us irrational that is merely because our reason is more enlightened than that of the savage he prohibited just such things as his philosophy and what he believed to be his experience showed him to be dangerous for obscure reasons any fool could see that it was dangerous to eat poison berries or frolic with a bear but it took reflection to discover that a baby or a corpse was dangerous by reason of evil spirits iruntarinia whom the alkna buma or clairvoyant could see and describe though mr jevons and i could not discern them these iruntarinia notoriously carry off women and probably like the fairies have their best chance in the hour of childbirth at all events the fairies have the belief is socially useful it prevents young arunta women from wandering off alone and philandering out of bounds thus these taboos are sanctioned by the tribal counsellors as the results of experience not their own perhaps but that of the alkna buma or clairvoyant or sensitive or medium or habitually hallucinated person other taboos as to women are imposed for very good reasons though not for the reasons alleged and broken taboos are not in actual ordinary experience attended by the penalties which however suggestion may produce taboo then is not imposed irrationally nor in deference to an inherent tendency of the human mind that mrs harris of philosophy but for a very good reason as savage reasoning goes and in accordance with what is believed to be experience and by dint of suggestion really does become experience it was irrational in dr johnson to touch certain posts and avoid certain stones and enter a door twice if he first entered it with the wrong foot all my life i have had similar private taboos though nobody knows better that they are nonsense but some solitary experience in childhood probably suggested a relation of cause and effect where there was only a fortuitous sequence of antecedent and consequent and so dr johnson and i though not so conspicuously as the doctor imposed taboos on ourselves in deference to fancied experience early man has acted in the same way on a large scale obeying no categorical a priori imperative but merely acting on his philosophy and experience which is real to him though not to civilised men they usually do not understand it but educated persons with a survival of savagery in their mental constitutions find the affair intelligible but the reason in actual practical experience for some taboos must be plain to the most civilised minds except those of badical voters for the border boroughs man in the hunter stage must have game laws and a closetime for edible animals and plants the border badical will not permit a closetime for trout preferring to destroy them and with them their offspring when gravid and unfit for human food or before they recover condition the primitive arunta are not so irrational and have a closetime protected by taboo or at least by ceremonies of a nature more or less magical in these ceremonies of a people not pastoral or agricultural we seem to see the germs of the offerings of firstfruits to gods or spirits though the australian produce is offered neither to spirits nor to gods these tribes recognise a great spirit indeed twanyirika but that he plays any other part in religion or society than presiding over the tribal mysteries we have at present no evidence to prove similar figures associated with the mysteries are in other parts of australia provided with an ample mythology and are subject to a being more august and remote but either the arunta are advanced thinkers who have passed beyond such ideas or they have not yet attained to them or our witnesses are uninformed on the subject in any case the firstfruits of the game grubs and plants of the arunta are not offered to twanyirika or to the minor sprites iruntarinia the ceremonies partly intended to make the creatures used for food prolific and partly i think to indicate that the closetime is over and that the creatures may be taken and eaten are called intichiuma on the mummeries expected to make animals and plants plentiful we need not dwell in each case the men who belong to the totem of the beast grub or plant perform the ceremonies there is believed to be a close and essential connection between a man of the kangaroo totem and all kangaroos between a man of the grub totem and all grubs so each totem group does the magic to propagate its ally among beasts or plants how these ideas arose we do not know but if a local group was originally called kangaroos or grubs and some name it must have the association of names would inevitably lead by association of ideas to the notion that a mysterious connection existed between the men of a totem name and the plant animal or what not which gave the name these men therefore would work the magic for propagating their kindred in the animal and vegetable world but the existence of this connection would also suggest that in common decency a man should not kill and eat his animal or vegetable relations in most parts of the world he abstains from this uncousinly behaviour among the arunta he may eat sparingly of his totem and must do so at the end of the closetime or beginning of the season he thus as a near relation of the actual kangaroos or grubs declares the season open and gives his neighbours of other totems a lead now they may begin to eat grubs or kangaroos the taboo is off thus in gask tabooed the corn of his tenants they must not reap it because they refused to rise and follow charlie prince charles hearing of this cut a few ears with his claymore thus removing the taboo in the same way the grub or kangaroo men publicly eat a little of their own totem after which the tribesmen and other totems may fall to and devour when the grub or whatever it is becomes plentiful after the magic doings for its propagation it is collected and placed before some members of the grub totem the alatunja or convener grinds up some of the grub he and his fellow totemists eat a little and hand the mass back to the members of other totems they eat a little of their own totem partly messrs spencer and gillen say to strengthen their mystic connection with the creature this in a way is a sacramental idea though no religious regard is paid to the plants and animals but the men also partake to remove the taboo and to let the rest of the community gorge themselves legally the rite has thus a practical purpose the grubs or other creatures are not prematurely destroyed like trout on the border in fact trout themselves are sensible enough not to begin feeding on may fly prematurely throughout the previous week says sir herbert maxwell a few may flies had been seen but not a trout would point his nose at one this hesitation on the part of the trout to begin their annual banquet is one of the best known and at the same time least explicable features of the may fly fortnight the arunta also let the grub come on to its full rise before feeding when a certain bulb is ripe the men of its totem rub off and blow away the husks then the general public may begin feeding there is nothing sacramental in this ceremony which merely opens the season for tuber eating the taboo is off and so in other cases the kangaroo men are smeared with the fat of the kangaroo and eat a little of the animal the nonkangaroo tribesmen may then eat kangaroo the traditions of the arunta represent their mythical ancestors as in some cases feeding solely on their totems but this cannot possibly be true a grub man would die when grubs were out of starvation and so with the rest when fruits is in cats is out and a man of the gooseberry totem who only ate gooseberries would perish miserably the arunta eating of the totem has nothing to do with consecrating the firstfruits of grubs or kangaroos to a god or with absorbing the qualities of a spirit when swedish peasants bake a cake shaped like a girl from the last sheaf of the new corn they perhaps originally ate the cake as the body of the corn spirit but when the lithuanian farmer takes the first swig of the new beer the second brew was for the servants perhaps he is only declaring his ownership and opening the beer season in an unnamed part of yorkshire the parson cuts the first corn he is the alatunja and opens the harvest in the celebes the priest opens the rice harvest all eat of it after this every one is free to get in his rice at st andrews on the medal day which is in harvest time the alatunja that is the new captain drives a ball from the first tee after this every one is free to drive off in his turn but not before in some places as in indochina the firstfruits are offered to a god in zululand the king pops a little into the mouth of every man present who may immediately get in his crops if he began harvest before he would die or if detected would be speared or forfeited sometimes the firstfruits are offered to the holy spirit of fire there are all sorts of ways and ceremonies of opening the season and taking off the taboo i really dont think it follows that the first fruits are dangerous to eat before the ceremony because they are regarded as instinct with a divine virtue and consequently the eating of them is a sacrament or communion i it is dangerous to eat them as it would be dangerous to steal a tabooed umbrella they are tabooed because it is closetime the other ideas may come to be entertained an automatic punishment may be thought to follow the breach of the taboo though we do not learn that this is the case among the arunta but the origin of the taboo on the immature food i think is the perfectly practical idea of a closetime plants are not to be gathered nor animals killed prematurely the more or less supreme being of the fuegians is angry if you shoot flappers very bad to shoot little duck come rain come wind blow very much blow the great black man who cannot be escaped and who influences the weather according to mens conduct is right about the flappers he sanctions a necessary game law the how king in tonga used to wait till the yams were ripe then he fixed a day for gathering them and had a religious function the sort of function depends on the stage at which local religion has arrived but a closetime no premature killing or gathering is the practical idea at the base of all these affairs of firstfruits any other superstition sacrificial or sacramental may crystallise round the practical primitive prohibition especially when it was sanctioned by the good old device of automatic punishment following on infringement of taboo if sir herbert maxwell could persuade mr thomas shaw mp that the proverbially execrable weather on the border is the direct result of fishing especially with salmonroe out of season if there was to be no fishing till mr shaw after tasting of the first trout declared the season open if the clergy of all denominations lent their presence to the imposing ceremony then i believe that tweed ettrick teviot yarrow ail and kale would be worth fishing in again taboo as mr frazer and mr jevons agree has had its uses in the evolution of morality but remark that strictly moral offences are nowhere under taboo you may steal as long as the object stolen is not tabooed and does not belong to a chief or priest you may kill you may interfere with the domestic bliss of your neighbour you may lie but the automatic punishment of taboobreaking nowhere follows baiame or pundjel may punish you but there is no instant mechanical penalty as under taboo after writing this paper i found that mr robert louis stevensons experience of tapu in the pacific led him to form the same opinions as are here expressed the devilfish it seems were growing scarce upon the reef it was judged fit to interpose what we should call a close season a tapu had to be declared the tapus described are for thoroughly sensible ends there are tapus which to us appear absurd but the tapu is more often the instrument of wise and needful restrictions these taboos are imposed from above by government in other cases where the taboo expresses an inference from savage superstition say that a baby or a corpse is dangerous the taboo is not imposed except by public opinion that opinion is sanctioned as in the case of firstfruits by the action of the alatunja or headman in more advanced societies by the king in many cases taboos are imposed on the king himself by the priestly colleges but the greatest authority is tradition resting on fancied experience introduction to the

through fire perhaps the topic of this paper may be ranged under the head of magic though in many cases the rite of passing through fire is sanctioned by religion and the immunity of the performers is explained by the protection of gods the immunity is really the curious feature mr frazer describes the chinese vernal festival of fire in spring connected as it is with the widespread custom of renewing the fire at a certain season the chief performers are labourers who must fast for three days and observe chastity for a week while they are taught in the temple how to discharge the difficult and dangerous duty which is to be laid upon them the fire is made in an enormous brazier of charcoal sometimes twenty feet wide the fire is gratified with salt and rice thrown on it by a taoist priest further two exorcists barefooted and followed by two peasants traverse the fire again and again till it is somewhat beaten down the procession of performers then walks through amidst much excitement their immunity is ascribed to the horny consistency of the soles of their feet and they suffer if the fire touches their ankles various indian examples are given by mr frazer captain mackenzie found the performance remote from the sensational and thought that only girls with tender soles were likely to suffer a case is also quoted from strabo women being the performers and the instance of the hirpi of soracte is well known mr frazer is interested mainly in the religious magical or ritual significance of the rite which varies in different places to me on the other hand the immunity of the performers appears a subject worthy of physiological inquiry the subject occurs everywhere in history legend folklore law and early religion and yet nobody has thought it worth while to collect the ancient reports and to compare them with wellauthenticated modern examples in mr tylors celebrated work primitive culture only one or two casual allusions are made to the theme they built the high places of baal in the valley of the son of hinnom to cause their sons and daughters to pass through to moloch that is to pass through the fire whether in ritual or symbolical sacrifice as a supposed rite of purification the ceremony is again touched upon lightly again the ancient ceremony of passing through a fire or leaping over burning brands has been kept up vigorously in the british isles namely at the midsummer ceremonies when it is or was the custom to jump over or run through light fires nobody would guess that a rite of passing deliberately and unscathed through ovens or furnaces yet exists in japan bulgaria the society islands fiji southern india trinidad the straits settlements the isle of mauritius and no doubt in other regions we must distinguish between such sportive playing with fire as prevailed recently in our isles and the more serious fire ceremony of central australia which tests endurance on the one hand and the apparent contravention of a natural law on the other again we must discount the popular reply that the hand can be rapidly plunged into molten metal and withdrawn without injury for we do not happen to be concerned with such a brief exposure to heat once more the theory of the application of some unknown chemical substance must be rejected because as we shall prove there are certainly cases in which nothing of the kind is done moreover science is acquainted with no substance alum or diluted sulphuric acid or the like which will produce the result of preventing cauterisation sir william crookes at least is not familiar with any such resources of science his evidence as to firehandling by d d home is familiar and i understand that mr podmore can only explain it away by an hypothesis of a trick played in a bad light by means of an asbestos glove or some such transparent trick perhaps he adds a little hallucination on the part of the spectators but asbestos and hallucination are out of the question in the cases which i am about to quote home was or feigned to be in a state of trance when he performed with fire the seeress of lourdes bernadette was also in religious contemplation when she permitted the flame of a candle to play through her clasped fingers which were unscathed for a timed quarter of an hour some indian devotees again aver that they meditate on some divine being while passing over the glowing embers and the nistinares of bulgaria who dance in the fire are described as being in a more or less abnormal mental condition but even this condition is absent in the wellattested raiatean and fijian examples in which also no kind of chemical preparation is employed finally where savages are concerned the hardness of the skins of their feet is dwelt upon as in the chinese case already quoted but first the sole of the boot would be scorched in the circumstances while their feet are not affected next the savages feet were not leathery so dr hocken avers thirdly one of the europeans who walked through the fire at rarotonga declares that the soles of his own feet are peculiarly tender thus every known physical or conjectured psychical condition of immunity fails to meet the case and we are left wholly without an ascertained or a good conjectural reason why for the phenomena i shall begin with the most recent and the best authenticated cases and work back in time and in civilisation mr tregear the wellknown lexicographer of the maori and the allied mangarova languages lately sent me the twentyninth number of the journal of the polynesian society march wellington nz professors max mueller and sayce were honorary members of the society which studies polynesian languages customs and conditions mr tregear attests the upright truthtelling character of the british official who is the narrator of his own experiment as the journal is not widely circulated in england i quote the whole of the brief report the umuti or firewalking ceremony by colonel gudgeon british resident rarotonga in this journal vol ii p miss teuira henry describes this ceremony as practised in raiatea of the society group we have lately received from colonel gudgeon the following account of his experiences in walking barefooted across the glowing hot stones of a native oven made in rarotonga by a man from raiatea since the date of the paper quoted it has come to light that the maoris of new zealand were equally acquainted with this ceremony which was performed by their ancestors on reading colonel gudgeons account to some old chiefs of the urewera tribe they expressed no surprise and said that their ancestors could also perform the ceremony though it has long gone out of practice editors i must tell you that i have seen and gone through the fire ceremony of the umuti the oven was lit at about dawn on the th of january and i noticed that the stones were very large as also were the logs that had been used in the oven for heating purposes about pm we went to the oven and there found the tohunga a raiatea man getting matters ready and i told him that as my feet were naturally tender the stones should be levelled down a bit he assented to this and evidently he had intended to do so for shortly after the men with very long poles that had hooks began to level the stones flat in the oven which was some ft in diameter he then went with his disciple and pointed to two stones that were not hot and instructed him the reason was that they had been taken from a marae or sacred place he then unwound two bundles which proved to be branches of a largeleaved ti or dracaena plucked it is said from two of these trees standing close together and it is said that the initiated can on such occasions see the shadow of a woman with long hair called te varua kino evil spirit standing between the trees the righthand branch is the first plucked and it is said that the branches bend down to be plucked so much for the shamanism and now for the facts the tohunga priest and his tauira pupil walked each to the oven and then halting the prophet spoke a few words and then each struck the edge of the oven with the ti branches this was three times repeated and then they walked slowly and deliberately over the two fathoms of hot stones when this was done the tohunga came to us and his disciple handed his ti branch to mr goodwin at whose place the ceremony came off and they went through the ceremony then the tohunga said to mr goodwin i hand my mana power over to you lead your friends across now there were four europeans dr w craig dr george craig mr goodwin and myself and i can only say that we stepped out boldly i got across unscathed and only one of the party was badly burned and he it is said was spoken to but like lots wife looked behind him a thing against all rules i can hardly give you my sensations but i can say this that i knew quite well i was walking on redhot stones and could feel the heat yet i was not burned i felt something resembling slight electric shocks both at the time and afterwards but that is all i do not know that i should recommend every one to try it a man must have mana to do it if he has not it will be too late when he is on the hot stone of tamaahiroa i cannot say that i should have performed this wizard trick had i not been one of the fathers of the polynesian society and bound to support the superiority of the new zealander all over polynesia indeed all over the world i would not have missed the performance for anything to show you the heat of the stones quite half an hour afterwards some one remarked to the priest that the stones would not be hot enough to cook the ti his only answer was to throw his green branch on the oven and in a quarter of a minute it was blazing as i have eaten a fair share of the ti cooked in the oven i am in a position to say that it was hot enough to cook it well i walked with bare feet and after we had done so about maoris followed no one so far as i saw went through with boots on i did not walk quickly across the oven but with deliberation because i feared that i should tread on a sharp point of the stones and fall my feet also were very tender i did not mention the fact but my impression as i crossed the oven was that the skin would all peel off my feet yet all i really felt when the task was accomplished was a tingling sensation not unlike slight electric shocks on the soles of my feet and this continued for seven hours or more the really funny thing is that though the stones were hot enough an hour afterwards to burn up green branches of the ti the very tender skin of my feet was not even hardened by the fire many of the maoris thought they were burned but they were not at any rate not severely do not suppose that the man who directed this business was an old tohunga he is a young man but of the raiatea family who are hereditary firewalkers i can only tell you it is mana mana tangata and mana atua on this report a few remarks may be offered no preparation of any chemical herbal or other sort was applied to the europeans at least the handing over the mana or power was practised by home sometimes successfully it is alleged as when mr s c halls scalp and white locks were unharmed by a redhot coal sometimes unsuccessfully a clergyman of my acquaintance still bears the blister caused when he accepted a redhot coal from the hand of home as he informs me by letter the walk was shorter than seems common only ft paces a friend of colonel gudgeons was badly burned and the reason assigned was a good folklore reason since the days of lots wife of theocritus and of virgil he looked behind the feeling as if of slight electric shocks is worthy of notice colonel gudgeon clearly believes that a man without mana had better not try and by mana here he probably means nerve as we can hardly suppose in spite of home that mana in a supernormal sense can be handed over by one man to another colonel gudgeons experience seems equally to baffle every theory of how it is done perhaps we can all do it people may make their own experiments perhaps colonel gudgeon faced fire in a manner so unusual as a result of dr hockens description of the fijian rite at mbenga an isle twenty miles south of suva this account was published in the transactions of the new zealand institute vol xxxi having been read before the otago institute on may and is here reprinted in full as follows an account of the fiji fire ceremony by dr t m hocken fls amongst the many incidents witnessed during a recent visit to the tropical island of fiji probably none exceeded in wonder and interest that of which i propose to give some account this evening and to which may be applied the designation of fire ceremony it is called by the natives vilavilairevo in this remarkable ceremony a number of almost nude fijians walk quickly and unharmed across and among whitehot stones which form the pavement of a huge native oven termed lovo in which shortly afterwards are cooked the succulent sugary roots and pith of the cordyline terminalis one of the cabbage trees known to the maoris as the ti and to the fijians as the masawe this wonderful power of firewalking is now not only very rarely exercised but at least as regards fiji is confined to a small clan or family the na ivilankata resident on bega mbenga an island of the group lying somewhat south of suva and twenty miles from that capital a small remnant of the priestly order at raiatea one of the society islands is yet able to utter the preparatory incantation and afterwards to walk through the fire it exists also in other parts of the world as in parts of india the straits settlements west india islands and elsewhere very interesting accounts of the ceremony as seen at raiatea and at mbenga are to be found in the second and third volumes of the journal of the polynesian society and in basil thomsons charming south sea yarns these descriptions filled our small party of three my wife dr colquhoun and myself with the desire to witness it for ourselves and if possible to give some explanation of what was apparently an inexplicable mystery our desires were perfectly realised the hon mr a m duncan a member of the legislative council of fiji and agent at suva of the union steamship company to whom i carried a letter of introduction from mr james mills the managing director of that company was most courteous and obliging and promised his best efforts in the matter his energy and ready response succeeded with the result that a large party from suva enjoyed such a day as each one must have marked with a red letter it was necessary to give the natives three days in which to make their preparations constructing the oven and paving it with stones which then required heating for thirtysix or fortyeight hours at least with fierce fires fed with logs and branches they had also to gather their stores of food to form the foundation of the huge feast whose preparation was to succeed the mystic ceremony during these three days we lost no opportunity of collecting from former witnesses of the ceremony whatever information or explanation they could afford but with no very satisfactory result the facts were undisputed but the explanations quite insufficient some thought that the chief actors rubbed their bodies with a secret preparation which rendered them fireproof others that lifelong friction on the hard hot rocks coralreefs and sands had so thickened and indurated the footsole that it could defy fire but all agreed as to the bona fides of the exhibition the incident recounted in the polynesian journal was also confirmed where lady thurston threw her handkerchief upon the shoulder of one of the actors and though it remained there but a few seconds before being picked off by means of a long stick it was greatly scorched the story or legend attached to this weird gift of firewalking was told us with some variation by two or three different people and it is mainly as follows a fardistant ancestor of the present inheritors of this power was walking one day when he espied an eel which he caught and was about to kill the eel squeaked out and said oh tui na galita enggalita do not kill me spare me i am a god and i will make you so strong in war that none shall withstand you oh but replied na galita i am already stronger in war than any one else and i fear no one well then said the eel i will make your canoe the fastest to sail on these seas and none shall come up with it but replied na galita as it is none can pass my canoe well then rejoined the eel i will make you a great favourite among women so that all will fall in love with you not so said na galita i have one wife of whom i am very fond and i desire no other the poor eel then made other offers which were also rejected and his chances of life were fading fast when he made a final effort oh na galita if you will spare me i will so cause it that you and your descendants shall henceforth walk through the masawe oven unharmed good said na galita now i will let you go this story varies somewhat from that told in the polynesian journal the eventful morning was blazingly hot and brilliant and the vividblue sky was without a cloud as we steamed down towards mbenga in the ss hauroto mr vaughan an eminent inhabitant of suva who has charge of the meteorological department there was of our party and carried the thermometer this was the most suitable for our purpose procurable it was in a strong japannedtin casing and registered deg fahr we had also three amateur photographers owing to the numerous coralreefs and shallows we finally transhipped into the maori a steamer of much less draught approaching the silent verdureclad islet with its narrow beach of white coral sand we saw a thin blue haze of smoke curling above the lofty cocoanut trees at a little distance in the interior which sufficiently localised the mysterious spot we now took the ships boat and soon stepping ashore made our way through a narrow pathway in the dense bush until we came to an open space cleared from the forest in the midst of which was the great lovo or oven a remarkable and nevertobeforgotten scene now presented itself there were hundreds of fijians dressed according to the rules of nature and their own art that is they were lightly garlanded here and there with their fantastic likulikus of grass ornamented with brilliant scarlet and yellow hibiscus flowers and streamers of the delicate ribbonwood these hung in airy profusion from their necks and around their waists showing off to advantage their lovely brown glossy skins in addition many wore clean white cotton sulus or pendant loincloths all were excited moving hither and thither in wild confusion and making the forest ring again with their noisy hilarity some climbed the lofty cocoapalms hand over hand foot over foot with all the dexterity of monkeys the top reached and shrouded amongst the feathery leaves they poured down a shower of nuts for the refreshment of their guests the celerity with which they opened the nuts was something astonishing and afforded an example too as to the mode of using stone implements a stout strong stick ft long and sharpened at both ends was driven into the ground and a few smart strokes upon it soon tore from the nut its outer thick covering the upper part of the shell was then broken off by means of a long sharpedged stone as cleanly and regularly as the lid of an egg is removed with a knife and then was disclosed a pint of delicious milk a most welcome beverage on that overpoweringly hot day the great oven lay before us pouring forth its torrents of heat from huge embers which were still burning fiercely on the underlying stones these were indeed melting moments for the spectators the pitiless noontide sun and the no less pitiless ovenheat both pent up in the deep welllike forest clearing reduced us to a state of solution from which there was no escape despite this the photographers took up their stations and others of us proceeded to make our observations the lovo or oven was circular with a diameter of ft or ft its greatest depth was perhaps ft its general shape that of a saucer with sloping sides and a flattish bottom the latter being filled with the whitehot stones near the margin of the oven and on its windward side the thermometer marked deg suddenly and as if pandemonium had been let loose the air was filled with savage yells a throng of natives surrounded the oven and in a most ingenious and effective way proceeded to drag out the smouldering unburnt logs and cast them some distance away large loops of incombustible lianas attached to long poles were dexterously thrown over the burning trunks much after the manner of the headhunters of new guinea when securing their human prey a twist or two round of the loop securely entangled the logs which were then dragged out by the united efforts of scores of natives who all the while were shouting out some wild rhythmical song this accomplished the stones at the bottom of the oven were disclosed with here and there flame flickering and forking up through the interstices the diameter of the area occupied by those stones was about ft but this was speedily increased to a spread of ft or more by a second ingenious method the natives thrust their long poles which were of the unconsumable witree spondias dulcis between the stones at intervals of perhaps i ft a long ropelike liana wa previously placed underneath the poles and ft or ft from their extremities was now dragged by scores of lusty savages with the effect of spreading and levelling the stones this done our thermometer was suspended by a simple device over the centre of the stones and about ft or ft above them but it had to be withdrawn almost immediately as the solder began to melt and drop and the instrument to be destroyed it however registered deg fahr and it is certain that had not this accident occurred the range of deg would have been exceeded and the thermometer burst during all these wild scenes we had seen nothing of the main actors of the descendants of na galita doubtless to give more impressive effect they had been hiding in the forest depths until the signal should be given and their own supreme moment arrive and now they came on seven or eight in number amidst the vociferous yells of those around the margin reached they steadily descended the oven slope in single file and walked as i think leisurely but as others of our party think quickly across and around the stones leaving the oven at the point of entrance the leader who was longest in the oven was a second or two under half a minute therein almost immediately heaps of the soft and succulent leaves of the hibiscus which had been gathered for the purpose were thrown into the oven which was thus immediately filled with clouds of hissing steam upon the leaves and within the steam the natives who had returned sat or stood pressing them down in preparation for cooking the various viands which were to afford them a sumptuous feast that evening or on the morrow but for us the most interesting part of the drama was over and it only remained to review observations and draw conclusions just before the great event of the day i gained permission to examine one or two of the firewalkers prior to their descent into the oven this was granted without the least hesitation by the principal native magistrate of the rewa district ndabea by name but generally known as jonathan this native is of great intelligence and influence is a member of the na galita clan and has himself at various times walked through the fire on this occasion he took no other part in the ceremony than that of watching or superintending it the two men thus sent forward for examination disclosed no peculiar feature whatever as to dress they were slightly garlanded round the neck and the waist the pulse was unaffected and the skin legs and feet were free from any apparent application i assured myself of this by touch smell and taste not hesitating to apply my tongue as a corroborative the footsoles were comparatively soft and flexible by no means leathery and insensible thus the two suvan theories were disposed of this careful examination was repeated immediately after egress from the oven and with the same result to use the language of scripture no smell of fire had passed upon them no incantations or other religious ceremonial were observed though these were formerly practised they have gradually fallen into disuse since the introduction of christianity i did not succeed in procuring the old incantation formula doubtless it was similar to that of the old raiatean ceremony which is given in the second volume of the polynesian societys journal p whilst walking through the fire dr colquhoun thought the countenances of the firewalkers betrayed some anxiety i saw none of this nor was it apparent to me at either examination the stones which were basaltic must have been whitehot but due to the brilliance of the day this was not visible various natives being interrogated for an explanation replied with a shrug they can do this wonderful thing we cannot you have seen it we have seen it whilst thus unable to suggest any explanation or theory i am absolutely certain as to the truth of the facts and the bona fides of the actors a feature is that wherever this power is found it is possessed by but a limited few i was assured too that any person holding the hand of one of the firewalkers could himself pass through the oven unharmed this the natives positively assert my friend mr walter carew for thirty years a resident commissioner and stipendiary magistrate in fiji has frequently conversed with jonathan referred to above who whilst withholding no explanation can give none he says i can do it but i do not know how it is done and further that at the time he does not experience any heat or other sensation does any psychical condition explain these facts as suggested in langs modern mythology i certainly did not observe any appearance of trance or other mental condition in connection with this mr carew thinks that intense faith is the explanation and that if this were upset the descendants of na galita would be no longer charmed but it is difficult to see how any mental state can prevent the action of physical law hypnotism and anaesthetics may produce insensibility to pain but do not interfere with the cautery many of the socalled fire miracles are remarkable indeed but are readily explained and by no means come within the present category such for instance as plunging the hand which is protected by the interposed film of perspiration assuming the globular state of water into boiling lead similarly many conjuring feats at the beginning of this century an italian lionetti performed remarkable experiments rubbed a bar of redhot iron over his arms legs and hair and held it between his teeth he also drank boiling oil dr sementini of naples carefully examined these experiments and experimented himself until he surpassed the fireproof qualities of his suggestor he found that frequent friction with sulphurous acid rendered him insensible to redhot iron a solution of alum did the same a layer of powdered sugar covered with soap made his tongue insensible to heat in these and similar instances however an explanation though probably not a very sufficient one has been given but in that forming the subject of this paper no solution has been offered langs chapter on the fire walk should be consulted his account of the bulgarian nistinares is as wonderful and inexplicable as anything here recited the whole subject requires thorough scientific examination my next case occurs among a civilised race the japanese and is vouched for by mr lafcadio hearn an american writer whose book i have not at hand and by colonel andrew haggard colonel haggard saw the firewalk done in tokio on april the fire was yards long by ft wide the rite was in honour of a mountain god ablutions in cold water were made by the performers and colonel haggard was told by one young lady that she had not only done the firewalk but had been able to sit for a long time in winter immersed in icecold water without feeling the cold in the least after some waving of wands and sprinkling of salt people of all ages walked through not glowing stones in this case but redhot charcoal i examined their feet afterwards they were quite soft and not a trace of fire upon them colonel haggard says that the rite is a very unusual thing in japan many of the japanese living in tokio had never heard of it before colonel haggard was unable to get any clear answer as to why the rite is performed the priest talked something about a good god who had power over the bad element of fire it is not clear how the rite being so unusual two japanese ladies told colonel haggard that they had frequently gone through the fiery ordeal if any one is anxious to know the particulars of the rite as practised in the isle mauritius he may communicate with our police officials there who annually superintend the performance coolies from southern india do just what is done by japanese and fijians our administration however does not permit women to pass through the fire after giving these recent examples in mauritius japan rarotonga and an isle of the fijian group i am obliged to fall back on the evidence already set forth in chapter xii of my book modern mythology the bulgarian practice i take from the recueil de folklore de litterature et de science edited by the bulgarian minister of public instruction with the aid of drs schischmanof whom i know personally and mastov in a private letter dr schischmanof hints at extase religieuse as in the selfmutilations of dervishes and fakirs their performances are extraordinary enough but there was no religious ecstasy in the little japanese boy of six whom colonel haggard saw pass through the fire none in colonel gudgeon none in the fijians observed by dr hocken the firewalkers in bulgaria are called nistinares and the faculty is regarded as hereditary we find the same opinion in fiji in ancient italy and in the spain of the last century in spain the firewalkers were employed to help to put out fires the story is given in the essay on the last earl marischal in my companions of pickle p and is derived from dalemberts account of the earl there is a family or caste in spain who from father to son have the power of going into the flames without being burned and who by dint of charms permitted by the inquisition can extinguish fires the duchess of medina sidonia thought this a proof of the verity of the catholic faith and wishing to convert the earl asked him to view the performance but he insisted on lighting the fire himself and to that the spaniards would not consent the earl being a heretic to return to the bulgarian nistinares they dance in the fire on may the feast of ss helena and constantine great fires of scores of cartloads of dry wood are made on the embers of those the nistinares who turn blue in the face dance and utter prophecies afterwards placing their feet in the muddy ground where libations of water have been poured forth the report says nothing as to the state of their feet the nistinare begins to feel the effect of the fire after his face has resumed its wonted colour and expression as for india i may cite mr stokes in the indian antiquary ii dr oppert in his original inhabitants of india p and mr crookes in introduction to popular religion and folklore in northern india p mr stokes uses evidence from an inquest on a boy that fell into the fire and died of his injuries at periyangridi the firepit was ft long by ft bread and a span in depth thirteen persons walked through mr stokes did not witness the performance which is forbidden by our law but explains that the fire would hardly injure the tough skin of the sole of a labourers feet yet it killed a boy the incredulous say that the firewalkers smear their feet with oil from the fat of the green frog dr oppert admitting that the heat is unbearable in the neighbourhood of the ditch says that the walkers as a rule do not do themselves much harm this is vague equally vague is the reference to rumours about a certain preservative ointment in trinidad british west indies mr henry k st clair writing to me describes september the feat as performed by indian coolie immigrants he personally witnessed the rite which was like that described to me by mr stephen ponder in both cases the performers were klings the case witnessed by mr ponder took place in the straits settlements province wellesley the trench was about yards long by ft wide and ft deep a pyre of wood or ft high was lighted at noon by p m it was a bed of redhot embers the men who with long rakes smoothed the ashes could not stand the heat for more than a minute at a time a little way from the end of the trench was a hole full of water six coolies walked the whole length and thence into the water not one of them showed the least sign of injury they had been prepared by a devildoctor not a brahmin on a later occasion mr ponder heard that one of them fell and was terribly burnt in these cases trinidad and mauritius and the straits settlements the performers are south indian coolies in all cases there were multitudes of european spectators except in mauritius where i learn europeans usually take no interest in the doings of the heathen turning to tonga we have the account of miss teuira henry the sister and sisters child of miss henry have walked over the redhot stones as in the rarotonga and fijian cases the ovens are ft in diameter the performance was photographed by lieutenant morne of the french navy and the original photograph was sent to the editor of the polynesian journal with a copy from it by mr barnfield of honolulu the ceremony preparatory to cooking the ti plant is religious and the archaic hymn sung is full of obsolete words mr hastwell of san francisco published a tract which i have not seen on the raiatean rite witnessed by himself the stones were i heated to a red and white heat the natives walked leisurely across five times there was not even the smell of fire on their garments cited in the polynesian journal vol ii no there is corroborative evidence from mr n j tone from province wellesley straits settlements in the polynesian journal ii he did not see the rite arriving too late but he saw the firepit and examined the naked feet of the walkers they were uninjured mr tones evidence is an extract from his diary as to fiji there are various accounts the best is that of mr basil thomson son of the late archbishop of york mr thomson was an official in fiji and is a wellknown anthropologist his sketch in his south sea yarns p et seq is too long for quotation the rite is done yearly before cooking the masawe a dracaena in the oven through which the clan na ivilankata walk the pit was filled with a whitehot mass shooting out little tongues of white flame the bottom of the pit was covered with an even layer of hot stones the tongues of flame played continually among them the walkers planted their feet squarely and firmly on each stone mr thomson closely examined the feet of four or five of the natives when they emerged they were cool and showed no trace of scorching nor were their anklets of dried treefern burnt though dried treefern is as combustible as tinder the instep is covered with skin no thicker than our own and we saw the men plant their insteps fairly on the stone a large stone was hooked out of the pit before the men entered and one of the party dropped a pockethandkerchief upon the stone when the first man leapt into the oven and snatched what remained of it up as the last left the stones every fold that touched the stone was charred mr thomson kindly showed me the handkerchief he also showed me a rather blurred photograph of the strange scene it has been rudely reproduced in the folk lore journal september such is part of the modern evidence for the ancient see aeneid xi et seq servius on the passage pliny hist nat vii silius italicus v this evidence refers to the hirpi of mount soracte a class exempted from military service by the roman government because as virgil makes aruns say strong in faith we walk through the midst of the fire and press our footsteps in the glowing mass the hirpi or wolves were perhaps originally a totem group like the wolf totem of tonkaway red indians they had like the tonkaway a rite in which they were told to behave like wolves the goddess propitiated in their firewalk was feronia a firegoddess max mueller or a lightning goddess kuhn or a corn goddess mannhardt each of these scholars bases his opinion on etymology i have merely given evidence for the antiquity wide diffusion and actual practice of this extraordinary rite neither physical nor anthropological science has even glanced at it except in dr hockens case perhaps because the facts are obviously impossible i ought to make an exception for sir william crookes but he doubtless was hallucinated or gulled by the use of asbestos or both perhaps mr podmore can apply these explanations to the spectators whom i have cited for my part i remain without a theory like all the european observers whom i have quoted but in my humble opinion all the usual theories whether of collective hallucination photographic cameras being hallucinated of psychical causes of chemical application of leathery skin on the soles of the feet and so on are inadequate there remains suggestion any hypnotist with his patients permission in writing and witnessed may try the experiment since this paper was written i have seen an article les dompteurs du feu on the same topic by dr th pascal the first part of the essay is an extract from the revue theosophique francaise no date is given but the rite described was viewed at benares on october i am unable to understand whether dr pascal is himself the spectator and narrator of the revue theosophique or whether he quotes he uses marks of quotation some other writer the phenomena were of the usual kind and the writer examining the feet of two of the performers found the skin of the soles fine and intact in four cases in which the performers had entered the fire after the procession with the master of the ceremonies and two excited persons who split cocoanuts with swords had gone there were slight cauterisations healed two days later the author of this passage speaks of a brahmin apparently the master of the ceremonies who observed to mr govinda das that the control of the fire was not so complete as usual because the images of the sanctuary had been touched by mahomedans and others in the crowd the second case not given with marks of quotation occurred in the park of maharajah tagore on december a frenchman the son of dr javal of paris was present the narrator nous was also present and went up after the rite to venture his hand in the furnace he was warned that the brahmin had left ten minutes before and that the fire had recovered its activity the maharajah however caused the ceremony to be repeated and some minutes after all was ready the narrator then traversed the fire barefoot at un petit trot a little less than two paces a second as yards can be run in ten seconds this trot was remarkably slow he felt in paces one and two a sensation of burning in the five following paces a sensation of intense heat there were three small brown marks on his feet which formed blisters but did not interfere with walking and healed in some days he now learned that the brahmins premier aide did the ceremony not quite successfully he is convinced that but for the ceremony he would have been seriously injured the third case was at benares in february three hindoos collided and fell in neither they nor their clothes were burned the author clearly regards the performers of the ceremony as able to tame considerably the destructive energy of the fire this of course is the theory of the savage devotees the ceremony was only a procession of sacred images carried in a glazed sanctuary and words not known to the spectator were uttered by the brahmin holy water was sprinkled and a cocoanut was thrown into the oven as has been said incantations are pronounced in fiji and elsewhere the following case is recent it is culled from the daily mail november ordeal by fire according to the japan herald on monday last a party of distinguished americans the american minister and his wife two naval officers and others attended the religious rites of the ontake jinsha a powerful sect of shintoists a heap of burning charcoal was placed in a large furnace the officiating priest read a service over the fire after which the foreign visitors to the number of seven including ladies took off their shoes and walked over the fire their naked feet showing no sign of scorching the performance called forth says the report the enthusiastic approval of the spectators yet more recent is the next case from honolulu the reporter being mr gorten a correspondent of the boston evening transcript march we quote the passage we have already witnessed still another strange sight suggestive of necromancy and the incantations of the east papa ita a tahitan has given us exhibitions of the famous firewalking which is still practised in the south sea islands and parts of japan and india on the vacant land swept a year ago by the chinatown fire a great elliptical pit was dug and a large quantity of wood placed therein on which were piled the lava rocks all day the fire burned till the stones were of a white heat then the whitehaired native from tahiti approached the fiery furnace dressed in a robe of white tapa with a girdle and headdress of the sacred ti leaves and a bundle of leaves in his hand for a wand striking the ground with the tileaf wand he uttered an incantation in his own language which was a prayer to his gods to temper the heat and allow him to pass then calmly and deliberately with bare feet he walked the length of the pit bearing aloft the tileaf wand pausing a moment on the other side he again struck the ground and returned over the same fiery path this was several times repeated and he even paused a few seconds when in the middle of the pit to allow his picture to be taken the stones were undoubtedly hot and were turned by means of long poles just before the walking to have the hottest side up and from between the rocks the low flames were continually leaping up the heat that radiated to the spectators was intense it was a fact that others followed with shoes on but no one could be found to accept the standing offer of dollars to any one who would with bare feet follow papa ita none but natives of course believe there is anything supernatural but we cannot explain how he does it it cannot be called a fake for he really does what he claims to do and none so far dare imitate him the natives fall down before him as a great kapuna and many interested in the welfare of the hawaiians deplore these exhibitions feeling it is bad for the natives in that it strengthens their old bonds of superstition to the undoing of much of the advancement they have made just now papa ita is touring the other islands of the group and rumour has it that his manager will take him to the panamerican exhibition at buffalo in that case people in the states can see and judge of this curious exhibition for themselves i end with the only instance forwarded from a correspondent by mr t s oconnor of the ascertained use of an ointment to diminish the effect of the fire dr hocken and colonel gudgeon as we saw found no trace of this device nor is it mentioned in the japanese evidence port of spain trinidad bwi june you referred some time ago to the firewalkers i have seen some of these gents performing quite recently and got an explanation from a coolie customer of ours who watched the business with me it seems they rub themselves with an oil made from the root of the tabicutch dont know the latin name which has the property of producing profuse sweat and the two combine causing an oily covering which warms very slowly and is difficult to dry up by heat but even then it is essential that the men be good stoics i give the explanation for what it is worth but saw the preparation myself and had some of the stuff scraped off a man who was ready for the rite put it on a piece of tin and held it in the fire and it certainly neither dried up nor got hot in a hurry it is clear that this explanation does not explain several of the cases wherein no anointing is used we can only agree with dr hocken that the performances deserve the study of physiologists and physicians the explanation of iamblichus they walk on fire unharmed is that the god within them does not let fire harm them this implies that an exalted psychical condition of the performers secures their immunity but in the cases where europeans bore a part and even in dr hockens examination of the natives there was no sign of other than the normal mental condition as fresh

borrowing i feel so nervous about differing from mr tylor as to the borrowing of the idea of a superior and creative being from the jesuits by the red indians that i have reconsidered his essay he is arguing that the great spirit belongs not to the untutored but to the tutored minds of the savages i am not contending for the use of the words great spirit as of native origin and as employed to designate what i call a superior being that the natives had an untaught belief in such a being is my opinion not that they styled him great spirit mr tylor refers us to relations des jesuites p in the quebec edition of here to translate the passage i read they believe in a god so they say but can only name him by the name of the sun niscaminou and know no prayers nor manner of adoring him when hungry they put on sacred robes turn to the east and say our sun or our god give us to eat here then are prayer vestments and turning to the east the jesuits then did not introduce these for the first time nor did they introduce the conception of the superior being thus implored a similar relation of the sun to the being addressed in prayer exists now among the blackfoot indians of america with them the word natos is equivalent to holy or divine and is also the name of the sun to natos prayer and sacrifice are offered and the cruel rites of the natosdance are performed tongues of cattle are served out to the virtuous this rite partakes of the nature of a sacrament youths sacrifice a finger in recognition of prayers answered by natos prayer is made to natos only and everything in okan the ceremony is sacred to him alone these are advanced elaborate and thoroughly native observances of which the germ may be found in the religions described in the jesuit relations of mr tylor says especially through missionary influence since ideas of retribution after death for deeds done in life have been implanted on native polytheism in various parts of the world but his jesuit authority of in the passage cited by him writes they believe in the immortality of the soul and in recompenses for good men and bad confusedly and in a general way but they seek and care no further as to the manner of such things comment cela doibt estre mr tylors authority does not i confess appear to me to support his opinion the natives believed in future retribution his other texts show us savages consulting each his manitou a powerful being quelque nature puissante or diable a manitou is any superior being good or bad the god of the jesuits is le bon manitou satan is le mauvais manitou i am not arguing that these phrases are more than the pigeonfrench of the savage flock or that the ideas expressed did not later become implanted in their minds but mr tylor in his essay of omits what he quotes in his primitive culture the jesuit evidence of p to one atahocan who made everything speaking of god in a hut one day they asked me what is god i replied the all powerful one who made heaven and earth they then began to say to each other atahocan atahocan he is atahocan they have no worship which they are used to pay to him whom they hold for their god this is the religious condition of the kaffirs described by dos santos in pinkerton xvi now it is atahocan who interests me as premissionary no doubt he was not called le bon manitou but there he was in father le jeune consulted a very hostile sorcerer who minimised atahocan they do not know said the sorcerer who was the author of the world perhaps atahocan it was uncertain they only spoke of atahocan as one speaks of something so remote as to be dubious in fact the word nitatahocan means in their language i tell a story an old tale the sorcerer a servant of familiar spirits had no interest in atahocan though the tribesmen recognised in him the god and creator of father le jeune there was but a waning tradition of a primal maker interesting and important just because it was waning and therefore could not be of fresh european introduction the beings in receipt of sacrifice were khichikouai to whom they threw fat on the fire with prayer it appears to me that these affable familiar ghosts practically serviceable had cast the otiose atahocan into the background but he like andouagni kiehtan and others was certainly there before the jesuits and these beings are elsewhere cited by mr tylor the question is one of the existence of belief in such a being not for me at least of the origin which may well be posteuropean of the words kitchi manitu or great spirit if the mandans believed as mr tylor does not deny in omahank numakchi the creator whose name appears to mean lord of earth it is quite unimportant that there is no mandan deity whose name answers to that of great spirit i mentioned in the first essay of this book mr max muellers version of bishop salvados account of motagon a dead creator in western australia mr tylor recognises him as sir george greys mettagong an insignificant demon identified with the phosphoric fungus but did that demon die in decrepit old age long ago like bishop salvados motagon there seems to be no hope of making anything clear out of motagon mr oldfield cited by mr tylor for australia i have never quoted his account cannot be uncontaminated yet the natives may have believed in an evil spirit before they adorned him with horns as mr oldfield states which no indigenous beast possesses their doctrine of a horned devil must be modern though not necessarily their belief in a bad spirit with mr tylors theory of baiame as a missionary translation of the word for creator

dasius was arraigned the long ms first published by m cumont says that the man on whom the lot fell personated cronos himself on the thirtieth day of revelry he died by the sword as a victim to the unclean idols the author then adds that in his own time socalled christians do devilworship by dancing about in skin of beasts at the new year which is not the date of the saturnalia december unlike these sinners who thus give themselves to the devil dasius determined to refuse to be a sacrifice to heathen gods he would never sacrifice himself to cronos he proclaimed himself a christian was thrown into a dark cell and was brought before bassus the legate next day bassus asked what he was charged with his name and profession dasius gave his name profession and religion bassus who appears to have been a mild kind of man bade him revere the images of the emperors whose salt he ate greek dorroumenoon eimin ta siteiresia dasius in a covenanting spirit replied that he served no earthly monarch bassus again invited him to adore the images of the emperor which homage even barbarous nations pay dasius defied the devil and anticipated in his confession the still unformulated nicene creed bassus keeping his temper to a marvel said that every man must obey constituted authority dasius answered do to me whatever your filthy and impious emperors command bassus then offered him two hours for reflection that you may consider in yourself how you may live among us with honour dasius refused the respite in vulgar and insolent terms bassus then ordered him to be decapitated he had a last chance being offered incense to burn before the imperial effigies but he threw it on the ground and was done to death not a word about the mockkingship passed between dasius and bassus who merely asked him to perform the customary sacrifice that he might live honourably in the regiment greek opoos dyneiteieis zein eimoon en doxei how could dasius live on if he was to be sacrificed at any rate why did not dasius tell bassus the supposed facts of the case that he objected to a month of unhallowed revelry followed by selfsacrifice to cronos bassus obviously knew nothing about all that a soldier only has his orders dasius insulted the religion and the head of the state he declined to retract and bassus had to administer the law if dasius did not like the law he need not have enlisted the two brief mss give us none of this conversation between bassus and dasius that foultongued confessor according to mr frazer refused to play the part of the heathen god and soil his last days by debauchery the threats and arguments of his commanding officer bassus failed to shake his constancy and accordingly he was beheaded but bassus a perfect gentleman never asked dasius to soil his last days by debauchery or to play the part of a heathen god he merely offered to dasius the usual test just as claverhouse might have offered the abjuration oath the position of dasius was exactly that of a dragoon of who refused the abjuration in my opinion dasius probably was executed for his scruples insolently expressed if we believe his biographer and if we do not believe his biographer the evidence ceases to exist the biographer knowing about the usual king of the saturnalia in every roman household and wishing to check the survivals of pagan revelry at the new year declared that the king of the saturnalia was actually sacrificed to saturn but in his own account of the conversations between dasius and his commanding officer not a word is said about the saturnalia and the sacrifice of the mockking on the other hand the commanding officer or military judge labours to save the life of dasius not being aware that it is in any way endangered except by his recusancy this hardly appears in mr frazers brief summary but a glance at the original acts of st dasius shows the nature of the evidence if any part of it has an official basis as m cumont supposes that part must be the examination of dasius by bassus here occurs no hint of sacrificing dasius as saturn bassus expects him to throw incense on the flame and to continue an honourable soldier of the empire he knows nothing about sacrificing dasius thus as historians regard evidence the statement about the yearly victim of saturn a statement made long after the event and after the establishment of christianity is weak indeed for it has no corroboration in the works of latin or greek historians or antiquaries but anthropology is not history and mr frazer argues the martyrologists account of the saturnalia agrees so closely with the accounts of similar rites elsewhere which could not possibly have been known to him that the substantial accuracy of his description may be regarded as established now we have the aztec case and the sacaean case but the aztec victim is a captive not a free soldier whose life bassus is most anxious to preserve the sacaean victim is not sacrificed and is a condemned criminal now mr frazer has said when a nation becomes civilised if it does not drop human sacrifices altogether it at least selects as victims only such wretches as would be put to death at any rate but a valuable soldier like dasius is not a wretch who would be put to death at any rate again among the numerous cases of periods of licence like the sacaea we know only one instance of sacrifice and that of a criminal in ashanti our business is to prove that free roman soldiers voluntarily sacrificed themselves at the saturnalia the aztec sacrifice of a captive the persian execution of a criminal with folklore rites of analogous description scarcely make the roman custom probable while the direct evidence is only that of the martyrologist his evidence merely asserts as to the death of dasius that he perished for refusing the usual test again as m parmentier argues the sacrifice if it existed may have been of oriental importation in this condition of the evidence especially as it allots thirty days to the saturnalia an otherwise unheardof period suspension of judgment seems prudent urbino vol i p golden bough iii analecta bollandiana xvi pp the precise position of a legatus like bassus is rather indistinct if an officer he need not have asked dasius what his profession was g b iii g b iii appendix c the ride of the beardless one mr frazers argument about the ride of the beardless one and the possible traces of a similar burlesque performance preluding to or succeeding the crucifixion is not easy to follow perhaps in the text i may have misconceived my authors meaning we know the ride of the beardless one in persia through the work of hyde published at oxford in and again in i condense hydes account as given by mr frazer the date of the festivity of the beardless one was the first day of the first month which in the most ancient persian calendar corresponds to march so that the date of the ceremony agrees with that of the babylonian new year festival of zakmuk in mr frazers third volume the sacaea synchronise with zakmuk though in his second volume the sacaea are of junejuly we shall suppose him in the present passage to adhere to the date of march for the sacaea the ride of the beardless one if so occurs at the sacaean date but hyde found that some persians regarded the ride of the beardless one as of recent institution if they were right it has no traceable connection with the ancient sacaea nor was there any mockking concerned in the ride of the beardless one and there was no probable sacred harlot still less were there two beardless ones with two sacred harlots as in mr frazers theory of the sacaea at all events hyde says no more about the sacred harlots than dio chrysostom or any other ancient author records in the case of the sacaea far from being attired as a king the beardless buffoon was led about naked on a horse mule or ass fanning himself and complaining of heat while people soused him in ice snow or cold water attended by the household of the king or governor he extorted contributions the goods seized between dawn and morning prayers fell to the governor or king what the buffoon took between the first and second prayers he kept and then he vanished the populace might beat him later if they caught him now if this holiday farce existed at the sacaea and at zakmuk during the time of the exile the jews could not borrow the sacaean custom of hanging a mockking for on mr frazers theory if i do not misunderstand it the ride of the beardless one came in after the serious meaning of the custom the hanging of the mockking had been forgotten the ride of the beardless one is a degenerate copy of the original of the sacaean whipping hanging and scourging a condemned criminal which had fallen out of use i presume lagarde is not of that opinion he thinks that the author of the book of esther knew and combined the colours of the persian magophonia the sacaea and the ride of the beardless in fact dio chrysostom does not tell us that the sacaean mockking rode whether naked or in splendour through the city nor that he made a forced collection which he was not allowed to live to enjoy these things may have occurred but no record proves them yet mr frazer has provisionally to conjecture that the sacaean victim had a ride of honour and made a collection and that our lord enjoyed the same privileges the description of his last triumphal ride into jerusalem reads almost like an echo of that brilliant progress through the streets of susa which haman aspired to and mordecai accomplished our lord does not appear to have been either naked like the beardless one or clad in splendour like mordecai or crowned and robed or attended by the menatarms of pilate or herod he borrowed an ass with her colt and the multitude strewed branches and cried hosanna to the son of david he then overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple a raid as mr frazer says but it is not on record that he seized any property and his motive has been regarded as an objection to commercial transactions in a sacred edifice it may seem a little arbitrary to connect these acts of christ not with what the sacaean victim to our knowledge ever did but with what was done by the beardless buffoon his degenerate copy we have first to guess that the sacaean mockking acted like him whom we have to guess to be his late degenerate copy and then to read into the gospels an idea derived from accounts of the ancient or modern buffoon moreover while christ represents the mockking of the sacaea in the high tragedy of the ancient ceremony for he is put to death his counterpart barabbas has a conjectural ride which is mere farce like that of the beardless buffoon now mr frazer says that after the serious meaning of the sacaean custom had been forgotten and the substitute was allowed to escape with his fife the high tragedy of the ancient ceremony would rapidly degenerate into farce the degeneration was rapid indeed in the twinkling of an eye christ was not allowed to escape with his life the high tragedy of the ancient ceremony existed in his case but instantly the high tragedy was forgotten barabbas christs counterpart in mr frazers theory may very well have been going about the streets rigged out in tawdry splendour with a tinsel crown on his head and a sham sceptre in his hand preceded and followed by all the tagrag and bobtail of the town hooting jeering and breaking coarse jests at his expense while some pretended to salute his mock majesty and others belaboured the donkey on which he rode it was in this fashion probably that in persia the beardless and oneeyed man made his undignified progress through the town to the delight of ragamuffins and the terror of shopkeepers whose goods he confiscated if they did not hasten to lay their peaceofferings at his feet all this as to barabbas implies that the high tragedy of the sacaea was already lost in the farce of the degenerate copy the ride of the beardless if so why did christ lose his life if he died solemnly as a recognised god which mr frazer seems to me to deny in iii and asserts in iii why is his no less sacred counterpart barabbas also and simultaneously a counterpart of the beardless buffoon either the whole affair was solemn and tragic the haman christ and the mordecai barabbas being recognised as divine or the whole affair was farce and in neither christ nor barabbas was there any recognised divinity mr frazer makes the belief in the divinity of christ depend on the contemporary recognition of the godhead of the sacaean victim whose male issue was also perhaps recognised as divine but he also assures us that the divinity of the sacaean victim must have been forgotten in the same way christ as victim was recognised as divine and so necessarily was his counterpart barabbas whether in sober fact or pious fiction the barabbas or son of that divine father who generously gave his own son to die for the world yet this son of the divine father was so remote from sacred that just three pages before his sonhood is asserted we have a picture of him riding about on a donkey among the jeers of the tagrag and bobtail it is difficult to accept both of the theories not very selfconsistent in my humble opinion which mr frazer seems able to hold simultaneously or alternately if barabbas rode a donkey amid the jeers of the ragamuffins then christ had no triumphal entry into jerusalem he too had merely a burlesque ride if barabbas had a burlesque ride as mr frazer thinks probable by the essence of his theory christ and barabbas were counterparts both were divine or neither was divine in general opinion if barabbas was a personage in a low farce as mr frazer supposes so was christ and no halo of divinity can accrue from taking part in a burlesque which cannot also be a high tragedy with divine actors as if difficulties were never to cease the beardless buffoon is a degenerate copy of the sacaean victim but while he was a proxy for the king and also a representative of humman or marduk or tammuz or gilgamesh or eabani or a god not yet identified in his popular form as the beardless buffoon his pretence of suffering from heat and his final disappearance suggest that if he personified either of the seasons it was the departing winter rather than the coming summer if so was the buffoon of the popular ceremony the folklore original of the sacaean mockking or was he a degenerate copy of that versatile victim with a new meaning popularly assigned to him we are to recognise in him the familiar features of the mock or temporary king though he has neither crown sceptre robes nor aught to cover his nakedness if he is not the popular original of the mockking of the sacaea how does he and how does his magic put us in a position finally to unmask the leading personages in the book of esther if he is a new popular interpretation of the sacaean mockking a misconstrued survival he cannot help to explain the sacaea or esther especially if as a player in a farce which was a mitigation of the sacaea he had not come into existence when esther was written but if the beardless buffoon represents the popular germ of the sacaean victim then that victim was originally neither the kings proxy nor tammuz nor marduk nor gilgamesh nor eabani but perhaps the departing winter he can only serve the theory in that capacity if provided with a counterpart to represent the coming summer while he and his counterpart both have female mates of whom there is not a ghost of a trace in our authorities whether in the instance of the sacaea the ride of the beardless or the crucifixion nobody says that there were two beardless buffoons yet there is just as much evidence for them as for the conjectural two sacred characters with two sacred harlots at the sacaea we must avoid the multiplicatio entium praeter necessitatem g b iii g b iii g b iii g b iii g b iii
