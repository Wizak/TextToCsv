 contents the flight of the horse leviathan bird in the hand theres a wolf in my time machine death in a cage flash crowd what good is a glass dagger afterword the flight of the horse the year was aa or ad approximately hanville svetz stepped out of the extension cage and looked about him to svetz the atomic bomb was eleven hundred years old and the horse was a thousand years dead it was his first trip into the past his training didnt count it had not included actual timetravel which cost several million commercials a shot svetz was groggy from the peculiar gravitational sideeffects of timetravel he was high on preindustrialage air and drunk on his own sense of destiny while at the same time he was not really convinced that he had gone anywhere or anywhen trade joke he was not carrying the anesthetic rifle he had come to get a horse he had not expected to meet one at the door how big was a horse where were horses found consider what the institute had had to go on a few pictures in a salvaged childrens book and an old legend not to be trusted that the horse had once been used as a kind of animated vehicle in an empty land beneath an overcast sky svetz braced himself with one hand on the curved flank of the extension cage his head was spinning it took him several seconds to realize that he was looking at a horse it stood fifteen yards away regarding svetz with large intelligent brown eyes it was much larger than he had expected further the horse in the picture book had had a glossy brown pelt with a short mane while the beast now facing svetz was pure white with a mane that flowed like a womans long hair there were other differences but no matter the beast matched the book too well to be anything but a horse to svetz it seemed that the horse watched him waited for him to realize what was happening then while svetz wasted more time wondering why he wasnt holding a rifle the horse laughed turned and departed it disappeared with astonishing speed svetz began to shiver nobody had warned him that the horse might have been sentient yet the beasts mocking laugh had sounded far too human now he knew he was deep deep in the past not even the horse was as convincing as the emptiness the horse had left behind no reaching apartment towers clawed the horizon no contrails scratched the sky the world was trees and flowers and rolling grassland innocent of men the silence it was as if svetz had gone deaf he had heard no sound since the laughter of the horse in the year post atomic such silence could have been found nowhere on earth listening svetz knew at last that he had reached the british isles before the coming of civilization he had traveled in time the extension cage was the part of the time machine that did the traveling it had its own air supply and needed it while being pushed through time but not here not before civilizations dawn not when the air had never been polluted by fission wastes and the combustion of coal hydrocarbons tobaccos wood et al now retreating in panic from that world of the past to the world of the extension cage svetz nonetheless left the door open behind him he felt better inside the cage outside was an unexplored planet made dangerous by ignorance inside the cage it was no different from a training mission svetz had spent hundreds of hours in a detailed mockup of this cage with a computer running the dials there had even been artificial gravity to simulate the peculiar sideeffects of motion in time by now the horse would have escaped but he now knew its size and he knew there were horses in the area to business then svetz took the anesthetic rifle from where it was clamped to the wall he loaded it with what he guessed was the right size of soluble crystalline anesthetic needle the box held several different sizes the smallest of which would knock a shrew harmlessly unconscious the largest of which would do the same for an elephant he slung the rifle and stood up the world turned grey svetz caught a wall clamp to stop himself from falling the cage had stopped moving twenty minutes ago he shouldnt still be dizzybut it had been a long trip never before had the institute for temporal research pushed a cage beyond zero pa a long trip and a strange one with gravity pulling svetzs mass uniformly toward svetzs navel when his head cleared he turned to where other equipment was clamped to a wall the flight stick was a liftfield generator and power source built into five feet of pole with a control ring at one end a brush discharge at the other and a bucket seat and seat belt in the middle compact even for svetzs age the flight stick was spinoff from the spaceflight industries but it still weighed thirty pounds with the motor off getting it out of the clamps took all his strength svetz felt queasy very queasy he bent to pick up the flight stick and abruptly realized that he was about to faint he hit the door button and fainted we dont know where on earth youll wind up ra chen had told him ra chen was the director of the institute for temporal research a large round man with gross exaggerated features and a permanent air of disapproval thats because we cant focus on a particular time of dayor on a particular year for that matter you wont appear underground or inside anything because of energy considerations if you come out a thousand feet in the air the cage wont fall itll settle slowly using up energy with a profligate disregard for our budget and svetz had dreamed that night vividly over and over his extension cage appeared inside solid rock exploded with a roar and a blinding flash officially the horse is for the bureau of history ra chen had said in practice its for the secretarygeneral for his twentyeighth birthday mentally hes about six years old you know the royal familys getting a bit inbred these days we managed to send him a picture book we picked up in pa and now the lad wants a horse svetz had seen himself being shot for treason for the crime of listening to such talk otherwise wed never have gotten the appropriation for this trip its in a good cause well do some cloning from the horse before we send the original to the un thenwell genes are a code and codes can be broken get us a male and well make all the horses anyone could want but why would anyone want even one horse svetz had studied a computer duplicate of the childs picture book that an agent had pulled from a ruined house a thousand years ago the horse did not impress him ra chen however terrified him weve never sent anyone this far back ra chen had told him the night before the mission when it was too late to back out with honor keep that in mind if something goes wrong dont count on the rule book dont count on your instruments use your head your head svetz god knows its little enough to depend on svetz had not slept in the hours before departure youre scared stiff ra chen commented just before svetz entered the extension cage and you can hide it svetz i think im the only one whos noticed thats why i picked you because you can be terrified and go ahead anyway dont come back without a horse the directors voice grew louder not without a horse svetz your head svetz your head svetz sat up convulsively the air slow death if he didnt close the door but the door was closed and svetz was sitting on the floor holding his head which hurt the air system had been transplanted complete with dials intact from a martian sandboat the dials read normally of course since the cage was sealed svetz nerved himself to open the door as the sweet rich air of twelfthcentury britain rushed in svetz held his breath and watched the dials change presently he closed the door and waited sweating while the air system replaced the heady poison with its own safe breathable mixture when next he left the extension cage carrying the flight stick svetz was wearing another spinoff from the interstellarexploration industries it was a balloon and he wore it over his head it was also a selectively permeable membrane intended to pass certain gasses in and others out to make a breathingair mixture inside it was nearly invisible except at the rim there where light was refracted most severely the balloon showed as a narrow golden circle enclosing svetzs head the effect was not unlike a halo as shown in medieval paintings but svetz didnt know about medieval paintings he wore also a simple white robe undecorated constricted at the waist otherwise falling in loose folds the institute thought that such a garment was least likely to violate taboos of sex or custom the trade kit dangled loose from his sash a heatandpressure gadget a pouch of corundum small phials of additives for color lastly he wore a hurt and baffled look how was it that he could not breath the clean air of his own past the air of the cage was the air of svetzs own time and was nearly four percent carbon dioxide the air of ante atomic held barely a tenth of that man was a rare animal here and now he had breathed little air he had destroyed few forests he had burnt scant fuel since the dawn of time but industrial civilization meant combustion combustion meant carbon dioxide thickening in the atmosphere many times faster than the green plants could turn it back to oxygen svetz was at the far end of two thousand years of adaptation to air rich in co it takes a concentration of carbon dioxide to trigger the autonomic nerves in the lymph glands in a mans left armpit svetz had fainted because he wasnt breathing so now he wore a balloon and felt rejected he straddled the flight stick and twisted the control knob on the fore end the stick lifted under him and he wriggled into place on the bucket seat he twisted the knob further he drifted upward like a toy balloon he floated over a lovely land green and untenanted beneath a pearlgrey sky empty of contrails presently he found a crumbling wall he turned to follow it he would follow the wall until he found a settlement if the old legend was trueand svetz reflected the horse had certainly been big enough to drag a vehiclethen he would find horses wherever he found men presently it became obvious that a road ran along the wall there the dirt was flat and bare and consistently wide enough for a walking man whereas elsewhere the land rose and dipped and tilted hard dirt did not a freeway make but svetz got the point he followed the road floating at a height of ten meters there was a man in worn brown garments hooded and barefoot he walked the road with patient exhaustion propping himself with a staff his back was to svetz svetz thought to dip toward him to ask concerning horses he refrained with no way to know where the cage would alight he had learned no ancient languages at all he thought of the trade kit he carried intended not for communication but instead of communication it had never been fieldtested in any case it was not for casual encounters the pouch of corundum was too small svetz heard a yell from below he looked down in time to see the man in brown running like the wind his staff forgotten his fatigue likewise something scared him svetz decided but he could see nothing fearful something small but deadly then the institute estimated that man had exterminated more than a thousand species of mammal and bird and insectsome casually some with malicebetween now and the distant present in this time and place there was no telling what might be a threat svetz shuddered the brown man with the hairy face might well have run from a stinging thing destined to kill hanville svetz impatiently svetz upped the speed of his flight stick the mission was taking far too long who would have guessed that centers of population would have been so far apart half an hour later shielded from the wind by a paraboloid forcefield svetz was streaking down the road at sixty miles per hour his luck had been incredibly bad wherever he had chanced across a human being that person had been just leaving the vicinity and he had found no centers of population once he had noticed an unnatural stone outcropping high on a hill no law of geology known to svetz could have produced such an angular flatsided monstrosity curious he had circled above itand had abruptly realized that the thing was hollow riddled with rectangular holes a dwelling for men he didnt want to believe it living within the hollows of such a thing would be like living underground but men tend to build at right angles and this thing was all right angles below the hollowed stone structure were rounded hairylooking hummocks of dried grass each with a mansized door obviously they must be nests for very large insects svetz had left that place quickly the road rounded a swelling green hill ahead of him svetz followed slowing a hilltop spring sent a stream bubbling down hill to break the road something large was drinking at the stream svetz jerked to a stop in midair open water deadly poison he would have been hard put to say which had startled him more the horse or the fact that it had just committed suicide the horse looked up and saw him it was the same horse white as milk with a flowing abundance of snowy mane and tail it almost had to be the horse that had laughed at svetz and run svetz recognized the malignance in its eyes in the moment before it turned its back but how could it have arrived so fast svetz was reaching for the gun when the situation turned upside down the girl was young surely no more than sixteen her hair was long and dark and plaited in complex fashion her dress of strangely stiff blue fabric reached from her neck to her ankles she was seated in the shadow of a tree on dark cloth spread over the dark earth svetz had not noticed her might never have noticed her but the horse walked up to her folded its legs in alternate pairs and laid its ferocious head in her lap the girl had not yet seen svetz xenophilia svetz snarled the worst word he could think of svetz hated aliens the horse obviously belonged to the girl he could not simply shoot it and take it it would have to be purchased somehow he needed time to think and there was no time for the girl might look up at any moment baleful brown eyes watched him as he dithered he dared waste no more time searching the countryside for a wild horse there was an uncertainty a finagle factor in the math of timetravel it manifested itself as an uncertainty in the energy of a returning extension cage and it increased with time let svetz linger too long and he could be roasted alive in the returning cage moreover the horse had drunk open water it would die and soon unless svetz could return it to post atomic thus the beasts removal from this time could not change the history of svetzs own world it was a good choice if he could conquer his fear of the beast the horse was tame young and slight as she was the girl had no trouble controlling it what was there to fear but there was its natural weaponry of which ra chens treacherous picture book had shown no sign svetz surmised that later generations routinely removed it before the animals were old enough to be dangerous he should have come a few centuries later and there was the look in its eye the horse hated svetz and it knew svetz was afraid could he shoot it from ambush no the girl would worry if her pet collapsed without reason she would be unable to concentrate on what svetz was trying to tell her he would have to work with the animal watching him if the girl couldnt control itor if lie lost her trustsvetz had little doubt that the horse would kill him the horse looked up as svetz approached but made no other move the girl watched too her eyes round with wonder she called something that must have been a question svetz smiled back and continued his approach he was a foot above the ground and gliding at dead slow riding the worlds only flying machine he looked impressive as all hell and knew it the girl did not smile back she watched warily svetz was within yards of her when she scrambled to her feet he stopped the flight stick at once and let it settle smiling placatorially he removed the heatandpressure device from his sash he moved with care the girl was on the verge of running the trade kit was a pouch of corundum a several phials of additives and the heatandpressure gadget svetz poured corundum into the chamber added a dash of chromic oxide and used the plunger the cylinder grew warm presently svetz dropped a pigeonsblood star ruby into his hand rolled it in his fingers held it to the sun it was red as dark blood with a blazing white sixpointed star it was almost too hot to hold stupid svetz held his smile rigid ra chen should have warned him what would she think when she felt the gems unnatural heat what trickery would she suspect but he had to chance it the trade kit was all he had he bent and rolled the gem to her across the damp ground she stooped to pick it up one hand remained on the horses neck calming it svetz noticed the rings of yellow metal around her wrist and he also noticed the dirt she held the gem high looked into its deep red fire ooooh she breathed she smiled at svetz in wonder and delight svetz smiled back moved two steps nearer and rolled her a yellow sapphire how had he twice chanced on the same horse svetz never knew but he soon knew how it had arrived before him he had given the girl three gems he held three more in his hand while he beckoned her onto the flight stick she shook her head she would not go instead she mounted the animal she and the horse they watched svetz for his next move svetz capitulated he had expected the horse to follow the girl while the girl rode behind him on the flight stick but if they both followed svetz it would be the same the horse stayed to one side and a little behind svetzs flight stick it did not seem inconvenienced by the girls weight why should it be it must have been bred for the task svetz notched his speed higher to find how fast he could conveniently move faster he flew and faster the horse must have a limit he was up to eight before he quit the girl lay flat along the animals back hugging its neck to protect her face from the wind but the horse ran on daring svetz with its eyes how to describe such motion svetz had never seen ballet he knew how machinery moved and this wasnt it all he could think of was a man and a woman making love slipperysmooth rhythmic motion absolute singleminded purpose motion for the pleasure of motion it was terrible in its beauty the flight of the horse the word for such running must have died with the horse itself the horse would never have tired but the girl did she tugged on the animals mane and it stopped svetz gave her the jewels he held made four more and gave her one she was crying from the wind crying and smiling as she took the jewels was she smiling for the jewels or for the joy of the ride exhausted panting she lay with her back against the warm pulsing flank of the resting animal only her hand moved as she ran her fingers repeatedly through its silver mane the horse watched svetz with malevolent brown eyes the girl was homely it wasnt just the jarring lack of makeup there was evidence of vitamin starvation she was short less than five feet in height and thin there were marks of childhood disease but happiness glowed behind her homely face and it make her almost passable as she clutched the corundum stones when she seemed rested svetz remounted they went on he was almost out of corundum when they reached the extension cage there it was that he ran into trouble the girl had been awed by svetzs jewels and by svetz himself possibly because of his height or his ability to fly but the extension cage scared her svetz couldnt blame her the side with the door in it was no trouble just a seamless spherical mirror but the other side blurred away in a direction men could not visualize it had scared svetz spitless the first time he saw the time machine in action he could buy the horse from her shoot it here and pull it inside using the flight stick to float it but it would be so much easier if it was worth a try svetz used the rest of his corundum then he walked into the extension cage leaving a trail of colored corundum beads behind him he had worried because the heatandpressure device would not produce facets the stones all came out shaped like miniature hens eggs but he was able to vary the color using chromic oxide for red and ferric oxide for yellow and titanium for blue and he could vary the pressure planes to produce cats eyes or star gems at will he left a trail of small stones red and yellow and blue and the girl followed frightened but unable to resist the bait by now she had nearly filled a handkerchief with the stones the horse followed her into the extension cage inside she looked at the four stones in svetzs hand one of each color red and yellow and light blue and black the largest he could make he pointed to the horse then to the stones the girl agonized svetz perspired she didnt want to give up the horse and svetz was out of corundum she nodded one swift jerk of her chin quickly before she could change her mind svetz poured the stones into her hand she clutched the hoard to her bosom and ran out of the cage sobbing the horse stood up to follow svetz swung the rifle and shot it a bead of blood appeared on the animals neck it shied back then sighted on svetz along its natural bayonet poor kid svetz thought as he turned to the door but shed have lost the horse anyway it had sucked polluted water from an open stream now he need only load the flight stick aboard motion caught his eye a false assumption can be deadly svetz had not waited for the horse to fall it was with something of a shock that he realized the truth the beast wasnt about to fall it was about to spear him like a cocktail shrimp he hit the door button and dodged exquisitely graceful exquisitely sharp the spiral horn slammed into the closing door the animal turned like white lightning in the confines of the cage and again svetz leapt for his life the point missed him by half an inch it plunged past him and into the control board through the plastic panel and into the wiring beneath something sparkled and something sputtered the horse was taking careful aim sighting along the spear in its forehead svetz did the only thing he could think of he pulled the homeagain lever the horse screamed as it went into free fall the horn intended for svetzs navel ripped past his ear and tore his breathingballoon wide open then gravity returned but it was the peculiar gravity of an extension cage moving forward through time svetz and the horse were pulled against the padded walls svetz sighed in relief he sniffed again in disbelief the smell was strong and strange like nothing svetz had ever smelled before the animals terrible horn must have damaged the air plant very likely he was breathing poison if the cage didnt return in time but would it return at all it might be going anywhere anywhen the way that ivory horn had smashed through anonymous wiring they might come out at the end of time when even the black infrasuns gave not enough heat to sustain life there might not even be a future to return to he had left the flight stick how would it be used what would they make of it with its control handle at one end and the brushstyle static discharge at the other and the saddle in the middle perhaps the girl would try to use it he could visualize her against the night sky in the light of a full moon and how would that change history the horse seemed on the verge of apoplexy its sides heaved its eyes rolled wildly probably it was the cabin air thick with carbon dioxide again it might be the poison the horse had sucked from an open stream gravity died svetz and the horse tumbled in free fall and the horse queasily tried to gore him gravity returned and svetz who was ready for it landed on top someone was already opening the door svetz took the distance in one bound the horse followed screaming with rage intent on murder two men went flying as it charged out into the institute control center it doesnt take anesthetics svetz shouted over his shoulder the animals agility was hampered here among the desks and lighted screens and it was probably drunk on hyperventilation it kept stumbling into desks and men svetz easily stayed ahead of the slashing horn a full panic was developing we couldnt have done it without zeera ra chen told him much later your idiot tanj horse had the whole center terrorized all of a sudden it went completely tame walked up to that frigid bitch zeera and let her lead it away did you get it to the hospital in time ra chen nodded gloomily gloom was his favorite expression and was no indication of his true feelings we found over fifty unknown varieties of bacteria in the beasts bloodstream yet it hardly looked sick it looked healthy as a healthy as a it must have tremendous stamina we managed to save not only the horse but most of the bacteria too for the zoo svetz was sitting up in a hospital bed with his arm up to the elbow in a diagnostician there was always the chance that he too had located some longextinct bacterium he shifted uncomfortably being careful not to move the wrong arm and asked did you ever find an anesthetic that worked nope sorry about that svetz we still dont know why your needles didnt work the tanj horse is simply immune to tranks of any kind incidentally there was nothing wrong with your air plant you were smelling the horse i wish id known that i thought i was dying its driving the internes crazy that smell and we cant seem to get it out of the center ra chen sat down on the edge of the bed what bothers me is the horn on its forehead the horse in the picture book had no horns no sir then it must be a different species its not really a horse svetz well have to send you back itll break our budget svetz i disagree sir dont be so tanj polite then dont be so tanj stupid sir svetz was not going back for another horse people who kept tame horses must have developed the habit of cutting off the horn when the animal was a pup why not we all saw how dangerous that horn is much too dangerous for a domestic animal then why does our horse have a horn thats why i thought it was wild the first time i saw it i suppose they didnt start cutting off horns until later in history ra chen nodded in gloomy satisfaction i thought so too our problem is that the secretarygeneral is just barely bright enough to notice that his horse has a horn and the picture book horse doesnt hes bound to blame me mmm svetz wasnt sure what was expected of him ill have to have the horn amputated somebodys bound to notice the scar said svetz tanj it youre right ive got enemies at court theyd be only too happy to claim id mutilated the secretarygenerals pet ra chen glared at svetz all right lets hear your idea svetz was busy regretting why had he spoken his vicious beautiful horse tamely docked of its killer horn he had found the thought repulsive his impulse had betrayed him what could they do but remove the horn he had it change the picture book not the horse a computer could duplicate the book in detail but with a horn on every horse use the center computer then wipe the tape afterward morosely thoughtful ra chen said that might work i know someone who could switch the books he looked up from under bushy black brows of course youd have to keep quiet yes sir dont forget ra chen got up when you get out of the diagnostician you start a four weeks vacation im sending you back for one of these ra chen told him four weeks later he opened the bestiary we picked up the book in a public park around ten post atomic left the kid who was holding it playing with a carborundum egg svetz examined the picture thats ugly thats really ugly youre trying to balance the horse right the horse was so beautiful youve got to have one of these or the universe goes off balance ra chen closed his eyes in pain just go get us the gila monster svetz the secretarygeneral wants a gila monster how big is it they both looked at the illustration there was no way to tell from the looks of it wed better use the big extension cage svetz barely made it back that time he was suffering from total exhaustion and extensive seconddegree burns the thing he brought back was thirty feet long had vestigial batlike wings breathed fire and didnt look very much like the illustration but it was as close as anything hed found the secretarygeneral loved it leviathon two men stood on one side of a thick glass wall youll be airborne svetzs beefy redfaced boss was saying we made some improvements in the small extension cage while you were in the hospital you can hover it or fly it at up to fifty miles per hour or let it fly itself theres a constantaltitude setting your field of vision is total weve made the shell of the extension cage completely transparent on the other side of the thick glass something was trying to kill them it was feet long from nose to tail and was equipped with vestigial batlike wings otherwise it was built something like a slender lizard it screamed and scratched at the glass with murderous claws the sign on the glass read gila monster retrieved from the year ante atomic approximately from the region of china earth extinct youll be well out of his reach said ra chen yes sir svetz stood with his arms folded about him as if he had a chill he was being sent after the biggest animal that had ever lived and svetz was afraid of animals for science sake what are you worried about svetz its only a big fish yes sir you said that about the gila monster its just an extinct lizard you said we had only a drawing in a childrens book to go by how could we know it would be so big the gila monster drew back from the glass it inhaled hugely and took aim yellowandorange flame spewed from its nostrils and played across the glass svetz squeaked and jumped for cover he cant get through said ra chen svetz picked himself up he was a slender smallboned man with pale skin lightblue eyes and very fine ashblond hair how could we know it would breathe fire he mimicked that lizard almost cremated me i spent four months in the hospital as it was and what really burns me is he looks less like the drawing every time i see him sometimes i wonder if i didnt get the wrong animal whats the difference svetz the secretarygeneral loved him thats what counts yes sir speaking of the secretarygeneral what does he want with a sperm whale hes got a horse hes got a gila monster thats a little complicated ra chen grimaced palace politics its always complicated right now svetz somewhere in the united nations palace a hundred different scientists are trying to get support each for his own project and every last one of them involves getting the attention of the secretarygeneral and holding it keeping his attention isnt easy svetz nodded everybody knew about the secretarygeneral the family that had ruled the united nations for years was somewhat inbred the secretarygeneral was years old he was a happy person he loved animals and flowers and pictures and people pictures of planets and multiple star systems made him clap his hands and coo with delight so the institute for space research shared amply in the united nations budget but he liked extinct animals too someone managed to convince the secretarygeneral that he wants the largest animal on earth the idea may have been to take us down a peg or two said ra chen someone may think were getting too big a share of the budget by the time i got onto it the secretarygeneral wanted a brontosaurus wed never have gotten him that no extension cage will reach that far was it your idea to get him a whale sir yeah it wasnt easy to persuade him whales have been extinct for so long that we dont even have pictures all i had to show him was a crystal sculpture from archaeologydug out of the steuben glass buildingand a bible and a dictionary i managed to convince him that leviathan and the sperm whale were one and the same thats not strictly true svetz had read a computerproduced condensation of the bible the condensation had ruined the plot in svetzs opinion leviathan could be anything big and destructive even a horde of locusts thank science you werent there to help svetz the issue was confused enough anyway i promised the secretarygeneral the largest animal that ever lived on earth all the literature says that that animal was a whale and there were spermwhale herds all over the oceans as recently as the first century anteatomic you shouldnt have any trouble finding one in twenty minutes ra chen looked startled what if i try to keep the big extension cage in the past for more than twenty minutes ill never be able to bring it home the i know that uncertainty factor in the energy constants svetz will blow the institute right off the map we thought of that svetz youll go back in the small extension cage when you find a whale youll signal the big extension cage signal it how weve found a way to send a simple onoff pulse through time lets go back to the institute and ill show you malevolent golden eyes watched them through the glass as they walked away the small extension cage was the part of the time machine that did the moving within its transparent shell svetz seemed to ride a flying armchair equipped with an airplane passengers lunch tray except that the lunch tray was covered with lights and buttons and knobs and crawling green lines he was somewhere off the east coast of north america in or around the year anteatomic or anno domini the temporalprecession gauge was not particularly accurate svetz skimmed low over water the color of lead beneath a sky the color of slate but for the rise and fall of the sea he might almost have been suspended in an enormous sphere painted half light half dark he let the extension cage fly itself feet above the water while he watched the needle on the nai the nervous activities indicator hunting leviathan his stomach was uneasy svetz had thought he was adjusting to the peculiar gravitational side effects of time travel but apparently not at least he would not be here long on this trip he was not looking for a mere foot gila monster now he hunted the largest animal that had ever lived a most conspicuous beast and now he had a lifeseeking instrument the nai the needle twitched violently was it a whale but the needle was trembling in apparent indecision a cluster of sources then svetz looked in the direction indicated a clipper ship winged with white sail long and slender and graceful as hell crowded too svetz guessed many humans closely packed would affect the nai in just that manner a sperm whalea single center of complex nervous activitywould attract the needle as violently without making it jerk about like that the ship would interfere with reception svetz turned east and away but not without regret the ship was beautiful the uneasiness in svetzs belly was getting worse not better endless graygreen water rising and falling beneath his flying armchair enlightenment came like something clicking in his head seasick on automatic the extension cage matched its motion to that of the surface over which it flew and that surface was heaving in great dark swells no wonder his stomach was uneasy svetz grinned and reached for the manual controls the nai needle suddenly jerked hard over a bite thought svetz and he looked off to the right no sign of a ship and submarines hadnt been invented yet had they no of course they hadnt the needle was rocksteady svetz flipped the call button the source of the tremendous nai signal was off to his right and moving svetz turned to follow it it would be minutes before the call signal reached the institute for temporal research and brought the big extension cage with its weaponry for hooking leviathan many years ago ra chen had dreamed of rescuing the library at alexandria from caesars fire for this purpose he had built the big extension cage its door was a gaping iris big enough to be loaded while the library was actually burning its hold at a guess was at least twice large enough to hold all the scrolls in that ancient library the big cage had cost a fortune in government money it had failed to go back beyond aa or ad the books burned at alexandria were still lost to history or at least to historians such a boondoggle would have broken other men somehow ra chen had survived the blow to his reputation he had pointed out the changes to svetz after they returned from the zoo weve fitted the cage out with heavyduty stunners and antigravity beams youll operate them by remote control be careful not to let the stun beam touch you it would kill even a sperm whale if you held it on him for more than a few seconds and itd kill a man instantly other than that you should have no problems it was at that moment that svetzs stomach began to hurt our major change is the call button it will actually send us a signal through time so that we can send the big extension cage back to you we can land it right beside you no more than a few minutes off that took considerable research svetz the treasury raised our budget for this year so that we could get that whale svetz nodded just be sure youve got a whale before you call for the big extension cage now years earlier svetz followed an underwater source of nervous impulse the signal was intensely powerful it could not be anything smaller than an adult bull sperm whale a shadow formed in the air to his right svetz watched it take shape a great grayblue sphere floating beside him around the rim of the door were antigravity beamers and heavyduty stun guns the opposite side of the sphere wasnt there it simply faded away to svetz that was the most frightening thing about any time machine the way it seemed to turn a corner that wasnt there svetz was almost over the signal now he used the remote controls to swing the antigravity beamers around and down he had them locked on the source he switched them on and dials surged leviathan was heavy more massive than svetz had expected he upped the power and watched the nai needle swing as leviathan rose invisibly through the water where the surface of the water bulged upward under the attack of the antigravity beams a shadow formed leviathan rising was there something wrong with the shape then a trembling spherical bubble of water rose shivering from the ocean and leviathan was within it partly within it he was too big to fit though he should not have been he was four times as massive as a sperm whale should have been and a dozen times as long he looked nothing like the crystal steuben sculpture leviathan was a kind of serpent armored with redbronze scales as big as a vikings shield armed with teeth like ivory spears his triangular jaws gaped wide as he floated toward svetz he writhed seeking with his bulging yellow eyes for whatever strange enemy had subjected him to this indignity svetz was paralyzed with fear and indecision neither then nor later did he doubt that what he saw was the biblical leviathan this had to be the largest beast that had ever roamed the sea a beast large enough and fierce enough to be synonymous with anything big and destructive yetif the crystal sculpture was anything like representational this was not a sperm whale at all in any case he was far too big for the extension cage indecision stayed his handand then svetz stopped thinking entirely as the great slitted irises found him the beast was floating past him around its waist was a sphere of weightless water that shrank steadily as gobbets dripped away and rained back to the sea the beasts nostrils flaredit was obviously an air breather though not a cetacean it stretched reaching for svetz with gaping jaws teeth like scores of elephants tusks all in a row polished and needlesharp svetz saw them close about him from above and below while he sat frozen in fear at the last moment he shut his eyes tight when death did not come svetz opened his eyes the jaws had not entirely closed on svetz and his armchair he heard them grinding faintly againstagainst the invisible surface of the extension cage whose existence svetz had forgotten entirely svetz resumed breathing he would return home with an empty extension cage to face the wrath of ra chena fate better than death he moved his fingers to cut the antigravity beams from the big extension cage metal whined against metal svetz whiffed hot oil while red lights blinked on all over his lunchtray control board he hastily turned the beams on again the red lights blinked out one by reluctant one through the transparent shell svetz could hear the grinding of teeth leviathan was trying to chew his way into the extension cage his released weight had nearly torn the cage loose from the rest of the time machine svetz would have been stranded in the past miles out to sea in a broken extension cage that probably wouldnt float with an angry sea monster waiting to snap him up no he couldnt turn off the antigravity beamers but the beamers were on the big extension cage and he couldnt hold it more than about minutes longer when the big cage was gone what would prevent leviathan from pulling him to his doom ill stun him off said svetz there was darkred palate above him and red gums and forking tongue beneath and the long curved fangs all around but between the two rows of teeth svetz could see the big extension cage and the battery of stunners around the door by eye he rotated the stunners until they pointed straight toward leviathan i must be out of my mind said svetz and he spun the stunners away from him he couldnt fire them at leviathan without hitting himself and leviathan wouldnt let go trapped no he thought with a burst of relief he could escape with his life the gohome lever would send his small extension cage out from between the jaws of leviathan back into the time stream back to the institute his mission had failed but that was hardly his fault why had ra chen been unable to uncover mention of a sea serpent bigger than a sperm whale its all his fault said svetz and he reached for the gohome lever but he stayed his hand i cant just tell him so he said for ra chen terrified him the grinding of teeth came through the extension cage hate to just quit said svetz think ill try something he could see the antigravity beamers by looking between the teeth he could feel their influence so nearly were they focused on the extension cage itself if he focused them just on himself he felt the change he felt both strong and lightheaded like a drunken ballet master and if he now narrowed the focus the monsters teeth seemed to grind harder svetz looked between them as best he could leviathan was no longer floating he was hanging straight down from the extension cage hanging by his teeth the antigravity beamers still balanced the pull of his mass but now they did so by pulling straight up on the extension cage the monster was in obvious distress naturally a water beast he was supporting his own mass for the first time in his life and by his teeth his yellow eyes rolled frantically his tail twitched slightly at the very tip and still he clung let go said svetz let go you monster the monsters teeth slid screeching down the transparent surface and he fell svetz cut the antigravity a fraction of a second late he smelled burnt oil and there were tiny red lights blinking off one by one on his lunchtray control board leviathan hit the water with a sound of thunder his long sinuous body rolled over and floated to the surface and lay as if dead but his tail flicked once and svetz knew that he was alive i could kill you said svetz hold the stunners on you until youre dead theres time but he still had ten minutes to search for a sperm whale it wasnt time enough it didnt begin to be time enough but if he used it all the sea serpent flicked its tail and began to swim away once he rolled to look at svetz and his jaws opened wide in fury he finished his roll and was fleeing again just a minute svetz said thickly just a scienceperverting minute there and he swung the stunners to focus gravity behaved strangely inside an extension cage while the cage was moving forward in time down was all directions outward from the center of the cage svetz was plastered against the curved wall he waited for the trip to end seasickness was nothing compared with the motion sickness of time travel free fall then normal gravity svetz moved unsteadily to the door ra chen was waiting to help him out did you get it leviathan no sir svetz looked past his boss wheres the big extension cage were bringing it back slowly to minimize the gravitational side effects but if you dont have the whale i said i dont have leviathan well just what do you have ra chen demanded somewhat later he said it wasnt later yet he said you killed him why svetz pure spite no sir it was the most intelligent thing i did during the entire trip but why never mind svetz heres the big extension cage a grayblue shadow congealed in the hollow cradle of the time machine and there does seem to be something in it hi you idiots throw an antigravity beam inside the cage do you want the beast crushed the cage had arrived ra chen waved an arm in signal the door opened something tremendous hovered within the big extension cage it looked like a malevolent white mountain in there peering back at its captors with a single tiny angry eye it was trying to get at ra chen but it couldnt swim in air its other eye was only a torn socket one of its flippers was ripped along the trailing edge rips and ridges and puckers of scar tissue and a forest of broken wood and broken steel marked its tremendous expanse of albino skin lines trailed from many of the broken harpoons high up on one flank bound to the beast by broken and tangled lines was the corpse of a bearded man with one leg hardly in mint condition is he ra chen observed be careful sir hes a killer i saw him ram a sailing ship and sink it clean before i could focus the stunners on him what amazes me is that you found him at all in the time you had left svetz i do not understand your luck or am i missing something it wasnt luck sir it was the most intelligent thing i did the entire trip you said that before about killing leviathan svetz hurried to explain the sea serpent was just leaving the vicinity i wanted to kill him but i knew i didnt have the time i was about to leave myself when he turned back and bared his teeth he was an obvious carnivore those teeth were built strictly for killing sir i should have noticed earlier and i could think of only one animal big enough to feed a carnivore that size ahhh brilliant svetz there was corroborative evidence our research never found any mention of giant sea serpents the great geological surveys of the first century postatomic should have turned up something why didnt they because the sea serpent quietly died out two centuries earlier after whalers killed off his food supply svetz colored exactly so i turned the stunners on leviathan before he could swim away and i kept the stunners on him until the nai said he was dead i reasoned that if leviathan was there there must be whales in the vicinity and leviathans nervous output was masking the signal sure enough it was the moment he was dead the nai registered another signal i followed it tosvetz jerked his head they were floating the whale out of the extension cage to him days later two men stood on one side of a thick glass wall we took some clones from him then passed him on to the secretarygenerals vivarium said ra chen pity you had to settle for an albino he waved aside svetzs protest i know i know you were pressed for time beyond the glass the oneeyed whale glared at svetz through murky sea water surgeons had removed most of the harpoons but scars remained along his flanks and svetz awed wondered how long the beast had been at war with man centuries how long did sperm whales live ra chen lowered his voice wed all be in trouble if the secretarygeneral found out that there was once a bigger animal than this you understand that dont you svetz yes sir good ra chens gaze swept across another glass wall and a firebreathing gila monster farther down a horse looked back at him along the dangerous spiral horn in its forehead always we find the unexpected said ra chen sometimes i wonder if youd do your research better svetz thought did you know that time travel wasnt even a concept until the first century anteatomic a writer invented it from then until the fourth century postatomic time travel was pure fantasy it violates everything the scientists thought were natural laws logic conservation of matter and energy momentum reaction any law of motion that makes time a part of the statement relativity it strikes me said ra chen that every time we push an extension cage past that particular fivecentury period we shove it into a world that isnt really natural thats why you keep finding giant sea serpents and firebreathing thats nonsense said svetz he was afraid of his boss yes but there were limits youre right ra chen said instantly almost with relief take a months vacation svetz then back to work the secretary general wants a bird a bird svetz smiled a bird sounded harmless enough i suppose he found it in another childrens book thats right ever hear of a roc bird in the hand its not a roc said ra chen the bird looked stupidly back at them from behind a thick glass wall its wings were small and underdeveloped its legs and feet were tremendous ludicrous it weighed three hundred pounds and stood nearly eight feet tall other than that it looked a lot like a baby chick it kicked me svetz complained a slender small boned man he stood stiffly this day with a slight list to port it kicked me in the side and broke four ribs i barely made it back to the extension cage it still isnt a roc sorry about that svetz we did some research in the history section of the beverly hills library while you were in the hospital the roc was only a legend but look at it svetzs beefy redfaced boss nodded thats probably what started the legend early explorers in australia saw these ostriches wandering about they said to themselves if the chicks are this size what are the adults like then they went home and told stories about the adults i got my ribs caved in for a flightless bird cheer up svetz its not a total loss the ostrich was extinct it makes a fine addition to the secretarygenerals vivarium but the secretarygeneral wanted a roc what are you going to tell him ra chen scowled its worse than that do you know what the secretarygeneral wants now people meeting ra chen for the first time thought he was constanfly scowling until they saw his scowl svetz had suspected ra chen was worried now he knew it the secretarygeneral was everybodys problem a recessive gene inherited from his powerful inbred family had left him with the intelligence of a sixyearold child another kind of inheritance had made him overlord of the earth and its colonies his whim was law throughout the explored universe whatever the secretarygeneral wanted now it was vital that he get it some idiot took him diving in los angeles ra chen said now he insists on seeing the city before it sank that doesnt sound too bad it wouldnt be if it had stopped there some of his circle of advisors noticed his interest and they got him historical tapes on los angeles he loved it he wants to join the first watts riot svetz gulped that should raise some security problems the secretarygeneral is as close to being pure caucasian as makes no difference the ostrich cocked its head to one side studying them it still looked like the tremendous chick of an even bigger bird svetz could imagine that it had just cracked its way out of an egg the size of a bungalow im going to have a headache he said why do you tell me these things you know i have no head for politics can you imagine what would happen if we caused the death of the secretarygeneral already there are powerful factions that would like to see the institute for temporal research disbanded space for instance theyd love to swallow us up but what can we do we cant turn down a direct request from the secretarygeneral we can distract him they had lowered their voices to conspiratorial whispers now they turned away from the ostrich and strolled casually down the line of glass cages how i dont know yet if i could only get to his nurse ra chen said between his teeth ive tried hard enough maybe the isr has bought her maybe shes loyal shes been with him thirtyeight years how do i know what would catch the attention of the secretarygeneral ive only met him four times on formal occasions i do know his attention span is low if we could distract him with a new toy hed forget about los angeles the cage they were passing was labeled elephant retrieved from the year ante atomic approximately from the region of india earth extinct the wrinkled gray beast watched them go by with sleepy indifference he had not been captured by svetz but svetz had captured almost half of the animals here including several whose tanks were half full of water svetz was afraid of animals especially big animals why did ra chen keep sending him after animals the thirty feet of lizard in the next cage definitely recognized svetz it jetted orangewhite flame at him and flapped its tiny batlike wings in fury when the flame washed harmlessly across the glass if it ever got out but that was why the cages were airtight the animals of earths past must be protected from the air of earths present svetz remembered the cobaltblue sky of earths past and was reassured todays afternoon sky was brilliant turquoise at the zenith shading through pastel green and yellow to rich yellowbrown near the horizon svetz saw it and was reassured if the chinese firebreather ever got out it would be too busy gasping for purer air to attack svetz what can we get him i think hes tired of these animals svetz what about a giraffe a what or a dog or a satyr its got to be unusual ra chen muttered a teddy bear out of his fear of animals svetz ventured i wonder if you might not be on the wrong track sir mph why the secretarygeneral has enough animals to satisfy a thousand men worse than that youre competing with space when you bring back funny animals they can do that too ra chen scratched behind his ear i never thought of that youre right but weve got to do something there must be lots of things to do with a time machine they could have taken a displacement plate back to the center ra chen preferred to walk it would give him a chance to think he said svetz walked with bowed head and blind eyes alongside his boss inspiration had come to him at similar times when he needed it but they had reached the red sandstone cube that was the center and the mental lightning had not struck a big hand closed on his upper arm just a minute ra chen said softly the secretarygenerals paying us a visit svetzs heart lurched how do you know ra chen pointed you should recognize that thing on the walkway we brought it back last month from los angeles june third twentysix postatomic the day of the great california earthquake its an internal combustion automobile it belongs to the secretarygeneral whatll we do go in and show him around ra chen said grimly pray be doesnt insist on being taken back to watts august eleventh twenty postatomic suppose he does ill send him back oh not with you svetz with zeera shes black and she speaks american it might help not enough said svetz but he was already calmer let zeera take the risks they passed close by the secretarygenerals automobile svetz was intrigued by its odd angular look its complex control panels the shiny chrome trim someone had removed the hood so that the polished complexity of the motor was open to view wait svetz said suddenly does he like it will you come on does the secretarygeneral like his automobile sure svetz he loves it get him another car california must have been full of automobiles on the day before the great quake ra chen stopped suddenly that could be it it would hold him for a while give us time time for what ra chen didnt hear a racing car no hed kill himself the circle of advisors would want to install a robot chauffeur override maybe a dune buggy why not ask him its worth a try said ra chen they went up the steps in the center there were three time machines including the one with the big extension cage plus a host of panels with flashing colored lights the secretarygeneral liked those he smiled and chuckled as ra chen led him about his guards hovered at his shoulders their faces stiff their fingernails clicking against their gun butts ra chen introduced svetz as my best agent svetz was so overwhelmed by the honor he could only stutter but the secretarygeneral didnt seem to notice whether he had forgotten about seeing the watts riot was moot but he did forget to ask on that occasion when ra chen asked about cars the secretarygeneral smiled all across his face and nodded vigorously faced by a vast array of choices five or six decades with dozens of new models for every year the secretarygeneral put his finger in his mouth and considered well then he made his choice why not ask him why not ask him ra chen mimicked savagely now we know the first car he wants the first car ever made i thought hed ask for a make of car svetz rubbed his eyes hard how can we possibly find one car a couple of decades to search through and all of the north american and european continents its not that bad well use the books from the beverly hills library but its bad enough svetz the raid on the beverly hills library had been launched in full daylight using the big extension cage and a dozen guards armed with stimners on june third twentysix postatomic giant time machines crazy men wearing flying beltson any other day it would have made every newspaper and television program in the country but june the third was a kind of happy hunting ground for the institute for temporal research no californian would report the raid except to other californians if the story did get out it would be swamped by more important news the series of quakes would begin at sunset had begun at sunset svetz and ra chen and zeera southworth spent half the night going through the history section of the beverly hills library ra chen knew enough white american to recognize titles but in the end zeera had to do the reading zeera southworth was tall and slender and very dark crowned with hair like a black powder explosion among men who worked at the center she was reputed to be as frigid as the caves of pluto she was also the only one who could handle the unique horned horse svetz had brought back from prehistoric britain she sat gracefully crosslegged reading pertinent sections aloud while the others paced they followed a twisting trail of references by two in the morning they were damp and furious nobody invented the automobile ra chen exploded it just happened we certainly have a wide range of choices zeera agreed i take it we wont want any of the steam automobiles that would eliminate cugnot and trevithick and the later british steam coaches thank science for eliminating something svetz said our best bets seem to be lenoir of france and marcus of vienna except that daimler and benz have good claims and seldens patent held good for years dammit pick one just a minute sir zeera alone retained some semblance of calm this ford might be the best weve got ford why he invented nothing but a system of mass production zeera held up the book svetz recognized it a biography she had been reading earlier this book implies that ford was responsible for everything that he created the automobile industry singlehanded but we know that isnt true svetz protested ra chen made a pushing motion with one hand lets not be hasty we take fords car and we produce that book to authenticate it wholl know the difference but if someone does the same research we justoh sure hell get the same answers no answers fords just as good a choice as any better if nobody looks further zeera said with satisfaction too bad we cant take the model t it looks much more like an automobile this thing he started with looks like a kiddy cart it says he built it out of old pipes tough said ra chen late the next morning ra chen delivered last minute instructions you cant just take the car he told zeera if youre interrupted come back without it yes sir it would be less crucial if we took our duplicate from a later time from the smithsonian institute for instance the automobile has to be new be reasonable zeera we cant give the secretarygeneral a secondhand automobile no sir well land you about three in the morning use infrared and pills to change your vision dont show any visible light artificial light would probably scare them silly right were you shown i know how to use the duplicator zeera sounded faintly supercilious as always i also know that it reverses the image never mind that bring back the reversed duplicate and well just reverse it again of course she seemed chagrined that she had not seen that for herself what about dialect you speak black and white american but its for a later period dont use slang stick to black unless you want to impress someone white then speak white but speak slowly and carefully and use simple words theyll think youre from another country i hope zeera nodded crisply she stooped and entered the extension cage turned and pulled the duplicator after her its bulk was small but it weighed a ton or so without the lift field generator to float it one end glowed white with glowpaint they watched the extension cage blur and vanish it was still attached to the rest of the time machine but attached along a direction that did not transmit light now then ra chen rubbed his hands together i dont expect shell have any trouble getting henry fords flightless flight stick our trouble may come when the secretarygeneral sees what hes got svetz nodded remembering the grayandflat pictures in the history books fords machine was ungainly slipshod ugly and undependable a few small surreptitious additions would make it dependable enough to suit the secretarygeneral nothing would make it beautiful we need another distraction said ra chen weve only bought ourselves more time to get it zeeras small time machine gave off a sound of ripping cloth subdued monotonous reassuring a dozen workmen were readying the big extension cage zeera would need it to transport the duplicate automobile theres something id like to try svetz ventured concerning what the roc ra chen grinned the ostrich you mean dont you ever give up there wasnt any roc svetz svetz looked stubborn do you know anything about neoteny never heard of it look svetz were going to be over budget because of the roe trip not your fault of course but another trip would cost us over a million commercials and i dont need the time machine oh i would like the help of the palace veterinarian have you got enough pull for that the palace veterinarian was a stocky blocky busty woman with muscular legs and a thrusting jaw a floating platform packed with equipment followed her between the rows of cages i know every one of these beasts she told svetz once i even thought of giving them names an animal ought to have a name theyve got names thats what i decided gila monster elephant ostrich she read you give gilgamesh a name so he wont get mixed up with gilbert but nobody would get horse mixed up with elephant theres only one of each its sad there are the clones do you know what we do with the clones we let them grow to infancy then freeze em only one at a time of each species is alive she stopped before the cage marked ostrich is this your prize ive been meaning to come see him the bird shifted its feet in indecision it cocked its head to consider the couple on the other side of the glass it seemed surprised at svetzs return he looks just like a newly hatched chick she said except for the legs and feet of course they seem to have developed to support the extra mass svetz was edgy with the need to be in two places at once his own suggestion had sparked zeeras project he ought to be there yetthe ostrich had been his first failure he asked does it look neotenous neotenous obviously neoteny is a common method of evolution we have neotenous traits ourselves you know bare skin where all the other primates are covered with hair when our ancestors started chasing their meat across the plains they needed a better cooling system than most primates need so they kept one aspect of immaturity the bare skin the axolotl was a classic example of neoteny the what you know what a salamander was dont you it had gills and fins while immature as an adult it grew lungs and shed the gills and lived on land the axoloti was a viable offshoot that never lost the gills and fins a gene shift typical of neoteny i never heard of either of them axolotis or salamanders theyve been extinct for a long time they needed open streams and ponds to live svetz nodded open water was deadly poison anywhere on earth the problem is that we dont know when your bird lost its ability to fly some random neotenous development may have occurred far in the past so that the birds wings never developed then it may have evolved its present size to compensate oh then the ancestor may have been no bigger than a turkey shall we go in and look the glass irised open to admit them svetz stepped into the cage felt the tug of the pressure curtain flowing over and around him the ostrich backed warily away the vet opened a pouch on her floating platform withdrew a stunner and used it the ostrich squawked in outrage and collapsed no muss no fuss the vet strode toward her patientand stopped suddenly in the middle of the cage she sniffed sniffed again in horror have i lost my sense of smell svetz produced two items like cellophane bags handed her one put this on why you might suffocate if you dont he donned the other himself by pulling it over his head then pressing the rim against the skin of his neck it stuck when he finished he had a hermetic seal this air is deadly he explained its the air of the earths past reconstituted think of it as coming from fifteen hundred years ago there were so few men then that they might as well have never discovered fire as far as the composition of the air was concerned thats why you dont smell anything but ostrich nothings been burned yet you dont need sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide to keep you alive you do need carbon dioxide a certain concentration of carbon dioxide in your blood activates the breathing reflex she had finished donning her filter helmet i take it the concentration is too low in here right youd forget to breathe youre used to air thats four percent carbon dioxide in here its barely a tenth of that the bird can breathe this bland stuff in fact itd die without it what weve put into the air in the past fifteen hundred years weve had fifteen hundred years to adapt to the ostrich hasnt ill keep that in mind she said shortly so that svetz wondered if hed been lecturing someone who knew more than he did she knelt beside the sleeping ostrich and the platform floated lower for her convenience svetz watched her as she ministered to the ostrich taking tissue samples testing blood pressure and heartbeat in reaction to small doses of hormones and drugs in a general way he knew what she was doing there were techniques for reversing the most recent mutations in an animals genetic makeup one did not always get what one expected stillthere was a homo habilis several cages down who had been in the circle of advisors until he called the secretarygeneral a tyrannical fugghead while she was identifying the neotenous developments she would also be trying to guess what she would have when they were eliminated then there were matters of metabolism if svetz was right the birds mass would increase rapidly it must be fed intravenously and even more rapidly in generalbut the details of what she was doing were mysterious and dull svetz found himself studying her filter helmet full inflation had rendered it almost invisible a golden rim of it showed by diffraction against the yellowbrown sky did space really want to take over the institute for temporal research then that golden halo was support for their claim it was a semipermeable membrane it would selectively pass gases in both directions in such a way as to make an almost breathable atmosphere breathable it had been taken unchanged from a space warehouse other itr equipment had come from the space industries flight sticks anesthetic needle guns the low mass antigravity unit in the new extension cage but their basic argument was more subtle once the ocean teemed with life svetz thought now the continental shelf is as dead as the moon nothing but bubble cities once this whole continent was all forest and living desert and fresh water we cut down the trees and shot the animals and poisoned the rivers and irrigated the deserts so that even the desert life died and now theres nothing left but the food yeast and us weve forgotten so much about the past that we cant separate legend from fact weve wiped out most of the forms of life on earth in the last fifteen hundred years and changed the composition of the air to the extent that wed be afraid to change it back i fear the unknown beasts of the past i cannot breathe the air i cannot recognize the edible plants i would not kill animals for food i dont know which would kill me the earths past is as foreign to me as another planet the palace veterinarian was busy hooking the ostrich intravenously to tubing of several colors svetzs pocket phone rang for a wild moment svetz considered not answering but good manners won out and svetz opened the phone theres trouble said ra chens image zeeras cage is on its way back she must have pulled the gohome lever right after she called for the big extension cage she left before the big cage could get there yah said ra chen whatever happened must have happened fast if she called for the big cage then she had the automobile a moment later she aborted the mission svetz im worried id hate to leave now sir svetz turned to look at the ostrich in that moment all of the birds feathers fell out leaving it plump and naked that decided him i cant leave now sir well have a fullgrown roc in a few minutes what good but how the ostrich was a neotenous offshoot of the roc weve produced a throwback good stick with it svetz well handle it here ra chen switched off the palace veterinarian said you shouldnt make promises you cant keep svetzs heart leapt trouble no its going beautifully so far all the feathers fell out is that good dont worry about it see for yourself already theres a coat of down your ostrich is reverting to chickhood she said cheerfully its ancestors chickhood if the ancestor really was no bigger than a turkey before it lost the ability to fly itll be even smaller as a chick whatll happen then itll drown in its own fat we should have taken a clone too late look at it now look at the legs they arent nearly as overdeveloped the bird was a big ball of pale yellow down its frame had shrunk but its legs had shrunk much more standing it would have been no more than four feet tall the extra mass had turned to fat so that the ostrich was nearly spherical it bulged like a poolside toy lying on its inflated side in a pool of feathers now it really looks like a chick said svetz it does svetz in fact it is that was a big chick the adult is going to be tremendous the palace veterinarian jumped to her feet svetz weve got to hurry is there a basic yeast source in this cage sure why hell starve at the rate hes growing unless just show me svetz the animals of the zoo ate yeast like everyone else but with special additives for each animal a brain tap could induce the animal to imagine it was eating whatever it was used to eating when the time probe had picked it up svetz showed her the yeast tap she hooked the pipeline to one of the machines on her floating platform she made adaptations added another machine the bird grew visibly its fat layer shrank deflated its legs and wings stretched outward the beak began to take a distinctive hooked form sharp and wicked looking svetz began to feel panic beneath its downy feathers the bird was little more than taut skin stretched over long bones the yeast was now feeding directly into two tanks on the floating platform and from there into the colored tubes somehow the palace veterinarian was converting the yeast directly into sugarplasma its working now she said i wasnt sure it would hell be all right now if the growth cycle slows down in time she smiled up at him you were right all along the ostrich was a neotenous roc at that moment the light changed svetz wasnt sure what had disturbed him but he looked up and the sky was baby blue from the horizon to the zenith what is it the woman beside him was bemused rather than frightened i never saw a color like that in my life i have what is it dont worry about it but keep your filter helmet on especially if you have to leave the cage can you remember that of course her eyes narrowed you know something about this svetz its something to do with time isnt it i think so svetz used the key beam then to avoid further questions the glass peeled back to let him out he turned for a last look through the glass the palace veterinarian looked frightened she must have guessed too much for her own comfort but she turned away to care for her patient the ostrich lay on its side its eyes open now it was tremendous and still scrawny despite the volume of the intravenous feed its feathers were changing color the bird would be black and green it was half as big as the elephant next door whose air of gray wisdom was giving way to uneasiness as he watched it looked nothing like an ostrich the sky was baby blue the blue of the deep past crossed with fluffy clouds of clean and shining white blue from the horizon to the zenith without a trace of the additives that ought to be there unconscious men and women lay everywhere svetz dared not stop to help what he had to do was more important he slowed to a walk as he neared the center there was pain like a knife blade inserted between his partly healed ribs itr crewmen had fallen in the walkway around the center presumably after staggering outside and there was the secretarygenerals automobile sitting quietly in front behind it flat on his back was ra chen what did he think he was doing there svetz heard the purr of the motor as he approached so that was it ra chen must have hoped that the exhaust would revive him damn clever and it should have worked why hadnt it svetz looked into the polished metal guts of the motor as he passed the motor had changed somehow what ran it now steam electricity a flywheel in any event the exhaust pipe ra chen had been searching for was no longer there ra chen was alive his pulse rapid and frantic but he wasnt breathing or yes he was he was breathing perhaps twice a minute as carbon dioxide built up enough to activate the reflex svetz went on into the center more than a dozen men and women had collapsed across lighted control panels three more figures sprawled in an aisle the secretarygeneral lay in angular disorder smiling foolishly up at the ceiling his guards wore troubled sleeping expressions and held drawn guns the small extension cage had not returned svetz looked into the empty gap in the time machine and felt terror what could he accomplish without zeera to tell him what had gone wrong from anteatomic to the present was a thirty minute trip ra chens call to the zoo must have come less than thirty minutes ago weird how an emergency could telescope time unless that was a side effect of the paradox unless the paradox had chopped away zeeras extension cage and left her stranded in the past or cast off into an alternate world line or there bad never been a temporal paradox math was no help the mathematics of time travel was riddled with singularities last year somebody had tried to do a topological analysis of the path of an extension cage he had proved not only that time travel was impossible but that you couldnt travel faster than light either ra chen had leaked the news to space on the off chance that their hyperdrive ships would stop working what to do start putting filter helmets on everyone great but the helmets werent kept at the center hed have to go across town did he dare leave the center svetz forced himself to sit down minutes later he snapped alert at the pop of displaced air the small extension cage had returned zeera was crawling out of the circular doorway get back in there svetz ordered quick i dont take orders from you svetz she brushed past him and looked about her the automobiles gone wheres ra chen zeeras face was blank with shock and exhaustion her voice was a monotone ragged at the edges svetz took her arm zeera weve she jerked away weve got to do something the automobiles gone didnt you hear me did you hear me get back in the extension cage but weve got to decide what to do why cant i smell anything she sniffed at air that was scentless empty dead she looked about herself in bewilderment realizing for the first time just how strange everything was then the eyes rolled up in her head and svetz stepped forward to catch her he studied her sleeping face across the diameter of the extension cage it was very different from her waking face softer more vulnerable and prettier zeera had quite a pretty face you should relax more often he said his ribs throbbed where the ostrich had kicked him the pain seemed to beat like a heart zeera opened her eyes she asked why are we in here the extension cage has its own air system said svetz you cant breathe the outside air why not you tell me her eyes went wide the automobile its gone why i dont know svetz i swear i did everything right but when i turned on the duplicator the automobile disappeared that doesnt sound at all good svetz strove to keep his voice level what did you i did it just the way they taught me i hooked the glowpainted end to the frame set the dials for an estimated mass plus a margin of error read the dials off you must have hooked up the wrong end somehow wait a minute were you using the infrared flash of course it was dead of night and youd taken the pills so youd be able to see infrared do you always think that slowly svetz then her eyes changed and svetz knew shed seen it i was seeing infrared of course i hooked up the hot end the duplicator end sure that would duplicate empty space where there was an automobile youd get emptiness at both ends zeera relaxed against the curved side of the extension cage with her arms hooked under her knees presently she said henry ford sold that automobile for two hundred dollars according to the book later he had trouble getting financed could the money have been crucial it must have been how much is two hundred dollars then someone else used mass production to make automobiles and he must have liked steam or electricity steam id guess steam came first tell me this svetz if the air changed why didnt we change with it we evolved to be able to breathe air with a certain percentage of carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide and nitrous and nitric oxides and so forth shouldnt the evolution have been canceled too for that matter why do we remember theres a lot we dont know about time travel how do you expect logic to hold when paradoxes hold too does that mean you dont know yes im not nagging svetz i dont know either more silence its clear enough zeera said presently you have to go back and warn myself to get the duplicator on straight that wont work it didnt work if youd gotten the ends of the duplicator straight we wouldnt be in this mess therefore you didnt she looked irritated too logical well what then maybe we can go around you svetz hesitated then plunged in try this send me back to an hour before the earlier zeera arrives the automobile wont have disappeared yet ill duplicate it duplicate the duplicate take the reversed duplicate and the original automobile past you in the big extension cage that lets you destroy the duplicate i reappear after youre gone leave the original automobile and come back here with the reversed duplicate hows that it sounded great would you mind going through it again lets see i go back to she was laughing at him never mind but it has to be me svetz you couldnt find your way you couldnt ask directions or read the street signs youll have to stay here and man the machinery reluctantly svetz agreed they were leaving the extension cage when there came a scream like the end of the world momentarily they froze then svetz ran around the swelling flank of the cage zeera followed wearing the filter helmet she had worn during her attempt to duplicate fords automobile one wall of the center was glass it framed a crest of hill across from the palace and a double row of cages that made up the zoo one of the cages was breaking apart as they watched smashing itself to pieces like like an egg hatching and like a chick emerging the roe stood up in the ruin of its cage the scream came again what is it zeera whispered it was an ostrich id hate to give it a name now the bird seemed to move in slow motion there was so much of it green and black beautiful and evil big as eternity and a crest of golden feathers had sprouted on its forehead its hooked beak descended toward a cage that cage ripped like paper zeera was shaking his arm come on if it came from the zoo we dont need to worry about it itll suffocate when we get the car back where it belongs oh bight said svetz they went to work moving the big extension cage a few hours further back in time when svetz looked again the bird was just taking to the air its wings flapped like sails and their black shadows swept like cloud shadows over the houses as the roe rose fully into view svetz saw that something writhed and struggled in its tremendous talons svetz recognized it and realized just how big the roe really was its got elephant he said an inexplicable sorrow gripped his heart inexplicable for svetz hated animals what come on svetz um oh yes he helped zeera into the small extension cage and sent it on its way despite its sleeping crew the machinery of the center seemed to be working perfectly if anything got off svetz would have six mens work to do therefore he prowled among the control boards alert for any discrepancy making minor adjustments and occasionally he looked out the picture window the roc reached a tremendous height any ordinary bird would have been invisible long since but the roc was all too visible hovering in the blue sky while it killed and ate elephant time passed twenty minutes for zeera to get back more time to make two duplicates of the automobile load them into the big extension cage then to signal svetz the signal came she had the cars she wanted to be moved forward svetz played it safe and moved her forward six hours almost to dawn she might be caught by an early riser but at least ford would have his automobile the roc had finished its bloody meal elephant was gone bones and all andsvetz watched until he was surethe bird was dropping riding down the sky on outstretched wings svetz watched it grow bigger and bigger yet until it seemed to enfold the universe it settled over the center like a tornado cloud in darkness and wind like twin tornado tunnels two sets of curved talons touched down in the walkway the bird bent low an inhuman face looked in at svetz through the picture window it nearly filled the window it knows me svetz thought even a birds brain must be intelligent in a head that size the vast head rose ponderously out of sight above the roof i had the ostrich i should have been satisfied thought svetz a coin in the hand is worth two in the street the ancient proverb could as easily be applied to birds the roof exploded downward around a hooked beak particles of concrete spattered against the walls and floor a yellow eye rolled and found svetz but the beak couldnt reach him not through that hole the head withdrew through the roof three red lights svetz leapt for the board and began twisting dials he made two lights turn green then the third it had not occurred to him to run the bird would find him wherever he hid there zeera had pulled the gohome lever from here it was all automatic crash svetz was backed up against the big time machine pinned by a yellow eye as big as himself half the roof was gone but still the birds beak couldnt reach him but a great talon came seeking him through the shattered glass the light changed svetz sagged behind the green and black feathers he could see that the sky had turned pale yellowgreen marked with yellowbrown streamers of cloud the bird sniffed incredulously it didnt have to be told twice its head rose through the ceiling it stepped back from the center for clearance its great wings came down like thunderclouds svetz stepped out to watch it rise he had to hug an ornamental pillar the wind of its wings was a hurricane the bird looked down once and recognized him and looped away it was still well in view rising and circling when zeera stepped out to join him presently ra chen was there to follow their eyes then half the center maintenance team was gaping upward in awe and astonishment while the bird dwindled to a black shadow black against pale green climbing climbing one sniff had been enough the birds brain was as enormously proportioned as the rest of it it had started climbing immediately without waiting to snatch up its dessert climbing climbing toward the edge of space reaching for clean air the secretarygeneral stood beside svetz smiling in wonder chuckling happily as he gazed upward was the roe still climbing no the black shadow was growing larger sliding down the sky and the slow motion of the wings had stopped how was a roc to know that there was no clean air anywhere theres a wolf in my time machine the old extension cage had no fine controls but that hardly mattered it wasnt as if svetz were chasing some particular extinct animal ra chen had told him to take whatever came to hand svetz guided the cage back to proindustrial america somewhere in midcontinent around ante atomic era few humans many animals perhaps hed find a bison and when he pulled himself to the window he looked out upon a vast white land svetz had not planned to arrive in midwinter briefly he considered moving into the time stream again and using the interrupter circuit try another date try luck again but the interrupter circuit was new untried and svetz wasnt about to be the first man to test it besides which a trip into the past cost over a million commercials using the interrupter circuit would nearly double that ra chen would be displeased svetz began freezing to death the moment he opened the door from the doorway the view was all white with one white bounding shape far away svetz shot it with a crystal of soluble anaesthetic he used the flight stick to reach the spot now that it was no longer moving the beast was hard to find it was just the color of the snow but for its open red mouth and the black pads on its feet svetz tentatively identified it as an arctic wolf it would fit the vivarium well enough svetz would have settled for anything that would let him leave this frozen wilderness he felt uncommonly pleased with himself a quick easy mission inside the cage he rolled the sleeping beast into what might have been a clear plastic bag and sealed it he strapped the wolf against one curved wall of the extension cage he relaxed into the curve of the opposite wall as the cage surged in a direction vertical to all directions gravity shifted oddly a transparent sac covered svetzs own head its lip was fixed to the skin of his neck now svetz pulled it loose and dropped it the air system was on he would not need the filter sac the wolf would it could not breathe industrial age air without the filter sac to remove the poisons the wolf would choke to death wolves were extinct in svetzs time outside time passed at a furious rate inside time crawled nestled in the spherical curve of the extension cage svetz stared up at the wolf who now seemed fitted into the curve of the ceiling svetz had never met a wolf in the flesh he had seen pictures in childrens books and even the childrens books had been stolen from the deep past why should the wolf look so familiar it was a big beast possibly as big as hanville svetz who was a slender smallboned man its sides heaved with its panting its tongue was long and red and its teeth were white and sharp like the dogs svetz remembered the dogs in the vivarium in the glass case labeled dog contemporary alone of the beasts in the vivarium the dogs were not sealed in glass for their own protection the others could not breathe the air outside the dogs could in a very real sense they were the work of one man lawrence wash porter had lived near the end of the industrial period between and post atomic era when billions of human beings were dying of lung diseases while scant millions adapted porter had decided to save the dogs why the dogs his motives were obscure but his methods smacked of genius he had acquired members of each of the breeds of dog in the world and bred them together over many generations of dogs and most of his own lifetime there would never be another dog show not a purebred dog was left in the world but hybrid vigor had produced a new breed these the ultimate mongrels could breathe industrial age air rich in oxides of carbon and nitrogen scented with raw gasoline and sulfuric acid the dogs were behind glass because people were afraid of them too many species had died the people of post atomic were not used to animals wolves and dogs could one have sired the other svetz looked up at the sleeping wolf and wondered he was both like and unlike the dogs the dogs had grinned out through the glass and wagged their tails when children waved dogs liked people but the wolf even in sleep svetz shuddered of all the things he hated about his profession this was the worst the ride home staring up at a strange and dangerous extinct animal the first time hed done it a captured horse had seriously damaged the control panel on his last mission an ostrich had kicked him and broken three ribs the wolf was stirring restlessly and something about it had changed something was changing now the beasts snout was shorter wasnt it its forelegs lengthened peculiarly its paws seemed to grow and spread svetz caught his breath svetz caught his breath and instantly forgot the wolf svetz was choking dying he snatched up his filter sac and threw himself at the controls svetz stumbled out of the extension cage took three steps and collapsed behind him invisible contaminants poured into the open air the sun was setting in banks of orange cloud svetz lay where he had fallen retching fighting for air there was an outdoor carpet beneath him green and damp smelling of plants svetz did not recognize the smell did not at once realize that the carpet was alive he would not have cared at that point he knew only that the cages air system had tried to kill him the way he felt it had probably succeeded it had been a near thing he had been passing post atomic when the air went bad he remembered clutching the interrupter switch then waiting waiting the foul air stank in his nostrils and caught hi his throat and tore at his larynx he had waited through twenty years feeling every second of them at post atomic he had pulled the interrupt switch and run choking from the cage pa at least he had reached industrial limes he could breathe the air it was the horse he thought without surprise the horse had pushed its wickedly pointed horn through svetzs control panel three years ago maintenance was supposed to fix it they had fixed it something must have worn through the way he looked at me every time i passed his cage always knew the horse would get me svetz thought he noticed the filter sac still in his hand not that hed be svetz sat up suddenly there was green all about him the damp green carpet beneath him was alive it grew from the black ground a rough twisted pillar thrust from the ground branched into an explosion of red and yellow papery things more of the crumpled colored paper lay about the pillars base something that was not an aircraft moved erratically overhead a tiny thing that fluttered and warbled living all of it a preindustrial wilderness svetz pulled the filter sac over his head and hurriedly smoothed the edges around his neck to form a seal blind luck that he hadnt fainted yet he waited for it to puff up around his head a selectively permeable membrane it would pass the right gasses in and out until the composition of the air waswassvetz was choking tearing at the sac he wadded it up and threw it sobbing first the air plant now the filter sac had someone wrecked them both the inertial calendar too he was at least a hundred years previous to post atomic someone had tried to kill him svetz looked wildly about him uphill across a wide green carpet he saw an angular verticalsided formation painted in shades of faded green it had to be artificial there might be people there he could no he couldnt ask for help either who would believe him how could they help him anyway his only hope was the extension cage and his time must be very short the extension cage rested a few yards away the door a black circle on one curved side the other side seemed to fade away into nothing it was still attached to the rest of the time machine in pa along a direction eyes could not follow svetz hesitated near the door his only hope was to disable the air plant somehow hold his breath then the smell of contaminants was gone svetz sniffed at the air yes gone the air plant had exhausted itself drained its contaminants into the open air no need to wreck it now svetz was sick with relief he climbed in he remembered the wolf when he saw the filter sac torn and empty then he saw the intruder towering over him the coarse thick hair the yellow eyes glaring the taloned hands spread wide to kill the land was dark in the east a few stars showed though the west was still deep red perfumes tinged the air a full moon was rising svetz staggered uphill bleeding the house on the bill was big and old big as a city block and two floors high it sprawled out in all directions as though a mad architect had built to a whim that changed moment by moment there were wrought iron railings on the upper windows and wrought iron handles on the screens on both floors all painted the same dusty shade of green the screens were wood painted a different shade of green they were closed across every window no light leaked through anywhere the door was built for someone twelve feet tall the knob was huge svetz used both hands and put all his weight into it and still it would not turn he moaned he looked for the lens of a peeper camera and could not find it how would anyone know he was here he couldnt find a doorbell either perhaps there was nobody inside no telling what this building was it was far too big to be a family dwelling too spread out to be a hotel or apartment house might it be a warehouse or a factory making or storing what svetz looked back toward the extension cage dimly he caught the glow of the interior lights he also saw something moving on the living green that carpeted the hill pale forms more than one moving this way svetz pounded on the door with his fists nothing he noticed a golden metal thing very ornate high on the door he touched it pulled at it let it go it clanked he took it in both hands and slammed the knob against its base again and again rhythmic chinking sounds someone should hear it something zipped past his ear and hit the door hard svetz spun around eyes wild and dodged a rock the size of his fist the white shapes were nearer now bipeds walking hunched they looked too humanor not human enough the door opened she was young perhaps sixteen her skin was very pale and her hair and brows were pure white quite beautiful her garment covered her from neck to ankles but left her arms bare she seemed sleepy and angry as she pulled the door openmanually and it was heavy too then she saw svetz help me said svetz her eyes went wide her ears moved too she said something svetz had trouble interpreting for she spoke in ancient american what are you svetz couldnt blame her even in good condition his clothes would not fit the period but his blouse was ripped to the navel and so was his skin four vertical parallel lines of blood ran down his face and chest zeera had been coaching him in the american speech now he said carefully i am a traveler an animal a monster has taken my vehicle away from me evidently the sense came through you poor man what kind of animal like a man but hairy all over with a horrible face and clawsclaws i see the mark they made i dont know how he got in i svetz shuddered no he couldnt tell her that it was insane utterly insane this conviction that svetzs wolf had become a bloodthirsty humanoid monster he only hit me once on the face i could get him out with a weapon i think have you a bazooka what a funny word i dont think so come inside did the trolls bother you she took his arm and pulled him in and shut the door trolls youre a strange person the girl said looking him over you look strange you smell strange you move strangely i did not know that there were people like you in the world you must come from very far away very said svetz ho felt himself close to collapse he was safe at last safe inside but why were the hairs on the back of his neck trying to stand upright he said my name is svetz whats yours wrona she smiled up at him not afraid despite his strangeness and he must look strange to her for she surely looked strange to hanville svetz her skin was sheet white and her rich white hair would better have fit a centenarian her nose very broad and flat would have disfigured an ordinary girl somehow it fit wronas face well enough but her face was most odd and her ears were too large almost pointed and her eyes were too far apart and her grin stretched way back and svetz liked it her grin was curiosity and enjoyment and was not a bit too wide the firm pressure of her hand was friendly reassuring though her fingernails were uncomfortably long and sharp you should rest svetz she said my parents will not be up for another hour at least then they can decide how to help you come with me ill take you to a spare room he followed her through a room dominated by a great rectangular table and a double row of highbacked chairs there was a large microwave oven at one end and beside it a platter of red things roughly conical they were each about the size of a strong mans upper arm each with a dot of white in the big end svetz had no idea what they were but he didnt like their color they seemed to be bleeding oh wrona exclaimed i should have asked are you hungry svetz was suddenly have you dole yeast why i dont know the word are those dole yeast they are all we have wed better forget it svetzs stomach lurched at the thought of eating something that color even if it turned out to be a plant wrona was half supporting him by the time they reached the room it was rectangular and luxuriously large the bed was wide enough but only six inches off the floor and without coverings she helped him down to it theres a wash basin behind that door if you find the strength best you rest svetz in perhaps two hours i will call you svetz eased himself back the room seemed to rotate he heard her go out how strange she was how odd he must look to her a good thing she hadnt called anyone to tend him a doctor would notice the differences svetz had never dreamed that primitives would be so different from his own people during the thousand years between now and the present there must have been massive adaptation to changes in air and water to ddt and other compounds in foods to extinction of food plants and meat animals until only dole yeast was left to higher noise levels less room for exercise greater dependence on medicines well why shouldnt they be different it was a wonder humanity had survived at all wrona had not feared his strangeness nor cringed from the scratches on his face and chest she was only amused and interested she had helped him without asking too many questions he liked her for that he dozed pain from deep scratches stickiness in his clothes made his sleep restless there were nightmares something big and shadowy half man and half beast reached far out to slash his face over and over at some indeterminate time he woke completely already trying to identify a musky unfamiliar scent no use he looked about him at a strange room that seemed even stranger from floor level high ceiling one frosted globe no brighter than a full moon glowed so faintly that the room was all shadow wrought iron bars across the windows black night beyond a wonder hed wakened at all the preindustrial air should have killed him hours ago it had been a futz of a day he thought and he shied from the memory of the thing in the extension cage the snarling face pointed ears double row of pointed white teeth the clawed hand reaching out swiping down the nightmare conviction that a wolf had turned into that it could not be animals did not change shape like that something must have gotten in while svetz was fighting for air chased the wolf out or killed it but there wire legends of such things werent there two and three thousand years old and more everywhere in the world were the tales of men who could become beasts and vice versa svetz sat up pain gripped his chest then relaxed he stood up carefully and made his way to the bathroom the spiggots were not hard to solve svetz wet a cloth with warm water he watched himself in the mirror emerging from under the crusted blood a pale slender young man topped with thin blond hair and an odd distortion of chin and forehead that must be the mirror he decided primitive workmanship it might have been worse hadnt the first mirrors been twodimensional a shrill whistle sounded outside his door svetz went to look and found wrona good youre up she said father and uncle wrocky would like to see you svetz stepped into the hail and again noticed the elusive musky scent he followed wrona down the dark hallway like his room it was lit only by a single white frosted globe why would wronas people keep the house so dark they had electricity and why were they all sleeping at sunset with breakfast laid out and waiting wrona opened a door gestured him in svetz hesitated a step beyond the threshold the room was as dark as the hallway the musky scent was stronger here he jumped when a hand closed on his upper arm it felt wrong there was hair on the palm the hard nails made a circlet of pressure pointsand a gravelly male voice boomed come in mister svetz my daughter tells me youre a traveler in need of help in the dim light svetz made out a man and a woman seated on backless chairs both had hair as white as wronas but the womans hair bore a broad black stripe a second man urged svetz toward another backless chair he too bore black markings a single black eyebrow a black crescent around one ear and wrona was just behind him svetz looked around at them all seeing how like they were how different from hanvifie svetz the fear rose up in him like a strong drug svetz was a xenophobc they were all alike rich white hair and eyebrows black markings narrow black fingernails the broad flat noses and the wide wide mouths the sharp white conical teeth the high pointed ears that moved the yellow eyes the hairy palms svetz dropped heavily onto the padded footstool one of the males noticed the larger one who was still standing it must be the heavier gravity he guessed its true isnt it svetz youre from another world obviously youre not quite a man you told wrona you were a traveler but you didnt say from how far away very far svetz said weakly from the future the smaller male was jolted the future youre a time traveler his voice became a snarl youre saying that we will evolve into something like you svetz cringed no really i hope not what then i think i must have gone sidewise in time youre descended from wolves arent you not apes wolves yes of course the seated male was looking him over now that he mentions it he does look much more like a troll than any man has a right to no offense intended svetz svetz surrounded by wolf men tried to relax and failed what is a troll wrona perched on the edge of his stool you must have seen them on the lawn we keep about thirty plains apes the smaller male supplied imported from africa sometime in the last century they make good watchbeasts and meat animals you have to be careful with them though they throw things introductions the other said suddenly excuse our manners svetz im flakee wrocky this is my brother flakee worrel and brenda his wife my niece you know pleased to meet you svetz said hollowly you say you slipped sideways in time i think so a futz of a long way too said svetz marooned gods protect me it must have been the horse wrocky broke in horse the horse three years ago a horse damaged my extension cage it was supposed to be fixed i suppose the repairs just wore through and the cage slipped sideways in time instead of forward into a world where wolves evolved instead of homo habilis gods know where im likely to wind up if i try to go back then he remembered at least you can help me there some kind of monster has taken over my extension cage extension cage the part of the time machine that does the moving youll help me evict the monster of course said worrel at the same time the other was saying i dont think so bear with me please worrel svetz it would be a disservice to you if we chased the monster out of your extension cage you would try to reach your own time would you not futz yes but you would only get more and more lost at least in our world you can eat the food and breathe the air yes we grow food plants for the trolls you can learn to eat them you dont understand i cant stay here im a xenophobe wrocky frowned his ears flicked forward enquiringly what im afraid of intelligent beings who arent human i cant help it its in my bones oh im sure youll get used to us svetz svetz looked from one male to the other it was obvious enough who was in charge wrockys voice was much louder and deeper than worrels he was bigger than the other man and his white fur fell about his neck in a mane like a lions worrel was making no attempt to assert himself as for the women neither had spoken a word since svetz entered the room wrocky was emphatically the boss and wrocky didnt want svetz to leave you dont understand svetz said desperately the air he stopped what about the air it should have killed me by now a dozen times over in fact why hasnt it odd enough that hed ever stopped wondering about that i must have adapted svetz said half to himself thats it the cage passed too close to this line of history my heredity changed my lungs adapted to preindustrial air futz it if i hadnt pulled the interrupter switch id have adapted back then you can breathe our air said wrocky i still dont understand it dont you have any industries of course worrel said in surprise internal combustion cars and aircraft diesel trucks and ships chemical fertilizers insect repellents no none of that chemical fertilizers wash away ruin the water the only insect repellents i ever heard of smelled to high heaven they never got beyond the experimental stage most of our vehicles are battery powered there was a fad for internal combustion once said wrocky it didnt spread very far they stank the people inside didnt care of course because they were leaving the stink behind at its peak there were over two hundred cars tootling around the city of detroit poisoning the air then one night the citizenry rose in a pack and tore all the cars to pieces the owners too worrel said ive always thought that men have more sensitive noses than trolls wrona noticed my smell long before i noticed hers wrocky this is getting us nowhere ive got to go home i seem to have adapted to the air but there are other things foods ive never eaten anything but dole yeast everything else died out long ago bacteria wrocky shook his head anywhere you go svetz your broken time machine will only take you to more and more exotic environments there must be a thousand ways the world could end suppose you stepped out into one of them or just passed near one but here on the other paw you will be an honored guest think of all the things you can teach us you who were born into a culture that builds time traveling vehicles so that was it oh no you couldnt use what i know said svetz im no mechanic i couldnt show you how to do anything besides youd hate the side effects too much of past civilizations was built on petrochemicals and plastics burning plastics produces some of the strangest but even the most extensive oil reserves could not last forever you must have developed other power sources by your own time wrockys yellow eyes seemed to bore right through him controlled hydrogen fusion but i cant tell you how its done svetz cried desperately i know nothing of plasma physics plasma physics what are plasma physics using electromagnetic fields to manipulate ionized gasses you must have plasma physics no but im sure you can give us some valuable hints already we have fusion bombs and so do the europeans but we can discuss that later wrocky stood up his black nails made pressure points on svetzs arm think it over svetz oh and make yourself free of the house but dont go outside without an escort the trolls you know svetz left the room with his head whirling the wolves would not let him leave svetz im glad youre staying wrona chattered i like you im sure youll like it here let me show you the house down the length of the hallway one frosted globe burned dimly in the gloom like a full moon transported indoors nocturnal they were nocturnal wolves im a xenophobe he said i cant help it i was born that way oh youll learn to like us you like me a little already dont you svetz she reached up to scratch him behind the ear a thrill of pleasure ran through him unexpectedly sharp so that he half closed his eyes this way she said where are we going i thought id show you some trolls svetz are you really descended from trolls i cant believe it ill tell you when i see them said svetz he remembered the homo habilis in the vivarium it had been a man an advisor until the secretarygeneral ordered him regressed they went through the dining room and svetz saw unmistakable bones on the plates he shivered his forebears had eaten meat the trolls were brute animals here whatever they might be in svetzs worldbut svetz shuddered his thinking seemed turgid his head felt thick he had to get out of here if you think uncle wrockys tough you should meet the european ambassador said wrona perhaps you will does he come here sometimes wrona growled low in her throat i dont like him hes a different species svetz here it was the wolves that evolved into men at least thats what our teacher tells us in europe it was something else i dont think uncle wrocky will let me meet him or even tell him about me svetz rubbed at his eyes youre lucky herr dracula smiles a lot and says nasty things in a polite voice it takes you a minute to svetz whats wrong svetz groaned like a man in agony my eyes he felt higher my forehead i dont have a forehead any more i dont understand svetz felt his face with his fingertips his eyebrows were a caterpillar of hair on a thick solid ridge of bone from the brow ridge his forehead sloped back at fortyfive degrees and his chin his chin was gone too there was only a regular curve of jaw into neck im regressing im turning into a troll said svetz wrona if i turn into a troll will they eat me i dont know ill stop them svetz no take me down to the extension cage if youre not with me the trolls will kill me all right but svetz what about the monster he should be easier to handle by now itll be all right just take me there please all right svetz she took his hand and led him the mirror hadnt lied hed been changing even then adapting to this line of history first his lungs had lost their adaptation to normal air there had been no industrial age here but there had been no homo sapiens either wrona opened the door svetz sniffed at the night his sense of smell had become preternaturally acute he smelled the trolls before he saw them coming uphill toward him across the living green carpet svetzs fingers curled wishing for a weapon three of them they formed a ring around svetz and wrona one of them carried a length of white bone they all walked upright on two legs but they walked as if their feet hurt them they were as hairless as men apes heads mounted on mens bodies homo habilis the killer plains ape mans ancestor pay them no attention wrona said offhandedly they wont hurt us she started down the hill svetz followed closely he really shouldnt have that bone she called back we try to keep bones away from them they use them as weapons sometimes they hurt each other once one of them got hold of the iron handle for the lawn sprinkler and killed a gardener with it im not going to take it away from him that glaring light is that your extension cage yes im not sure about this svetz she stopped suddenly uncle wrockys right youll only get more lost here youll at least be taken care of no uncle wrocky was wrong see the dark side of the extension cage how it fades away to nothing its still attached to the rest of the time machine itll just reel me in oh no telling how long its been veering across the time lines maybe ever since that futzy horse poked his futzy horn through the controls nobody ever noticed before why should they nobody ever stopped a time machine halfway before svetz horses dont have horns mine does there was noise behind them wrona looked back into a darkness svetzs eyes could not pierce somebody must have noticed us come on svetz she pulled him toward the lighted cage they stopped just outside my head feels thick svetz mumbled my tongue too what are we going to do about the monster i cant hear anything no monster just a man with amnesia now he will only dangerous in the transition stage she looked in why youre right sir would yousvetz he doesnt seem to understand me sure not why should he he thinks hes a white arctic wolf sevtz stepped inside the white haired wolf man was backed into a corner warily watching he looked a lot like wrona svetz became aware that he had picked up a branch his hand must have done it without telling his brain he circled holding the weapon ready an unreasoning rage built up and up in him invader the man bad no business here in svetzs territory the wolf man backed away his slant eyes mad and frightened suddenly he was out the door and running the trolls close behind your father can teach him maybe said svetz wrona was studying the controls how do you work it let me see fm not sure i remember svetz rubbed at his drastically sloping forehead that one closes the door wrona pushed it the door closed shouldnt you be outside i want to come with you said wrona oh it was getting terribly difficult to think svetz looked over the control panel eeny meenythat one svetz pulled it free fall wrona yipped gravity came vectored radially outward from the center of the extension cage it pulled them against the walls when my lungs go back to normal ill probably go to sleep said svetz dont worry about it was there something else he ought to tell wrona he tried to remember oh yes you cant go home again said svetz wed never find this line of history again i want to stay with you said wrona all right within a deep recess in the bulk of the time machine a fog formed it congealed abruptlyand svetzs extension cage was back hours late the door popped open automatically but svetz didnt come out they had to pull him out by the shoulders out of air that smelled of beast and honeysuckle hell be all right in a minute get a filter tent over that other thing ra chen ordered he stood over svetz with his arms folded waiting svetz began breathing he opened his eyes all right said ra chen what happened svetz sat up let me think i went back to preindustrial america it was all snowed in i shot a wolf weve got it in a tent then what no the wolf left we chased him out svetzs eyes went wide wrona wrona lay on her side in the filter tent her fur was thick and rich white with black markings she was built something like a wolf but more compactly with a big head and a short muzzle and a tightly curled tail her eyes were closed she did not seem to be breathing svetz knelt help me get her out of there cant you tell the difference between a wolf and a dog no why would you bring back a dog svetz weve got dozens of dogs svetz wasnt listening he pulled away the filter tent and bent over wrona i think shes a dog more dog than wolf anyway people tend to domesticate each other shes adapted to our line of history and our brand of air svetz looked up at his boss sir well have to junk the old extension cage its been veering sideways in time have you been eating gunchy pills on the job ill tell you all about it wrona opened her eyes she looked about her in rising panic until she found svetz she looked up at him her golden eyes questioning ill take care of you dont worry svetz told her he scratched her behind the ear his fingertips deep in soft fur to ra chen he said the vivariuin doesnt need any more dogs she can stay with me are you crazy svetz you live with an animal you hate animals she saved my life i wont let anyone put her in a cage sure keep it live with it i dont suppose you plan to pay back the two million commercials she cost us i thought not ra chen made a disgusted sound all right lets have your report and keep that thing under control will you wrona raised her nose and sniffed at the air then she howled the sound echoed within the institute and heads turned in questioning and fear puzzled svetz imitated the gesture and understood the air was rich with petrochemicals and oxides of carbon and nitrogen and sulfur industrial air the air svetz had breathed all his life and svetz hated it death in a cage svetz was coming home his narrow arms were folded on his chest his back curved like a bow to fit him into the curvature of the extension cage he lay motionless in stoic endurance watching the inertial calendar gravity behaved oddly in an extension cage the pull was outward now as the cage moved into the future svetz could not have reached the controls without considerable effort they were overhead at the center of the spherical shell he did not need to reach them the bulk of the time machine was fixed in time space at the institute for temporal research in post atomic it would simply reel him in the small armored thing hed captured was strapped to an opposite wall it had not moved since svetz shot it with an anaesthetic crystal the numbers on the inertial calendar rolled upward gravity jumped and shivered like a car on a bumpy road svetz lay on his back and tried to ignore what his belly and his inner ear were telling him in a couple of hours internal time hed be home something smoky began to obscure the control panel svetz sniffed the air was thick with oxides of nitrogen and sulfur carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride a mixture of industrial wastes that svetz had been breathing since the day he was born he sniffed and found nothing unusual but the haze was thickening it was not fanning out it hung before the control panel taking shape svetz rubbed his eyes it was still there a shape like a cloaked and hooded man distorting colors and outlines where they showed through a vague stickfigure hand moulded itself around a lever and pulled the interrupter circuit svetz sat up his head swam he tried to stand and overbalanced and fell rolling the apparition braced its smoky feet against the control panel heedless of the switches and dials its feet and ankles were terribly thin it pantomimed frantic effort but the lever marked emergency stop did not move the figure turned to svetz and screamed at him without sound svetz screamed back and threw his arms across his eyes that face when svetz dared look again the thing was gone svetz began to shake the inertial calendar read ghosts eh svetzs beefy red faced boss scowled ferociously at least he was taking it seriously he might as easily have sent svetz off for a psychiatric examination thats all we need a haunted time machine well have you got any idea what really happened there must be something wrong with the time machine i think we ought to give up using it until we find out what you do yes sir come here a minute ra chen took svetzs arm and walked away with him he was twice svetzs mass his hand wrapped one and a half times around svetzs bicep he stopped them before the picture window that fronted the institute for temporal research spread below them the shops and houses and crooked streets of the city of capitol on the hill across the valley tremendous and daunting the complex of buildings that was the united nations palace ra chen pointed downhill there there was a gap in the cityscape a cluster of broken houses surrounded the broken corpse of a bird a bird the size of a five story building it had been there for two weeks now the stink reached them even here our worst failure to date i forebear to point out to you svetz that it was your idea to use regression treatments on an ostrich notice however that the futzy thing lies in full view of the palace well have to do something spectacular before the advisors forget that gaff and wed better do it soon yes sir were in bad odor at the palace svetz sir i think thats the roc ra chen glared were already missing one time machine he continued i had to yank it after we found out it was veering sidewise in time across probability lines the technical arm is still trying to find something wrong with it now you want me to yank the other one svetz could you have imagined thismanifestation ive asked myself that well no sir it was real even if i could see through it its just such a lousy time to lose both time machines appropriations come up in three months the vets were removing his armadillo from the extension cage svetz watched them erect a gauzy filter tent over it to protect it from the air of post atomic we ought to give up on funny animals said ra chen the secretarygeneral already has more extinct animals than he knows what to do with we ought to try something else yes sir but what ra chen didnt answer they watched as the medical team took clone samples from the armadillo then moved away with it it was awake but doing very little to prove it tomorrow it would be in the vivarium this ghost now ra chen said suddenly was it human or just humanoid itthere was something wrong with the face something dreadful but was it a man or an alien i couldnt tell after all it was thin as smoke it was wearing a robe i couldnt see anything but the face and handsand they were dreadfully thin it looked like a walking skeleton a skeleton huh maybe you were seeing through the flesh like a holo of a man in xray light that sounds right but why why would he be transparent funny i was just wondering the same thing dont be sarcastic svetz sorry sir weve both been assuming it was a sign of something wrong with the time machine what if it wasnt what if the thing was real svetz shook his head violently there are no such things as ghosts we thought that about roes why not think how long the ghost legend has been around all over the world in burial customs folk tales all the great religions there are people who believe in ghosts even today not many i admit but sir its nonsense even if there were real ghosts whatever they are how would they get aboard an extension cage and what could we do about it capture it of course the secretarygeneral would love it he could even play with it it sounded harmless enough but just ugly as for how it got there how should i know i dont know anything about the theory of time travel it should be possible to duplicate the conditions you say its harmless i saw it i say it isnt we can look into that after weve got it svetz we need a coup were going after that ghost we me and i wont come said ra chen let us reason together gravity behaved oddly in an extension cage going backward in time the pull was inward toward svetzs navel its intensity fluctuated to no known laws i must be getting used to this svetz thought he found that ominous svetz hated time travel if he was getting used to the odd motion he had probably given up hope of changing careers at least he didnt get sick any more how did he talk me into this the extension cage slowed gravity dwindled was gone came back pointing down the inertial calendar read ante atomic seven hundred years before the first nuclear explosion through the transparent hull of the extension cage svetz could see a thousand shades of dark green green in all directions a place of obscenely proliferating life it was the south american jungle where he had found the armadillo svetz donned a filter sac and waited for it to inflate around his head then he cut the air system and opened the vents to flood the extension cage with outside air the ghost had first appeared around pa if there was a ghost and if it came it would probably suffocate in industrial age air svetz took a sonic stun gun from its place on the wall subsonics were less material than anaesthetic crystals more likely to affect a ghost he told himself he pulled the gohome lever and that was that svetz had no controls only signals the controls were in the future with the bulk of the time machine in the institute building now the technicians began bringing him home they had readings from his last mission they could make his cage behave as it had then svetz had nothing to do but wait time travel still cost over a million commercials a shot if the cage simply brought him home now he was going to feel like an idiot but then so would ra chen he was passing post atomic when the haze began to form svetz stayed on his back but he raised the handgun it was clearer now more solid a dark voluminous cloak and hood showed behind the pale translucent outline of a human skeleton details were blurred mercifully perhaps because the thing was moving too fast screaming and pleading and gesticulating all without a sound it was frantic it begged svetz to stop the machine svetz fired the stun weapon he kept the stud down until his own head buzzed from the echoes the apparition screamed what must have been a string of curses and thereafter ignored him it wrapped the bones of its hands around the emergency stop braced the bones of its feet against the control panel and pulled the lever didnt move it was as if fog clung to the control panel svetz began to relax the thing was harmless he was willing to believe that it was manshaped though he could see no trace of the ghostly flesh that must surround the smoky bones perhaps he was watching some kind of probability phenomenon as if the ghostfigure marked where a man might be if there were another man aboard svetzs extension cage and its transparency was a measure of just how improbable that was svetzs head began to ache certainly he could not be expected to capture a probabilityphenomenon the ghost slowly faded then became clear it shifted its grip the white of bones gleamed faintly through dark cloak the ghost came solid in an instant it pulled the emergency stop down hard turned and leapt it was still a skeleton svetz screamed high and shrill turned and tried to burrow into the hull he felt the thing land on his back light and dry and hard he wailed again he was in fetal position now hugging his knees bony fingers tugged at his hand and he screamed and let go of the stun gun the fingers took it away for a long time nothing happened svetz waited for the end instead he heard slow footsteps clickings and a hollow grating voice that said all right thats enough of that roll over small bones prodded svetzs ribs he rolled over and opened his eyes it was as bad as hed thought worse the ghostfigure had turned solid but it was still no more than a mobile skeleton it stood now with its cloak flung back and a sonic stun gun in its finger bones its face was a skull far back in the black eye sockets eyes watched him steadily stop staring said the apparition it spoke speech it spoke svetzs language but the consonants came out mushy because the things skull was lipless it chuckled hollowly you can see me cant you it means youre going to die when people can see me its because theyre going to die no svetz whispered his legs were trying to push him back through the wall of the extension cage stop staring its not my fault im this way it was the radiation the apparition shifted uncomfortably whats your name ssvetz allow me to introduce myself i am doctor nathaniel reynolds the worlds first time traveler and ive decided to hijack your time machine svetz licked his lips i dont think so the first time traveler i beat him to it on another line of history of course a dead line my own fault have you ever heard of the cuban missile crisis the date was nineteen fiftyeight ad seventeen post atomic your dating no youre sure we called it the short war svetz shook his head doctor reynolds settled himself against the curved wall he held svetzs gun steadily on svetz he was not as much a skeleton as svetz had thought there was skin over the bones though the skin itself was the white of bleached bone in reynoldss neck there were trachea and gullet as well as the lumpy row of vertebrae the rib cage was something else again reynoldss ribs were naked bone behind the ribs was a narrow torso of flabby white flesh that pulsed like lungs torso and abdomen depended from the spine but daylight showed between the exoskeletal ribs the nose and ears were mere holes the pelvic bones were sharp as ax blades doctor reynolds was both hairless and sexless he said i dont talk well the only people who can see me and hear me are always about to die sometimes theyre too sick to concentrate sometimes too busy sometimes too scared am i dying reynolds chuckled well decide that between us what are you im a ghost my own fault but dont laugh it could happen to you svetz was not thinking of laughing let me tell you i was born about a century after the short war said doctor reynolds by then it was obvious the human race was dying too many countries had dropped too many bombs in the short war some were cobalt bombs there was still too much radiation around too many mutations mostly sick and mostly sterile not to mention disgusting i was one of the lucky ones svetz said nothing id have knocked your teeth out said the hollow voice i really was one of the lucky ones no brain damage no gonads but so what with all the radiation around i wouldnt have bred true anyway no organic damage that couldnt be fixed by available medicines i had to take the pills every day of course would you believe that i once had a pot belly svetz shook his head a very small pot belly i had to get rid of it it hurt my abdominal muscles couldnt carry the weight funny ive never picked up fat anywhere else just the belly and bones showing through the rest of me how did you get to be a ghost reynolds laughed a weak hollow sound deliberately and by dint of great effort there were thousands of us working on it there wasnt any question that we were doomed our best brains such as we were were working on time travel we called it project retake you know what a retake is doing a scene over for a sensory thats what we were after we werent sure the past could be changed even if we did have time travel but we had to try it we did it too the time machine was just big enough for me and the scrambler system they picked me because i only weigh about fifty pounds what did you do scrambled the guidance mechanisms of every guided missile in the union of soviet socialist republics a week before the cuban missile crisis they had to back down and move the missiles out of cuba by the time they got their missiles fixed the crisis was over and they still didnt know what had happened it must have made them cautious for awhile afterward i monitored it all by radio i made sure nobody saw me of course my appearance is a bit right so afterward i tried to go home not to my own present but to the new one the one id created my time machine didnt work we saved a lot of weight by leaving the power source fixed in the future now it was gone i left the time machine and went to give myself up and found out i was gone too well thats all over now said reynolds he hefted the stunner the bones of his hands were crossed by narrow strands of muscle his fingernails were long and ragged were going to put it back the way it was uh using your time machine mine wouldnt do it but yours will were going back to seventeen post atomic we cant ill kill you if we dont sventz believed him when nathaniel reynolds gave himself a name svetz had stopped seeing him as a supernatural horror but he was convinced that the bony physicist was mad he said you dont understand this isnt a time machine its only the extension cage the part that does the moving the technicians have to haul me back to the present before they can send me back again youre lying no reynolds there arent any controls herejust onoff pulses to tell the technicians which way to move me they can only move me forward now i almost believe you reynolds mused but ill still kill you unless one of us thinks of something youre crazy youd have to be crazy to want your bombedout world back the skeleton clacked his teeth svetz saw the red of his mouth horribly incongruous in the white skull svelz you havent asked me how long ive been a ghost how long then theres no way to measure svetz im anchored to seventeen post atomic i wait i get eight months or so beyond the cuban missile crisis and then everything slows down and stops i think its been thousands of years more can you imagine anything more horrible its a frozen world people like statues pigeons nailed to the air im frozen too i dont get old i dont get hungry sunlight goes right through me see how white my skin is and i cant die im not real enough to die id have gone crazy long ago if it werent for the time machines reynoldss eyes burned black within the pits of his skull the time machines i see them going and coming svetz some from your line of history some from others yours is the real future the future i made but i can ride the others too mostly i ride them into the past as far as theyll go that way time passes normally for me until seventeen post atomic rolls around again ive been through the middle ages a dozen times funny thing svetz im invisible to most people but anyone can see me if hes about to die maybe because hes about to leave time entirely it doesnt matter what line of history hes on or im on reynolds laughed i think some of them die because they see me heart failure svetz shuddered reynolds was probably right reynolds said not funny eh ive been in the future too dozens of futures svetz did you know that your time machines go sidewise in time we had one that did it was damaged they all do they wobble the selfpowered ones get lost the ones that are anchored to their own lines of history like yours they always get pulled back no matter how far they slip across alternate probabilities ive seen some strange futures svetz paradises alien invasions one where elephants were civilized ive been in your future reynolds said bitterly long enough to learn speech long enough to see what youve done to the world i made you what do you mean what do i mean everythings dirty everythings dead you killed off everything but yourselves and that gray sludge you eat dole yeast dole yeast i know a short word that would fit it better ive watched you ejecting that sludge from your mouths what i was going backward in time of course waiting to slide back to seventeen post atomic the fun goes out of that awfully fast i dont like hopping time machines into the future not unless i can get a ride back but i do it anyway theres always the chance a time machine will wobble across my own line of history then i could get off or even stop the machine and it paid off didnt it i dont understand you havent looked outside at all have you svetz for the first time svetz looked part reynolds the extension cage rested on a plain of cracked black glass nothing grew far in the distance was a line of svetz abruptly realized that it was a rim wall they were in something like a lunar crater this is your world thats right im home i cant say i like it much reynolds laughed his hollow grating laugh its cleaner than your world svetz if id known youd kill off everything on earth poison the land and the water and the air well never mind well fix that what do you mean all youve got to do is step outside youre home but it isnt real i need you to make it real this is the only time ive ever been able to affect a time machine youre my only chance svetz but i told you svetz this is a stun gun it cant hurt anyone but it can hold you still while i immobilize you after that well ive spent considerable time in medieval torture chambers wait wait what year did you leave from what was the date when you left to stop the short war ah twenty ninetytwo you wouldnt think to look at me that i was only twentytwo years old would you i havent aged since what date post atomic lets see one fortyseven the inertial calendar read all right you can hitch a ride on your own time machine it leaves thirteen years from now we cant move back in time but we can jump forward svetz reached for the gohome in the same instant his arm became dead meat dropping limply back to his side reynolds said but if we tried to go into the future wed likely slip sidewise wouldnt we and then the pattern of events would have been different and i wouldnt exist any more would i so it was certainly worth a try thought svetz he said what are you going to do wait thirteen years if i have to reynolds clacked his teeth apparently it was his only expression it must make do for a smile a scowl a thoughtful look hah i can do better than that svetz can you get me to australia will this thing travel in space coordinates yes im going to change guns reynolds stood examined the equipment lining the curved wall selected a weapon a heavy needle gun it wouldnt kill an elephant maybe but theres anaesthetic enough in here to kill a man yah said svetz he felt very afraid and now well go australia the eastern coast was a cityscape of streets and oblong buildings its the only place on earth thats even marginally habitable said reynolds its mostly empty now and he directed svetz south along the coast he had not stopped talking during the entire flight he sprawled motionless as a laboratory exhibit the gun propped casually on one kneecap while he poured out a steady monologue of reminiscence of course i have a poor opinion of mankind he was saying in answer to one of his own questions why not if youd seen people under stress as often as i have in overcrowded hospitals in torture chambers on scaffolds and headsmans blocks on battlefieldsyoud know people take stress badly especially on battlefields now i may have a biased viewpoint i suppose i should spend more time at square dances and new years eve parties and palace balls places where people laugh a lot but svetz who would i talk to nobody can see me or hear me unless hes about to die and then they wont listen men bear suffering so badly and theyre so afraid to die ive tried to tell them how lucky they are to be able to buy eternal peace at the price of a few hours of agony ive talked to millions of men and women and children over tens of thousands of years the only ones who listen are the children sometimes svetz are you afraid of death yes idiot are you sure you know where were going oh well find it svetz dont worry were looking for the school a school what for youll see theres only one school svetz its far too big for the number of children you know sometimes the people i talk to seem to recognize me but then they always behave like idiots dont take me as if i had something to do with it ive had men offer me goldhow would i carry it and what the women offer me makes even less sense if theyd only use their own senses reynolds pointed there that wide parkland wide it was vast all green grass and the green heads of trees svetz was reminded of the jungle where hed found the armadillo but this greenery was neater and there were white buildings showing here and there thats the zoo that low building all the real animals are dead but we have mechanical mockups there the athletic field see the white lines on the grass veer right we want the lower grade schoolyard there were children in the schoolyard but not many and they werent playing much many were distorted their deformities obvious even at this altitude one nine year old was terribly thin he looked like a small ambulatory skeleton hold her steady said reynolds open the door no suddenly svetz understood open the door the bore of reynoldss gun looked straight into svetzs eyes svetz opened the door when reynolds turned to the door svetz jumped him his dead arm threw him off balance reynoldss gun butt caught him under the jaw svetz fell back with lights exploding in his head when his head cleared reynolds was braced in the doorway svetz struggled to his knees reynolds fired into the playground svetz staggered toward him with his good hand outstretched reynolds fired again then he noticed svetz and brought the gun around svetz lurched forward to catch the muzzle reynolds fought madly to turn the gun he couldnt svetz weak as a kitten and ready to die was still too strong for him when reynolds suddenly kicked svetz under the jaw it was like being hit with foam plastic six feet tall and a fifty pound weakling svetz jerked the gun toward him out of reynoldss grip and threw it behind him reynolds staggered helplessly after it svetz reached out and took him by the neck if he closed his fist reynolds would be dead there was no muscle to protect his windpipe svetz looked down the skeleton boy was sprawled beside a green bench surrounded by boys and girls and small indeterminate beings he looked dead svetz wasted some time trying to think of something to do then he moved two levers with his foot gravity changed reynolds struggled furiously for moment and then svetzs hand was empty something foggy seemed to be tugging at the emergency stop svetz watched it fade but then he got away with it said ra chen svetz shrugged i did my best to stop him you dont get it he killed himself he stopped himself from ever going back in time to stop the short war svelz nodded thenwe arent real the short war happened and reynoldss line of history happened and ours didnt so how can you be here at all the time machine pulled me home an extension cage cant get lost not if its anchored to its own present ra chens eyes were haunted but if reynolds aborted our past if we dont have a history any more then metaphysics what if we arent real what if we never were real sir you feel real dont you so do i we can always tell ourselves that project retake went ahead without reynolds but or maybe the boy lived he had no hair and practically no scalp if reynolds shot him in the head the anaesthetic crystal would just ricochet off his skull right and knock him out um i like that if the kid was dead at age nine reynolds would have disappeared right wrong futz it ra chen snarled if he made himself unreal he made you unreal too why shouldnt you go on seeing him come here a minute svetz pulled at ra chens arm without effect but after a moment ra chen followed him voluntarily beyond the glass wall that fronted the itr building half a dozen broken buildings surrounded the broken corpse of a bird the bird was several blocks long and several weeks dead now dont you have enough to worry about besides whether youre real or not futz yes weve got to do something about that roc said ra chen there it lies in full view of the united nations palace flash crowd from edge to edge and for all of its length from central los angeles through beverly hills and west los angeles and santa monica to the sea wilshire boulevard was a walkway once there had been white lines on concrete and raised curbs to stop the people from interfering with the cars now the lines were gone and much of the concrete was covered with soil and grass there were even a few trees concrete strips had been left for bicycles and wider places for helicopters carrying cargo too big for the displacement booths wilshire was wide for a walkway people seemed to hug the edges even those on bikes and motor skates a boulevard built for cars was too big for mere people outlines of the street still showed through ridges in the grass marked where curbs had been with breaks where there had been driveways some stretches in westwood had a concrete center divider the freeway ramps were unchanged and unused someday the city would do something about them jerryberry jansen lived in what had been a seaside motel halfway between bakersfield and san francisco on longago summer nights the shady rest had been packed with transients at ten dollars a head now it made a dandy apartment house with swimming pool and everything including a displacement booth outside the managers office there was a girl in the booth when jerryberry left his apartment he glimpsed long wavy brown hair and the shape of her back in the instant before she disappeared janice wolfe too bad she hadnt waited but she hadnt even seen him nobody was ever around the booths long enough to say hello to you could meet someone by hovering outside the booths but what would they think meeting people was for the clubs a displacement booth was a glass cylinder with a rounded top the machinery that made the magic was invisible buried beneath the booth coin slots and a telephone dial were set into the glass at sternum level jerryberry inserted his cb a credit card below the coin slots he dialed by punching numbered buttons withdrawing the credit card closed a circuit an eye blink later he was in an office in the central broadcasting association building in downtown los angeles the office was big and empty only once in an aeon was all that empty space ever used though several score of newstapers saw it for a few seconds each day one wall was lined with displacement booths a curved desk down at the end was occupied by jerryberrys boss george bailey was fat from too much sitting and darkly tanned by the nevada sun he commuted to work every morning via the longdistance booths at los angeles international today he waved at jerryberry without speaking routine then jerryberry chose one of several cameras and slung the padded strap over his shoulder he studied several lists of numbers posted over the table before picking one he turned and moved to avoid three more newstapers stepping out of booths they nodded he nodded they passed as he reached for a booth door a woman flicked in in front of him rush hour he smiled at her and stepped over to the next booth consulted the list dialed and was gone he had not spoken to anyone that morning the east end of wilshire boulevard was a most ordinary tintersection between high blocky buildings jerryberry looked around even as he was dialing nothing newsworthy no he was two blocks away and dialing he punched the numbered buttons with a ballpoint pen when he remembered nonetheless his index finger was calloused the streets of the inner city were empty this early in a minute or so jerryberry was in sight of the freeway he stepped out of the booth to watch trucks and bulldozers covering this part of the pasadenaharbor freeway with topsoil old machines find new usebut others were covering the event he moved on the booths were all identical he might have been in a fullvision theater watching scenes flick around him he was used to the way things jerked about he flicked west on wilshire waiting for something to happen it was a cheap effective way to gather news at a chocolate dollar per jump per man c b a could afford to support a score of wandering newstapers in addition to the regular staff they earned low salaries plus a bonus for each news item plus a higher bonus per item used the turnover was high it had been higher before cba learned not to jumble the numbers at random an orderly progression down a single street was easier on the mind and nerves jerryberry jansen knew every foot of wilshire at twentyeight he was old enough to remember cars and trucks and traffic lights when the city changed it was the streets that had changed most he watched wilshire change as he dialed at the old hatshaped brown derby they were converting the parking lot into a miniature golf course about time they did something with all that wasted space he queried bailey but bailey wasnt interested the miracle mile was a landscaped section suddenly there were people throngs of shoppers so thick that many preferred to walk a block instead of waiting for a booth they seemed stratified with the older people hugging the curbs and the teens taking the middle of the street jerryberry had noticed it before as a child hed been trained to cross only in the crosswalks with the light sometimes his training came back and he found himself looking both ways before he could step out from the curb he moved on west following the list of numbers that was his beat the mall had been a walkway when displacement booths were no more than a theorem in quantum mechanics dips in the walk showed where streets had crossed but the santa monica mall had always been a sanctuary for pedestrians and windowshoppers here were several blocks of shops and restaurants and theaters low buildings that did not block the sky displacement booths were thick here people swarmed constantly around and in and out of them some travelers carried foldup bicycles many wore change purses from noon onward there was always the tension of too many people trying to use the same space for the same purpose the argument started outside penneys department store at the time one could see only that the police officer was being firm and the woman middleaged big and brawnywas screaming at the top of her lungs a crowd grew not because anyone gave a damn but because the two were blocking the walkway people had to stream around them some of them stopped to see what was happening many later remembered hearing the policeman repeating madam i place you under arrest on suspicion of shoplifting anything you say in a voice that simply did not carry if the officer had used his shockstick then nothing more would have happened maybe then again he might have been mobbed already the crowd blocked the entire mall and too many of them were shoutinggenial or sarcastic suggestions random insults and a thousand variations of get out of my way and i cant you idiot for any to be heard at all at jerryberry jansen flicked in and looked quickly about him while his hands were reinserting his credit card his eyes registered the ancient shops at the end of the mall and lingered a moment on the entrance to romanoffs anyone newsworthy sometimes they came the big names for the cuisine or the publicity nopassed on jumped to the crowd in front of penneys two blocks down there were booths nearer but he didnt know the numbers offhand jerryberry picked up his card and stepped out of the booth he signaled the studio but didnt bother to report circumstantial details he could give later but he turned on his camera and the event was now real he jogged the two blocks whatever was happening might end without him a young bemused face turned at jerryberrys hail excuse me sir can you tell me how this started nope sony i just got here said the young man and he strolled off he would be edited from the tape but other heads were turning noticing the arrival of a lean young man with an open curious friendly face topped by redblond hair curly as cotton a tiny mike at his lips a small plug in one ear a coin purse at his belt in his hands a heavy gyrostabilized teevee camera equipped with a directional mike a newstaper one pair of eyes turned for an instant too long the woman swung her purse the policemans arm came up too late to block the purse which bounced solidly off his head something heavy in that purse the policeman dropped things happened very fast jerryberry talked rapidly to himself while he panned the camera occasional questions in his earpiece did not interrupt the flow of his report though they guided it the gyrostabiized camera felt like a living thing in his hands it followed the woman with the heavy purse as she pushed her way through the crowd shot jerryberry a venomous look and ran for a displacement booth it watched someone break a jewelers window snatch up a handful of random jewelry and run the directional mike picked up the scream of an alarm the police officer was still down jerryberry went to help him it occurred to him that of those present the policeman was most likely to know what had been going on the voice in his earpiece told him that others were on their way even as his eye found them leaving the booths faces he knew on men carrying cameras like his own he knelt beside the policeman officer can you tell me what happened the uniformed man looked up with hurt bewildered eyes he said something that the directional mike picked up but jerryberrys ears lost it in the crowd noise he heard it later on the news wheres my hat jerryberry repeated what happened here while a dozen cba men around him were interviewing the crowd and police were pouring out of the displacement booths the flow of blue uniforms looked like far more than they were they had to use their shocksticks to get through the crowd some of the spectatorsshoppersstrollers had decided to leave a wise decision but impractical the nearest booths could not be used at all they held passengers cased in glass each trying to get his door open against the press of the mob every few seconds one would give up and flick out and another trapped passenger would be pushing at the door for blocks around there was no way to get into a displacement booth as fast as anyone left a booth someone else would flick in most were nondescript citizens who came to gape a few carried big cardboard rectangles carelessly printed in fluorescent colors often with the paint still wet a different few nondescript otherwise had rocks in their pockets for jerryberry kneeling above the felled policeman and trying to get audible sense out of him it all seemed to explode he looked up and it was a riot its a riot he said awed the directional mike picked it up the crowd surged and he was moving he looked back trying to see if the policeman had gained his feet if he hadnt he could be hurt but the crowd surged away in this mob there was no conservation of matter there were sources and sinks in it and today all the sinks were sources the flow had to go somewhere a young woman pushed herself close to jerryberry her eyes were wide her hair was wild a kind of rage a kind of joy made her face a battlefield legalize directcurrent stimulus she screamed at him she lunged and caught the snout of jerryberrys camera and mike and pulled it around to face her legalize wireheading jerryberry wrenched the camera free he turned it toward the big display window in penneys the glass was gone men crawled in the display window looting jerryberry held the camera high taking pictures of them over the bobbing heads he had the scene for a momentand then three signs shot up in front of the camera one said tanstaafl and one bore a mushroom cloud and the words power corrupts and jerryberry never read the third because the crowd surged again and he had to scramble to keep his feet there were men and women and children being trampled here he could be one of them how had it happened hed seen it all but he didnt understand he tried to keep the camera over his head he got a big brawny hairy type carrying a stack of teevees under his arm half a dozen twentyinch sets almost an inch thick the thief saw the camera facing him and the solenm face beneath and he roared and lunged toward jerryberry jerryberry abruptly realized that there were people here who would not want to be photographed the big man had dropped his teevees and was plowing toward him with murder on his face jerryberry had to drop his camera to get away when he looked back the big man was smashing the camera against a lamp post idiot the scene was on tape now in the cba buildings in los angeles and in denver the riot splashed outward jerryberry perforce went with it he concentrated on keeping his feet the explosive growth of the mall riot has taken enforcement agencies by surprise police have managed to hold the perimeter and are letting people through the lines but necessarily in small numbers the screen showed people being filtered through a police blockade one at a time they looked tired stunned one had two pockets full of stolen wristwatches he did not protest when they confiscated the watches and led him away a blankeyed girl maintained a death grip on a rough wooden stick glued to a cardboard rectangle the cardboard was crumpled and torn the dayglo colors smeared meanwhile all displacement booths in the area have been shut down from outside the enclosed area includes fourteen city blocks viewers are warned away from the following areas these scenes were taken by cba helicopter most of the street lights were out those left cast monstrous shadows through the mall orange flames flickered in the windows of a furniture store diminutive figures angered by spotlights in the helicopter pointed and shouted silently into the camera viewpoint the deep earnest voice went on we are getting no transmissions from inside the affected area a dozen cba newsmen and an undisclosed number of police in the area have not been heard from many of the rioters are armed a cba helicopter was shot down early today but was able to crashland beyond the perimeter close shot of a helicopter smashed against a brick wall two men being carried out on stretchers in obvious haste the source of weapons is not known police conjecture that they may have been looted from kerrs sport shop which has a branch in the mall how did it all start the square brown face looking out of the tridee screen was known throughout the englishspeaking world when news was good that wide mouth would smile enormously the filter cigarette in the middle of it smoldering delicately between white front teeth it was not smiling now that expression was more earnest it was shaken jerryberry jansen looked back with no expression at all he had thrown away his camera and seen it destroyed he had dropped his coin purse and ear mike into a trash can not being a newsman was a good idea during the mall riot now an hour after the police had let him through he was still wandering aimlessly he had no goal almost he had thrown away his identity he stood in front of an appliancestore window watching teevee the deep precise voice of wash evans was audible through the glassbarely how did it all start evans vanished and jerryberry watched scenes taken by his own camera a milling crowd mostly trying to get past a disturbance a blue uniformed man a brawny woman with a heavy purse the officer was trying to arrest a suspected shoplifter who has not been identified when this man appeared on the scene picture of jerryberry jansen camera held high caught in the view of another cba camera barry jerome jansen a roving newstaper it was he who reported the disturbance and reported it as a riot to this man bailey at his desk in the cba building jerryberry twitched sooner or later he would have to report to bailey and explain where his camera had gone hed picked up some good footage and it was being used a string of bonuses waiting for him unless bailey docked him for the cost of the camera george lincoln bailey sent in a crew to cover the disturbance he also put the report on teevee practically live editing it as it came at this point anyone with a teevee anywhere in the united states could see the violence being filmed by a dozen veteran cba newstapers the square dark face returned and then it all blew up the population of the mall expanded catastrophically and they all started breaking things why wash evans flashed a white grin with a cigarette in it well it seems that there are people who like riots jerryberry cocked his head he had never heard it put quite like that now that seems silly who would want to be caught in a riot wash evans had long expressive fingers with pink nails he began ticking off items on his fingers first more police to stop whats being reported as a riot second more newstapers third anyone who wants publicity on the screen behind wash evans signs shot out of a sea of moving heads a girls face swelled enormously so close she seemed all mouth and shrieked legalize wireheading anyone with a cause anyone who wants the ear of the public there are newsmen here man and cameras and publicity behind evans the scene jumped that was angela monk coming out of a displacement booth angela monk the semiporno movie actress very beautiful in a dress of loosemesh net made from white braided yarn very selfpossessed in the split second before she saw what shed flicked into she tried to dodge back inside and to hell with the free coverage a yell went up hands pulled the door open before she could dial again other hands pulled her out then there are people who have never seen a riot in person a lot of them came what they think about it now is something else again now all of these might not be a big fat percentage of the public how many people would be dumb enough to come watch a riot but that little percentage they all came at once from all over the united states and some other places too and the more there were the bigger the crowd got the louder it gotthe better it looked to the looters evans folded down his remaining finger and the looters came from everywhere too these days you can get from anywhere to anywhere in three flicks scenes shifted in evanss background store windows being smashed a subdued wail of sirens a cba helicopter thrashing bout in midair an ape of a man carrying stolen tridees under one ann evans looked soberly out at his audience so there you have it an unidentified shoplifting suspect a roving newsman who reported a minor disturbance as a riot good god jerryberry jansen was jolted completely awake theyre blaming me theyre blaming me too said george bailey he ran his hands through his hair glossy shoulderlength white hair that grew in a fringe around a dome of suntanned scalp youre second in the chain im tired if only they could find the woman who hit the cop they havent not a sign of her jansen you look like hell i should have changed suits this ones been through a riot jerryberrys laugh sounded forced and was im glad you waited it must be way past your quitting time oh no weve been in conference all night we only broke up about twenty minutes ago damn wash evans anyway have you heard i heard some of it a couple of the directors want to fire him not unlike the ancient technique of using gasoline to put out a fire there were some even wilder suggestions have you seen a doctor im not hurt just bruised and tired and hungry come to think of it i lost my camera youre lucky you got out alive i know george bailey seemed to brace himself i hate to be the one to tell you were going to have to let you go jansen what you mean fire me yah public pressure i wont make it pretty for you wash evanss instant documentary has sort of torn things open it seems you caused the mall riot it would be nice if we could say we fired you for it butbut i didnt yes you did think about it bailey wasnt looking at him so did i cba may have to fire me too now jerryberry stopped and started overnow wait a minute if youre saying what i think youre saying but what about freedom of the press we talked about that too i didnt exaggerate what was happening i reported aa disturbance when it turned into a riot i called it a riot did i lie about anything anything oh in a way bailey said in a tired voice youve got your choice about where to point that camera you pointed it where there was fighting didnt you and i picked out the most exciting scenes when we both finished it looked like a small riot fighting everywhere then everyone who wanted to be in the middle of a small riot came flicking in just like evans said and in thirty seconds we had a large riot you know what somebody suggested a time limit on news a law against reporting anything until twentyfour hours after it happens can you imagine anything sillier for ten thousand years the human race has been working to send news farther and faster and now oh hell jansen i dont know about freedom of the press but the riots still going on and everyones blaming you youre fired thanks jerryberry surged out of his chair on what felt like the last of his strength bailey moved just as fast but by the time he got around the desk jerryberry was inside a booth dialing he stepped out into a warm black night he felt sick and miserable and very tired it was two in the morning his paper suit was torn and crumpled and clammy george bailey stepped out of the booth behind him thought so now jansen lets talk sense how did you know id be here i had to guess youd come straight home jansen you wont suffer for this you may make money on it cb a wants an exclusive interview on the riot your viewpoint thirtyfive hundred bucks screw that in addition theres two weeks severance pay and a stack of bonuses we used a lot of your tape and when this blows over im sure well want you back blows over huh oh it will news gets stale awfully fast these days i know jansen why dont you want thirtyfive hundred bucks youd play me up as the man who started the mall riot make me more valuable wait a minute who have you got in mind for the interview who else wash evans hes fair youd get your say bailey considered him let me know if you change your mind youd have a chance to defend yourself and youd get paid besides no chance all right bailey went for eric jansen and his family displacement booths came as a disaster at first he didnt see it that way he was twentyeight when jumpshift inc demonstrated the augmented tunnel diode effect on a lead brick he watched it on television he found the prospects exciting eric jansen had never worked for a salary he wrote poetry and articles and a few short stories highly polished admired by a small circle of readers sold at infrequent intervals to lowpaying markets that he regarded as prestigious his money came from inherited stocks if he had invested in jumpshift thenbut millions could tell that sad story it was too risky then he was thirtyone when commercial displacement booths began to be sold for cargo transport he was not caught napping many did not believe that the magic could work until suddenly the phenomenon was changing their world but eric jansen looked into the phenomenon very carefully he found that there was an inherent limitation on the augmented tunnel diode effect teleportation over a difference in altitude made for drastic temperature changes a drop of seven degrees fahrenheit for every mile upward and vice versa due to conservation of energy conservation of momentum plus the rotation of the earth put a distance limit on lateral travel a passenger flicking east would find himself kicked upward by the difference between his velocity and the earths flicking west he would be slapped down north and south he would be kicked sideways cargo and passenger displacement booths were springing up in every city in america but eric jansen knew that they would always be restricted to short distances even a tenmile jump would be bumpy a passenger flicking halfway around the equator would have to land runningat half a mile per second jumpshift stock was skyhigh eric jansen decided it must be overpriced he considered carefully then made his move he sold all of his general telephone stock if anyone wanted to talk to someone he would just go wouldnt he a displacement booth took no longer than a phone call he tried to sell his general motors wisely but everyone else wisely made the same decision and the price fell like a dead bird at least he got something back on the stock he owned in motorcycle and motorscooter companies later he regretted that it developed that people rode motorcycles and scooters for fun now with the streets virtually empty they were buying more than ever still he had fluid cashand the opportunity to make a killing airline stock had dropped with other forms of transportation before the general public could realize its mistake eric jansen invested every dime in airlines and aircraft companies the first displacement booths in any city were links to the airport that lousy halfhour drive from the center of town the heavy taxi fare in were gone forever and the booths couldnt compete with the airlines themselves of course you still had to check in earlyand the planes took off only at specified times what it amounted to was that plane travel was made easier but shortdistance travel via displacement booth was infinitely easier and planes still crashed cassettes had copped the entertainment market so that television was mostly news these days you didnt have to go anywhere to find out what was happening just turn on the tv a plane flight wasnt worth the hassle as for the telephone stock people still made longdistance calls they tended to phone first before they went visiting they would give out a phonebooth number whereas they would not give out a displacement booth number the airlines survived somehow but they paid rockbottom dividends barry jerome jansen grew up poor in the midst of a boom period his father hated the displacement booths but used them because there was nothing else jerryberry accepted that irrational hatred as part of his fathers personality he did not share it he hardly noticed the displacement booths they were part of the background the displacement booths were the most important part of a newstapers life and still he hardly noticed their existence until the day they turned on him in the morning there were messages stored in his phone he heard them out over breakfast half a dozen news services and tapezines wanted exclusives on the riot one call was from bailey at cba the price had gone up to four thousand the others did not mention price but one was from playboy that gave him furiously to think playboy paid high and they liked unpopular causes three people wanted to murder him on two of them the teevee was blanked the third was a graying dowdy woman all fat and hate and disappointed hopes who showed him a kitchen knife and started to tell him what she wanted to do with it jerryberry cut her off shuddering he wondered if any of them could possibly get hold of his displacementbooth number there was a check in the mail severance pay and bonuses from cba so that was that he was setting the dishes in the dishwasher when the phone rang he hesitated then decided to answer it was janice wolfea pretty oval face brown eyes a crown of long wavy soft brown hairand not an anonymous killer she lost her smile as she saw him you look grim could you use some cheering up yes jerryberry said fervently come on over apartment six booth number i live here remember he laughed hed forgotten you got used to people living anywhere and everywhere george bailey lived in nevada he commuted to work every morning in three flicks using the longdistance displacement booths at las vegas and los angeles international airports those longdistance booths had saved the airlinesafter his father had dribbled away most of his stocks to feed his family they had been operating only two years and come to think of it doorbell over coffee he told janice about the riot she listened sympathetically asking occasional questions to draw him out at first jerryberry tried to talk entertainingly until he realized first that she wasnt indulging in a spectator sport and second that she knew all about the riot already she knew hed been fired too thats why i called they put it on the morning news she told him it figures what are you going to do now get drunk alone if have to would you like to spend a lost weekend with me she hesitated youll be bitter yah i probably will not fit to live with hey janice do you know anything about how the longdistance displacement booths work no should i the mall riot couldnt have happened without the longdistance booths that damn wash evans might at least have mentioned the fact except that i only just thought of it myself funny there hasnt ever been a riot that happened that quick ill come with you janice decided what good you dont start drinking this early in the morning do you i guess not are you free today every day during summer i teach school oh so whatll we do san diego zoo he suggested at random sounds like fun they made no move to get up it felt peaceful in jerryberrys tiny kitchen nook there was still coffee you could get a bad opinion of me this way i feel like tearing things up go ahead mean it me too she said serenely you need to tear things up fine go ahead after that you can try to put your life back together just what kind of school do you teach janice laughed fifth grade there was quiet you know what the punch line is wash evans wants to interview me after that speech he made that sounds like a good idea she said surprisingly gives you a chance to give your side of the story you didnt really cause the mall riot did you no no janice hes just too damn good hed make mincemeat of me by the time he got through id be the man who caused the mall riot in every englishspeaking country in the world and some others too because he gets translations hes just a commentator jerryberry started to laugh he makes it look so easy he said a hundred million eyes out there watching him and he knows it have you ever seen him selfconscious have you ever heard him at a loss for words my dad used to say it about writing but its true for wash evans the hardest trick in the world is to make it look easy so easy that any clod thinks he can do it just as well hell i know what caused the mall riot the news program yes hes right there but the longdistance displacement booth did it too control those and we could stop that kind of riot from ever happening again but what could i tell wash evans about it what do i know about displacement booths well what do you know jerryberry jansen looked into his coffee cup for a long time presently he said i know how to find out things i know how to find out who knows most about what and then go ask legwork they hammered at it in the journalism classes i know legwork he looked up and met her eyes then he lunged across the table to reach the phone hello oh hi jansen changed your mind yes but good good ill put you through to yes but oh okay go ahead i want some time to do some research now damn it jensen you know that time is just what we dont have old news is no news what kind of research displacement booths why that never mind its your business how much time how much can you afford damn little bailey cba upped my price to four thousand this morning how come you didnt see it its on every screen in the country the rioters broke through the police line theyve got a good section of venice now and there are about twice as many of them because the police didnt shut down the displacement booths in the area until about twenty minutes too late twenty minutes bailey seemed actually to be grinding his teeth we held off reporting the breakthrough until they could do it we did ab s reported it live on all stations thats where all the new rioters came from then it looks like the mall riot is going to last a little longer that it does and you want more time things are working out arent they then sorry those abs bastards how much time do you want as much as i can get a week youve got to be kidding you maybe can get twentyfour hours only i cant make the decision why dont you talk to evans himself fine put him on the teevee went on hold paleblue flow patterns floated upward in what had become a twentyinch kaleidoscope waiting jerryberry said if this riot gets any bigger i could be more famous than hitler janice set his coffee beside him she said or mrs olearys cow the screen came on jansen can you get over here right now wash evans wants to talk to you in person okay jerryberry clicked off he felt a thrumming inside him as if he felt the motion of the world and the world were spinning faster and faster surely things were happening fast janice said no lost weekend not yet love have you any idea what youve let me in for i may not sleep for days ill have to find out what teleportation is what it does where do i start wash evans youd better get moving right he bolted his coffee in three swift gulps thanks thanks for coming over thanks for jarring me off the dime well see how it works out he went pulling on a coat wash evans was five feet four inches tall people sometimes forgot that size was invisible in a teevee closeup in the middle of a televised interview when the camera was flashing back and forth between two angry faces then the deep sure voice and the dark mobile expressive face of wash evans could be devastatingly convincing wash evans looked up at jerryberry jansen and said ive been wondering if i owe you an apology take your time said jerryberry he finished buttoning his coat i dont fact is i psyched out the mall riot as best i knew how and i think i did it right i didnt tell the great unwashed public you caused it all i just told it like it happened you left some things out all right now weve got something to talk about sit down they sat their faces were level now jerryberry said this present conversation is not for publication and is not to be considered an interview i have an interview to sell i dont want to undercut myself i accept your terms on behalf of the network well give you a tape of this conversation im making my own jerryberry tapped his inside pocket which clicked wash evans grinned of course you are my child now what did i miss displacement booths well sure if the booths had been cut off earlier if the booths didnt exist youre kidding no youre not jansen thats a wishing horse displacement booths are here to stay i know but think about this newstapers have been around longer than displacement booths roving newstapers like meweve been using the booths since they were invented so why didnt the mall riot happen earlier i see what you mean hmm the airport booths jansen are you actually going to face the great unwashed teevee public and tell them to give up longdistance displacement booths no i dont know just what i have in mind thats why i want some time i want to know more uhhuh said evans and waited jerryberry said turn it around are you going to try to talk the public into giving up news programs no maybe to put some restrictions on newstaping practices were too fast these days a machine wont work without friction neither does a civilization but wed ruin the networks wouldnt we youd cut your own throat oh id be out evans mashed out a cigarette take away the news broadcasts and they wouldnt have anything left to sell but educational teevee nothing to sell but toys and breakfast cereal jansen i dont know good said jerryberry you question my dispassionate judgment evans chuckled in his throat im on both sides suppose we do an interview live at ten tonight thatll give you twelve hours twelve hours thats enough isnt it you want to research teleportation i want to get this in while people are still interested in the riot not just for the ratings but because we both have something to say jerryberry tried to interrupt but evans overrode him well advance you a thousand and three more if we do the interview nothing if we dont thatll get you back on time jerryberry accepted it one thing can you make bailey forget to cancel my cba card for a while i may have to do a lot of traveling ill tell him i dont know if hell do it he flicked in at los angeles international offcenter in a long curved row of displacement booths upright glass cylinders with rounded tops no different from the booths on any street corner on the opposite wall a good distance away large red letters said twa he stood a moment thinking then he dialed again he was home at the shady rest he dialed again he was near the end of the rowa different row with no curve to it and the opposite wall bore the emblem of united the terminal was empty except for one man in a blue uniform who was waxing the floor jerryberry stepped out for upwards of a minute he watched the line of booths people flicked in at random generally they did not even look up they would dial a long string of digitssometimes making a mistake snarling something and starting overand be gone there were so many that the booths themselves seemed to be flickering he took several seconds of it on the minox beneath the united emblem was along long row of empty counters with scales between them for luggage the terminal was spotlessand empty unused haunted by a constant flow of ghosts a voice behind him said you want something is there a managers office the uniformed man pointed down an enormous length of corridor the maintenance sections down that way where the boarding area used to be ill call ahead let them know youre coming the corridor was long unnecessarily long and it echoed the walk was eating up valuable time and then an open cart came from the other end and silently pulled up alongside him a straightbacked old man in a onebutton business lounger said hello want a ride thanks jerryberry climbed aboard he handed over his cba credit card im doing some research for aa documentary of sorts what can you tell me about the longdistance booths anything you like im nils kjerulf i helped install these booths and ive been working on them ever since how do they work where do i start do you know how a normal booth works sure the load isnt supposed to exist at all between the two endpoints like the electron in a tunnel diode an answer right out of the science section of any tapezine beyond that he could fake it this nils kjerulf was lean and ancient with deep smile wrinkles around his eyes and mouth his hair was thick and white he said they had to give up that theory when youre sending a load to mars say you have to assume that something exists in the ten minutes or so it takes the load to make the trip conservation of energy all right what is it for ten minutes its a kind of superneutrino thats what they tell me im not a physicist i was in business administration in college a few years ago they gave me a year of retraining so i could handle longdistance displacement machinery if youre really interested in theory you ought to ask someone at cape canaveral here we are two escalators one going up one motionless they rode up jerryberry asked why didnt they build closer think of all the walking wed save you never heard a taking off sound is only part of it if a plane ever crashed here nobody would want it hitting all the main buildings at once the escalator led to two semicircular chambers one was empty but for a maze of chairs and couches and low partitions all done in old chrome and fading orange in the other the couches had been ripped out and replaced with instrument consoles jerryberry counted half a dozen men supervising the displays a dim snoring sound began somewhere like an electric razor going in the nextdoor apartment jerryberry turned his head seeking it was outside outside behind a wall of windows a tiny singleengine plane taxied down a runway yes we still function as an airport said nils kjerulf skydiving sport flying gliding i fly some myself the jumbojet pilots used to hate us we use up just as much landing time as a now weve got the runways to ourselves i gather you were a manager somewhere right here iran this terminal before anyone had heard of teleportation i watched it ruin us thirty years mr jansen with no offense intended whatever why did they train a professional administrator in quantum displacement physics why not the other way around there werent any experts where the longdistance booths were concerned mr jansen theyre new what have you learned in two years do you still get many breakdowns we still do every two weeks or so something goes out of synch then we go out of service for however long it takes to find it and fix itusually about an hour and what happens to the passenger kjerulf looked surprised nothing he stays where he startedor rather that giant neutrino we were talking about is reflected back to the transmitter if the receiver cant pick it up the worst thing that can happen is that the link to the velocity damper could be lost in which casebut weve developed safeguards against that no the passengers just stop coming in and we go out of service and the other companies take the overflow there isnt any real competition between the companies anymore whats the point twa and united and eastern and the rest used to advertise that they had better meals in flight more comfortable seats prettier hostesses like that how long do you spend in a displacement booth so when we converted over we set the dialing system up so you just dial los angeles international or whatever and the companies get customers at random everyone saves a fortune in advertising an antitrust suit would have us dead to rights nobodys done it because theres no point it works the way we run it each company has its own velocity shift damper we couldnt all get knocked out at once in an emergency i think any of the companies could handle all of the longdistance traffic mr kjerulf what is a velocity shift damper kjerulf looked startled jerryberry said i took journalism ah its not just curiosity my dad lost a fortune on airline stock so did i said kjerulf halfsmiling with old pain oh sometimes i feel ive sold out the booths couldnt possibly compete with the airlines could they they wouldnt send far enough yet they ruined us my dad figured the same way and now the booths do send that far and im working for them or theyre working for me there wasnt all that much reason to build the longdistance systems at airports lots of room here of course and an organization already set up but they really did it to save the airline companies a little late perhaps some day theyll turn us into a public utility kjerulf looked about the room then called to a man seated near the flat wall of the semicircle dan yo the man boomed without looking up can you spare me twenty minutes for a publicrelations job the man stood up then climbed up on his chair he looked slowly about the room jerryberry guessed that he could see every instrument board from where he was standing he called sure no sweat they took the cart back to the terminal they entered a booth jerryberry inserted his c b a credit card then waited while kjerulf dialed they were in a concrete building beyond large square windows a sunlit sea of blue water heaved and splashed almost at floor level men looked around curiously recognized nils kjerulf and turned back to their work lake michigan and out there kjerulf pointed jerryberry saw a tremendous white mass a flattened dome very regular a great softly rounded island is the united air lines velocity damper all of the dampers look about like that but they float in different lakes or oceans aeroflot uses the caspian sea the twa damper is in the gulf of mexico just what is it essentially its a hell of a lot of soft iron surrounded by a hell of a lot more foam plastic enough to float it plus a displacementbooth receiver feeding into the iron look see it surge the island rose several feet slowly then fell back as slowly ripples moved outward and became waves as they reached the station that must have been a big load now heres how it works you know that the rotation of the earth puts a limit on how far you can send a load if you were to shift from here to rio de janeiro say youd flick in moving up and sidewaysmainly up because rio and la are almost the same distance from the equator but with the longdistance booths the receiver picks up the kinetic energy and shunts it to the united air lines velocity damper that big mass of iron surges up or down or sideways until the water stops itor someone flicks in from rio and the damping body stops cold jerryberry thought about it what about conservation of rotation it sounds like youre slowing down the earth we are theres nothing sacred about conservation of rotation except that the energy has to go somewhere there are pumps to send water through the damper bodies if they get too hot jerryberry pulled out the minox mind if i take some pictures no go ahead the minox was a movie camera but it would not have the resolution of a press camera no matter if he had the time he could comeback not that he thought he would he took shots of the men at work in the station of nils kjerulf with his back to the windows he shot almost a minute of the great white island itself he was hoping it would surge and presently it did sinking sideways surging up again waves beat at the station a jet of white steam sprayed from the top of the great white mass good he said briskly to himself he folded the spidery tripod legs and dropped the camera in his pocket he turned to kjerulf who had been watching the proceedings with some amusement mr kjerulf can you tell me anything about traffic control is there any how do you mean customs not exactly but tell me about customs the customs terminal in los angeles is at twa you havent been out of the country recently no well any bigcity airport has a customs terminal in a small country theres likely to be just one if you dial a number outside the country any country you wind up in somebodys customs terminal the booths there dont have dials you see you have to cross the customs line to dial out clever are there any restrictions on traffic within the united states no you just drop your chocolate dollars in and dial unless its a police matter if the police know that someones trying to leave the city they may set up a watch in the terminals we can put a delay on the terminals to give a detective time to look at a passengers face and see if hes who they want but nothing to stop passengers from coming in no except that its possible to kjerulf trailed off oddly then finished turn off any booth by remote control from the nearest jumpshift maintenance system what are you thinking of the mall riot there was no more to say he left nils kjerulf in the united terminal in los angeles he dialed for customs for several minutes jerryberry watched them flicking in there were two types the tourists came in couples sometimes with a child or two they flicked in looking interested and harried and a little frightened their clothing was outlandish and extraordinary before they left the booths they would look about them mistrustfully sometimes they formed larger groups the businessmen traveled alone they wore conservative or oldfashioned clothing and carried one suitcase large or small but one they were older than the tourists they moved with authority walking straight out of the booths the moment they appeared at the barner four men in identical dark suits with shieldshaped shoulder patches jerryberry was on the wrong side of the barrier to command their attention he was thinking of dialing himself to mexico and back when one of them noticed him and pegged him as a newstaper his name was gregory scheffer small and round and middleaged he perched on the wooden barner and clasped one knee in both hands sure i can talk awhile this isnt one of the busy days the only time these booths really get a workout is christmas and new year and bastille day and like that look around you he said waving a pudgy hand expansively about four times as many incoming as there was six months ago i used to want to search every bag that came through just to be doing something if we keep getting more and more of them this way well need twice as many customs people next year why do you suppose did you know that the longdistance booths have been operating for two solid years its only in the last six months or so that weve started to get so many passengers they had to get used to traveling again look around you look at all this space it used to be full before jumpshift came along people have got out of the habit of traveling thats all there is to it for twenty solid years they have to get back into it guess so jerryberry tried to remember why he was here mr scheffer greg jerryberry customs main job is to stop smuggling isnt it well it used to be now we only slow it down and not very damn much nobody in his right mind would smuggle anything through customs there are safer ways oh diamonds for instance diamonds are practically indestructible you could rig a cargo booth in kansas to receive from oh theres a point in the south pacific to match anyplace in the united states same longitude opposite latitude you dont need a velocity damper if you put the boat in the right place diamonds you could ship in swiss watches that way though thats pretty finicky youd want to pad them good grief you could smuggle anything you pleased anywhere just about you dont need the ocean trick say you rig a booth a mile south of the canadian border and another booth a mile north thats not much of a jump you can flick further than that just in la i think were obsolete said scheffer i think smuggling laws are obsolete you wont publish this i wont use your name i guess thats okay can you get me over to the incoming booths i want to take some pictures what for im not sure yet lets see some id gregory scheffer didnt trust evasive answers the incoming booths were in his jurisdiction he studied the cba card for a few seconds and suddenly said jansen mall riot right what was it like jerryberry invested half a minute telling him so now im trying to find out how it got started if there were some way to stop all of those people from pouring in like that you wont find it here look a dozen passengers and were almost busy a thousand people suddenly pour through those booths and what would we do hide under something thats what wed do i still want to see the incoming booths scheffer thought it over shrugged and let him through he stood at jerryberrys shoulder while jerryberry used his eye and his camera the booth was just like a streetcorner booth except for the blank metal face where a dial would be i dont know whats underneath scheffer told him for all of me its just like any other booth how much work would it be to leave off the dial which made sense but it was no help at all they tape the tonight show at two in the afternoon twenty minutes into it the first guest is lolling at his ease just rapping talking off the top of his head ignoring the probable hundred million eyes behind the cameras this is a valuable knack and rare tonights first guest is a series hero in a sciencefiction tapezine he is saying have you ever seen a red tide its thick down at hermosa beach i was there this weekend in the daytime its just dirty water muddylooking and it smells but at night this enthusiasm that can reach through a teevee screen to touch fifty million minds this enthusiasm is in no way artificial he means it he only expresses it better than most men he leans forward in his chair his eyes blaze there is harsh tension in his voice the breakers glow like churning blue fire those plankton are fluorescent and theyre all through the wet sand walk across it it flashes blue light under your feet kick it scuff your feet through it it lights up throw a handful of sand it flashes where it hits this light isnt just on the surface stamp your foot you can see the structure of the sand by the way it flares youve got to see it to believe it he says they will run the tape starting at eight thirty tonight standard booths how standardized who makes them besides jumpshaft monopoly how extensive skip spaceflight space exploration depended utterly on teleportation but the subject was likely to be very technical and not very useful he could gain time by skipping it entirely jerryberry considered then turned the question mark into an exclamation point his twelve hours had become nine of the halfdozen key clubs to which he belonged the cave des roys was the quietest a place of stone and wood a good place to sit and think the wall behind the bar was several hundred wine bottles in a cement matrix jerryberry looked into the strange lights in the glass sipped occasionally at a silver fizz and jotted down whatever occurred to him sociology what has teleportation done to society cars oil companies oil stocks see back issues wall street journal watts riot chicago riot he crossed that last one out the chicago riot had been political hadnt it then he couldnt remember any other riots they were too far in the past he wrote riot control police procedure crime the crime rate should have soared after displacement booths provided the instant getaway had it sooner or later he was going to have to drop in at police headquarters hed hate that but he might learn something likewise the library for several hours of dull research then he certainly wasnt going to persuade everybody to give up displacement booths he wrote objective demonstrate that displacement booths imply instant riot its a social problem solve it on that basis for the sake of honesty he added get em off my back crowds in minutes the mall had become a milling mass of men but hed seen crowds form almost as fast it might happen regularly in certain places after a moments thought he wrote tahiti jerusalem mecca easter island stonehenge olduvai gorge he stood up start with the phone calls doctor robin whyte jerryberry said to the phone screen please the receptionist at seven sixes was no sex symbol she was old enough to be jerryberrys aunt and handsome rather than beautiful she heard him out with a noncommittal dignity that he sensed could turn glacial in an instant barry jerome jansen he said carefully he waited on hold watching darkred patterns flow upward in the phone screen key clubs were neither new nor rare some were small and local others were chains existing in a dozen or a hundred locations everyone belonged to a club most people belonged to several but seven sixes was something else its telephone number was known universally its membership large in absolute terms was small for an organization so worldwide it included presidents kings winners of various brands of nobel prize its location wasunknown somewhere in earths temperate zones jerryberry had never heard of its displacement booth number being leaked to anyone it took a special kind of gall for one of jerryberrys social standing to dial he had learned that gall in journalism class go to the source no matter how highly placed be polite be prepared to wait but keep trying and never never worry about wasting the great mans time funny they still called it journalism though newspapers had died and the constitution that had protected newspapers still protected the press for a while but laws could change the screen cleared robin whyte the physicist had been a mature man of formidable reputation back when jumpshift first demonstrated teleportation today twentyfive years later he was the last living member of the team that had formed jumpshift his scalp was pink and bare his face was round and soft almost without wrinkles but slack as if the muscles were tired he looked like somebodys favorite grandfather he looked jerryberry jansen up and down very thoroughly he said i wanted to see what you looked like he reached for the cutoff switch i didnt do it jerryberry said quickly whyte stopped with his finger on the cutoff no i am not responsible for the mall riot i hope to prove it the old man thought it over and you propose to involve me how jerryberry took a chance i think i can demonstrate that displacement booths and the mall riot are intimately connected my problem is that i dont know enough about displacementbooth technology and you want my help you invented the displacement booths practically singlehanded jerryberry said straightfaced instant riots instant getaways instant smuggling are you going to just walk away from the problem robin whyte laughed in a highpitched voice his head thrown way back his teeth white and perfect and clearly false jerryberry waited wondering if it would work all right whyte said come on over wait a minute what am i thinking you cant come to seven sixes ill meet you somewhere lorangerie new york city at the bar the screen cleared before jerryberry could answer that was quick he thought and move idiot get there before he changes his mind in new york it was just approaching cocktail hour lorangerie was polished wood and dim lighting and chafing dishes of swedish meatballs on toothpicks jerryberry captured a few to go with his drink he had not had lunch yet robin whyte wore a longsleeved gray onepiece with a collar that draped into a short cape and the cape was all the shifting rainbow colors of an oil film the height of fashion except that it should have been skintight it was loose all over bagging where whyte bagged and it looked very comfortable whyte sipped at a glass of milk one by one i give up my sins he said drinking was the last and i havent really turned loose of it yet but almost thats why your reverse salesmanship hooked me in ill talk to anyone what do i call you barry jerome jansen let me put it this way im robbie what do i call you oh jerryberry whyte laughed i cant call anyone jerryberry make it barry god bless you sir what do you want to know how big is jumpshift ooohhh pretty big whats your standard of measurement jerryberry who had wondered if he was being laughed at stopped wondering how many kinds of booth do you make hard to say three for general use maybe a dozen more for the space industry those are still experimental we lose money on the space industry wed make it back if we could start producing dropships in quantity weve got a ship on the drawing boards that would transmit itself to any dropship receiver jerryberry prompted him and three for general use you said yes weve made over three hundred million passenger booths in the past twenty years then theres a generaluse cargo booth the third model is a tremendous portable booth for shipping really big fragile cargoes like a prefab house or a rocket booster or a live sperm whale you can set the thing in place almost anywhere using three strapon helicopter setups i didnt believe it when i saw it whyte sipped at his milk youve got to remember that im not in the business anymore im still chairman of the board but a bunch of younger people give most of the orders and i hardly ever get into the factories does jumpshift have a monopoly on displacement booths he saw the newstaper reaction a tightening at whytes eyes and lips wrong word jerryberry said quickly sony what i meant was who makes displacement booths im sure you make most of the passenger booths in the united states all of them its not a question of monopoly anyone could make his own booths any community could but it would be hideously expensive the cost doesnt drop until youre making millions of them so suppose chile for instance chile has less than a million passenger booths all jumpshift model suppose they had gone ahead and made their own theyd have only their own network unless they built a direct copy of some other model all the booths in a network have to have the same volume naturally in practice there are about ten networks worldwide the ussr network is the biggest by far i think the smallest is brazil what happens to the air in a receiver whyte burst out laughing i knew that was coming it never fails he sobered we tried a lot of things it turns out the only practical solution is to send the air in the receiver back to the transmitter which means that every transmitter has to be a receiver too then you could get a free ride if you knew who was about to flick in from where when of course you could but would you want to bet on it i might if i had something to smuggle past customs how do you mean im just playing with ideas the incoming booths at customs are incoming because theres no way to dial out i remember type is with the dials removed okay say you wanted to smuggle something into the country you flick to customs in argentina then a friend flicks from california to argentina into your booth you wind up in his booth in california and not behind the customs barrier brilliant said whyte unfortunately theres a failsafe to stop anyone from flicking into an occupied booth sorry whyte said grinning what do you care there are easier ways to smuggle too many im not really sorry im a laissezfaire man myself i wondered if you could do something with dials to stop another mall riot whyte thought about it not by taking the dials off if you wanted to stop a riot youd have to stop people from coming in counters on the booths maybe what was it like barry crowded like a dam broke the law did shut the booths down from outside but not fast enough maybe thats the answer cut out the booths at the first sign of trouble wed get a lot of people mad at us you would wouldnt you like the power brownouts in the seventies and eighties or like obscene telephone calls you couldnt do anything about them except get more and more uptight readier to smash things thats why riots happen barry people who are a little bit angry all the time oh all the riots i remember whyte smiled there havent been any for a long time give jumpshift some credit for that we stopped some of the things that kept everyone a little bit angry all the time smog traffic jams slow mail slum landlords you dont have to live near your job or your welfare office or whatever job hunting crowding have you ever been in a traffic jam maybe when i was a little boy friend of mine was a college professor for a while his problem was he lived in the wrong place five days a week he would spend an hour driving to workyou dont believe meand an hour and a quarter driving home because traffic was heavier then eventually he gave it up to be a writer gawd i should hope so it wasnt even that rare whyte said seriously it was rough if you owned a car and rougher if you didnt jumpshift didnt cause riots we cured them and he seemed to wait for jerryberry s agreement silence stretched long enough to become embarrassing yet the only thing jerryberry might have said to break it was but what about the mall riot he held his peace drain that thing whyte said abruptly ill show you show me finish that drink were going places whyte drank half a glass of milk in three gulps his adams apple bobbing he lowered the glass well ready on madison avenue the sunset shadows ran almost horizontally along the glass faces of buildings robin whyte stepped out of lorangerie and turned right four feet away a displacement booth in the booth he blocked the hand jerryberry would have used to insert his cba card my treat this was my idea anyway some of these numbers are secret he inserted his own card and dialed three numbers twice they saw rows of longdistance booths then it was bright sunlight and sea breeze far out beyond a sandy beach and white waves a great cylinder with a rounded top rose high out of the water orange letters on the curved metal flank read jumpship freshwater transport i could take you out in a boat said whyte but it would be a waste of time you wouldnt see much nothing but vacuum inside you know how it works sure teleportation was like laser technology one big breakthrough and then a thousand ways to follow up on it we spent twelve solid years building continuous teleport pumps for various municipalities to ship fresh water in various directions when all the time the real problem was getting the fresh water not moving it do you know how we developed this gimmick my secretary dreamed it up one night at an office party she was about half smashed but she wrote it down and the next morning we all took turns trying to read her handwriting well never mind its a simple idea you build a tank more put the teleport pump in the top you teleport the air out when the air goes the seawater boils from then on youre teleporting cold watervapor it condenses wherever you ship it and you get fresh water want to take pictures i do then lets look at the results whyte said and dialed now it was even brighter the booth was backed up against a long wooden building far away was a white glare of salt flats backed by blue ghosts of mountains jerryberry blinked and squinted whyte opened the door jerryberry said whoooff death valley hot isnt it words fail me at a time like this but i suggest you look up the dictionary definition of blast furnace jerryberry felt perspiration start as a rippling itch all over him im going to pretend im in a sauna why doesnt anyone ever put displacement booths inside they did for a while there were too many burglaries lets go around back they walked around the dry wooden building and into an oasis jerryberry was jarred on one side of the building the austere beauty of a barren desert on the other was a manicured forest rows and rows of trees we can grow damn near anything out here we started with date palms went to orange and grapefuit trees pineapples a lot of rice paddies mangoesanything that grows in tropic climates will grow here as long as you give it enough water jerryberry had already noticed the water tower it looked just like the transmitter he said and the right soil well yes soil isnt that good in death valley we have to haul in too much fertilizer rivulets of perspiration ran down whytes cheeks his soft face looked almost stern but the principle holds with teleportation men can live practically anywhere we gave people room a man can work in manhattan or central los angeles or central anywhere and live in in nevada or hawaii or the grand canyon crowding caused riots weve eliminated crowdingfor a while anyway at the rate were going well still wind up shoulder to shoulder but not until you and i are both dead jerryberry considered keeping his mouth shut but decided he didnt have the willpower what about pollution what death valley used to have an ecology as unique as its climate whats your unlimited water doing to that ruining it i guess hawaii you said grand canyon there are laws against putting up apartment buildings in national monuments thank god hawaii probably has the population density of new york by now your displacement booths can put men anywhere right even places they dont belong well maybe they can whyte said slowly pollution hmm what do you know about death valley its hot jerryberry was wet through death valley used to be an inland sea a salt sea then the climate changed and all the water went away what did that do to the ecology jerryberry scratched his head a sea yes a sea and drying it up ruined one ecology and started another just like were doing but never mind that i want to show you some things pollution huh whytes grip on jerryberrys arm was stronger than it had any right to be whyte was angry in the booth he froze with his brow furrowed and his forefinger extended trying to remember a number then he dialed in trembling haste he dialed two sequences jerryberry saw the interior of an airline terminal thendark oh damn i forgot it would be night here where are we sahara desert rudolph hill reclamation project no dont go out there theres nothing to see at night do you know anything about the project youre trying to grow a forest in the middle of the sahara trees leafeating molds animals the whole ecology jerryberry tried to see out through the glass nothing hows it working well enough if we can keep it going another thirty years this part of the sahara should stay a forest do you think were wiping out another ecology well its probably worth it here the sahara used to be a lush green land it was men who turned it into a desert over thousands of years mainly through overgrazing were trying to put it back okay said jerryberry he heard whyte dialing through the glass he could now see stars and a horizon etched with treetop shadows he squinted against airportterminal lights he asked how did we get through customs oh the hill project is officially united states territory whyte swung the local directory out from the wall and leafed through it before dialing a second time some day youll make any journey by dialing two numbers he was saying why should you have to dial your local airport first just dial a longdistance booth near your destination of course the changeover will cost us considerable here we are bright sunlight sandy beach blue sea stretching to infinity the booth was backed up against a seaside hotel jerryberry followed whyte whose careful determined stride took him straight toward the water they stopped at the edge tiny waves brushed just to the tips of their shoes carpintena they advertise this beach as the safest beach in the world its also the dullest of course no waves remember anything about carpinteria barry i dont think so oilslick disaster a tanker broke up out there opposite santa barbara which is up the coast a little all of these beaches were black with oil i was one of the volunteers working here to save the birds to get the oil off their feathers they died anyway almost fifty years ago barry part of a history lesson floated to the top of his mind i thought that happened in england there were several oilslick disasters almost i might say there were many these days we ship oil by displacement booths and we dont use anything like as much oil no cars no oil wells practically they shifted from an underwater dome they gazed out at an artificial reef made from old car bodies the shapes seemed to blend their outlines obscured by mud and time and swarming fish bent and twisted metal bodies had long since rusted away but their outlines remained held by shellfish living and dead ghosts of cars the dashboards and upholstery showing through an occasional fiberglass wreck showed as if it had been placed yesterday the reef went on and on disappearing into gray distance all those cars people used to joke about the east river catching fire and burning to the ground it was that dirty said whyte now look at it things floated by wide patches of scum with plastic and metal objects embedded in them jerryberry said its pretty grubby maybe but its not an open sewer teleportation made it easier to get rid of garbage i guess my trouble is i never saw anything as dirty as you claim it was oil slicks lake michigan the mississippi maybe youre exaggerating just what has teleportation done for garbage collection there are records pictures but even with your wonderful bottomless garbage cans it must be easier just to dump it in the river ahh i guess so and you still have to put the gupp somewhere after you collect it whyte was looking at him oddly very shrewd barry let me show you the next step whyte kept his hand covered as he dialed secret he said jumpshift experimental laboratory we dont need a lot of room because experiments with teleportation arent particularly dangerous but there was room lots of it the building was a huge inflated quonset hut through the transparent panels jerryberry could see other buildings set wide apart on bare dirt the sun was degrees up if he had known which way was north he could have guessed longitude and latitude a very tall very black woman in a lab smock greeted whyte with glad cries whyte introduced her as gemini jones phd gem where do you handle disposal of radioactive waste building four the physicists hair exploded around her head like a black dandelion adding unnecessary inches to her height she looked down at jerryberry with genial curiosity newstaper dont ever try to fool anyone the eyes give you away they took the booth to building four presently they were looking down through several densities of leaded glass into a cylindrical metal chamber we get a package every twenty minutes or so said gem jones theres a transmitter linked to this receiver in every major power plant in the united states we keep the receiver on all the time if a package gets reflected back we have to find out whats wrong and that can get hairy because its usually wrong at the dropship jerryberry said dropship gemini jones showed surprise at his ignorance whyte said backup a bit barry whats the most dangerous garbage ever give me a hint radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants most dangerous per pound anyway they send those wastes here and we send them to a dropship youve got to know what a dropship is of course i a dropship is a moving teleport receiver with one end open generally its attached to a space probe the payload flicks in with a velocity different from that of the dropship of course its supposed to come tearing out the open end which means somebody has to keep it turned right and of course the dropship only operates in vacuum package gem jones said softly something had appeared in the metal chamber below it was gone before jerryberry could quite see what it was just where is your dropship circling venus said whyte originally it was part of the second venus expedition you can send anything through a dropship fuel oxygen food water even small vehicles there are dropships circling every planet in the solar system except neptune when the venus expedition came home they left the dropship in orbit we thought at first that we might send another expedition through it butface it venus just isnt worth it were using the planet as a garbage dump which is about all its good for now theres no theoretical reason we cant send unlimited garbage through the venus dropship as long as we keep the dropship oriented right many transmitters one receiver the payload doesnt stay in the receiver more than a fraction of a second if it did get overloaded why some of the garbage would be reflected back to the transmitter and wed send it again no problem what about cost stupendous horrible too high for any kind of garbage less dangerous than this radioactive stuff but maybe we can bring it down someday whyte stopped he looked puzzled mind if i sit down there were foldup chairs around a card table with empty pop bulbs on it whyte sat down rather disturbingly hard even with gem jones trying to support his weight she asked can i get doctor janesko no gem just tired is there a pop machine jerryberry found the pop machine he paid a chocolate dollar for a clear plastic bulb of cola he turned and almost bumped into gemini jones she spoke low but there was harsh intensity in her voice youre running him ragged will you lay off of him hes been running me jerryberry whispered i believe it well dont let him run you so fast remember hes an old man whyte pulled the cola bulb open and drank better he sighed and was back in high gear now you see were cleaning up the world we arent polluters right thank you i never should have raised the subject what have you got for the mall riot whyte looked confused the mall riot is still going on and theyre still blaming me and you still blame jumpshift its a matter of access jerryberry said patiently even if only ten men in a million say would loot a store given the opportunity thats still about four thousand people in the united states and all four thousand can get to the santa monica mall in the time it takes to dial twentyone digits when whyte spoke again he sounded bitter what are we supposed to do stop inventing things no of course not jerryberry pulled open another bulb of cola what then i dont know just keep working things out he drank theres always another problem behind the one you just solved does that mean you should stop solving problems well lets solve this one they sat sipping cola it was good to sit down the old mans running me ragged thought jerryberry crowds he said right you can make one receiver for many transmitters in fact every booth in a city receives from any other booth can you make a booth that transmits only whyte looked up sure give it an unlisted number potentially it would still be a receiver of course because you have to flick the air back to the transmitter hows this sound you can put an e on the booth number the only dials with es in them are at police stations and fire stations e for emergency all right now you put a lot of these escape booths wherever a crowd might gather that could be anywhere you said so yourself yah wed have to double the number of booths in the country or cut the number of incoming booths in half youd have to walk twice as far to get where youre going from any given booth would it be worth it i dont think this is the last riot said jerryberry its growing like tourism your shorthop booths cut tourism way dqwn the longdistance booths are bringing it back but slowly would you believe a permanent floating riot a mob that travels from crowd to crowd carrying coin purses looting where they can i hate that idea jerryberry put his hand on the old mans shoulder dont wony about it youre a hero you made a miracle what people do with it isnt your fault maybe you even saved the world the pollution was getting very rough before jumpshift came along by god it was ive got to be going there are things i want to see before i run out of time tahiti jerusalem mecca easter island stonehenge the famous places of the world places a man might dial almost on impulse names that came unbidden to the mind mecca vast numbers of muslims bowed toward mecca five times a day the koran called for every muslim to make a pilgrimage to mecca at least once in a lifetime the citys only industry was the making of religious articles and you could get there just by dialing jerusalem sacred to three major religions jews still toasted each other at passover next year in jerusalem still a forming ground of history after thousands of years and you could get there just by dialing stonehenge an ancient mystery what race erected those stones and when and why these would never be known with certainty from the avenue at the northeast entrance a path forked and ran up a hill between burial mounds and there was a longdistance displacement booth on the hill it would be eleven at night in stonehenge one in the morning in mecca and jerusalem no action there jerryberry crossed them out eiffel tower the pyramids the sphinx the vatican dammit the most memorable places on earth were all in the same general area what could he see at midnight well tahiti say tropical paradise and every stranger in earshot will murmur tahiti once hawaii had had the same reputation but hawaii was too close to civilization hawaii had been civilized tahiti isolated in the southern hemisphere might have escaped that fate everything lurched as he finished dialing jerryberry stumbled against the booth wall briefly he was terrified but hed be dead if the velocity transfer had failed it must be a little out of synch he knew too much that was all there were six booths of different makes this side of customs the single official had a hopeless look he waved through a constant stream of passengers without seeming to see them jerryberry moved with the stream they were mostly men many had cameras few had luggage english american french german some spanish and ussr most were dressed lightlyand poorly in cheap clothes ready to come apart they swarmed toward the outgoing booths the rectangular common market booths with one glass side jerryberry saw unease and dismay on many faces perhaps it was the new clean modem building that bothered them this was an island paradise air conditioning fluorescent lighting jerryberry stood in line for the phone then he found that it wouldnt take his coin or his credit card on his way to the change counter he thought to examine the displacement booths they took only french money he bought a heavy double handful of coins then got back in line for the phone they have to get used to traveling again right on the computerized directory spoke english he used it to get a string of booth numbers in downtown papeete he was a roving newstaper again dial watch the scene flick over look around while inserting a coin and dialing the coin slot was in the wrong place and the coins felt wrongtoo big too thinand the dial was a disk with holes in it a little practice had him in the routine there was beach front lined with partly built hotels in crazily original shapes of all the crowds he saw in papeete the thickest were on the beaches and in the water later he could not remember the color of the sand he hadnt seen enough of it downtown he found huge blocks of buildings faced in glass some completed some half built he found old slums and old mansions but wherever the streets ran past mansions or slums or new skyscrapers he found tents and leantos and board shacks hastily nailed together they filled the streets leaving small clear areas around displacement booths and public rest rooms and far more basic portable toilets an openair market ran for several blocks and was closed at both ends by crowds of tents the only way in or out was by booth theyre ahead of us thought jerryberry when youve got booths who needs streets he was not amused he was appalled there were beggars at first he was moving too fast he didnt realize what they were doing but wherever he flicked in one or two habitants immediately came toward his booth he stopped under a vertical glass cliff of a building where the tents of the squatters ran just to the bouommost of a flight of stone steps and waited beggars some were natives men and women and children uniform in their darkbronze color and in their dress and their speech and the way they moved they were a thin minority most were men and white and foreign they came with their hands out mournful or smiling they spoke rapidly in what they guessed to be his language and were right about half the time he tried several other numbers they were everywhere tahiti was a white mans daydream suddenly hed had enough on his list of jotted numbers was one that would take him out of the city jerryberry dialed it air puffed out of the booth when he opened the door jerryberry opened his jaws wide to pop his ears the view he was near the peak of a granite mountain other mountains marched away before him and the valleys between were green and lush greens and yellows and white clouds the bluegray of distant peaks and beyond everything else the sea it was a bus terminal an ancient greyhound was just pulling out the driver stopped alongside him and shouted something amiable in french jerryberry smiled and shook his head violently the driver shrugged and pulled away this could not have been the original terminal before displacement booths it could have been reached only after hours of driving in moving the terminal up here the touring company had saved the best for first and last the bus had looked full business was good jerryberry stood for a long time drinking in the view this was the beauty that had made tahiti famous it was good to know that tahitis population explosion had left something intact in good time he remembered that he was running on a time limit he walked around to the ticket window the young man in the booth laid a paperback book face down he smiled agreeably yes do you speak english certainly he wore a kind of uniform but his features and color were those of a tahitian his english was good the accent not quite french would you like to buy a tour ticket no thanks id like to talk if you have a minute what would you like to talk about tahiti im a newstaper the mans smile drooped a bit and you wish to give us free publicity something like that the smile was gone you may return to your country and tell them that tahiti is full i noticed that i have just come from papeete i have the honor to own a house in papeete a good property we my family and myself we have been forced to move out there was nono paysage he was too angry to talk as fast as he wantedno passage from the house to anyplace we were surrounded by the tents of the he used a word jerryberry did not recognize we could not buy an instant motion booth for the house i had not the money we could not have moved the booth to the house because thethat word againblocked the streets the police can do nothing nothing why not there are too many we are not monsters we cannot simply shoot them it would be the only way to stop them they come without money or clothing or a place to stay and they are not the worst you will tell them this when you return im recording said jerryberry tell them that the worst are those with much money those who build hotels they would turn our island into an enormous hotel see he pointed where jerryberry could not have seen himself down the slope of the mountain the playboy club builds a new hotel below us jerryberry looked down to temporary buildings and a great steel box with helicopter rotors on it he filmed it on the minox then filmed a panoramic sweep of the mountains beyond and finished with the scowling man in the ticket booth squatters the tickettaker said suddenly the word i wanted the squatters are in my house now l am sure of it in my house since we moved out tell them we want no more squatters ill tell them said jerryberry before he left he took one more long look about him green valleys grayblue mountains distant line of sea but his eyes kept dropping to the endless stream of supplies that poured from the playboy clubs type of cargo booth easter island tremendous longfaced solemn stone statues with topknots of red volcanic tuff cartoons of the statues were even more common than pictures and even pictures can only hint at their massive solemnity but you could get there just by dialing except that the directory wouldnt give him a booth number for easter island surely there must be booth travel to easter island mustnt there but how eager would the peruvian government be to see a million tourists on easter island the other side of the coin displacement booths made any place infinitely accessible but only if you moved a booth in jerryberry was grinning with delight as he dialed los angeles international there was a defense at the police station on purdue avenue he couldnt get anyone to talk to him the patience of a newstaper was unique in a world of instant transportation he kept at it eventually a deskman stopped long enough to tell him look we dont have time everybodys out cleaning up the mall riot cleaning up is it over just about we had to move in old riot vehicles from chicago i guess well have to start building them again but its over good too right i dont mean to say we got them all some looters managed to juryrig a cargo booth in the basement of penneys they moved their loot out that way and then got out that way themselves were going to hate it the next time they show up theyve got guns now a permanent floating riot something like that look i dont have time to talk and he was back on the phone the next man jerryberry stopped recognized him at once youre the man who started it all will you get out of my way jerryberry left sunset on a summer evening it was cocktail hour again three and a half hours later jerryberry felt unaccountably dizzy outside the police station he rested against the wall too much change over and over again he had changed place and time and climate from evening in new york to a humid seacoast to the dry furnace of death valley to night in the sahara it was hard to remember where he was he had lost direction when he felt better he shifted to the cave des roys for each human being there is an optimum ratio between change and stasis too little change he grows bored too little stability he panics and loses his ability to adapt one who marries six times in ten years will not change jobs one who moves often to serve his company will maintain a stable marriage a woman chained to one home and family may redecorate frantically or take a lover or go to many costume parties displacement booths make novelty easy stability comes hard for many the clubs were an element of stability many key clubs were chains a man could leave his home in wyoming and find his club again in denver members tended to resemble one another a man changing roles would change clubs clubs were places to meet people as buses and airports and even neighborhoods no longer were some clubs were good for pickups others for heavy conversation at the beach club you could always find a paddletennis game the cave was for quiet and stability a quick drink and the cool darkness of the caves bar were just what jerryberry needed he looked into the lights in the wall of bottles and tried to remember a name when it came he jotted it down then finished his drink at leisure harry mccord had been police chief in los angeles for twelve years and had been on the force for far longer he had retired only last year the computerdirectory took some time to find him he was living in oregon he was living in a small house in the middle of a pine forest from mccords porch jerryberry could see the dirt road that joined him to civilization it seemed to be fading away in weeds but the displacement booth was new they drank beer on the porch crime is a pretty general subject said harry mccord crime and displacement booths said jerryberry i want to know how your job was affected by the instant getaway jerryberry waited pretty drastically i guess the booths came in when nineteen ninety but they came slowly we had a chance to get used to them lets see there were people who put displacement booths in their living rooms and when they got robbed they blamed us mccord talked haltingly at first then gaining speed he had always been something of a public figure he talked well burglary the honors were even there if the house or apartment had an alarm the police could be on the scene almost instantly if the burglar moved fast enough to get away he certainly wouldnt have time to rob his target there were sophisticated alarms now that would lock the displacement booth door from the inside often that held the burglar up just long enough for the police to shift in at opposite extremes of professionalism there were men who could get through an alarm system without setting it offin which case there wasnt a hope in hell of catching them after theyd leftand men who had been caught robbing apartment houses because theyd forgotten to take corns for the booth in the lobby then there was lon willis his mo was to prop the booth door open before he went to work on the house if he set the alarm off hed run next door and use that booth worked pretty wellit slowed us up just enough that we never did catch him but one night he set off an alarm and when he ran next door the nextdoor neighbor blew a small but adequate hole in him murder the alibi was an extinct species a man attending a party in hawaii could shoot a man in paris in the time it would take him to use the bathroom like george clayton larkin did except that he used his credit card and we got him said mccord and we got lucille downey because she ran out of coins and had to ask at the magazine stand for change with blood all over her sleeves pickpocketsdo you have a lock pocket sure said jerryberry it was an inside pocket lined with tough plastic the zipper lock took two hands to open theyre tough to get into but not impossible whats in it credit cards right and you can cancel them in three minutes picking pockets isnt profitable any more if it was they would have mobbed the mall riot smugglingnobody even tried to stop it drugs theres no way to keep them from getting in anyone who wants drugs can get them we make arrests where we can and so what me im betting on darwin how do you mean the next generation wont use drugs because theyll be descended from people who had better sense id legalize wireheading if it were up to me with a wire in your pleasure center youre getting what all the drugs are supposed to give you and no dope peddler can hold out on you riots the mall riot was the first successful riot in twenty years the police can get to a riot before its a riot said mccord we call them flash crowds and we watch for them weve been doing it ever since well ever since it became possible he hesitated and evidently decided to go on see the coin booths usually went into the shopping centers first and then the residential areas it wasnt till jumpshift put them in the slum areas that we stopped having riots makes sense mccord laughed even thats a halftruth when the booths went into the slums we pretty near stopped having slums everyone moved out theyd commute why do you think the police didnt stop the mall riot thats a funny one isnt it i was there this afternoon did you get a chance to look at the cargo booth in penneys basement its a professional job whoever rigged it knew exactly what he was doing no slips he probably had a model to practice on we traced it to a cargo receiver in downtown la but we dont know where it was sending to because someone stayed behind and wrecked it and then shifted out real professional some gang has decided to make a profession of riots you think this is their first job id guess they must have seen the malltype riots coming which is pretty shrewd because a flash crowd couldnt have formed that fast before longdistance displacement booths its a new crime makes me almost sorry i retired how would you redesign the booths to make life easier for the police but mccord wouldnt touch the subject he didnt know anything about displacementbooth design seven oclock the interview with evans was at ten jerryberry shifted back to the cave he was beginning to get nervous the cave and a good dinner should help ease his stage fright he turned down a couple of invitations to join small groups with the interview hanging over his head hed be poor company he sat alone and continued to jot during dinner escape booths send anywhere receive only from police and fire departments police can shut down all booths in an area except escape booths no that would let the looters escape too but there might be no way to stop that at least it would get the innocent bystanders out of a riot area hah escape booths send only to police station he crossed that out and wrote all booths send only to police station he crossed that out too to write an expanded version riot signal from police station all booths in area stop receiving all booths in area send only to police station he went back to eating moments later he stopped with his fork half raised put it down and wrote a million rioters stomp police station to rubble from inside and it had seemed like such a good idea he was dawdling over coffee when the rest of it dropped into place he went to a phone the secretary at seven sixes promised to have dr whyte call as soon as he checked in jerryberry put a timelimit on it which seemed to please her mccord wasnt home jerryberry went back to his coffee he was feeling twitchy now he had to know if this was possible otherwise he would be talking through his hatin front of a big audience twenty minutes later as he was about to get up and call again the headwaiter came to tell him that dr robin whyte was on the phone its a design problem said jerryberry let me tell you how id like it to work and then you can tell me if its possible okay go ahead first step is the police get word of a flash crowd a mall riottype crowd they throw emergency switches at headquarters each switch affects the displacement booths in a small area thats the way it works now now those switches turn off the booths id like them to do something more complex set them so they can only receive from police and fire departments and can only transmit to a police station we can do that whyte halfclosed his eyes to think good then the police could release the innocent bystanders send the injured to a hospital hold the obvious looters get everybodys names right brilliant youd put the receiver at the top of a greased slide and a big cell at the bottom maybe at least the receiver would be behind bars you could issue override cards to the police and other authorities to let them shift in through a blockade good whyte stopped suddenly and frowned theres a hole in it a really big crowd would either wreck the station or smother depending on how strong the cell was did you think of that id like to use more than one police station how many theres a distance him bany what are you thinking as it stands now a longdistance passenger has to dial three numbers to get anywhere you said you could cut that to two can you cut it to one i dont know its poetic justice said jerryberry our whole problem is that rioters can converge on one point from all over the united states if we could use police stations all over the united states we wouldnt have a problem as soon as a cell was full here wed switch to police stations in san diego or oregon whyte was laughing if you could see your face barry youre a dreamer you cant do it no of course we cant do it wait a minute whyte pursed his lips theres a way we could do it if there was a longdistance receiver at the police station hook the network to a velocity damper i told you theres no reason you shouldnt be able to dial to a longdistance receiver from any booth it would work then youd have to talk the public into paying for it design wouldnt be much of a problem we could cover the country with an emergency network in a couple of years can i quote you of course we sell displacement booths thats our business talk shows are one of the few remaining pure entertainment features on teevee with cassettes the viewer buys a package with a talk show he never knows just what hes getting it is a different product it is cheap to produce it can compete the tonight show shows at pm prime time around nine they start flicking in pouring out of the coin booths that line the street above the last row of houses they mill about searching out the narrow walks that lead down to the strand they pour over the low stone wall that guards the sand from the houses they pause awed breakers roll in from the black sea flashing electricblue within minutes hennosa beach is aswarm with people men women children in couples and family groups they hold hands and look out to sea they stamp the packed wet sand dancing like savages and whoop with delight to see blue light flash beneath their feet high up on the dry sand are piles of discarded clothing swimmers are thick in the water splashing blue fire at each other many were drunk or high on this or that when the tonight show led them here those who came were happy to start with they came to do a happy thing some carry sixpacks or pouches of pot the line of them stretches around the curve of the shore to the north beyond hermosa pier to the south bunching around the pier more are shifting in all the time trickling down to join the others jerryberry jansen flicked in almost an hour early for the interview the station was an ants nest a swarm of furious disorganization jerryberry was looking for wash evans when wash evans came running past him from behind glanced back and came to a jarring halt lo said jerryberry is there anything we need to go over before we go on evans seemed at a loss yah he said and caught his breath a little youre not news anymore jansen we may not even be doing the interview jerryberry said a dirty word i heard theyd cleared up the riot more than that they caught the lady shoplifter good if you say so one out of a thousand people that recognized your pictures of her turned out to be right woman name of inna hennessey lives in jersey city but commutes all over the country she says shes never hit the same store twice shes a kick jansen a newstapers dream no offense intended but i wish theyd let her out of jail tonight id interview her so i didnt cause the mall riot anymore now youve got irma hennessey well good i didnt like being a celebrity anything else he was thinking all that jumping around all the things i learned today all wasted unless i can get a tapezine lecture out of it evans said yah theres a new mall riot going on at hermosa beach what the hell craziest damn thing wash evans lit a cigarette and talked around it you know gordon lundt the zine star he was on the tonight show and he happened to mention the red tide down at hermosa beach he said it was pretty the next thing anyone knows every man woman and child in the country has decided he wants to see the red tide at hermosa beach how bad is it well nobodys been hurt last i heard and they arent breaking things its not that kind of crowd and theres nothing to steal but sand anyway its a happy riot jansen theres just a bitch of a lot of people another flash crowd it figures said jerryberry you can get a flash crowd anywhere there are displacement booths can you theyve been around a long time its just that they happen faster with the longdistance booths some places are permanent floating flash crowds like tahiti whats wrong wash evans had a funny look it just hit me that we dont really have anything to replace you with youve been doing your homework have you all day jerryberry dug out the minox ive been everywhere i could think of some of this goes with taped interviews he produced the tape recorder of course there isnt much time to sort it out no gimme evans took the camera and the recorder we can follow up on these later maybe theyll make a special right now the news is at hermosa beach and you sound like you know how it happened and what to do about it do you still want to do that interview isure go get a cba camera from george bailey lets see itsnine fifteen dammit spend half an hour see as much as you can then get back here find out what you can about theflash crowd at hermosa beach thats what well be talking about george bailey looked up as jerryberry arrived he pointed emphatically at the single camera remaining on the table fingercombed the hair back out of his eyes and went back to monitoring half a dozen teevee screens the camera came satisfyingly to life in jerryberrys hands he picked up a list of hermosa beach numbers and turned to the displacement booths too much coffee sloshed in his belly he stopped suddenly thinking one big riotcontrol center would do it you wouldnt need a police networkjust one longdistance receiver to serve the whole country and a building the size of yankee stadium big enough to handle any riot a federal police force on permanent guard rioting was an interstate crime now anyway you could build such a center faster and cheaper than any network not now back to work he stepped into a booth dialed and was gone what good is a glass dagger i twelve thousand years before the birth of christ in an age when miracles were somewhat more common a warlock used an ancient secret to save his life in later years he regretted that he had kept the secret of the warlocks wheel for several normal lifetimes the demonsword glirendree and its stupid barbarian captive would have killed him no question of that but no mere demon could have been as dangerous as that secret now it was out spreading like ripples on a pond the battle between glirendree and the warlock was too good a tale not to tell soon no man would call himself a magician who did not know that magic could be used up so simple so dangerous a secret the wonder was that nobody had noticed it before a year after the battle with glirendree near the end of a summer day aran the peacemonger came to shayl village to steal the warlocks wheel aran was a skinny eighteenyearold lightly built his face was lean and long with a pointed chin his dark eyes peered out from under a prominent shelf of bone his short straight dark hair dropped almost to his brows in a pronounced widows peak what he was was no secret and anyone who touched hands with him would have known at once for there was short fine hair on his palms but had anyone known his mission he would have been thought mad for the warlock was a leader in the sorcerers guild it was known that he had a name but no human throat could pronounce it the shadow demon who had been his namefather had later been imprisoned in tattooed runes on the warlocks own back an uncommonly dangerous bodyguard yet aran came well protected the leather wallet that hung from his shoulder was old and scarred and the seams were loose by its look it held nuts and hard cheese and bread and almost no money what it actually held was charms magic would serve him better than nuts and cheese and aran could feed himself as he traveled at night he reached the warlocks cave shortly after sunset he had been told how to use his magic to circumvent the warlocks safeguards his need for magic implied a need for voice and hands so that aran was forced to keep the human shape and this made him doubly nervous at moonrise he chanted the words he had been taught and drew a live bat from his pouch and tossed it gently through the barred entrance to the cave the bat exploded into a mist of blood that drifted slantwise across the stone floor arans stomach lurched he almost ran then but he quelled his fear and followed it in squeezing between the bars those who had sent him had repeatedly diagrammed the cave for him he could have robbed it blindfolded he would have preferred darkness to the flickering blue light from what seemed to be a captured lightning bolt tethered in the middle of the cavern he moved quickly scrupulously tracing what he had been told was a path of safety though aran had seen sorcerous tools in the training laboratory in the school for mercantile grammaree in atlantis most of the warlocks tools were unfamiliar it was not an age of mass production he paused by a workbench wondering why would the warlock be grinding a glass dagger but aran found a tarnishblackened metal disc hanging above the workbench and the runes inscribed around its rim convinced him that it was what he had come for he took it down and quickly strapped it against his thigh leaving his hands free to fight if need be he was turning to go when a laughing voice spoke out of the air put that down you mangy son of a bitch aran converted to wolf agony seared his thigh in human form aran was a lightly built boy as a wolf he was formidably large and dangerous it did him little good this time the pain was blinding stupefying aran the wolf screamed and tried to run from the pain he woke gradually with an ache in his head and a greater agony in his thigh and a tightness at his wrists and ankles it came to him that he must have knocked himself out against a wall he lay on his side with his eyes closed giving no sign that he was awake gently he tried to pull his hands apart he was bound wrists and ankles well he had been taught a word for unbinding ropes best not to use it until he knew more he opened his eyes a slit the warlock was beside him seated in lotus position studying aranwith a slight smile in one hand he held a slender willow rod the warlock was a tall man in robust good health he was deeply tanned legend said that the warlock never wore anything above the waist the years seemed to blur on him he might have been twenty or fifty in fact he was one hundred and ninety years old and bragged of it his condition indicated the power of his magic behind him aran saw that the warlocks wheel had been returned to its place on the wall waiting for its next victim the real warlocks wheel was of copper those who had sent aran had known that much but this decoy must be tarnished silver to have seared him so the warlock wore a dreamy absent look there might still be a chance if he could be taken by surprise man said kpllr the warlock lashed him across the throat the willow wand had plenty of spring in it aran choked and gagged he tossed his head fighting for air that word has four syllables the warlock informed him in a voice he recognized youll never get it out gluck said aran i want to know who sent you man did not answer though he had his wind back youre no ordinary thief but youre no magician either the warlock said almost musingly i heard you you were chanting by rote you used basic spells spells that are easy to get right but they were the right spells each time somebodys been using prescience and farsight to spy on me someone knows too many of my defenses the ancient magician said gently i dont like that i want to know who and why when aran did not reply the warlock said he had all the knowledge and he knew what he was after but he had better sense than to come himself he sent a fool the warlock was watching arans eyes or perhaps he thought a werewolf would have a better chance at me by the way theres silver braid in those cords so youd best stay human for the nonce you knew i was coming oh i had ample warning didnt it occur to you that ive got prescience and farsight too it occurred to your master said the warlock he set up protections around you a moving region where prescience doesnt work then what went wrong i foresaw the dead region you ninny i couldnt get a glimpse of what was stealing into my cave but i could look around it i could follow its path through the cavern that path was most direct i knew what you were after then there were bare footprints left behind i could study them before they were made you waited for moonrise instead of trying to get in after dusk on a night of the full moon too other than that it wasnt a bad try sending a werewolf was bright it would take a kid your size to squeeze between the bars and then a kid your size couldnt win a fight if something went wrong a wolf your size could a lot of good it did me what i want to know is how did they talk an atlantean into this they must have known what they were after didnt they tell you what the wheel does sucks up magic said aran he was chagrined but not surprised that the warlock had placed his accent sucks up mana the warlock corrected him do you know what mana is the power behind magic so they taught you that much did they also tell you that when the mana is gone from a region it doesnt come back ever aran rolled on his side being convinced that he was about to die he felt he had nothing to lose by speaking boldly i dont understand why youd want to keep it a secret a thing like the warlocks wheel it could make war obsolete its the greatest purely defensive weapon ever invented the warlock didnt seem to understand man said you must have thought of that why no enemys curses could touch atlantis if the warlocks wheel were there to absorb it obviously you werent sent by the atlantean minister of offense hed know better the warlock watched him shrewdly or were you sent by the greek isles i dont understand dont you know that atlantis is tectonically unstable for the last half a thousand years the only thing thats kept atlantis above the waves has been the spells of the sorcererkings youre lying you obviously arent the warlock made a gesture of dismissal but the wheel would be bad for any nation not just atlantis spin the wheel and a wide area is dead to magic foras far as ive been able to tellthe rest of eternity who would want to bring about such a thing i would you would why were sick of war aran said roughly unaware that he had said we the warlocks wheel would end war can you imagine an army trying to fight with nothing but swords and daggers no hurling of death spells no prescients spying out the enemys battle plans no killer demons beating at unseen protective walls mans eyes glowed man to man sword against sword blood and bronze and no healing spells why no king would ever fight on such terms wed give up war forever some basic pessimism deep within me forces me to doubt it youre laughing at me you dont want to believe it man said scornfully no more mana means the end of your youth spells youd be an old man too old to live that must be it well lets see who you are the warlock touched mans wallet with the willow wand let it rest there a few moments aran wondered frantically what the warlock could learn from his wallet if the lockspells didnt hold then they didnt of course the warlock reached in pulled out another live bat then several sheets of parchment marked with what might have been geometry lessons and with script printed in a large precise hand schoolboy script he commented lines drawn with painful accuracy mistakes scraped out and redrawn the idiot he forgot the hooked tail on the whirlpool design a wonder it didnt eat him the warlock looked up am i being attacked by children these spells were prepared by half a dozen apprentices man didnt answer but he lost hope of concealing anything further they have talent though so youre a member of the peacemongers arent you all armyage youngsters ill wager youre backed by half the graduating class of the school of mercantile grammaree they must have been watching me for months now to have my defenses down so pat and you want to end the war against the greek isles did you think youd help matters by taking the warlocks wheel to atlantis why im half minded to let you walk out with the thing it would serve you right for trying to rob me he looked hard into mans eyes why youd do it wouldnt you why i said why we could still use it youd sink atlantis are the peacemongers traitors now im no traitor aran spoke low and furious we want to change atlantis not destroy it but if we owned the warlocks wheel the palace would listen to us he wriggled in his tight bonds and thought once again of the word that would free him then convert to werewolf and run between the bars down the hill into the woods and freedom i think ill make a conservative of you the warlock said suddenly he stood up he brushed the willow wand lightly across mans lips aran found that he could not open his mouth he remembered now that he was entirely in the warlocks powerand that he was a captured thief the warlock turned and aran saw the design on his back it was an elaborately curlicued fivesided tattoo in red and green and gold inks man remembered what he had been told of the warlocks bodyguard recently i dreamed said the warlock i dreamed that i would find a use for a glass dagger i thought that the dream might be prophetic and so i carved thats silly man broke in what good is a glass dagger he had noticed the dagger on the way in it had a honed square point and honed edges and a fusedlooking hilt with a guard two clamps padded with fox leather held it in place on the work table the uppermost cutting edge was not yet finished now the warlock removed the dagger from its clamps while man watched the warlock scratched designs on the blade with a pointed chunk of diamond that must have cost him dearly he spoke low and softly to it words that man couldnt hear then he picked it up likea dagger frightened as he was aran could not quite believe what the warlock was doing he felt like a sacrificial goat there was mana in sacrifice and more mana in human sacrifice but he wouldnt he wouldnt the warlock raised the knife high and brought it down hard in mans chest man screamed he had felt it a whisper of sensation a slight ghostly tugthe knife was an insubstantial shadow but there was a knife in man the peacemongers heart the hilt stood up out of his chest the warlock muttered low and fast the glass hilt faded and was gone apparently its easy to make glass invisible glass is half invisible already its still in your heart said the warlock but dont worry about it dont give it a thought nobody will notice only be sure to spend the rest of your life in manarich territory because if you ever walk into a place where magic doesnt workwell itll reappear thats all man struggled to open his mouth now you came for the secret of the warlocks wheel so you might as well have it its just a simple kinetic sorcery but openended he gave it the wheel spins faster and faster until its used up all the mana in the area it tends to tear itself apart so you need another spell to hold it together and he gave that speaking slowly and distinctly then he seemed to notice that man was flopping about like a fish he said kplirapranthry the ropes fell away aran stood up shakily he found be could speak again and what he said was take it out please now theres one thing about taking that secret back to atlantis i assume you still want to but youd have to describe it before you could use it as a threat you can see how easy it is to make a big nation like atlantis tends to have enemies doesnt it and youd be telling them how to sink atlantis in a single night man pawed at his chest but he could feel nothing take it out i dont think so now we face the same death wolf boy goodby and give my best to the school for mercantile grammaree and oh yes dont go back by way of hvirin gap grandson of an ape aran screamed he would not beg again he was wolf by the time he reached the bars and he did not touch them going through with his mind he felt the knife in his chest and he heard the warlocks laughter following him down the hill and into the trees when next he saw the warlock it was thirty years later and a thousand miles away ii aran traveled as a wolf when he could it was an age of greater magic a werewolf could change shape whenever the moon was in the sky in the wolf shape aran could forage reserving his remaining coins to buy his way home his thoughts were a running curse against the warlock once he turned about on a small hill and stood facing north toward shayl village he bristled remembering the warlocks laugh but he remembered the glass dagger he visualized the warlocks throat and imagined the taste of arterial blood but the glowing twisting design on the warlocks back flashed at the back of mans eyes and man tasted defeat he could not fight a shadow demon man howled once and turned south nildiss range the backbone of a continent rose before him as he traveled beyond the range was the sea and a choice of boats to take him home with what he had learned of the warlock perhaps the next thief would have better luck and so he came to hvirin gap once the range had been a formidable barrier to trade then almost a thousand years ago a sorcerer of rynildissen had worked an impressive magic the range had been split as if by a cleaver where the mountains to either side sloped precipitously upward hvirin gap sloped smoothly down to the coast between rock walls flat enough to have a polished look periodically the bandits had to be cleaned out of hvirin gap this was more difficult every year for the spells against banditry didnt work well there and swords had to be used instead the only compensation was that the dangerous mountain dragons had disappeared too man stopped at the opening he sat on his haunches considering for the warlock might have been lying he might have thought it funny to send man the long way over nildiss range but the dragon bones where magic didnt work dragons died the bones were there huge and reptilian they had fused with the rock of the pass somehow so that they looked tens of millions of years old aran had traveled the gap in wolf form if hvirin gap was dead to magic he should have been forced into the man form or would he find it impossible to change at all but i can go through as a wolf aran thought that way i cant be killed by anything but silver and platinum the glass dagger should hurt but damn im invulnerable but is it magic if it doesnt work in hvirin gap and he shuddered the dagger had never been more than a whisper of sensation that had faded in half an hour and never returned but man knew it was there invisible a knife in his heart waiting it might reappear in his chest and he could still surviveas a wolf but it would hurt and he could never be human again aran turned and padded away from hvirin gap he had passed a village yesterday perhaps the resident magician could help him a glass dagger the magician chortled he was a portly jolly balding man clearly used to good living now ive heard everything well what were you worried about its got a handle doesnt it was it a complex spell i dont think so he wrote runes on the blade then stabbed me with it fine you pay in advance and youd better convert to wolf just to play safe he named a sum that would have left aran without money for passage home man managed to argue him down to something not far above reason and they went to work the magician gave up some six hours later his voice was hoarse his eyes were red from oddly colored oddly scented smokes and his hands were discolored with dyes i cant touch the hilt i cant make it visible i cant get any sign that its there at all if i use any stronger spell its likely to kill you i quit wolf boy whoever put this spell on you he knows more than a simple village magician man rubbed at his chest where the skin was stained by mildly corrosive dyes they call him the warlock the portly magician stiffened the warlock the warlock and you didnt think to tell me get out what about my money i wouldnt have tried it for ten times the fee me a mere hedgemagician and you turned me loose against the warlock we might both have been killed if you think youre entitled to your money lets go to the headman and state our case otherwise get out man left shouting insults try other magicians if you like the other shouted after him try rynildissen city but tell them what theyre doing first iii it had been a difficult decision for the warlock but his secret was out and spreading the best he could do was see to it that world sorcery understood the implications the warlock addressed the sorcerers guild on the subject of mana depletion and the warlocks wheel think of it every time you work magic he thundered in what amounted to baby talk after his severely technical description of the wheel only finite mana in the world and less of it every year as a thousand magicians drain it away there were beings who ruled the world as gods long ago until the raging power of their own being used up the mana that kept them alive one day itll all be gone then all the demons and dragons and unicorns trolls and rocs and centaurs will vanish quite away because their metabolism is partly based on magic then all the dream castles will evaporate and nobody will ever know they were there then all the magicians will become tinkers and smiths and the world will be a dull place to live you have the power to bring that day nearer that night he dreamed a duel between magicians makes a fascinating tale such tales are commonand rarely true the winner of such a duel is not likely to give up trade secrets the loser is dead at the very least novices in sorcery are constantly amazed at how much preparation goes into a duel and how little action the duel with the hill magician started with a dream the night after the warlocks speech made that duel inevitable it ended thirty years later in that dream the enemy did not appear but the warlock saw a cheerful harmlesslooking fairy castle perched on an impossible hill from a fertile hummocky landscape the hill rose like a breaking wave leaning so far that the castle at its crest had empty space below it in his sleep the warlock frowned such a hill would topple without magic the fool who built it was wasting mana and in his sleep he concentrated memorizing details a narrow path curled up the hillside facts twisted dreamlike there was a companion with him or there wasnt the warlock lived until he passed through the gate or he died at the gate in agony with great ivory teeth grinding together through his rib cage he woke himself up trying to sort it out the shadowy companion was necessary at least as far as the gate beyond the enemys gate he could see nothing a warlocks wheel must have been used there to block his magic so thoroughly poetic justice he spent three full days working spells to block the hifi magicians prescient sense during that time his own sleep was dreamless the others magic was as effective as his own iv great ships floated at anchor in the harbor there were cargo ships whose strange demonic figureheads had limited power of movement just enough to reach the rats that tried to swarm up the mooring lines a large atlantean passenger liner was equipped with twin outriggers made from whole tree trunks by the nearest dock a magicians slender yacht floated eerily above the water aran watched them all rather wistfully he had spent too much money traveling over the mountains a week after his arrival in rynildissen city he had taken a post as bodyguard watchdog to a rug merchant he had been down to his last coin and hungry now lloraginezee the rug merchant and raharroo his secretary talked trade secrets with the captain of a nile cargo ship man waited on the dock watching ships with indifferent patience his ears came to point the bearded man walking past him wore a captains kilt man hailed him ho captain are you sailing to atlantis the bearded man frowned and whats that to you i would send a message there deal with a magician id rather not said aran he could hardly tell a magician that he wanted to send instructions on how to rob a magician otherwise the message would have gone months ago ill charge you more and it will take longer the bearded man said with some satisfaction who in atlantis and where man gave him an address in the city he passed over the sealed message pouch he had been carrying for three months now aran too had made some difficult decisions in final draft his message warned of the tectonic instability of the continent and suggested steps the peacemongers could take to learn if the warlock had lied aran had not included instructions for making a warlocks wheel far out in the harbor dolphins and mermen played rough and complicated games the atlantean craft hoisted sail a wind rose from nowhere to fill the sails it died slowly following the passenger craft out to sea soon enough man would have the fare he would almost have it now except that he had twice paid out sorcerers fees with the result that the money was gone and the glass dagger was not meanwhile lloraginezeo did not give trade secrets to his bodyguard he knew that aran would be on his way as soon as he had the money here they came down the gangplank uoraginezee with less waddle than might be expected of a man of his girth the girl walking with quiet grace balancing the rug samples on her head raharroo was saying something as aran joined them something man may have been intended to hear beginning tomorrow ill be off work for five days you know she told lloraginezeeand blushed pine fine said lioraginezee nodding absently man knew too he smiled but did not look at her he might embarrass her and he knew well enough what raharroo looked like her hair was black and short and coarse her nose was large but flat almost merging into her face her eyes were brown and soft her brows dark and thick her ears were delicately formed and convoluted and came to a point she was a lovely girl especially to another of the wolf people they held hands as they walked her nails were narrow and strong and the fine hair on her palm tickled in atlantis he would have considered marrying her had he the money to support her here it was out of the question for most of the month they were friends and coworkers the night life of rynildissen city was more convenient for a couple and there were times when uoraginezee could spare them both perhaps lioraginezee made such occasions he was not of the wolf people he probably enjoyed thinking that sex had reared its lovely disturbing head but sex could not be involvedexcept at a certain time of the month man didnt see her then she was locked up in her fathers house he didnt even know where she lived he found out five nights later he had guarded lloraginezees way to adriennes house of pleasures lloraginezee would spend the night on an air mattress floating on mercury a bed aran had only heard described a pleasant sleep was not the least of pleasures the night was warm and balmy aran took a long way home walking wide of the vacant lot behind adriennes that broad flat plot of ground had housed the palace of shilbree the dreamer three hundred years ago the palace had been all magic and quite an achievement even in its day eventually it had worn out shilbree would have said one day it was gone and not even the simplest of spells would work in that vacant lot someone had told aran that households of wolf people occupied several blocks of the residential district it seemed to be true for he caught identifying smells as he crossed certain paths he followed one curious to see what kind of house a wealthy werewolf would build in rynildissen the elusive scent led him past a high angular house with a brass door and then it was too late for another scent was in his nostrils and in his blood and brain he spent that whole night howling at the door nobody tried to stop him the neighbors must have been used to it or they may have known that he would kill rather than be driven away more than once he heard a yearning voice answering from high up in the house it was raharroos voice with what remained of his mind man knew that he would be finding apologies in a few days she would think he had come deliberately aran howled a song of sadness and deprivation and shame v the first was a small village called oath and a guild prentice who came seeking black opals he found them and free for the taking too for oath was dead empty the prentice sorcerer wondered about that and he looked about him and presently he found a dead spot with a crumbled castle in it it might have been centuries fallen or it might have been raised by magic and collapses when the mana went out of it yesterday or last week it was a queer tale and it got around the prentice grew rich on the opals for black opals are very useful for cursing but the empty village bothered him i thought it was slavers at first he said once in the warlocks hearing as it turned out there were no corpses none anywhere slave traders dont kill if they can help it but why would a troop of slavers leave valuables lying where they were the opals were all over the street mixed with hay i think a jeweler must have been moving them in secret whensomething smashed his wagon but why didnt they pick up the jewels it was the crumbled castle the warlock remembered three years later when he heard about shiskabil he heard of that one directly from a magpie that fluttered out of the sky onto his shoulder and whispered warlock and when he had heard he went shishkabil was a village of stone houses within a stone wall it must have been abandoned suddenly dinners had dried or rotted on their plates meat had been burnt to ash in ovens there were no living inhabitants and no dead the wall had not been breeched but there were signs of violence everywhere broken furniture doors with broken locks or splintered hinges crusted spears and swords and makeshift clubs and blood dried black blood everywhere as if it had rained blood clubfoot was a younger guild member thin and earnest though talented he was still a little afraid of the power he commanded through magic he was not happy in shiskabil he walked with shoulders hunched trying to avoid the places where blood had pooled weird isnt it but i had a special reason to send for you he said theres a dead region outside the wall i had the idea someone might have used a warlocks wheel there a rectangular plot of fertile ground utterly dead a foretaste of a world dead to magic in the center were crumbled stones with green plants growing between the warlock circled the place unwilling to step where magic did not work he had used the wheel once before against glirendree after the demonsword had killed his shadow demon the wheel had sucked the youth from him left the warlock two hundred years old in a few seconds there was magic worked in the village said clubfoot i tried a few simple spells the mana levels very low i dont remember any famous sorcerers from shiskabil do you no then whatever happened here was done by magic clubfoot almost whispered the word magic could be very evilas he knew they found a zigzag path through the dead borderline and a faintly live region inside at a gesture from the warlock the crumbled stones stirred feebly trying to rise so it was somebodys castle said clubfoot i wonder how he got this effect i thought of something like it once say you put a heavy kinetic spell on a smaller wheel the wheel would spin very fast would use up mana in a very tight area clubfoot was nodding i see it he could have run it on a track a close path it would give him a kind of hedge against magic around a live region and he left the border open so he could get his tools in and out he zigzagged the entrance so no spells could get through nobody could use farsight on him i wonder i wonder what he had to hide i wonder what happened in shiskabil said the warlock and he remembered the dead barrier that hid the hill magicians castle his leisurely duel with a faceless enemy was twelve years old it was twentythree years old before they found the third village hathzoril was bigger than shiskabil and better known when a shipment of carvings in ivory and gem woods did not arrive the warlock heard of it the village could not have been abandoned more than a few days when the warlock arrived he and clubfoot found meals half cooked meals half eaten broken furniture weapons that had been taken from their racks broken doors but no blood i wonder why clubfoot was jittery otherwise its just the same the whole population gone in an instant probably against their will ten whole years no more id half forgotten you got here before i did did you find a dead area and a crumbled castle no i looked the younger magician rubbed his birthmaimed foot which he could have cured in half an hour but it would have robbed him of half his powers we could be wrong if its him hes changed his techniques that night the warlock dreamed a scrambled dream in pyrotechnic colors he woke thinking of the hill magician lets climb some hills he told clubfoot in the morninug ive got to know if the hill magician has something to do with these empty villages were looking for a dead spot on top of a hill that mistake almost killed him the last hill clubfoot tried to climb was tumbled crumbled soil and rock that slid and rolled under his feet he tried it near sunset in sheer desperation for they had run out of hills and patience he was still near the base when the warlock came clambering to join him come down from there he laughed nobody would build on this sand heap clubfoot looked around and shouted get out of here youre older the warlock rubbed his face and felt the wrinkles he picked his way back in haste and in care wanting to hurry but fearful of breaking fragile bones he left a trail of fallen silver hair once beyond the manapoor region he cackled in falsetto my mistake i know what he did now clubfoot well find the dead spot inside the hill first well work you a rejuvenation spell clubfoot laid his tools out on a rock a charcoal block a silver knife packets of leaves that borders bad it sucks up mana from inside he must have to move pretty often so he raised up a bill like a breaking wave when the magic ran out the hill just rolled over the castle and covered up everything hell do it again too clever what do you think happened in hathzoril village we may never know the warlock rubbed new wrinkles at the corners of his eyes something bad i think something very bad vi he was strolling through the merchants quarter that afternoon looking at rugs normally this was a cheerful task hanging rugs formed a brightly colored maze through this part of the quarter as aran the rug merchant moved through the maze wellknown voices would call his name then there would be gossip and canny trading he had traded in rynildissen city for nearly thirty years first as lloraginezees apprentice later as his own man the finest rugs and the cheapest from all over this continent and nearby islands came by ship and camels back to rynildissen city wholesalers retailers and the odd nobleman who wished to furnish a palace would travel to rynildissen city to buy today they glowed in the hot sunlight but today they only depressed him aran was thinking of moving away a bald man stepped into view from behind a block of cured sphinx pelts bald as a rocs egg he was yet young and in the prime of muscular good health he was shirtless like a stevedore but his pantaloons were ofhigh quality and his walk was pure arrogance aran felt he was staring rather rudely yet there was something familiar about the man he passed aran without a glance aran glanced back once and was jolted the design seemed to leap out at him a fivesided multicolored tattoo on the mans back aran called warlock he regretted it the next moment the warlock turned on him the look one gives a presumptuous stranger the warlock had not changed at all except for the loss of his hair but aran remembered that thirty years had passed that he himself was a man of fifty with the hollows of his face filled out by rich living he remembered that his greying hair had receded leaving his widows peak as a shock of hair all alone on his forehead and he remembered in great detail the circumstances under which he had met the warlock he had spent a thousand nights plotting vengeance against the warlock yet now his only thought was to get away he said your pardon sir but something else occurred to him so that he said firmly but we have met under what circumstance i do not recall it the warlock said coldly arans answer was a measure of the selfconfidence that comes with wealth and respect he said i was robbing your cave were you the warlock came closer ah the boy from atlantis have you robbed any magicians lately i have adopted a somewhat safer way of life aran said equably and i do have reason for presuming on our brief acquaintance our brief the warlock laughed so that heads turned all over the marketplace still laughing he took arans arm and led him away they strolled slowly through the merchants quarter the warlock leading i have to follow a certain path he explained a project of my own well my boy what have you been doing for thirty years trying to get rid of your glass dagger glass dagger oh yes i remember surely you found time for other hobbies aran almost struck the warlock then but there was something he wanted from the warlock and so he held his temper my whole life has been warped by your damned glass dagger he said i had to circle hvirin gap on my way home when i finally got here i was out of money no money for passage to atlantis and no money to pay for a magician which meant that i couldnt get the glass knife removed so i hired out to lioraginezee the rug merchant as a bodyguard watchdog now im the leading rug merchant in rynildissen city ive got two wives and eight children and a few grandchildren and i dont suppose ill ever get back to atlantis they bought wine from a peddler carrying two fat wineskins on his shoulders they took turns drinking from the great copper goblet the man carried the warlock asked did you ever get rid of the knife no and you ought to know it what kind of a spell did you put on that thing the best magicians in this continent havent been able to so much as touch that knife let alone pull it out i wouldnt be a rug merchant if they had why not well id have earned my passage to atlantis soon enough except that every time i heard about a new magician in the vicinity id go to him to see if he could take that knife out selling rugs was a way to get the money to pay the magicians eventually i gave up on the magicians and kept the money all id accomplished was to spread your reputation in all directions thank you the warlock said politely aran did not like the warlocks amusement he decided to end the conversation quickly im glad we ran into each other he said because i have a problem that is really in your province can you tell me something about a magician named wavyhill it may be that the warlock stiffened what is it that you want to know whether his spells use excessive power the warlock lifted an interrogatory eyebrow you see we try to restrict the use of magic in rynildissen city the whole nation could suffer if a key region like rynildissen city went dead to magic thered be no way to stop a flood or a hurricane or an invasion of barbarians do you find something amusing no no but could a glass dagger possibly have anything to do with your conservative attitude thats entirely my own business warlock unless youd care to read my mind no thank you my apologies id like to point out that more than just the welfare of rynildissen city is involved if this region went dead to magic the harbor mermen would have to move away they have quite an extensive city of their own down there beyond the docks furthermore they run most of the docking facilities and the entire fishing industry relax i agree with you completely you know that the magician laughed you ought to sorry i preach at the drop of a hat its been ten years since anyone saw a dragon near rynildissen city even further out theyre warped changed when i first came here the dragons had a mercenarys booth in the city itself what are you doing the warlock had handed the empty goblet back to the vendor and was pulling at arans arm come this way please quickly before i lose the path path im following a fogged prescient vision i could get killed if i lose the pathor if i dont for that matter now just what was your problem that said aran pointing among the fruit stalls the troll was an apes head on a human body covered from head to toe in coarse brown hair from its size it was probably female but it had no more breasts than a female ape it held a wicker basket in one quite human hand its bright brown eyes glanced up at arans pointing fingerstartlingly human eyesthen dropped to the melon it was considering perhaps the sight should have roused reverence a troll was ancestral to humanity homo habilis long extinct but they were too common millions of the species had been fossilized in the drylands of africa magicians of a few centuries ago had learned that they could be reconstituted by magic i think youve just solved one of my own problems the warlock said quietly he no longer showed any trace of amusement wonderful aran said without sincerity my own problem is how much mana are wavyhills trolls using up the mana level in rynildissen city was never high to start with wavyhill must be using terrifically powerful spells just to keep them walking arans fingertips brushed his chest in an unconscious gesture id hate to leave rynildissen city but if magic stops working here i wont have any choice id have to know the spells involved tell me something about wavyhill will you everything you can remember to most of rynildissen city the advent of wavyhill the magician was very welcome once upon a time troll servants had been common they were terrifically strong suffering no pain they could use hysterical strength for the most mundane tasks being inhuman they could work on official holidays they needed no sleep they did not steal but rynildissen city was old and the mana was running low for many years no troll had walked in ryniidissen city at the gate they turned to blowing dust then came wavyhill with a seemingly endless supply of trolls which did not disintegrate at the gate the peapie paid him high prices in gold and in honors for half a century thieves have worked freely on holidays aran told the warlock now weve got a trollish police force again can you blame people for being grateful they made him a councilmanover my objections which means that theres very little short of murder that wavyhill cant do in rynildissen city im sorry to hear that why did you say over your objections are you on the council yes im the one who rammed through the laws restricting magic in rynildissen city and failed to rain through some others i might add the trouble is that wavyhill doesnt make the trolls in the city nobody knows where they come from if hes depleting the mana level hes doing it somewhere else then whats your problem suppose the trolls use up mana just by existing i should be asking do they i think so said the warlock i knew it warlock will you testify before the council because no i wont but youve got to ill never convince anyone by myself wavyhill is the most respected magician around and hell be testifying against me besides which the council all own trolls themselves they wont want to believe theyve been suckered and they have been if were right the trolls will collapse as soon as theyve lowered the mana level enough at that point man ran down for he had seen with what stony patience the warlock was waiting for him to finish the warlock waited three seconds longer using silence as an exclamation point then he said its gone beyond that talking to the council would be like shouting obscenities at a forest fire i could get results that way you couldnt is he that dangerous i think so man wondered if he was being had but the warlocks face was so grave and man had seen that face in too many nightmares what am doing here he wondered i had a technical question about trolls so i asked a magician and now keep talking i need to know more about wavyhill and walk faster said the warlock how long has he been here wavyhill came to rynildissen city seven years ago nobody knows where he came from he doesnt have any particular accent his palace sits on a hill that looks like its about to fall over what are you nodding at i know that hill keep talking we dont see him often he comes with a troupe of trolls to sell them or he comes to vote with the council on important matters hes short and dark that could be a seeming never mind describe him anyway ive never seen him short wand dark with a pointed nose and a pointed chin and very curly dark hair he wears a dark robe of some soft material a tall pointed hat and sandals and he carries a sword does he the warlock laughed out loud whats the joke i carry a sword myself sometimes oh thats right magicians have a thing about swordsmen thats not why i laughed its a trade joke a sword can be a symbol of masculine virility oh you see the point dont you a sorcerer doesnt need a sword he knows more powerful protections when a sorcerer takes to carrying a sword its pretty plain hes using it as a cure for impotence and it works of course it works its straight oneforone similarity magic isnt it but youve got to take the sword to bed with you laughed the warlock but his eyes found a troll servant and his laughter slipped oddly he watched as the troll hurried through a gate in a high white wall they had passed out of the merchants quarter i think wavyhills a necromancer he said abruptly necromancer what is it it sounds ugly a technical term for a new branch of magic and it is ugly turn sharp left here they ducked into a narrow alley two and three story houses leaned over them from both sides the floor of the alley was filthy until the warlock snarled and gestured then the dirt and garbage flowed to both sides the warlock hurried them deep into the alley we can stop here i think sit down if you like well be here for some timeor i will warlock are you playing games with me what does this new dance have to do with a duel of sorcery a fair question do you know what lies that way mans sense of direction was good and he knew the city the judging place right and that way the vacant lot just this side of adriennes house of pleasuresyou know it the deadest spot hi rynildissen city the palace of shilbree the dreamer once stood there might i ask the courthouse is void of mana too naturally ten thousand defendants and thirty thousand lawyers all praying for conviction or acquittal doesnt leave much magic in any courthouse if i can keep either of those spots between me and wavyhill i can keep him from using farsight on me man thought about it but you have to know where he is no i only have to know where i ought to be most of the time i dont wavyhill and i have manageзl to fog each others prescient senses pretty well but im supposed to be meeting an unknown ally along about now and ive taken great care that wavyhill cant spy on me you see i invented the wheel wavyhill has taken the wheel concept and improved it in at least two ways that i know of naturally he uses up mana at a ferocious rate he may also be a mass murderer and hes my fault thats why ive got to kill him aran remembered then that his wives were waiting dinner he remembered that he had decided to end this conversation hours ago and he remembered a story he had been told of a layman caught in a sorcerers duel and what had befallen him well ive got to be going he said standing up i wish you the best of luck in your duel warlock and if theres anything i can do to help fight with me the warlock said instantly man gaped then he burst out laughing the warlock waited with his own abnormal patience when he had some chance of being heard he said i dreamed that an ally would meet me during this time that ally would accompany me to the gate of wavyhills castle i dont have many of those dreams to help me man wavyhills good if i go alone my forecast is that ill be killed another ally aran suggested no too late the time has passed look aran slapped his belly with the flat of his hand the flesh rippled its not that much extra weight he said for a man im not unsightly but as a wolf id look ten years pregnant i havent turned wolf in years what am doing i dont have to convince you of anything aran said abruptly and he walked away fast the warlock caught him up at the mouth of the alley i swear you wont regret staying theres something you dont know yet dont follow me too far warlock youll lose your path man laughed in the magicians face why should i fight by your side if you really need me to win i couldnt be more delighted ive seen your face in a thousand nightmares you and your glass dagger so die warlock its my dinner time shh said the warlock and mari saw that the warlock was not looking at him but over his shoulder man felt the urge to murder but his eyes flicked to follow the warlocks gaze and the imprecations died in his throat it was a troll only a troll a male with a tremendous pack on its back coming toward them and the warlock was gesturing to it or were those magical passes good he said now i could tell you that its futile to fight fate and you might even believe me because im an expert but id be lying or i could offer you a chance to get rid of the dagger go to hell i learned to live with that dagger wolfman if you never learn anything else from me learn never to blaspheme in the presence of a magician excuse me the troll had walked straight to the mouth of the alley now the warlock took it by the arm and led it inside will you help me i want to get the pack off its back they lifted it down while aran wondered at himself had he been bewitched into obedience the pack was very heavy it took all of arans strength even though the warlock bore the brunt of the load the troll watched them with blank brown eyes good if i tried this anywhere else in the city wavyhill would know it but this time i know where he is hes in adriennes house of pleasures searching for me the fool hes already searched the courthouse never mind that do you know of a village named oath no or shiskabil no wait a shiska had bought six matching green rugs from him once yes a small village north of here something happened to it the population walked out one night leaving all their valuables and a good deal of unexplained blood thats right man felt sudden horrible doubt it was never explained gath was first then shiskabil then hathzorll bigger cities each time at hathzoril he was clever he found a way to hide where his palace had been and he didnt leave any blood but what does he do where do the people go what do you know about mana aran you know that its the power behind magic and you know it can be used up what else im not a magician i sell rugs mana can be used for good or evil it can be drained or transferred from one object to another or from one man to another some men seem to carry mana with them you can find concentrations in oddly shaped stones or in objects of reverence or in meteoroids there is much mans associated with murder said the warlock too much for safety in my day my teacher used to warn us against working near the site of a murder or the corpse of a murdered man or murder weaponsas opposed to weapons of war i might add war and murder are different in intent necromancy uses murder as a source of magic its the most powerful form of magicso powerful that it could never have developed until now when the mana level everywhere in the world is so low i think wavyhill is a necromancer said the warlock and he turned to the troll well know in a moment the troll stood passive its long arms relaxed at its sides watching the warlock with strangely human brown eyes and with a human dignity that contrasted oddly with its low animal brow and hairy body it did not flinch as the warlock dropped a kind of necklace over its head the change came instantly man backed away sucking air the warlocks necklace hung around a mans necka man in his middle thirties blondhaired and bearded wearing a porters kiltand that mans belly had been cut wide open by one clean swing of a sword or scimitar man caught the smell of him he had been dead for three or four days plus whatever time the preserving effects of magic had been at work on him yet he stood passively waiting and his expression had not changed wavyhill has invented a kind of perpetual motion the warlock said dryly but he backed away hastily from the smell of the dead man theres enough power in a murdered man to make him an obedient slave and plenty left over to cast on him the seeming of a troll he takes more mans from the environment but what of that when the mana runs out in gath wavyhifis trolls kill their masters then twice as many trolls move on to shiskabil in hathzoril they probably used strangling cords they wouldnt spill any blood that way and they wouldnt bleed themselves i wonder where hell go after rynildissen nowhere well tell the council and wavyhill a councilman no and you cant spread the word to individual members because eventually one of them would tip wavyhill that youre slandering him theyd believe you all it takes is one who doesnt then he tells wavyhill and wavyhill turns loose the trolls no youll do three things said the warlock in tones not of command but of prophecy youll go home youll spend the next week getting your wives and children out of rynidisen city my gods yes i swore you wouldnt regret hearing me out the third thing if you so decide is to join me at dawn at the north gate a week from today come by way of adriennes house of pleasures the warlock ordered and stay awhile the dead area will break your trail do that today too i dont want wavyhill to follow you by prescience go now said the warlock i cant decide take a week i may not be here how can i contact you you cant it doesnt matter ill go with you or without you abruptly the warlock stripped the necklace from the neck of the standing corpse turned and strode off down the alley following the path the dead man was a troll again it followed aran with large disturbingly human brown eyes vii that predawn morning adriennes house of pleasures was wrapped in thick black fog man the rug merchant hesitated at the door then shivering squared his shoulders and walked out into it he walked with his sword ready for tapping or killing the fog grew lighter as he went but no less dense several times he thought he saw monstrous vague shapes pacing him but there was no attack at dawn he was at the north gate the warlocks mounts were either lizards enlarged by magic or dragons mutated by no magic they were freaks big as twin bungalows one carried baggage the other two saddles in tandem mount up the warlock urged we want to get there before nightfall despite the chill of morning he was bare to the waist he turned in his saddle as man settled behind him have you lost weight i fasted for six days and exercised too and my wives and children are four days on their way to atlantis by sea you can guess what pleasures i chose at adriernies i wouldnt have believed it your bellys as flat as a board a wolf can fast for a long time i ate an unbelievable meal last night today i wont eat at all the fog cleared as they left rynildissen and the morning turned clear and bright and hot when aran mentioned it the warlock said that fog was mine i wanted to blur things for wavyhill i thought i saw shapes in the fog were those yours too no thanks wavyhill meant to frighten you man he wouldnt attack you he knows you wont be killed before we reach the gate that explains the pack lizards i wondered how you could possibly expect to sneak up on him i dont he knows were coming hes waiting the land was rich in magic near wavyhills castle you could tell by the vegetation giant mushrooms vying for variety of shape and color lichens growing in the shapes of men or beasts trees with contorted trunks and branches trees that moved menacingly as the packlizards came near i could make them talk said the warlock but i couldnt trust them theyll be wavyhills allies in the red light of sunset wavyhills castle seemed all rose marble perched at the top of a fairy mountain the slender tower seemed made for kidnapped damsels the mountain itself as man saw it now for the first time was less a breaking wave than a fist raised to the sky in defiance we couldnt use the wheel here said the warlock the whole mountain would fall on us i wouldnt have let you use the wheel i didnt bring one which way up the path he knows were coming is your shadow demon ready shadow demon the warlock seemed to think oh for a moment i didnt know what you were talking about that shadow demon was killed in the battle with glirendree thirty years ago words caught in arans throat then broke loose in a snarl then why dont you put on a shirt habit ive got lots of strange habits why so vehement i dont know ive been staring at your back since morning i guess i was counting on the shadow demon aran swallowed its just us then just us arent you even going to take a sword or a dagger no shall we go the other side of the hill was a sixty degree slope the narrow meandering path could not support the lizard beasts man and the warlock dismounted and began to climb the warlock said theres no point in subtlety we know well get as far as the gate so does wavyhill excuse me he threw a handful of silver dust ahead of them the road was about to throw us off apparently wavyhill doesnt take anything for granted but man had only the warlocks word for it and that was the only danger that threatened their climb there was a rectangular pond blocking the solid copper gates an arched bridge led across the pond they were approaching the bridge when their first challenger pushed between the gates what is it man whispered ive never heard of anything like it there isnt its a changed one call it a snail dragon a snail dragon its spiral shell was just wide enough to block the gate completely its slender supple body was fully exposed reared high to study the intruders shiny leaflike scales covered the head and neck but the rest of the body was naked a soft greyishbrown its eyes were like black marbles its teeth were white and pointed and the longest pair had been polished to a liquid glow from the other side of the small arched bridge the warlock called ho guardian were you told of our coming no said the dragon were you welcome i would have been told welcome the warlock guffawed we came to kill your master now the interesting thing is that he knows of our coming why did he not warn you the snail dragon tilted its mailed head the warlock answered himself ho knows that we will pass this gate he suspects that we must pass over your dead body he chose not to tell you so that was kind of him the dragons voice was low and very gravelly a sound like rocks being crushed kind yes but since we are foredoomed to pass why not step aside or make for the bills and we will keep your secret it cannot be youre a changed one snail dragon beasts whose energy of life is partly magical breed oddly where the mana is low most changed ones are not viable so it is with you said the warlock the shell could not protect you from a determined and patient enemy or were you counting on speed to save you you raise a salient point said the guardian if i were to leave now what then my master will very probably kill you when you reach his sanctum then by and by this week or the next he will wonder how you came to pass his guardian then next week or the week following he will come to see or to remove the discarded shell by then with luck and a good tail wind i could be halfway to the woods perchance he will miss me in the tall grass said the bungalowsized beast no better to take my chances here in the gate at least i know the direction of attack damn youre right said the warlock my sympathies snail dragon and he set about fixing the bridge into solidity half of it the half on the side away from the gate really was solid the other half was a reflected illusion until the warlockdid things the dead border runs under the water he told man dont fall into it the snail dragon withdrew most of itself into its shell only his scaly head showed now as aran and the warlock crossed aran came running he was still a man it was not certain that wavybill knew that aran was a werewolf it was certain that they would pass the gate so he reserved his last defense and came at the dragon with a naked sword the dragon blew fire aran went through it he carried a charm against dragon fire but he couldnt see through it it shocked hell out of him when teeth closed on his shoulder the dragon had stretched incredibly man screamed and bounced his blade off the metallic scales andthe teeth loosed him snapped ineffectually at the warlock who danced back laughing waving but the warlock had been unarmed the dragon collapsed his thick neck was cut half in two behind the scales the warlock wiped his weapon on his pantaloons and held it up aran felt suddenly queasy the warlock laughed again what good is a glass dagger the fun thing about being a magician is that everyone always expects you to use magic but but its just a glass dagger no spells on it nothing wavyhill could detect i had a friend drop it in the pond two days ago glass in water is near enough to invisible to fool the likes of wavyhill excuse my open mouth i just dont like glass daggers now what the corpse and shell of the snail dragon still blocked the gate if we try to squeeze around we could be trapped i suppose well have to go over fast said aran right fast keep in mind that he could be anywhere the warlock took a running start and ran climbed up the curve of the shell aran followed almost as quickly in his sanctum the snail dragon had said the picture he had evoked was still with aran as he went up the shell wavyhill would be hidden in his basement or his tower room in some place of safety man and the warlock would have to fight their way through whatever the enemy could raise against them while wavyhill watched to gauge their defenses there were similar tales of magicians battles aran was ravenously hungry it gave him a driving energy he hadnt had in years decades his pumping legs drove a body that seemed featherlight he reached the top of the shell just as the warlock was turning full about in apparent panic then he saw them a horde of armed and armored skeletons coming at them up a wooden plank there must have been several score of them man shouted and drew his sword how do you kill a skeleton the warlock shouted too strange words in the guild language the skeletons howled a whirlwind seemed to grip them and lift them and fling them forward already they were losing form like smoke rings aran turned to see the last of them vanishing into the warlocks back my name is legion they must have been animated by a single demon and the warlock had pulled that demon into a demon trap empty and waiting for thirty years the problem was that both man and the warlock had been concentrating on the plural demon the warlocks back was turned and man could do nothing he spotted wavyhill gesticulating from across the courtyard in the instant before wavyhill completed his spell man turned to shout a warning and so he saw what the spell did to the warlock the warlock was old in an instant the flesh seemed to fade into his bones he looked bewildered spat a mouthful of blackened pebblesno teethclosed his eyes and started to fall man caught him it was like catching an armload of bones he eased the warlock onto his back on the great snail shell the warlocks breathing was stertorous he could not have long to live aran the merchant aran looked down what did you do to him the magician wavyhill was dressed as usual in dark robe and sandals and pointed hat a belt with a shoulder loop held his bighilted sword just clear of the ground he called that is precisely what i wish to discuss i have found an incantation that behaves as the warlocks wheel behaves but directionally is this over your head i understand you in laymans terms ive sucked the magic from him that leaves him two hundred and twentysix years old i believe that gives me the win my problem is whether to let you live aran do you understand what my spell will do to you man did buttell me anyway then tell me how you found out from some of my colleagues of course after i determined that you were my enemy you must have consulted an incredible number of magicians regarding the ghostly knife in your heart more than a dozen well leave in peace dont come back i have to take the warlock he is my enemy hes my ally i wont leave him said aran take him then aran stooped he was fortyeight years old and the bitterness of defeat had replaced the manic energy of battle but the warlock was little more than a snoring mummy dry and light the problem would be to get the fragile old man down from the snail shell wavyhill was chanting aran stoodin time to see the final gesture then the spell hit him for an instant he thought that the knife had truly reappeared in his heart but the pain was all through him like a million taut strings snapping inside him the shape of his neck changed grindingly all of his legs snapped forward his skull flattened his eyes lost color vision his nose stretched his lips pulled back from bared teeth the change had never come so fast had never been more complete a blackness fell on arans mind it was a wolf that rolled helplessly off the giant snail shell and into the courtyard a wolf bounced heavily and rolled to its feet snarled deep in its throat and began walking stifflegged toward wavyhill wavyhill was amazed he started the incantation over speaking very fast as aran approached he finished as aran came within leaping distance this time there was no change at all except that aran leapt and wavyhill jumped back just short of far enough and aran tore his throat out for aran the nightmare began then what had gone before was as sweet dreams wavyhill should have been dead his severed carotid arteries pumped frantically his windpipe made horrid bubbling sounds andwavyhill drew his sword and attacked aran the wolf circled and moved in and slashedand backed away howling for wavyhills sword had run him through the heart the wound healed instantly aran the wolf was not surprised he leapt away and circled and slashed and was stabbed again and circled it went on and on wavyhills blood had stopped flowing hed run out yet he was still alive so was his sword or so it seemed aran never attacked unless it seemed safe but the sword bit him every time and every time he attacked he came away with a mouthful of wavyhill he was going to win he could not help but win his wounds healed as fast as they were made wavyhills did not aran was stripping the flesh from the magicians bones there was a darkness on his brain he moved by animal cunning again and again he herded wavyhill back onto the slippery flagstones where wavyhill had spilled five quarts of his blood four feet were surer than two it was that cunning that led him to bar wavyhill from leaving the courtyard he tried he must have stored healing magic somewhere in the castle but aran would not let him reach it he had done something to himself that would not let him die he must be regretting it terribly man the wolf had crippled him now slashing at his ankles until there was not a shred of muscle left to work the bones wavyhill was fighting on his knees now man came closer suffering the bite of the sword to reach the magician nightmare aran the peacemonger had been wrong if aran the rug merchant could work on and on stripping the living flesh from a man in agony taking a stab wound for every biteif aran could suffer such agonies to do this to anyone for any cause then neither the end of magic nor anything else would ever persuade men to give up war they would fight on with swords and stones and whatever they could find for as long as there were men the blackness had lifted from arans brain it must have been the sword the mana in an enchanted sword had replaced the mana sucked from him by wavyhills variant of the warlocks wheel and finally he realized that the sword was fighting alone wavyhill was little more than bloody bones he might not be dead but he certainly couldnt move the sword waved itself at the end of the stripped bones of his arm still trying to keep aran away aran slid past the blade he gripped the hilt in his teeth and pulled it from the magicians stillfleshy hand the hand fought back with a senseless determined grip but it wasnt enough he had to convert to human to climb the dragon shell the warlock was still alive but his breathing was a thing of desperation aran laid the blade across the warlocks body and waited the warlock grew young not as young as he had been but he no longer lookeddead he was in the neighborhood of seventy years old when he opened his eyes blinked and asked what happened you missed all the excitement said aran i take it you beat him my apologies its been thirty years since i fought glirendree with every magician in the civilized world trying to duplicate the warlocks wheel one or another was bound to improve on the design he used it on me too oh the warlock chuckled i suppose youre wondering about the knife it did come to mind where is it in my belt did you think id leave it in your chest id had a dream that i would need it so i kept it and sure enough but it was in my heart i made an image of it i put the image in your heart then faded it out arans fingernails raked his chest you miserable son of an ape you let me think that knife was in me for thirty years you came to my house as a thief the warlock reminded him not an invited guest aran the merchant had acquired somewhat the same attitude toward thieves with diminished bitterness he said just a little magicians joke was it no wonder nobody could get it out all right now tell me why wavyhills spell turned me into a wolf the warlock sat up carefully he said what he waved his arms at me and sucked all the mana out of me and i turned into a wolf i even lost my human intelligence probably my invulnerability too if he hadnt been using an enchanted sword hed have cut me to ribbons i dont understand that you should have been frozen into human form unless then visibly the answer hit him his pale cheeks paled further presently he said youre not going to like this aran man could see it in the warlocks face seventy years old and very tired and full of pity go on he said the wheel is a new thing even the dead spots arent that old the situation has never come up before thats all people automatically assume that werewolves are people who can turn themselves into wolves it seems obvious enough you cant even make the change without moonlight you keep your human intelligence but theres never been proof one way or another until now youre saying im a wolf without magic youre a wolf the warlock agreed does it matter ive spent most of my life as a man man whispered what difference does it makeoh oh yes it wouldnt matter if you didnt have children eight and theyll have children and one day the mana will be gone everywhere on earth then what warlock you know already theyll be wild dogs for the rest of eternity and nothing anyone can do about it oh yes there is im going to see to it that no magician ever enters rynildissen again man stood up on the dragons shell do you hear me warlock your kind will be barred magic will be barred well save the mana for the sea people and the dragons it may be that he succeeded fourteen thousand years later there are still tales of werewolves where rynildissen city once stood certainly there are no magicians afterword a word about how these stories came to be written i had been claiming that time travel is fantasy as opposed to science fiction that is time travel is clearly impossible on any level one morning it hit me that if time travel is fantasy then a working time machine would and the result was get a horse retitled the flight of the horse i outlined the story that afternoon and told it to some people at a cocktail party that night a good test for a story idea if you can tell it standing up without confusing yourself confusing your listener or losing his interest its a story worth writing i used to bend my brothers ear constantly now i can generally judge a story without that test but i told all of the svetz stories before i wrote them the theme is fun to play games with see the extension cage is a fantasy vehicle and svetz doesnt know it one thing about fantasy a fantasy story selfadmittedly has no connection with any specific reality thus the writer is obligated to talk in universals otherwise hes not talking about anything it took me a good long time to learn how to write fantasy primarily i write science fiction glass dagger is my only swordsandsorcery novelette to date and possibly forever i hate writing for deadlines ive only done it twice in my life both times for bob silverbergs anthologies he can tell you what happened the first time when i promised him a pluto story for tomorrows worlds with two weeks to his deadline i had already written him a letter saying that he couldnt have the story sorry i only had half an idea and two weeks wasnt enough the letter was sitting on my hifl set waiting to be mailed when i got the other half of the idea bob got a tiny story practically a vignette and he got it at the last possible moment there was no such problem with flash crowd fm happy to say except that my wife who remembers that occasion kept nudging me to sit down and write it nagging nagging always nagging i turned the story in days early and the notes left over leave room for a whole series of stories dealing with a society moulded by teleportation someday ill write it
