benjamin said gentle mrs pope who had a kindly and sympathetic heart isnt that a little hard hard alrnira said the squire arching his eyebrows i fail to comprehend your meaning you know philip has been tenderly reared and has always had a comfortable home he will have a comfortable home now mrs pope probably you are not aware that it cost the town two thousand dollars last year to maintain the almshouse i can show you the item in the town report i dont doubt it at all husband said mrs pope gently of course you know all about it being a public man squire pope smiled complacently it pleased him to be spoken of as a public man ahem well yes i believe i have no inconsiderable influence in town affairs he responded i am on the board of selectmen and am chairman of the overseers of the poor and in that capacity i shall convey philip gray to the comfortable and wellordered institution which the town has set apart for the relief of paupers i dont like to think of philip as a pauper said mrs pope in a deprecating tone what else is he urged her husband his father hasnt left a cent he never was a good manager wont the furniture sell for something benjamin it will sell for about enough to pay the funeral expenses and outstanding debtsthat is all but it seems so hard for a boy well brought up to go to the poorhouse you mean well almira but you let your feelings run away with you you may depend upon it it is the best thing for the boy but i must write a letter in time for the mail squire pope rose from the breakfasttable and walked out of the room with his usual air of importance not even in the privacy of the domestic circle did he forget his social and official importance who was squire pope we already know that he held two important offices in the town of norton he was a portly man and especially cultivated dignity of deportment being in easy circumstances and even rich for the resident of a village he was naturally looked up to and credited with a worldly sagacity far beyond what he actually possessed at any rate he may he considered the magnate of norton occasionally he visited new york and had been very much annoyed to find that his rural importance did not avail him there and that he was treated with no sort of deference by those whom he had occasion to meet somehow the citizens of the commercial metropolis never suspected for a single moment that he was a great man when squire pope had finished his letter he took his hat and with measured dignity walked to the village postoffice he met several of his neighbors there and greeted them with affable condescension he was polite to those of all rank as that was essential to his retaining the town offices which he would have been unwilling to resign from the postoffice the squire as he remembered the conversation which had taken place at the breakfasttable went to make an official call on the boy whose fate he had so summarily decided before the call it may be well to say a word about philip gray our hero and the circumstances which had led to his present destitution his father had once been engaged in mercantile business but his health failed his business suffered and he found it bestindeed necessary to settle up his affairs altogether and live in quiet retirement in norton the expenses of living there were small but his resources were small also and he lived just long enough to exhaust them it was this thought that gave him solicitude on his deathbed for he left a boy of fifteen wholly unprovided for let us go back a week and record what passed at the last interview between philip and his father before the latter passed into the state of unconsciousness which preceded death are you in pain father asked philip with earnest sympathy as his father lay outstretched on the bed his face overspread by the deathly pallor which was the harbinger of dissolution not of the body philip said mr gray that is spared me but i own that my mind is ill at ease do you mind telling me why father no for it relates to you my son or rather to your future when my affairs are settled i fear there will be nothing left for your support i shall leave you penniless if that is all father dont let that trouble you i am afraid philip you dont realize what it is to be thrown upon the cold charities of the world i shall work for my living said philip confidently you will have to do that im afraid philip but i am not afraid to work father didnt you tell me one day that many of our most successful men had to work their way up from early poverty yes that is true but a boy cannot always get the chance to earn his living of one thing i am glad you have a good education for a boy of your age that is always a help thanks to you father yes though an invalid i have at all events been able to give private attention to your education and to do better for you than the village school would have done i wish i had some relative to whom i might consign you but you will be alone in the world have i no relatives asked philip your mother was an only child and i had but one brother what became of him father he got into trouble when he was a young man and left the country where he went to i have no idea probably he went first to europe and i heard a rumor at one time that he had visited australia but that was twenty years ago and as i have heard nothing of him since i think it probable that he is dead even if he were living and i knew where he was i am not sure whether he would make a safe guardian for you have you any advice to give me father asked philip after a pause whatever your wishes may be i will try to observe them i do not doubt it philip you have always been an obedient son and have been considerate of my weakness i will think it over and try to give you some directions which may be of service to you perhaps i may be able to think of some business friend to whom i can commend you you have talked enough father said philip noticing his fathers increasing pallor and the evident exertion with which he spoke rest now and tomorrow we can talk again mr gray was evidently in need of rest he closed his eyes and apparently slept but he never awoke to consciousness the conversation above recorded was the last he was able to hold with his son for two days he remained in a kind of stupor and at the end of that time he died philips grief was not violent he had so long anticipated his fathers death that it gave him only a mild shock friends and neighbors made the necessary arrangements for the funeral and the last services were performed then at length philip realized that he had lost his best earthly friend and that he was henceforth alone in the world he did not as yet know that squire pope had considerately provided him with a home in the village poorhouse chapter ii philip at home when the funeral was over frank dunbar whom philip regarded as his most intimate friend came up to him philip he said my mother would like to have you spend a few days with us while you are deciding what to do thank you frank answered philip but until the auction i shall remain at home i shall soon enough be without a home but it will be very lonely for you objected frank no i shall have my thoughts for company when i am alone i can think best of my future plans wont you come to our house to meals then thank you frank i will do that when is the auction to be today is monday it is appointed for thursday i hope there will be something left for you there will be about enough left to pay my fathers small debts and his funeral expenses i would not like to have him indebted to others for those i dont think there will be anything over frank looked perplexed i am sorry for you phil he said i wish we were rich instead of having hard work to make both ends meet you would not lack for anything then dear frank said philip earnestly i never doubted your true friendship but i am not afraid that i shall suffer i am sure i can earn my living but why do you shut yourself up alone philip asked frank not satisfied to leave his friend in what he considered the gloomy solitude of a house just visited by death i want to look over my fathers papers i may find out something that i ought to know and after the auction it will be too late father had some directions to give me but he did not live long enough to do it for three days i have the house to myself after that i shall perhaps never visit it again dont be downhearted philip said frank pressing his hand with boyish sympathy i dont mean to be frank i am naturally cheerful and hopeful i shall miss my poor father sadly but grieving will not bring him back i must work for my living and as i have no money to depend upon i cannot afford to lose any time in forming my plans you will come over to our house and take your meals yes frank frank dunbars father was a small farmer who as frank had said found it hard work to make both ends meet among all the village boys he was the one whom philip liked best though there were many others whose fathers were in hotter circumstances for this however philip cared little rich or poor frank suited him and they had always been known as chums to adopt the term used by the boys in the village it may be thought that as philips circumstances were no better such an intimacy was natural enough but philip gray possessed special gifts which made his company sought after he was a fine singer and played with considerable skill on the violin an accomplishment derived from his father who had acted as his teacher then he was of a cheerful temperament and this is a gift which usually renders the possessor popular unless marred by positive defects or bad qualities there were two or three young snobs in the village who looked down upon philip on account of his fathers poverty but most were very glad to associate with our hero and have him visit their homes he was courteous to all but made no secret of his preference for frank dunbar when philip parted from frank and entered the humble dwelling which had been his own and his fathers home for years there was a sense of loneliness and desolation which came over him at first his father was the only relative whom he knew and his death therefore left the boy peculiarly alone in the world everything reminded him of his dead father but he did not allow himself to dwell upon thoughts that would depress his spirits and unfit him for the work that lay before him he opened his fathers desk and began to examine his papers there was no will for there was nothing to leave but in one compartment of the desk was a thick wallet which he opened in it among some receipted bills was an envelope on which was written in his fathers wellknown hand the contents of this envelope are probably of no value but it will be as well to preserve the certificate of stock there is a bare possibility that it may some day be worth a trifle philip opened the envelope and found a certificate for a hundred shares of the excelsior gold mine which appeared to be located in california he had once heard his father speak of it in much the same terms as above i may as well keep it reflected philip it will probably amount to nothing but there wont be much trouble in carrying around the envelope he also found a note of hand for a thousand dollars signed by thomas graham attached to it was a slip of paper on which he read also in his fathers writing this note represents a sum of money lent to thomas graham when i was moderately prosperous it is now outlawed and payment could not be enforced even if graham were alive and possessed the ability to pay five years since he left this part of the country for some foreign country and is probably dead and i have heard nothing from him in all that time it will do no harm and probably no good to keep his note i will keep it decided philip it seems that this and the mining shares are all that father had to leave me they will probably never yield me a cent but i will keep them in remembrance of him phillip found his fathers watch it was an oldfashioned gold watch but of no great value even when new now after twenty years use it would command a very small price at the coming sale ever since philip had been old enough to notice anything he remembered this watch which was so closely identified with his father that more than anything else it called him to mind philip looked at it wistfully as it lay in his hand i wish i could keep it he said to himself no one else will value it much but it would always speak to me of my father i wonder if i might keep it philip had a mind to put it into his pocket but the spirit of honesty forbade it must be sold he said with a sigh without it there wouldnt be enough to pay what we owe and when i leave norton i dont want any one to say that my father died in his debt there was nothing else in the desk which called for particular notice or appeared to be of any special value after a careful examination philip closed it and looked around at the familiar furniture of the few rooms which the house contained there was one object which he personally valued more than anything else this was his violin on which he had learned all that he knew of playing his father had bought it for him four years before it was not costly but it was of good tone and philip had passed many pleasant hours in practicing on it i can take this violin at any rate said philip to himself it belongs to me and no one else has a claim on it i think i will take it with me and leave it at frank dunbars so that it neednt get into the sale he put back the violin into the case and laid it on one side then he sat down in the armchair which had been his fathers favorite seat and tried to fix his mind upon the unknown future which lay before him he had sat there for half an hour revolving in his mind various thoughts and plans when he heard a tap on the window and looking up saw through the pane the coarse red face of nick holden a young fellow of eighteen the son of the village butcher let me in said nick i want to see you on business chapter iii nick holdens call philip had never liked nick holden he was a coarse roughlooking boy his reddish face one mass of freckles and about as unattractive as a person could be without absolute deformity this however was not the ground for philips dislike with all his unattractiveness nick might have possessed qualities which would have rightly made him popular so far from this however he was naturally mean selfish and a bully with very slight regard for truth will it be believed that in spite of his homely face nick really thought himself goodlooking and aspired to be a beau for this reason he had often wished that he possessed philips accomplishment of being able to play upon the violin his conversational powers were rather limited and he felt at a loss when he undertook to make himself fascinating to the young ladies in the village if he could only play on the violin like philip he thought he would be irresistible he had therefore conceived the design of buying philips instrument for a trifle judging that our hero would feel compelled to sell it the reader will now understand the object which led to nicks call so soon after the funeral of mr gray he was afraid some one else might forestall him in gaining possession of the coveted instrument when philip saw who his visitor was he was not overjoyed it was with reluctance that he rose and gave admission to nick i thought i would call around and see you phil said nick as he sat down in the most comfortable chair in the room thank you responded phil coldly the old man went off mighty sudden continued nicholas with characteristic delicacy do you mean my father inquired philip of course i do there aint any one else dead is there i had been expecting my poor fathers death for some time said philip gravely just so he want very rugged weve all got to come to it sooner or later i expect dadll die of apoplexy some timehes so awful fat remarked nicholas cheerfully if he does its lucky hes got me to run the business im only eighteen but i can get along as well as anybody im kinder smart in business i am glad you are smart in anything thought philip for he knew that nick was a hopeless dunce in school duties i hope your fatherll live a good while he said politely yes of course said nick lightly id be sorry to have the old man pop off but then you never can tell about such a thing as that philip did not relish the light way in which nick referred to such a loss as he was suffering from and by way of changing the subject said i believe you said you came on business nicholas yes thats what i wanted to come at its about your fiddle my violin said philip rather surprised oh well fiddle or violin whats the odds i want to buy it what for to play on of course what did you think i wanted it for but you cant play can you not yet but i expect you could show me some now couldnt you what put it into your head to want to play on the violin asked philip with some curiosity why you see the girls like it it would be kind of nice when i go to a party or marm has company to scrape off a tune or twojust like you do it makes a feller kinder poplar with the girls dont you see said nick with a knowing grin and you want to be popular with the young ladies said philip smiling in spite of his bereavement at the idea being entertained by such a clumsylooking caliban as nick holden of course i do answered nick with another grin you see im gettin alongill be nineteen next month and i might want to get married by the time im twentyone especially if the old man should drop off sudden i understand all that nicholas call me nick i aint stuck up if i am most a man call me pet names dearest and nicholas laughed loudly at his witty quotation just as you prefer nick then i understand your object but what made you think i wanted to sell the violin it was nicks turn to be surprised aint there goin to be an auction of your fathers things he said yes but the violin is mine and i am not going to sell it youll have to said nick what do you mean by that nicholas holden said philip quickly because youll have to sell everything to pay your fathers debt my father said so this very morning i think i know my own business best said philip coldly i shall keep the violin maybe it aint for you to say returned nick apparently not aware of his insolence come now ill tell you what ill do my fathers got a bill against yours for a dollar and sixtyfour cents i told father i had a use for the fiddle and he says if youll give it to me hell call it square there what do you say to that nicholas leaned back in his chair and looked at philip through his small fishy eyes as if he had made an uncommonly liberal offer as for philip he hardly knew whether to be angry or amused you offer me a dollar and sixtyfour cents for my violin he repeated yes its secondhand to be sure but i guess its in pretty fair condition besides you might help me a little about learnin how to play how much do you suppose the violin cost inquired philip couldnt say it cost my father twentyfive dollars oh come now thats too thin you dont expect a feller to believe such a story as that i expect to be believed for i never tell anything but the truth oh well i dont expect yon do generally but when it comes to tradin most everybody lies observed nick candidly i have no object in misrepresenting for i dont want to sell the violin you cant afford to keep it the town wont let you the town wont let me echoed philip now thoroughly mystified of course they wont the idea of a pauper bein allowed a fiddle to play on why its ridiculous what do you mean demanded philip who now began to comprehend the meaning of this thickwitted visitor what have i got to do with the town or with paupers why youre goin to the poorhouse aint you certainly not answered philip with flashing eyes i guess youre mistaken said nick coolly squire pope was over to our shop this mornin and he told dad that the seleckmen were goin to send you there after the auction philips eyes flashed angrily he felt insulted and outraged never for a moment had he conceived the idea that any one would regard him as a candidate for the poorhouse he had an honorable pride in maintaining himself and would rather get along on one meal a day earned by himself in honest independence than be indebted to public charity even for a luxurious support squire pope doesnt know what hes talking about retorted philip who had to exercise some selfrestraint not to express himself more forcibly and you can tell him so when you see him i am no more likely to go to the poorhouse than you are come thats a good one chuckled nick talk of me goin to the poorhouse when my father pays one of the biggest taxes in town of course its different with you youll have to excuse me now said philip determined to get rid of his disagreeable companion i have something to do then you wont sell me the fiddle phil no i wont answered our hero with scant ceremony then ill have to bid it off at the auction maybe ill get it cheaper and mr nicholas holden at length relieved philip of his company chapter iv the auction it so happened that nick holden met squire pope on the village street and being rather disappointed at the result of his negotiations with philip thought it might be a good idea to broach the subject to the squire who as he knew had taken it upon himself to superintend the sale of mr grays goods i say squire ive just been over to see phil gray ahem well how does he seem to feel kinder stuck up i reckon he said he wouldnt go to the poorhouse and i might tell you so i apprehend said the squire in his stately way he will be under the necessity of going whether he likes it or not just so thats what i told him interjected nick and he should be grateful for so comfortable a home continued the public man well i dunno said nick they do say that old tucker most starves the paupers why his bills with dad are awful small the town cannot afford to pamper the appetites of its beneficiaries said the squire where is philip now i guess hes at home i offered to buy his fiddle but he said he was going to keep it i offered him a dollar and sixtyfour cents the same as dads bill against his father but he wouldnt take it really nicholas your offer was very irregular extremely irregular it should have been made to me as the administrator of the late mr gray and not to a boy like philip will you sell me the fiddle for dads bill squire asked nicholas eagerly you are premature nicholas whats that i mean you must wait till the auction then you will have a chance to bid on the instrument if you want to secure it phil says its his and wont be for sale at the auction then philip is mistaken he is only a boy the estate will be settled by those who are older and wiser than he i guess youll find him hard to manage squire said nick laughing we shall see we shall see returned the squire and with a dignified wave of the hand he cotinued on his walk after the visit of nicholas philip thought it most prudent to convey the violin which he prized so much to the house of his friend frank dunbar where he had been invited to take his meals he was willing to have the furniture sold to defray his fathers small debts but the violin was his own it had not even been given him by his father though the latter purchased it the money which it cost had been given to philip by a friend of the family he rightly thought that he had no call to sell it now frank said he to his boyfriend i want you to put away my violin safely and keep it until after the auction of course i will phil but wont you want to play on it not at present ill tell you why i want it put away and philip told his friend about nicks application to purchase it and the liberal offer he had made nicks generosity never will hurt him much said frank laughing what in the world did he want of your violin he wants to make himself popular with the girls hell never do that even if he learns to play like an angel said frank you ought to hear the girls talk about him he couldnt get a single one of them to go home with from singingschool last winter he teased my sister to go but she told him every time she was engaged to some one else the two days that intervened between the funeral and the auction passed and the last scene connecting philip with the little cottage which had been his home was to take place in a country town an auctionhowever inconsiderabledraws together an interested company of friends and neighbors and though no articles of value were to be sold this was the case at the present sale philip didnt at first mean to be present he thought it would only give him pain but at the last moment he came having been requested to do so by squire pope as information might be required which he could give the bulk of the furniture was soon disposed of at low prices to be sure but sufficiently high to make it clear that enough would be realized to pay the small bills outstanding philips lip quivered when his fathers watch was put up he would have liked to buy it but this was impossible for he had only about a dollar of his own nick holdens eyes sparkled when he saw the watch he had forgotten about that but as soon as he saw it he coveted it he had a cheap silver watch of his own which he had bought secondhand about three years before he had thought that he might some day possess a gold watch but he was not willing to lay out the necessary sum of money by dint of actual meanness he had laid up two hundred dollars which he now had in the savingsbank in the next village and he could therefore have bought one if he had chosen but like gilpin though on pleasure bent he had a frugal mind now however there seemed a chance of getting a gold watch at a low price nick reasoned rightly that at an auction it would go much below its value and it would be a good thing for him to buy iteven as an investmentas he would probably have chances enough to trade it off at a handsome profit i shouldnt wonder if i could double my money on it he reflected accordingly when the watch was put up nick eagerly bid two dollars philips lip curled when he heard this generous bid and he heartily hoped that this treasured possession of his dead father might not fall into such hands nick rather hoped that no one would bid against him but in this he was destined to be disappointed five dollars was next heard and this bid came from mr dunbar the father of his friend frank philips eyes brightened up for there was no one he would sooner see the possessor of the watch than his kind friend nick looked chopfallen when he heard this large increase on his original bid and hesitated to continue but finally mustered up courage to say in a rather feeble tone five and a quarter five dollars and a quarter bid said the auctioneer do i hear more six dollars said mr dunbar quietly the bid was repeated and the auctioneer waited for a higher one but nick retired ignominiously from the contest he wasnt sure whether he could get much over six dollars for it himself and he foresaw that mr dunbar intended to have it even if it cost considerable more its kinder hard on a feller he complained to the man standing next him what does mr dunbar want of the watch hes got one already perhaps he thinks it is a good bargain at the price its what ive been wantin all along said nick he might have let me have it why dont you bid more i wanted to get it cheap and the auctioneer wants to get as much as he can for the articles and so do philips friends this was a consideration which of course had no weight with nicholas however he had one comfort he would bid on the violin and probably no one else would bid against it he did not see it to be sure but concluded of course that it would be bid off when the sale drew near the end he went to philip and said whereabouts is the fiddle phil it isnt here answered our hero aint it goin to be sold of course not its mine i told you that once already well see said nicholas angrily and going up to squire pope he held a brief conversation with that gentleman the squire nodded vigorously and walked over to philip philip said he go and bring your violin what will i do that for asked our hero quietly so that it may be sold it is not to be sold returned philip quietly it belongs to me nothing belongs to you except your clothes said the squire angrily i require you to go and fetch the instrument and i decline to do it said philip do you know who i am demanded the squire with ruffled dignity i know you perfectly well answered philip but i am the owner of the violin and i dont mean to have it sold you will repent this said squire pope who felt that his lawful authority and official dignity were set at naught philip bowed and left the house he did not know what steps the squire might take but he was resolved not to give up his cherished violin chapter v an alliance against philip squire pope was not a bad man nor was he by nature a tyrant but he was so fully convinced of his own superior judgment that he was in all things obstinately bent on having his own way he had persuaded himself that our young hero philip would be better off in the poorhouse than in a place where he could earn his own living and no one could convince him to the contrary as to the boys feelings on the subject he considered those of no importance he had good reason to know that philip would object to being an inmate of the almshouse but he was determined that he should go there in like manner before the auction was over he saw clearly that it would realize a sum more than sufficient to pay the funeral expenses of the late mr gray and the few small bills outstanding against his estate and that there was no necessity that philips violin should be sold but none the less he resolved that it should be sold shall i allow a young lad to dictate to me squire pope asked himself in irritation certainly not i know better what is right than he it is ridiculous that a town pauper should own a violin why the next thing we shall have to buy pianos for our almshouses for the use of the gentlemen and ladies who occupy them a violin indeed this squire pope regarded as irresistible logic and withering sarcasm combined he saw philip go out of the cottage but as the sale was not over he was unable to follow him never mind ill fix him as soon as i have time he said to himself back so soon is the auction over asked his friend frank dunbar who was engaged in splitting wood in the rear of the house no frank not quite but its almost overwho do you think bid on fathers gold watch i dont know nick holden he didnt get it did he i am glad to say not your father bought it did he why hes got one watch already i am glad hes got it i couldnt bear to think of nick holden carrying my fathers watch he was disappointed about one thing besides what was that the violin he went to squire pope and complained that it was not in the sale thats just like his impudence what did the squire say he came to me and ordered me to get it so that it might be sold shall i get it for you then not much answered philip emphatically it is mine as i have already told you if the auction doesnt bring in enough to settle up everything i may agree to sell it for a fair price but i am sure from the prices that it wont be necessary squire popes a dreadful obstinate man said frank doubtfully he may insist upon your selling the violin let him do it said philip contemptuously i should like to see him get it where have you put it frank where squire pope wont be apt to find it in an old chest up in the garret its full of old clothes belonging to my grandfather and hasnt been looked into by any one except me for years i put it away under all the clothes at the bottom no one knows where it is except you and me not even mother thats good i guess we can defy the squire then half an hour later mr dunbar came home from the auction philip went to meet him thank you for buying fathers watch he said but for you nick holden would have had it and i should have been sorry for it he was badly disappointed said mr dunbar smiling but i didnt buy the watch for myself philip for whom then asked philip in some surprise for the one that has the best right to it for you and the farmer took the watch from his pocket and handed it to philip but i havent the money to pay for it mr dunbar said our hero then i give it to you as a present said mr dunbar i am very grateful said philip but i ought not to accept it you are too kind to me let me be the judge of that besides it wouldnt be safe for me to take it squire pope will try to get my violin away from me in order to sell it and he would be sure to try to do the same by the watch if he found that i had it but philip i dont need the watch myself then mr dunbar will you be kind enough to keep it for me and when i can afford to pay for it and there is no danger of its being taken from me i will ask you for it i shall be very glad indeed when i am older to carry my fathers watch for i have seen it in his hands so often that it will constantly remind me of him perhaps that will be the best arrangement said mr dunbar you might have it stolen from you if you carried it yourself just at present as you request i will keep it subject to your order but i would rather let it be a gift from me and not require you to pay for it we wont talk about that now said philip smiling at any rate you must let me thank you for your great kindness to me dont speak of that phil said the farmer kindly i had a great respect and liking for your father and i verily believe my frank loves you as well as if you were his own brother so come what may you have a friend in our family i indorse all that father says frank said and he extended his hand to philip who grasped it heartily it warmed his heart to think that he had such good friends though he was an orphan and alone in the world after supper mr dunbar went to the village store while frank and philip remained at home suddenly frank said philip you are going to have a visitor i guess a visitor yes i saw squire pope stumping along the road nourishing his goldheaded cane he is headed this way and its likely he is going to honor you with a call hes got somebody with him too who is it philip shaded his eyes with his hand for the sun was near its setting and shining with dazzling brightness from the quarter toward which he was looking its nick holden he said so it is what can he want i understand very well he wants my violin he couldnt get it at the sale so he has come here to see if he cant make me give it to him and will you you ought to know me better than to ask frank said philip firmly nick might as well have stayed away for he wont accomplish anything nick however held a different opinion after philip left the cottage he had gone to squire pope and cunningly asked are you going to let philip keep his fiddle in spite of you squire what do you mean nicholas demanded the squire in a stately way why seems to me hes kinder settin up his will agin yours you say the fiddle shall be sold and he says it shant he told me he didnt care what you said he should keep it did he say that nicholas asked the squire who felt that his dignity was outraged by such insolence im sartain he did hes pretty big feelin phil is he always wants to have his own way he will find that he cant defy me with impunity said the squire stiffly just so then youll sell me the fiddle i will said the squire emphatically you wont ask too much will you asked nick anxiously now squire pope who knew nothing of the price of violins and had a very inadequate idea of their value after some haggling on the part of nick agreed to sell him the instrument for two dollars and a half and to see that it was delivered that evening do you know where it is nicholas he asked why phil is staying over at frank dunbars and i guess hes got it there somewhere i guess wed better go over there and get it very well nicholas after supper if you will come to my house i will go over there and see that you have the instrument all right squire said nick gleefully phil will find that he cant have his own way this time i apprehend he will said the squire complacently now the reader understands how it happened that squire pope and nick holden made a call on philip as to what passed at the interview we must refer him to the next chapter chapter vi fuss about a fiddle ahem good evening said squire pope to frank dunbar taking no notice of philips cold but polite salutation good evening will you go into the house said frank i believe not i have not time i am sorry father isnt home he just started for the village ahem it was not to see your father that i called answered squire pope i wish to have a few words with this young man indicating philip stiffly i am at your service squire pope said philip with ceremonious politeness we came about the fiddle interrupted nick holden who always wanted to have a share in the conversation squire pope frowned for he did not relish nicks interference nicholas he said severely i apprehend i am competent to manage the business we have come upon dont get riled squire said nick by no means abashed by this rebuke i thought you were kinder slow about comin to the point your interruption was very indecorous i do not require any assistance or any suggestions all right squire squire pope now turned to our hero and said as i was about to say when interrupted by nicholas i have come to require you to give up the violin which without authority and against my express command you withheld from the auction the violin is mine squire pope said philip firmly and i mean to keep it you talk like an ignorant boy as a minor you had no claim to the possession of any article except your clothing i judged it best that the violin should be sold at the auction and it is presumptuous for you to set up your judgment against mine i dont take that view of it said philip and then he stopped he knew it was of no use to argue against the squire who was obstinate to the verge of pigheadedness if i may be allowed to use the expression he felt that it would be only wasting his breath it is quite immaterial how you view the subject said the squire pompously my mind is made up and my resolution is not likely to be shaken by a boy then sir answered philip in a respectful tone but with a slight smile it is hardly worth while for me to say any more i am glad you have arrived at so sensible a conclusion said squire pope i take it that you have the violin here yes sir then bring it out and give it to me now came the critical point when philip must array himself in determined opposition to squire pope he felt that he was entirely in the right still he regretted the necessity of the antagonism philip had one thing in his favor he had plenty of selfcontrol and although he was very indignant at the course of the squire which he regarded as unjustifiable he made up his mind to be as respectful as circumstances would permit i dont think you understand me squire pope he said i refuse to give up the violin you refuse to give up the violin repeated squire pope scarcely believing the testimony of his ears do i hear you aright yes sir i never see such impudence ejaculated nick holden wishing to egg on the squire do you mean to defy me to my face demoded squire pope growing very red i dont wish to defy you or anybody else returned philip but i shall stand up for my rights misguided boy said the squire severely you will yet rue this rash and heedless course frank he continued turning to frank dunbar do you know where philips violin is yes sir do me the favor to bring it out and place it in my hands you must excuse me squire pope answered frank it belongs to philip and i have no right to meddle with it if philip has told you this he has misrepresented said the squire rather discouraged by this second rebuff the violin does not belong to philip it belongs to this young man and with a wave of his hand he designated nick holden it was not polite but frank dunbar was so surprised by this announcement that he whistled as for philip he regarded nick calmly but there didnt seem to be any sign of yielding in his look it belongs to nicholas because i have sold it to him continued squire pope doggedly thats so corroborated nick complacently the squire sold me the fiddle for twofifty its mine now and youd better fetch it along out or therell be trouble philip turned to squire pope and said quietly as you had no right to sell it the sale amounts to nothing if you had a right i should say you were not very shrewd to sell an instrument that cost twentyfive dollars and was considered a bargain at the price for two dollars and fifty cents the violin cost twentyfive dollars ejaculated the squire in genuine surprise for as it has already been stated he had no idea whatever of the usual price for a violin yes sir dont you believe him squire said nicholas afraid that he would lose what he knew to be a good bargain no fiddle that was ever made cost twentyfive dollars its ridiculous it does seem a large price said the squire guardedly squire pope would doubtless have been surprised to learn that certain violins of celebrated make such as the cremonas have sold for thousands of dollars probably he would have disbelieved it nevertheless he began to think that he had been too precipitate in accepting nick holdens offer if he should sacrifice or sell at an utterly inadequate price any article belonging to the boy whom he considered his ward he knew that he would be blamed and he began to consider how he could recede from the bargain nicholas he said i didnt exactly sell the violin to yon i will ascertain what is a fair price for it and then i will consider your proposal you sold it right out squire said nick and i can prove it didnt you just say it was mine there now nick turned triumphantly to frank and phil but for very good reasons they did not care to side with him i say you havent treated me right persisted nick who had no particular respect nor veneration for the squire and was not to be deterred from speaking as he felt i offered you twofifty and you said i should have it and you got me to call at your house to come here for it i cannot sacrifice the property of my ward said squire pope i must ascertain how much the violin is worth a bargain is a bargain every time said nick irritated i will let you have it as cheap as anybody said the squire who thought it possible that nick might be the only one who desired to purchase it that ought to satisfy you philip go and bring me the violin and i will carry it home and dispose of it to the best advantage you must excuse me squire pope i shall not let it leave my possession just then squire pope espied mr dunbar returning from the village and hailed him as a probable ally he laid the matter before him and requested him to compel philip to get the violin you must excuse me squire said mr dunbar coldly philip is my guest and he shall be protected in his rights as long as he remains here without a word squire pope walked off in angry discomfiture in one direction while nick equally dissatisfied walked off in another they dont seem happy said frank slyly i wish i knew where it was going to end returned philip gravely it seems to me said frank the squire is making a great fuss about a fiddle for a man of his dignity he doesnt care about the violin he wants to have his own way said philip thus hitting the nail on the head chapter vii mr joe tucker before going further i will introduce to the reader a citizen of norton who filled a position for which he was utterly unfitted this man was joe tucker in charge of the almshouse he had not been selected by the town authorities on the ground of fitness but simply because he was willing to work cheap he received a certain low weekly sum for each one of his inmates and the free use of apartments for himself and family with the right to cultivate the ten acres of land connected with the establishment and known as the town farm his family consisted of three persons himself his wife and a son ezekiel familiarly known as zeke now sixteen years old the leading family trait was meanness mr tucker supplied a mean table even for a poorhouse and some of the hapless inmates complained bitterly one had even had the boldness to present a complaint to the selectmen and that body rather reluctantly undertook to investigate the justness of the complaint they deputed squire pope to visit the poorhouse and inquire into the matter now though squire pope thought himself unusually sharp it was the easiest thing in the world for a cunning person like joe tucker to satisfy him that all was right mr tucker said squire pope pompously i am deputed by the selectmen and i may add by the overseers of the poor to investigate a complaint made by one of the paupers in relation to the fare you offer them who is it inquired mr tucker it is ann carter she says you dont allow her sugar in her tea and only allow one slice of bread at supper and that the meat is so bad she cant eat it just like the old woman exclaimed mr tucker indignantly oh shes a highstrung pauper she is expects all the delicacies of the season for seventyfive cents a week shed ought to go to the fifth avenoo hotel in new york and then ill bet a cent she wouldnt be satisfied it is observable that even in his imaginary bets mr tucker maintained his economical habits and seldom bet more than a cent once when very much excited he had bet five cents but this must be attributed to his excited state of mind so you regard her complaints as unreasonable do you mr tucker observed the investigating committee unreasonable i should think they was i allow squire pope we dont live like a firstclass hotel mr tuckers language was rather mixed but we live as well as we can afford to as to sugar we dont allow the paupers to put it in for themselves or theyd ruin us by their extravagance mrs tucker puts sugar in the teapot before she pours it out i spose ann carter would put as much in one cup of tea as mrs t uses for the whole teapotful if she had her way this was very probably true as the frugal mrs tucker only allowed one teaspoonful for the entire supply that looks reasonable mr tucker said the squire approvingly now about the bread and the meat the paupers has plenty of bread said mr tucker our bread bill is actually enormous and as to the meat we dont give em roast turkey every day and we dont buy tenderloin steaks to pamper their appetites said mr tucker though were perfectly willing to do it if the townll pay us so we can afford it do you think the townll agree to pay me twentyfive cents more a week for each one squire certainly not it cant be thought of said the squire hastily knowing that if the selectmen advocated such a measure they would probably lose their reelection if it would we might live a little better so that ann carter wouldnt have to complain though bless your soul that woman is always complainin ahem mr tucker you present the matter to me in a new light i really feel that ann carter is very unreasonable in her complaints i knowed youd do me justice squire said mr tucker effusively youre a sharp man you aint agoin to be taken in by any of them paupers rigmarole i always said squire pope that you was the right man in the right place and that the town was lucky to have so intelligent and publicspirited a citizen fillin her most important offices mr tucker said the squire you gratify me it has ever been my aim to discharge with conscientious fidelity the important trusts which the town has committed to my charge ill bear witness to that squire and your sincere tribute gives me great satisfaction i hope youll report things right to the board squire pope said mr job tucker insinuatingly be assured i will mr tucker i consider you a zealous and trustworthy official striving hard to do your duty in the place the town has assigned you i do indeed squire said mr tucker pulling on a red handkerchief and mopping some imaginary tears excuse my emotions sir but your generous confidence quite unmans me i i trust now that i shall be able to bear meekly the sneers and complaints of ann carter and her fellow paupers i will stand by you mr tucker said squire pope cordially for the mans flattery coarse as it was had been like incense to his vanity i will stand by you and uphold you by my testimony thank you squire with such an impartial advocate i will continue to do my duty and fear nothing as squire pope left the almshouse mr tucker winked at himself in the glass and said quizzically i guess im all right now the vain old fool thinks hes a second solomon and thinks i regard him as such oh it takes me to get round him squire pope wrote an elaborate report in which he stated that after searching investigation he had ascertained that the complaints of ann carter were absolutely groundless and gave it as his conviction that mr tuckers treatment of her and her associate paupers was characterized by remarkable consideration and humanity such officials as he have much to answer for and yet there are plenty just as false to their responsibilities as he it was two days after squire popes ineffectual attempt to possess himself of philips violin that our hero was walking along a country road on his return from an errand which he had undertaken for his friends father when his attention was drawn to the yelping of a small dog that seemed in fear or pain looking over the stone wall philip saw zeke tucker amusing himself by thrusting the dogs head into a pool of dirty water and holding it there till the animal was nearly strangled the dogs suffering appeared to yield the most exquisite amusement to the boy who burst into peal after peal of rude laughter as he watched the struggles of his victim philip like every decent boy had a horror of cruelty and the sight stirred him to immediate anger and disgust what are you doing there zeke tucker he demanded sternly none of your business answered zeke frowning youd better answer my question said philip who had by this time jumped over the wall then i will im havin a little fun what have you got to say about it retorted zeke and once more he plunged the head of the poor dog into the filthy pool the next moment he found himself floundering on his back while the dog slipping from his grasp was running across the meadows what did you do that for demanded zeke springing up his face flaming with rage i rather think you understand well enough answered philip contemptuously what business have you to touch me i can have you arrested you low pauper whats that what did you call me demanded philip i called you a pauper by what right squire pope told my father he was going to bring you over to the poorhouse to live you just see if my father doesnt give it to you then thank you said phil contemptuously but i dont propose to board at your establishment not even to obtain the pleasure of your society maybe you cant help yourself said zeke gleefully for he saw what had escaped the notice of philip whose back was turned namely a fourseated carryall containing his father and squire pope which had just halted in the road hard by mr tucker said squire pope in a low tone now will be the best opportunity to capture the boy and carry him to the almshouse all right im ready said tucker readily for another boarder would bring him sixty cents a week more they stopped the horses and prepared for business chapter xiii in the enemys hands philip heard a step and turned to see whose it was but when he recognized mr tucker the latters hand was already on his collar what have you been doin to zeke tell me that you young rascal said mr tucker roughly he pitched into me savage father answered zeke who had picked himself up and was now engaged in brushing the dust from his coat pitched into ye did he repeated joe tucker grimly i reckon he didnt know your father was round what have you got to say for yourself eh philip regarded his captor contemptuously and didnt struggle to escape knowing that he was not a match for a man five inches taller than himself but contempt he could not help showing for he knew very well that zeke had inherited his mean traits largely from his father ill thank you to remove your hand from my collar sir said philip when you have done that i will explain why i pitched into zeke as he calls it dont you let go father said zeke hastily hell run away if you do if i do you can catch me between you returned philip coolly i reckon thats so said mr tucker withdrawing his hand but keeping wary watch of our hero now go ahead said he philip did so i saw zeke torturing a small dog he explained and i couldnt stand by and let it go on what was he doin to him inquired mr tucker putting the poor animals head into this dirty pool and keeping it there till it was nearly suffocated was you doin that zeke asked his father i was havin a little fun with him said zeke candidly it might have been fun to you but it wasnt to him said phil why didnt you ask zeke to stop and not fly at him like a tiger demanded mr tucker i did remonstrate with him but he only laughed and did it again he hadnt no right to order me said zeke it want no business of his if i was havin a little fun with the dog and i had a little fun with you returned philip you couldnt have complained if i had dipped your head in the water also i aint a dog said zeke i should respect you more if you were said philip are you goin to let him talk to me like that asked zeke appealing to his father no i aint said mr tucker angrily youve committed an assault and battery on my son you rascal and youll find there aint no fun in it for you i could have you arrested and put in jail couldnt i squire ahem well you could have him fined but as he is to be under your care mr tucker you will have a chance of making him conduct himself properly what do you mean by that squire pope asked philip quickly young man i do not choose to be catechized said squire pope in a dignified manner but i have no objections to tell you that i have made arrangements with mr tucker to take you into the poorhouse ive heard that before but i couldnt believe it said philip proudly i guess youll have to believe it pretty soon he he laughed zeke with a grin which indicated his high delight i guess dadll make you stand round when he gits you into the poorhouse dont you consider me capable of earning my own living squire pope asked philip ahem yes you will be one of these days you wont have to stay in the almshouse all your life youll have a chance to earn your livin with me said mr tucker i shall give you something to do you may depend you can make him saw and split wood father and do the chores and milk the cow suggested zeke i have no objection to doing any of those things for a farmer said philip but i am not willing to do it where i shall be considered a pauper kinder uppish suggested mr tucker turning to squire pope most all of them paupers is proud but its pride in the wrong place i reckon if it is pride to want to earn an independent living and not live on charity then i am proud continued philip well squire how is it to be asked mr tucker philip said squire pope pompously you are very young and you dont know what is best for you we do and you must submit mr tucker take him and put him in the wagon and well drive over to the poorhouse what now asked philip in dismay just so answered joe tucker when youve got your bird dont let him go thats what i say thats the talk dad said zeke gladfully well take down his pride i guess when weve got him home joe tucker approached philip and was about to lay hold of him when our hero started back you neednt lay hold of me mr tucker he said i will get into the wagon if squire pope insists upon it im glad youre gettin sensible said the squire congratulating himself on finding philip more tractable than he expected and you will go to the poorhouse peaceful and without making a fuss asked joe yes i will go there but i wont stay there you wont stay there ejaculated the squire no sir in treating me as a dependent on charity you are doing what neither you nor any other man has a right to do said philip firmly you dont appear to remember that i am a selectman and overseer of the poor said the squire i am aware that you hold those offices but if so you ought to save money to the town and not compel them to pay for my support when i am willing and able to support myself squire pope looked a little puzzled this was putting the matter in a new light and he could not help admitting to himself that philip was correct and that perhaps his fellow citizens might take the same view on the other hand the squire was fond of having his own way and he had now gone so far that he could not recede without loss of dignity i think he answered stiffly that i understand my duty as well as a boy of fifteen i dont mean to keep you here long but it is the best arrangement for the present of course it is said zeke well pleased with the humiliation of his enemy shut up zeke said his father observing from the squires expression that he did not fancy zekes interference all right dad said zeke goodnaturedly seeing that things had turned out as he desired jump in said mr tucker to philip our hero without a word obeyed he was firmly resolved that squire pope should not have his way but he did not choose to make himself ridiculous by an ineffectual resistance which would only have ended in his discomfiture seated between mr tucker and the squire he was driven rapidly toward the poorhouse chapter ix the poorhouse there was no room for zeke to ride that is there was no seat for him but he managed to clamber into the back part of the wagon where he sat or squatted rather uncomfortably but evidently in the best of spirits if any inference could be drawn from his expression the poorhouse was not far away it was a threestory frame house which badly needed painting with a dilapidated barn and shed near by a threestory farmhouse is not common in the country but this dwelling had been erected by a mr parmenter in the expectation of making a fortune by taking summer boarders there was room enough for them but they did not come the situation was the reverse of pleasant the soil about was barren and there were no shade or fruit trees it was a crazy idea selecting such a spot for a summer boardinghouse and failure naturally resulted there had indeed been two boarders a man and his wife who paid one weeks board and managed to owe six before the unlucky landlord decided that they were a pair of swindlers he had spent more money than he could afford on his house and went steadily behindhand year after year till the town which was in want of a poorhouse stepped in and purchased the house and farm at a bargain so it came to be a boardinghouse after all but in a sense not contemplated by the proprietor and at present accommodated eleven persons mostly old and infirm whom hard fortune compelled to subsist on charity mr tucker had this advantage that his boarders had no recourse except to stay with him however poor his fare or harsh his treatment unless they were in a position to take care of themselves when philip came in sight of the almshouse which he had often seen and always considered a very drearylooking building he was strengthened in his determination not long to remain a tenant mr tucker drove up to the front door with a flourish a hardfeatured woman came out and regarded the contents of the wagon with curiosity well abigail can you take another boarder asked mr tucker as he descended from the wagon who is it well it aint likely to be squire pope said joe facetiously and zeke and i are regular boarders on the free list is it that boy yes its phil gray humph boys are a trial remarked mrs tucker whose experience with zeke had doubtless convinced her of this fact i shant trouble you long mrs tucker said philip i dont intend to stay you dont hey retorted joe tucker with a wolfish grin and an emphatic nod of the head well see about that wont we squire pope the boy is rather rebellious mrs tucker said the selectman he appears to think he knows better what is good for him than we do you may look upon him as a permanent boarder what he says is of no account philip said nothing but he looked full at the squire with an unflinching gaze if ever determination was written upon any face it was on his come down there said mrs tucker addressing our hero youre at home now mr dunbar wont know what has become of me said philip with a sudden thought they will be anxious may i go back there and tell them where i am do you think i am green enough for that mr tucker touching the side of his nose waggishly we shouldnt be likely to set eyes on you again i will promise to come back here this evening said philip and will you promise to stay asked squire pope doubtfully no sir answered philip boldly i wont do that but i will engage to come back then mr tucker will have to look out for me for i tell you and him frankly i dont mean to stay did you ever hear such talk squire asked mr tucker with a gasp of incredulity he actually defies you who are a selectman and an overseer of the poor so he does mr tucker im shocked at his conduct shall we let him go no of course not i agree with you squire i knowd you wouldnt agree to it what shall i do about his wantin to run away it will be best to confine him just at first mr tucker ill shut him up in one of the attic rooms said mr tucker i think it will be the best thing to do mr tucker philip took all this very coolly as to the way in which they proposed to dispose of him for the present he cared very little as he did not intend stay till morning if there was any possible chance of getting away the only thing that troubled him was the doubt and anxiety of his good friends the dunbars when he did not return to the house squire pope he said turning to that official will you do me a favor ahem explain yourself said the squire suspiciously will you call at mr dunbars and tell them where i am now for obvious reasons the squire did not like to do this he knew that the dunbars would manifest great indignation at the arbitrary step which he had adopted and he did not like to face their displeasure especially as his apology would perforce be a lame one i dont think i am called upon to do you a favor seeing how youve acted philip he said hesitatingly besides it would be out of my way and i ought to get home as soon as possible then you refuse sir well id rather not will you get word to them mr tucker asked philip turning to him i haint got time answered mr tucker who feared that the dunbars would come for philip and release him in the course of the evening philip was nonplused always considerate of the feelings of others he was unwilling that his friends should suffer anxiety on his account as mr tucker and squire pope walked away together our hero turned to zeke i suppose its no use to ask you to do me a favor zeke he said do you want me to tell frank dunbar where you are yes i wish you would then ill do it youre a better fellow than i thought you were zeke said philip surprised no i aint do you want to know why im willin to go why i know frank dunbarll feel bad and i hate him so that is your object is it zeke youve got it well whatever your motive may be i shall be much obliged to you if you go heres ten cents for you zeke grasped at the coin with avidity for his father was very parsimonious and his mother no less so and he seldom got any ready money thank you said zeke with unusual politeness ill go right off but i say dont you tell dad where ive gone or he might prevent me and dont you let on youve given me this dime or hed try to get it away no i wont say anything about it answered philip a curious family this is he thought there doesnt seem to be much confidence in each other zeke sauntered away carelessly to avert suspicion but when he had got round a bend of the road he increased his speed never looking back lest he should see his father signaling for him philip breathed a sigh of relief ive got a messenger at last he said now my friends will know what has become of me when i dont come home to supper he was a little curious to learn what they were going to do with him but he was not long kept in suspense chapter x bad tidings leaving philip for a short time in the hands of his captor we will follow zeke on his errand he didnt have to go as far as mr dunbars house for he met frank dunbar about a quarter of a mile this side of it now between frank dunbar and zeke tucker there was no love lost there had been a difficulty between them originating at school which need not be particularly referred to enough that it led to zekes cordially disliking frank while the latter who was a frank straightforward boy could not see anything in mr tuckers promising son to enlist either his respect or his liking there was a small river running through norton which crossed the main thoroughfare and had to be bridged over frank dunbar fishingline in hand was leaning over the parapet engaged in luring the fish from their river home he looked up when he saw zeke approaching him not having any particular desire to hold a conversation with him he withdrew his eyes and again watched his line zeke however approached him with a grin of anticipated enjoyment and hailed him in the usual style hello frank oh its you is it said frank dunbar indifferently yes its me i suppose you thought it was somebody else chuckled zeke though frank could see no cause for merriment well i see who it is now he responded where is phil gray inquired zeke chuckling again do you want to see him asked frank rather surprised oh no i shall see him soon enough and again zeke chuckled frank looked up he was expecting philip to join him and was in fact waiting for him now zekes mysterious merriment suggested that he might have met philip possibly bore some message from him do you know anything about phil asked frank looking fixedly at his visitor i reckon i do i know all about him said zeke with evident enjoyment well if you have any message from him let me hear it you cant guess where he is blurted out zeke he isnt in any trouble is he asked frank quickly no hes safe enough but you neednt expect to see him tonight why not demanded frank not yet guessing what was likely to detain his friend because hes at our house chuckled zeke dad and squire pope have carried him to the poorhouse and hes goin to stay there for good this was a surprise in his astonishment frank nearly let go his rod he was eager now to question zeke further you dont mean to say phil has been carried to the poorhouse against his will he exclaimed i reckon he was anxious to go said zeke where was he when your father and squire pope committed this outrage said frank indignantly i thought youd be mad said zeke with the same unpleasant chuckle answer my question or ill pitch you into the river said frank sternly he did not mean what he said but zeke drew back in alarm quit now i didnt have nothin to do with it said zeke hastily me and him was over in haywoods pasture when dad come along with the squire in his wagon well they made phil get in and thats all of it except i promised id come and tell your folks so you neednt get scared or nothin when he didnt come back tonight he will come back tonight said frank he wont stay in the poorhouse yes he will he cant help himself dads goin to lock him up in the attic i guess he wont jump out of the window where you goin you aint got through fishin be you yes im through answered frank as he drew his line out of the water just tell phil when you go home that hes got friends outside who wont see him suffer say aint you goin to give me nothin for comin to tell you asked zeke who was always intent on the main chance frank flung a nickel in his direction which zeke picked up with avidity i guess it pays to run errands when you can get paid twice he reflected complacently chapter xi philips new room we return to phil foller me boy said mr tucker as he entered the house and proceeded to ascend the front steps philip had formed his plans and without a word of remonstrance he obeyed the whole interior was dingy and dirty mrs tucker was not a neat woman and everything looked neglected and slipshod in the common room to the right the door of which was partly open philip saw some old men and women sitting motionless in a sort of weary patience they were paupers and dependent for comfort on the worthy couple who regarded them merely as human machines good to them for sixty cents a week each mr tucker did not stop at the first landing but turned and began to ascend a narrower and steeper staircase leading to the next story this was if anything dirtier and more squalid than the first and second there were several small rooms on the third floor into one of which mr tucker pushed his way come in he said now youre at home this is goin to be your room philip looked around him in disgust which he did not even take the trouble to conceal there was a cotbed in the corner with an unsavory heap of bedclothing upon it and a couple of chairs both with wooden seats and one with the back gone that was about all the furniture there was one window looking out upon the front so this is to be my room is it asked our hero yes how do you like it i dont see any washstand or any chance to wash come thats rich said mr tucker appearing to be very much amused you didnt think you was stoppin in the fifth avenoo hotel did you this dont look like it we aint used to fashionable boarders and we dont know how to take care of em youll have to go downstairs and wash in the trough like the rest of the paupers do and wipe my face on the grass i suppose said philip coolly though his heart sank within him at the thought of staying even one night in a place so squalid and filthy come thats goin too far said mr tucker who felt that the reputation of the boarding house was endangered by such insinuations we mean to live respectable theres two towels a week allowed and that i consider liberal and do all your boarders use the same towel asked phil unable to suppress an expression of disgust sartain you dont think we allow em one apiece do you no i dont said philip decidedly he had ceased to expect anything so civilized in mr tuckers establishment now youre safe in your room i reckon id better go downstairs said tucker i will go with you not much you wont we aint agoin to give you a chance of runnin away just yet do you mean to keep me a prisoner demanded philip thats just what we do at present answered his genial host it wont be for long mr tucker whats that you say im master here id have you to know just then a shrill voice was heard from below come down joe tucker are you goin to stay upstairs all day comin abigail answered mr tucker hastily as he backed out of the room locking the door behind him philip heard the click of the key as it turned in the lock and he realized for the first time in his life that he was a prisoner chapter xii a paupers meal half an hour later philip heard a pounding on the door of his room he was unable to open it but he called out loud enough for the outsider to hear who is it its me zeke was the answer that came back did you tell the dunbars where i was asked philip eagerly yes i shouldnt think you had time to go there and back said philip fearing that zeke had pocketed his money and then played him false but as we know he was mistaken in this i didnt go there shouted zeke i met frank on the bridge what did he say he was mad answered zeke laughing i thought he would be did he send any message to me asked philip no he stopped fishin and went home here the conversation was interrupted the loud tones in which zeke had been speaking in order to be heard through the door had attracted attention below his father came to the foot of the attic stairs and demanded suspiciously what you doin there zeke tryin to cheer up phil gray answered zeke jocosely he dont need any cheerin up hes all right i reckon youre up to some mischief no i aint come along down all right dad if you say so lucky he didnt hear what i was sayin about seein frank dunbar thought zeke hed be mad presently there was another caller at philips room or rather prison this time it was mr tucker himself he turned the key in the lock and opened the door philip looked up inquiringly suppers ready announced joe you can come down if you want to philip was provided with an appetite but he did not relish the idea of going downstairs and joining the rest of mr tuckers boarders it would seem like a tacit admission that he was one of their number of course he couldnt do without eating but he had a large apple in his pocket when captured and he thought that this would prevent his suffering from hunger for that night at least and he did not mean to spend another at the norton poorhouse the problem of tomorrows supply of food might be deferred till then i dont care for any supper answered philip perhaps you expect your meals will be brought up to you said mr tucker with a sneer i havent thought about it particularly said philip coolly you may think youre spitin me by not eatin anything observed mr tucker who was rather alarmed lest philip might have made up his mind to starve himself this would be embarrassing for it would make an investigation necessary oh no answered philip smiling that never came into my mind i dont mind bringin you up your supper for once said tucker of course i cant do it reglar but this is the first night i suppose i shall be better able to make my escape if i eat thought philip probably the most sensible thing is to accept this offer how much are you to get for my board mr tucker he asked only sixty cents grumbled tucker it aint enough but the town wont pay any more youve no idea what appetites them paupers has you made a mistake when you agreed to take me said philip gravely im very hearty youll be sure to lose money on me mr tucker looked uneasy well you see i expect to have you earn part of your board by doin chores he said after a pause that will give me a good chance to run away remarked philip calmly youll have to let me out of this room to work you know you wouldnt dare to run away said tucker trying to frighten philip by a blustering manner that shows you dont know me mr tucker returned our hero i give you fair warning that i shall run away the first chance i get philips tone was so calm and free from excitement that mr tucker could not help seeing that he was in earnest and he looked perplexed you dont look at it in the right light he said condescending to conciliate his new boarder if you dont make no trouble youll have a good time and ill let you off now an then to play with zeke he needs a boy to play with philip smiled for the offer did not attract him very much you are very kind he said but i dont think that even that will reconcile me to staying here with you but if youll agree to let me pay you for the supper you may bring me up some the town will pay me said tucker thats just what i dont want the town to do said philip quickly i will make you an offer at sixty cents a week the meals for one day will not cost over ten cents ill pay you ten cents for supper and breakfast youre a curus boy said tucker you want to pay for your vittles in a free boardinhouse it isnt free to me at any rate i dont want it to be what do you say oh i aint no objections to take your money said tucker laughing i didnt know you was so rich i am not rich but i think i can pay my board as long as i stay here this philip said because he had decided that his stay should be a very brief one just as you say chuckled mr tucker as he went downstairs he reflected i can take the boys money and charge his board to the town too theres nothin to hender and itll be so much more in my pocket i wish the rest of the paupers would foller his example he went downstairs and explained to mrs tucker that he wanted philips supper tell him to come down to the table like the rest of the folks retorted mrs tucker he aint too lazy is he no but its safer to keep him in his room for the first twentyfour hours hes a desperate boy but i reckon hell get tamed after a while ill desperate him said mrs tucker scornfully i dont believe in humorin him nor i abigail hed like to come down but i wont let him we can manage him between us i should smile if we couldnt said mrs tucker if you want any supper for him you can get it yourself ive got too much to do no widder jones you cant have another cup of tea and you neednt beg for it one clips plenty for you and its all we can afford only this once pleaded the poor old woman ive got a headache then another cup of tea would only make it worse if youve got through your supper go back to your seat and give more room for the rest while mrs tucker was badgering and domineering over her regular boarders her husband put two slices of dry bread on a plate poured out a cup of tea not strong enough to keep the most delicate child awake and surreptitiously provided an extra luxury in the shape of a thin slice of cold meat he felt that as he was to receive double price he ought to deal generously by our hero he carried this luxurious supper to the third story and set it down before philip philip promptly produced a dime which mr tucker pocketed with satisfaction he waited till his young guest had finished his repast in order himself to carry down the dishes there was no butter for the bread and the tea had been sweetened scantily however philip had the appetite of a healthy boy and he ate and drank everything that had been provided ill be up in the morning said mr tucker we go to bed early here the paupers go to roost at seven and me and my wife and zeke at eight youd better go to bed early too chapter xiii a friendly mission philip was glad to hear that all in the almshouse went to bed so early he had not yet given up the hope of escaping that night though he had as yet arranged no definite plan of escape meanwhile he had an active friend outside i refer of course to frank dunbar frank had no sooner heard of his friends captivity than he instantly determined if it were a possible thing to help him to escape he would not even wait till the next day but determined after it was dark to visit the poorhouse and reconnoiter first he informed his parents what had befallen phil their indignation was scarcely less than his squire pope is carrying matters with a high hand said the farmer according to my idea he has done no less than kidnap philip without the shadow of a legal right cant he be prosecuted asked frank eagerly i am not sure as to that answered his father but i am confident that philip will not be obliged to remain unless he chooses a dependent upon the charity of the town it is outrageous said mrs dunbar who was quite as friendly to philip as her husband and son in my opinion said mr dunbar squire pope has done a very unwise thing as regards his own interests he desires to remain in office and the people will not be likely to reelect him if his policy is to make paupers of those who wish to maintain themselves voters will be apt to think that they are sufficiently taxed already for the support of those who are actually unable to maintain themselves if i were a voter exclaimed frank indignantly i wouldnt vote for squire pope even for dogcatcher the meanest part of it is the underhanded way in which he has taken phil he must have known he was acting illegally or he would have come here in open day and required phil to go with him i agree with you frank squire pope may be assured that he has lost my vote from henceforth hitherto i have voted for him annually for selectman knowing that he wanted the office and considering him fairly faithful father said frank after a thoughtful pause do you think philip would be justified in escaping from the poorhouse i do answered mr dunbar in this free country i hold that no one ought to be made an object of charity against his will philip is strong enough and smart enough to earn his own living said frank that is true i will myself give him his board and clothes if he will stay with me and work on the farm i wish he would he would be a splendid companion for me but i think he wants to leave norton and try his fortune in some larger place i cant blame him if his father were living and he had a good home i should not think it wise but as matters stand it may not be a bad plan for him father said frank after supper i am going out and i may not be back very early are you going to see philip yes but i want to see him alone if possible i will see him without attracting the attention of joe tucker you wont get into any trouble frank said his mother anxiously no mother i dont know what trouble i can get into you may very likely fail to see philip suggested his father i hear that tucker and his boarders go to bed very early so much the better said frank in a tone of satisfaction the only one i want to see is philip and he isnt likely to go to sleep very early mr dunbar smiled to himself frank has got some plan in his head he thought i wont inquire what it is for he has good common sense and wont do anything improper about eight oclock frank after certain preparations which will hereafter be referred to set out for the poorhouse which was about a mile distant chapter xiv philip makes his escape it grew darker and darker in philips chamber but no one came to bring him a light it was assumed that he would go to bed before he required one by seven oclock the paupers had settled themselves for the night and when eight oclock struck mr and mrs tucker sought their beds it was no particular trial for joe tucker to go to bed early for he was naturally a lazy man and fond of rest while his wife who worked a great deal harder than he after being on her feet from four oclock in the morning found it a welcome relief to lie down and court friendly sleep zeke wasnt always ready to go to bed in fact he would much rather have gone up to the village now and then but if he had done so he would have had to stay out all night there was one thing his parents were strict about and that was retiring at eight oclock philip however did not retire at that hour it was earlier than his usual hour for bed besides he was in hopes his friend frank would make his appearance and help him though he didnt exactly understand how to make his escape at halfpast eight it was dark the stars were out and the moon was just making its appearance philip had opened his window softly and was looking out when all at once he saw a boyish figure approaching couldnt be frank dunbar he hoped so but in the indistinct light could not be quite certain the boy whoever it might be approached cautiously till he stood within fifty feet of the house then philip saw that it was indeed frank and his heart beat joyfully it was something to see a friend even though they were separated by what seemed to him to be an impassable gulf about the same time frank recognized his friend in the boyish figure at the window is that you phil he asked in a guarded voice yet loud enough to be heard yes frank i have been expecting you i knew you wouldnt desert me i should think not i didnt come before because i didnt want to be seen by any of tuckers folks they are all abed now and i hope asleep cant you come downstairs and steal away no my chamber door is locked on the outside thats what i thought cant you help me in any way ill see suppose you had a rope could you swing out of the window yes i could fasten it to the bedstead and fix that just against the window then i think i can help you can you catch a ball yes but what good will that do youll see make ready now and dont miss it he produced a ball of common size and after taking aim threw it lightly up toward philips window the first time it didnt come within reach the second philip caught it skilfully and by the moonlight saw that a stout piece of twine was attached to it at the end of the twine frank had connected it with a clothesline which he had borrowed from home now pull away phil urged frank philip did and soon had the stout line in his possession it will hold its new and strong said frank father only bought it last week i didnt think then what use we should have for it philip however was not afraid he was so anxious to escape that even if there had been any risk to run he would readily have incurred it for the sake of getting away from the poorhouse in which he was unwilling to spend a single night he fastened one end of the rope firmly to his bedstead as he had proposed then cautiously got upon the windowsill and lowered himself descending hand over hand till he reached the ground he breathed a sigh of relief as he detached himself from the rope and stood beside frank dunbar just then the boys heard a secondstory window open and saw mr tuckers head projecting from it chapter xv escape and flight though the boys had made as little noise as possible conversing in an undertone they had been heard by mrs tucker her husband as was his custom had gone to sleep but mrs tucker who during the day had discovered the loss of ten cents from her bureau drawer in which she kept her savings had been kept awake by mental trouble some of my readers may think so small a loss scarcely worth keeping awake for but mrs joe tucker was a strictly economical and saving woman some even called her penurious and the loss of ten cents troubled her she would have laid it to one of them paupers as she was wont contemptuously to refer to them except that she never allowed one of them to enter the sacred precincts of her chamber a horrible thought entered her mind could it be zeke the boy whom she thought such a paragon though no one else had been able to discover his virtues or attractions she did not like to think of it but it did occur to her that zeke the previous day had asked her for ten cents though he would not own the purpose for which he wanted it the boy might have been tempted to take the money at any rate she would go and see zeke slept in a small room adjoining when his mother entered with a candle in her hand he was lying asleep with his mouth wide open and one arm dropped over the side of the bed mrs tucker took a look at him and saw that he was wrapped in slumber and unable to notice what she proposed to do his clothes were thrown down carelessly on a chair nearby mrs tucker searched first in the pockets of his pants and though she discovered a large variety of miscellaneous articles of no use to any one except the owner she didnt discover any traces of the missing dime she began to hope that he had not taken it after all although in that case the loss would continue to be shrouded in obscurity but on continuing her search she discovered in one of the pockets of his vest a silver tencent piece mrs tuckers eyes flashed partly with indignation at zekes dishonesty partly with joy at the recovery of the missing coin ive found you out you bad boy she said in a low voice shaking her fist at the sleeping boy i wouldnt have believed that my zeke would have robbed his own mother we must have a reckoning tomorrow she was halfinclined to wake zeke up and charge him with his crime confronting him with the evidence of it which she had just discovered but on second thoughts she decided that she might as well let him sleep as the next day would do just as well poor zeke he was not guilty after all though whether his honesty was strict enough to resist a powerful temptation i am not sure the dime which mrs tucker had discovered was the same one that philip had given to zeke in return for his service in notifying frank dunbar of his captivity in another pocket was the fivecent piece given him by frank but that had escaped his mothers attention the reader will understand now how it happened that mrs tucker was kept awake beyond her usual time she was broad awake when frank dunbar arrived and she heard something through the partially open window of the conference between the two boys she heard the voices that is to say but could not tell what was said with her mind dwelling upon zekes supposed theft however she was more easily frightened than usual and immediately jumped to the conclusion that there were burglars outside trying to get in the absurdity of burglars attempting to rob the town poorhouse did not occur to her in panic she sat up in bed and proceeded to nudge her husband in no gentle fashion mr tucker she exclaimed her husband responded by an inarticulate murmur but did not wake mr tucker she exclaimed in a louder voice giving him a still more vigorous shake eh what whats the matter said tucker opening his eyes at last and staring vacantly at his wife whats the matter retorted his wife impatiently the matter is that theres burglars outside let em stay outside said joe tucker in a sleepy tone did any one ever hear such a fool exclaimed mrs tucker exasperated theyre trying to get in do you hear that mr tucker trying to get in is the door locked asked joe a little alarmed you must get up and defend the house continued mrs tucker now mr tucker was not a brave man he had no fancy for having a handtohand conflict with burglars who might be presumed to be desperate men it occurred to him that it would be decidedly better to stay where he was and ran no risk never mind abigail he said soothingly the burglars cant do us any harm they eant do any more than carry off a pauper or two and i dont believe theyll do that i wouldnt mind that mr tucker but ive left the spoons downstairs answered his wife how many are there six i want you to go down and get them and bring them up here where they will be safe but suppose i should meet some of the burglars suggested tucker trembling then you must defend yourself like a man you might find me in the morning weltering in my gore said joe with an uneasy shudder are we to have the spoons stolen then demanded mrs tucker sharply if you care so much for the spoons abigail youd better go downstairs yourself and get em i dont value them as much as my life i dont know but i will if youll look out of the window and see whether you can see any of the burglars outside responded mrs tucker if they havent got in yet ill take the risk where did you hear em abigail eight outside open the window and look out and you may see em mr tucker was not entirely willing to do this but still he preferred it to going downstairs after the spoons and accordingly he advanced and lifting the window put his head out as described at the close of the last chapter philip and frank were just ready to go when they heard the window rising and naturally looked up in some trepidation its old tucker said frank in a low voice philip looked up and saw that his friend was right mr tucker had not yet discovered them but the whisper caught his ear and looking down he caught sight of the two boys in his alarm and the obscurity of the night he did not make out that they were boys and not men and was about to withdraw his head in alarm when a mischievous impulse seized frank dunbar give me the ball philip he said quickly philip complied with his request not understanding his intention now frank belonged to a baseball club and had a capital aim he threw up the ball and struck mr tucker fairly in the nose the effect upon the terrified joe was startling full as his mind was of burglars he fancied that it was something a great deal more deadly that had struck him oh abigail im shot through the brain he moaned in anguish as he poked in his head and fell back upon the floor what do you mean joe asked his wife in alarm as she hastened to her prostrate husband whose hand was pressed convulsively upon the injured organ which naturally ached badly with the force of the blow im a dead man moaned mr tucker and its all your fault you made me go to the window i dont believe youre shot at all i didnt hear any report said mrs tucker let me see your face mr tucker withdrew his hand mournfully youve only been struck with a rock or something said she after a careful examination its bleeding groaned job seeing a dark stain on his nightdress suppose it is it wont kill you ill look out myself but she saw nothing philip and frank had immediately taken to flight and vanished in the darkness theyve run away announced mrs tucker my spoons are safe but my nose isnt groaned mr tucker you wont die this time said mrs tucker not very sympathetically soak your nose in the washbasin and youll be all right in the morning the two boys were destined to have another adventure that night chapter xvi a night adventure i didnt mean to hit him said frank as he and philip hurried away from the poorhouse i only intended to give him a fright i think you have i wonder whether he recognized us i dont believe it he had hardly got his head out of the window before i let drive then he wont imagine i have escaped what are your plans phil suppose they try to take you back to the poorhouse they wont get the chance before five oclock tomorrow morning i shall leave norton leave town exclaimed frank in surprise and so soon yes there is nothing for me to do here father would like to have you stay and assist him on the farm he said so to me he wouldnt be able to pay much but i think we would have a good time together philip pressed his friends hand warmly i know we should frank he said but if i remained here it would only remind me of my poor father i would rather go out into the world and try my fortune isnt it risky phil objected frank doubtfully i suppose it is but i am willing to work and i dont expect much suppose you fall sick then if i can i will come back to you and your good father and mother and stay till i am well promise me that phil i promise i wish i could go with you phil said frank with a boyish impulse no it wouldnt be wise for you you have a good home and you will be better off there than among strangers it might be your home too phil thank you but i shall be better away from norton for a time a minute later frank said suddenly theres squire pope coming he will see you i dont care he wont take me back get behind the stone wall and i will wait and interview him philip immediately followed the advice of his friend he was curious to hear what the squire would say squire popes eyesight was not good and it was only when he came near that he recognized frank dunbar he stopped short for there was a subject on which he wished to speak frank dunbar he said do you wish to speak to me sir inquired frank coldly yes where have you been out walking answered frank shortly have you been to the poorhouse i have did you see philip i saw him looking out of a thirdstory window squire pope chuckled if indeed such a dignified man can be said to chuckle what did he say he condescended to inquire that he wouldnt stay he will have to responded squire pope complacently mr tucker will see to that probably mr tucker will wake up some fine morning and find phils room empty said frank quietly ill take the risk of it returned the squire serenely but theres a matter i want to speak to you about youve got philips fiddle in your possession suppose i have i wish you to bring it round to my house in the morning and ill give you something for your trouble you must excuse me squire pope if it were your property i would bring it to you and charge nothing for my trouble young man said the squire sternly i am philips legal guardian and i have a right to receive his violin you will get into trouble if you resist my authority if you will give me philips order for it you shall have it sir frank dunbar you are trifling with me philip is now a pauper and has no right to hold property of any kind he cannot give a legal order then you are guardian to a pauper in my capacity of overseer of the poor in my capacity as philips friend i refuse to consider you his guardian you may call him a pauper but that doesnt make him one he is an inmate of the norton poorhouse frank laughed i dont want to be disrespectful squire pope he said but i cant help telling you that you undertook a bigger job than you thought for when you made up your mind to make a pauper of philip gray squire pope was indignant at the coolness of frank i shall come to your house tomorrow morning he said and convince you to the contrary very well sir frank dunbar bowed and the squire went his way thats a very impudent boy he soliloquized just like the gray boy it wouldnt do him any harm to put him under joe tuckers care too after the squire had passed on philip came out from behind the stone wall did you hear what passed between your guardian and myself asked frank yes i heard every word he little thought that the bird had flown phil he will make all the trouble he can that is one more reason why i think it best to leave town i wouldnt let squire pope drive you out of town i would stay and face the music if it suited me but i want to go away suppose we cut across this field it will be a little nearer all right there was a pathway through a pasturelot comprising some ten acres poor land covered with puny bushes and a few gnarled trees producing ciderapples it belonged to an old bachelor farmer who lived in solitary fashion doing his own cooking and in general taking care of himself he was reputed to have money concealed about his premises which was quite probable as he spent little and was known to have received four years before a considerable legacy from the estate of a brother who had died a successful merchant in the city of new york the boys had to pass by the small and weatherstained house where he lived as the path ran very near it when within a few rods of the house the boys were startled by a sharp cry of terror which appeared to proceed from inside the house both simultaneously stood still whats that exclaimed both in concert somebody must be trying to rob mr lovett suggested frank cant we do something said phil quickly we can try there were two stout sticks or clubs lying on the ground at their feet they stooped picked them up and ran to the house a glance showed that one of the windows on the north side had been raised the window sill was low pausing a moment before springing over it into the room they looked in and this was what they saw the farmer lay halfprostrate on the floor half supporting himself by a chair which he had mechanically grasped as he was forced downward over him stood a ruffianly looking tramp whom phil remembered to have seen about the streets during the day with a stick uplifted he had not heard the approach of the boys give me two hundred dollars and ill go he said to the man at his feet i cannot do it i havent got as much here thats a lie said the other coarsely i heard all about you today youre a miser and youve got no end of money stowed away here get it for me quick or ill dash your brains out just then the prostrate farmer saw what the tramp could not see his back being turned to the window the faces of the two boys looking through the window fresh courage came to him singlehanded and taken at advantage he was no match for the ruffian who had entered his house but with these two young auxiliaries he felt that all was not lost chapter xvii a reformed burglar what do you say demanded the tramp impatiently speak quick i cant stay here all night let me up and ill see if i can find the money for you i thought id bring you to terms said the tramp laughing grimly he allowed his victim to rise as he certainly would not have done if he had looked behind him and seen the two boys at the window nows our time answered philip he gave a light spring into the room followed by frank of course the tramp heard them and turned in sudden alarm as he turned the farmer snatched the club from his hand and he found himself unexpectedly unarmed and confronted by three enemies its my turn now said lovett do you surrender the tramp saw that the game was up and made a dash for the open window but philip skillfully inserted a stick between his legs and tripped him up and with the help of mr lovett held him struggling desperately till frank fetched a rope with which he was securely bound confound you he said scowling at the two boys but for you i would have succeeded and got away with my booty thats true said the farmer i owe my escape from robbery and perhaps bodily injury to you i am glad we were at hand said philip and now my friend said the farmer i may as well say that you were quite mistaken in supposing i kept a large amount of money in this lonely house i should be a fool to do it and i am not such a fool as that where do you keep your money then growled the tramp in different savingsbanks i am ready to tell you for it will do you no good i wish id known it sooner i came here on a fools errand i am glad you have found it out now what are you going to do with me keep you here till i can deliver you into the hands of the law that wont do you any good it will give you a home where you cannot prey on the community i dont mean to do so any more im going to turn over a new leaf and become an honest man that is if youll let me go your conversion is rather sudden i havent any faith in it listen to me said the man and then decide do you think i am a confirmed lawbreaker you look like it yes i do but i am not never in my life have i been confined in any prison or penitentiary i have never been arrested on any charge i see you dont believe me let me tell you how i came to be what i am two years since i was a mechanic tolerably welltodo owning a house with a small mortgage upon it it was burned to the ground one night i built another but failed to insure it six months since that too burned down and left me penniless and in debt under this last blow i lost all courage i left the town where i had long lived and began a wandering life in other words i became a tramp steadily i lost my selfrespect till i was content to live on such help as the charitable chose to bestow on me it was not until today that i formed the plan of stealing i heard in the village that you kept a large sum of money in your house and an evil temptation assailed me i had become tired of wandering and determined to raise a sum which would enable me to live at ease for a time i should have succeeded but for these two boys and you are sorry you did not succeed i was five minutes since but i feel differently now i have been saved from crime now i have told you my story do with me as you will the mans appearance was rough but there was something in his tone which led mr lovett to think that he was speaking the truth boys he said you have heard what this man says what do you think of it i believe him said philip promptly thank you boy said the tramp i am glad some one has confidence in me i believe you too said frank i have not deceived you your words have done me more good than you think it is my first attempt to steal and it shall be my last if you want to become an honest man god forbid that i should do aught to prevent you said the farmer i may be acting unwisely but i mean to cut this rope and let you go will you really do this said the tramp his face lighting up with mingled joy and surprise i will he knelt on the floor and drawing from his pocket a large jackknife cut the rope the tramp sprang to his feet thank you he said in a husky voice i believe you are a good man there are not many who would treat me as generously considering what i tried to do just now you shant repent it will you give me your hand gladly said the farmer and he placed his hand in that of the visitor lately so unwelcome i wish you better luck boys will you give me your hands too asked tke tramp turning to philip and frank tke boys readily complied with his request and repeated the good wishes of the farmer the stranger was about to leave the house when lovett said stay my friend i wish to ask you a question very well sir have you any money not a cent then take this said the farmer drawing from his vest pocket a fivedollar bill i lend it to you some time you will be able to repay it if you keep to your resolution of leading an honest life when that time comes lend it to some man who needs it as you do now thank you sir i will take it for it will help me greatly at this time goodby if you ever see me again you will see a different man he leaped through the window and was gone i dont know if i have done a wise thing but i will take the risk said the farmer and now boys i want to make you some return for your assistance tonight both frank and philip earnestly protested that they would receive nothing in the conversation that ensued philip made known his intention to leave norton the next morning what are your plans where do you mean to go asked the farmer i dont know sir i shall make up my mind as i go along i think i can make my living somehow wait here five minutes said lovett and he went into an adjoining room within the time mentioned he returned holding in his hand a sealed letter philip he said put this envelope in your pocket and dont open it till you are fifty miles from here very well sir answered philip rather puzzled but not so much surprised as he might have been if he had not known the farmers reputation for eccentricity i suppose it contains some good advice he thought well good advice is what i need the two boys went home immediately upon leaving the farmhouse though so much had happened it was not late being not quite halfpast nine philip received a cordial welcome from mr and mrs dunbar who however hardly expected to see him so soon are you willing to receive a pauper beneath your roof asked philip smiling that you will never be while you have health and strength ill be bound said mr dunbar i like your pride and independence philip they tried to induce philip to give up his resolution to leave norton the next morning but did not succeed i will come back some time he said now i feel better to go at five oclock the next morning with a small bundle swung over his shoulder attached to a stick philip gray carrying his violin left the village which for some years had been his home frank accompanied him for the first mile of his journey then the two friends shook hands and parted not without sorrow for who could tell when they would meet again chapter xviii a professional engagement a depressing feeling of loneliness came to phil after he had parted with frank he was going out into the world with no one to lean upon and no one to sympathize with him or lend him a helping hand no wonder he felt friendless and alone but this mood did not last long i shall find friends if i deserve them he reflected and i dont mean to do anything dishonorable or wrong i am willing to work and i believe i can make a living leaving him to proceed we go back to the poorhouse where his absence was not noticed till morning job tucker in spite of the blow which his nasal organ had received slept pretty comfortably and was awakened at an early hour by his vigilant spouse youd better go up and wake that boy and set him to work mr tucker she said there are plenty of chores for him to do you are right abigail said mr tucker with approval he reflected that he could assign to philip some of the work which generally fell to himself and the reflection was an agreeable one he had tried to get work out of zeke but he generally found that it was harder to keep him at work than it was to do the job himself after he had made his toilet not a very elaborate one mr tucker went upstairs to arouse his young prisoner he found the key in the outside of the door everything seemed right i wonder how he feels this morning chuckled mr tucker wonder whether hes tamed down a little he turned the key in the lock and threw open the door he glanced at the bed started in amazement to find that it had not been slept in and then his wonder ceased for the telltale rope explained how the boy had escaped he ran downstairs in anger and excitement whats the matter with you joe tucker demanded his wife are you drunk or crazy enough to make me both wife he answered the boys gone gone exclaimed mrs tucker stopping short with a saucepan in her hand gone ejaculated zeke his mouth wide open i dont believe it said mrs tucker positively he couldnt go hed have to jump out of the thirdstory window sure enough said zeke i cant help it hes gone declared mr tucker he tied a clothesline to the bedstead and let himself down from the window now i want to know who left a clothesline in the room there wasnt any said mrs tucker maybe he had one in his pocket suggested zeke but this suggestion was not considered worthy of notice by his parents now i know who hit me in the nose exclaimed mr tucker light flashing upon him there was two of em the ones i took for burglars then the other one must have been frank dunbar said mrs tucker zeke said his father go right off and tell squire pope that philip gray has escaped ask him if i cant have him arrested for assault and battery its likely hes at frank dunbars now well have him back before the day is out and then ill see he dont get out all right dad as soon as ive had breakfast ill go the result of zekes message was that squire pope hurried over to the poorhouse and held a conference with mr and mrs tucker the next step was that he and joe rode over to mr dunbars to demand the return of the fugitive they found frank splitting wood in the yard to him they made known their errand requesting him to call philip out he isnt here answered frank isnt here i dont believe it said the squire hastily sorry you doubt my word squire pope but its just as i say where is he then demanded the squire suspiciously he has left town left town repeated the squire and joe tucker in dismay where is he gone hes probably ten miles away by this time answered frank enjoying their perplexity i guess youd better wait till he comes back job and the squire conferred together but no satisfactory result was arrived at except it wouldnt pay to pursue philip for two reasons one because they were quite uncertain in what direction he had gone another because even if overtaken they would have no authority to apprehend him since he had been guilty of no crime finally a bright idea came to the squire bring me out his fiddle he said to frank im his guardian and i will take care of it for him he carried it away with him said frank the squires lower jaw fell he was defeated at all points i guess we cant do nothing under the circumstances squire said job tucker scratching his head i shall have to reflect upon it said squire pope in a crestfallen tone thats as good as a circus thought frank as his roguish glance followed the two baffled conspirators as they rode out of the yard its a pity phil was not here to enjoy it at the end of the second day philip was some forty miles distant from norton he had not walked all the way but had got a lift for a few miles from a tinpeddler with whom he had a social chat it cannot be said that he was depressed or that he regretted having left norton but he certainly did feel uncomfortable and his discomfort sprang from a very homely cause to tell the plain truth he was hungry he had not had anything to eat for six hours except an apple which he had picked up by the roadside and during those six hours he had walked not far from fifteen miles i believe i never was so hungry before thought philip the question is where is my supper to come from although he knew pretty well the state of his finances he began to search his pockets to see if he could not somewhere find a stray dime or better still a quarter with which to purchase the meal of which he stood so much in need but his search was unproductive or rather it only resulted in the discovery of a battered cent so that penny constitutes my whole fortune thought philip there were two houses in sight one on each side of the road probably they would have given philip a supper at either but our heros honest pride revolted at the idea of begging for a meal much as he stood in need of it he might as well be a pauper as he justly reflected so he pushed on evidently he was drawing near a village for houses began to appear at nearer intervals hello my boy where are you traveling asked a hearty voice philip turned round and his glance rested on a stout young farmer whose face though very much sunburned was pleasant and goodnatured i dont know answered philip dont know was repeated in surprise i am in search of work oh thats it are you a musician asked the young man looking at the violin yes a little of one are you looking for a job at fiddling asked the young man yes if i can find one answered philip smiling can you play dancingmusic yes then i guess i can get you a job for this evening i wish you could said philip hopefully catching at a way out of his troubles you see theres to be a little dance in schoolhouse hall tonight said the farmer or there was to be one but the fiddlers took sick and we was afraid wed have to give it up now if youll take his place we can have it after all ill do it said philip promptly whatll you charge how much was the other one going to charge five dollars you see he would have to come six miles ill come for three dollars and my supper and lodging said philip all right you shall have supper and lodging at our house there it is down that lane come right along for supper must be on the table after supper ill go and tell the committee ive engaged you philips spirits rose help had come from an unexpected quarter he felt that a new career was opening before him chapter xix new acquaintances on his way to the farmhouse philip ascertained that his companions name was abner webb and that he and his brother jonas carried on a farm of about a hundred acres abner appeared to be about twentyfive years old you seem pretty young to be a fiddler said the young man surveying philip with a glance of curiosity i am almost sixteen i am twentyfive and i cant play at all it isnt all in the age returned our hero did you ever try to learn yes i took one or two lessons but i had to give it up for a bad job i couldnt get into it somehow you didnt try very long said philip smiling i reckon id never do much at it how long have you been a fiddler ive been playing three or four years sho you dont say so do you like it yes very much well im glad you happened along it would have been a pity to have our dance spoiled by this time they had reached the farmhouse and abner went in followed by our hero a young woman his brothers wife looked at philip in some surprise you see ive got a fiddler after all said abner gleefully we wont have to put off the dance as he spoke his brother jonas came into the room and the explanation was repeated thats good said jonas heartily youd better go down to the store after supper abner and tell the boys for theyve just heard that paul beck cant come you just save me some supper and ill go now the boyll stay with us tonight thats the bargain i made with him hes heartily welcome said jonas webb a pleasantfaced man with sandy complexion who was probably from two to three years older than his brother youve happened along just at the right time i am glad of it said philip and there is no doubt he was sincere for we know how much he stood in need of employment though he naturally did not care to let his new friends know of his destitution my brother didnt tell me your name said jonas my name is philip gray answered our hero do you go round playing for dances inquired jonas i have only just begun philip didnt think it necessary to say that the idea of making money in this way had never occurred to him till this very day sit right up to supper jonas and you too mr gray said mrs webb philip was by no means loath for the dishes which he saw on the table had had the effect of stimulating his appetite already sharpened by his long walk and long fast philip as the guest was first helped to a bountiful supply of cold meat a hot biscuit and some golden butter not to mention two kinds of preserves for the webbs always lived well he was not slow in doing justice to the good supper spread before him he was almost afraid to eat as much as he wanted lest his appetite should attract attention and therefore was pleased to see that jonas quite kept pace with him indeed when he had already eaten as much as he dared mrs webb said hospitably i am afraid mr gray you wont make out a supper i dont think there is any danger of that said philip smiling i have enjoyed my supper very much the young woman looked gratified by this tribute to her cooking and just then abner came in did you see the boys abner asked jonas yes i saw them all they were awfully glad we could have the dance after all you see weve been lookin forward to it and didnt like to be disappointed and now i must hurry down my supper for ive got to slick up and go for mary ann temple are you goin lucy of course she is answered jonas i dont have so far to go for my girl as you do he added slyly you used to go farther once jonas six miles where i have only to go two when supper was over philip inquired how early will the dance commence about eight we keep early hours in the country and we like to get our moneys worth if you have no objection i will go out to the barn and try my violin a little to see if it is in good tune try it in the next room said the farmers wife yes do said her husband wed like to hear you he was a little afraid judging from philips youth that he could not play very well and this would give him an opportunity of deciding how competent the boy was to take the place of paul beck of pomfret who had quite a reputation in the towns around philip went into the next room and began to prepare himself for his evenings task though lus training had by no means been confined to dancingtunes he was quite proficient in that department having more than once been called upon in norton to officiate in a similar capacity when jonas had listened for five minutes to philip he turned to abner with a satisfied look he understands his business he said nodding with emphasis he aint no new beginner i think he beats paul beck said abner delighted to find his choice approved i dont know but he does i feel as if i wanted to start off now i dont see how he does it said abner with a puzzled look i never could do anything at it though im almost twice as old he passed into the room where philip was practising youre a tiptop player said he to philip admiringly why you beat paul beck is he the one you expected to have yes pauls got a big name for fiddlin i am glad you like my playing said philip who was naturally pleased to find that he was likely to give satisfaction in his new business the boys will be pleased i can tell you i will do all i can to give them satisfaction said philip modestly oh you will theres no doubt about that how much did you pay for your fiddle i believe it cost twentyfive dollars my father gave it to me sho i didnt think fiddles cost so much some cost a great deal more seems a good deal to lay out but youll get your money back if you can get enough to do i hope so well you must excuse me now ive got to slick up and go after mary ann temple shed have been awfully disappointed if wed had to give it up is she fond of dancing youd better believe she is why that girl could dance for four hours stiddy without wiltin how late do you keep it up till eleven or twelve you wont be sleepy will you if i am i will get up later tomorrow morning thats all right you can get up jest as late as you like lucy will save you some breakfast we dont allow no one to go hungry here but i must be off you will go to the hall along with jonas and lucy theyll introduce you round and see that you are taken care of philip congratulated himself on being so well provided for at least for one night the future was uncertain but with the money which he was to receive for his services he would be able to get along for two or three days and he might perhaps if successful obtain another similar engagement he had a new reason for being thankful that squire pope had not succeeded in depriving him of his violin for this was likely to prove a breadwinner he continued to practice till it was time to go over to the hall chapter xx a lively evening schoolhouse hall as may be inferred was a large hall occupying the second story of the center schoolhouse and though not originally intended for dancingparties answered very well for that purpose the hall was tolerably well filled when philip entered in company with jonas webb and his wife philip had effaced as well as he could the stains of travel had arrayed himself in a clean shirt and collar brushed his hair neatly and being naturally a very goodlooking boy appeared to very good advantage though he certainly did look young as he walked through the hall with his violin under his arm he attracted the attention of all it having been already made known that in place of the veteran paul beck a man of fifty or more an unknown boy would furnish the music for the evening philip could not avoid hearing some of the remarks which his appearance excited what that little runt play the fiddle said one countrified young man in a shortwaisted blue coat and towcolored hair plastered down on either side of his head with tallow i dont believe he can play any more than i can i hope he can retained his partner a plump redcheeked young farmers daughter hes very goodlooking anyhow he isnt anything to brag of said her partner jealously oh how can you say so jedidiah i see what beautiful black hair and eyes hes got and such a lovely color on his cheeks now jedidiah in appearance was just the reverse of philip his hair as already stated was towcolor his face was tanned and the color rather resembled brickdust than the deep red of our heros cheeks his partner was a rustic flirt and he was disposed to be jealous not being certain how far she favored him he therefore took offense at his partners admiration of the young fiddler he looks very common to me said jedidiah pettishly youve got a strange taste maria perhaps i have and perhaps i havent retorted maria tossing her head perhaps youre in love with him continued jedidiah in a tone meant to be sarcastic i should be if he was a little older said the young lady rather enjoying her lovers displeasure i dont believe he can play at all growled jedidiah hes fooled abner webb like as not its a pity we couldnt have paul beck very likely he can play better than paul beck said maria not because she thought so but because she knew it would tease her partner dont be a fool maria said jedidiah scarcely conscious of the impoliteness of his speech the young lady however resented it at once i am sure you are very polite mr jedidiah burbank so polite that i think you had better find another partner excuse me maria said jedidiah hastily alarmed at the prospect of being left without a partner of course i didnt mean anything if you didnt mean it what made you say it retorted maria tossing her head i aint used to being called a fool i never knew a gentleman to make such a remark to a lady i think youd better find some other partner i take it all back said jedidiah in alarm i was only in fun i dont like that kind of fun said maria in a tone of dignified coldness then i wont joke you again i guess he can play well enough if abner says so miss maria snodgrass allowed herself to be propitiated more especially as she herself might have been left without a partner had she adhered to her determination and sent jedidiah adrift he took his place in a quadrille not exactly wishing philip to fail but rather hoping that he would prove a poor performer in order that he might have a little triumph over maria who had the bad taste to prefer the young musicians appearance to his meanwhile philip following jonas webb across the room had been introduced to frank ingalls who acted as manager i am glad to see you mr gray said ingalls i hope we shant make you work too hard we are very fond of dancing here i dont get tired very easily answered philip i hope you will be satisfied with my playing no fear of that mr ingalls ive heerd him play at home and i tell you he can do it thank you mr webb said philip bowing his acknowledgment of the compliment i guess we may as well commence mr gray said mr ingalls the boys seem to be getting impatient heres the order of dances for the evening very well mr ingalls the manager raised his voice and said gentlemen and ladies you already know that beck is sick and cannot be with us this evening as he engaged to do in his place we have engaged a young musician who has already gained a great reputation in his profession philip was rather surprised to hear this but it was not for him to gainsay it let me introduce to you mr philip gray philip bowed and smiled and putting his violin in position immediately commenced a lively air in less than five minutes the manager felt perfectly at ease concerning the young musician it was clear that philip understood his business philip himself entered into the spirit of his performance his cheek flushed his eyes sparkled and he almost outdid himself when the first dance was concluded there was a murmur of approval throughout the ballroom the dancers were both surprised and pleased hes a smart boy said more than one he plays as well as paul beck and pauls been playin for moren twenty years as well i never heard paul beck play as well as that said another among those who were most pleased was miss maria snodgrass what do you think now mr burbank she said addressing her partner do you think the boy can play now yes he can play most as well as paul beck admitted jedidiah most as well paul beck cant begin to play as well as him returned maria who was not educated and occasionally made slips in grammar just as you say maria answered jedidiah submissively only dont call me mr burbank why aint that your name asked the young lady demurely not to you maria well i wont if youll take me up and introduce me to mr gray what for asked jedidiah jealously because i want to know him mr burbank was obliged to obey the request of his partner oh mr gray you play just lovely said miss snodgrass rapturously thank you for the compliment said philip with a low bow i like your playing ever so much better than paul becks you are too kind said philip with another bow isnt he just lovely jedidiah said maria as she walked away with her lover maybe he is i aint a judge said mr burbank not very enthusiastically so the evening passed philip continued to win the favorable opinion of the merry party by his animated style of playing when at halfpast eleven the last dance was announced he was glad for after his long walk and the efforts of the evening he felt tired at the conclusion mr ingalls handed him three dollars saying heres your money mr gray and we are much obliged to you besides thank you said our hero carelessly slipping the money into his vest pocket the manager little imagined that it constituted his entire capital i hope we may have you here again some time mr gray continued the manager perhaps so said philip but i am not sure when i shall come this way again good night mr gray said miss snodgrass effusively i should be glad to have you call at our house philip bowed his thanks he did not notice the dark cloud on the brow of the young ladys escort chapter xxi fortune smiles again notwithstanding his exertions during the day and evening philip rose the next day at his usual hour and was in time for the family breakfast at seven oclock dont you feel tired mr gray asked mrs webb no thank you i slept well and feel quite refreshed hes used to it lucy remarked her husband they look upon me as a professional player thought philip i think you and i ought to be more tired for we were dancing all the evening continued the farmer when they rose from the table philip looked for his hat youre not going to leave us so soon mr gray said mrs webb hospitably we shall be glad to have you stay with us a day or two if you can content yourself thats right lucy im glad you thought to ask him said her husband philip was tempted to accept this kind invitation he would have free board and be at no expense instead of spending the small sum he had earned the evening previous but he reflected that he would be no nearer solving the problem of how he was to maintain himself and while this was in uncertainty he was naturally anxious i am very much obliged to you both he said if i come this way again i shall be glad to call upon you but now i think i must be pushing on youll always be welcome mr gray said mrs webb philip thanked her and soon after set out on his way he was more cheerful and hopeful than the day before for then he was well nigh penniless and now he had three dollars in his pocket three dollars was not a very large sum to be sure but to one who had been so near destitution as philip it seemed very important besides he had discovered in his violin a source of income whereas hitherto he had looked upon it merely as a source of amusement this made him feel more independent and selfreliant he had walked perhaps two miles when he heard the rattle of wheels behind him he did not turn his head for there was nothing strange in this sound upon a frequented road he did turn his head however when he heard a strong voice calling hello turning he saw that a young man who was driving had slackened the speed of his horse and was looking toward him philip halted and regarded the driver inquiringly youre the young chap that played for a dance last night aint you said the newcomer yes sir then youre the one i want to see jump in and well talk as we are going along philip had no objection to a ride and he accepted the invitation with alacrity the driver he noticed was a young man of pleasant manners though dressed in a coarse suit i drove over to jonas webbs to see you and they told me you had just gone he continued i thought maybe youd get up late but you was up on time are you engaged for this evening philip began to prick up his ears and become interested was it possible that his good luck was to continue and that he was to have an opportunity of earning some more money through his faithful friend the violin he didnt think it well to exhibit the satisfaction he felt and answered in a matteroffact tone no i have no engagement for this evening im glad of it responded the young man evidently well pleased you see we had arranged to have a dance over to our place but mr beck being sick we thought wed have to give it up one of my neighbors was over last evening and heard you play and he thought maybe we could secure you i shall be glad to play for you said philip politely what are your terms asked his companion three dollars and board and lodging for the time i need to stay thats satisfactory ill engage you is it near here asked philip its in conway only four miles from here ill take you right over now and you shall stay at my house thank you i shall find that very agreeable said philip does mr beck live near you asked our hero a little later bless you he lives in our place i suppose his services are in demand yes he is sent for to all the towns around fact is there isnt anybody but he that can play to suit but i expect from what ive heard that you can come up to him i couldnt expect to do that said philip modestly i am very young yet folks do say you beat paul it seems wonderful too considering how young you are what might be your age now just sixteen sho you dont say so why paul becks over fifty mr beck wont think im interfering with him will he asked philip of course he cant wed a had him if he was well we cant be expected to put off the party because hes sick that wouldnt be reasonable now would it i should think not just then philip became sensible that a light wagon was approaching driven by a young lady he did not however suppose it was any one he knew till the carriage stopped and he heard a voice saying good morning mr gray then he discovered that it was the same young lady who had asked for an introduction to him the evening previous good morning miss snodgrass he said politely remembering fortunately the young ladys name meanwhile maria and philips drivers had also exchanged salutations for they were acquainted and where are you carrying mr gray mr blake she asked im carrying him over to our place hes going to play for us this evening is there going to be a dance in conway this evening inquired miss snodgrass with sudden interest yes wont you come over i will if i can get jedidiah to bring me answered maria i guess theres no doubt about that answered andrew blake who knew very well jedidiahs devotion to the young lady oh i dont know answered maria coquettishly perhaps he wont care for my company if he doesnt you wont have any trouble in finding another beau after a little more conversation the young lady drove away but not without expressing to philip her delight at having another chance to hear his beautiful playing shell be there said andrew blake as they drove away she makes jedidiah burbank do just as she orders him are they engaged asked our hero yes i expect so but there may be some chance of your cutting him out if you try the young lady seems to admire you philip smiled i am only a boy of sixteen he said i am too young to think of such things i wont interfere with mr burbank jedidiahs apt to be jealous said blake and maria likes to torment him however shell end by marrying him i guess in half an hour or thereabouts andrew blake drew up at the gate of a small but neat house on the main street in conway he was a carpenter as philip afterward found and had built the house himself he was probably of about the same age as jonas webb and like him was married to a young wife during the afternoon philip being left pretty much to his own devices took a walk in and about the village ascending a hill at one side which afforded him a fine view of that and neighboring villages he was pleasantly received and hospitably entertained at the house of mr blake and about quarter of eight started out for the hall at which he was to play in company with his host and hostess as they approached the hall a young man approached them with a perplexed face what do you think andrew he said paul becks in the hall as mad as a hatter and he vows hell play himself he says he was engaged and no one shall take his place andrew blake looked disturbed and philip shared in his feeling was he to lose his engagement after all chapter xxii rival musicians they entered the hall which was already well filled for the young people of both sexes liked to have as long a time for enjoyment as possible at the head of the hall in the center of a group stood a tall thin man dressed in solemn black with a violin under his arm his face which looked like that of a sick man was marked by an angry expression and this indeed was his feeling i suppose thats mr beck said philip yes it is answered andrew blake in evident discomposure what on earth brings him here from a sickbed i cant understand i heard that he had a fever the fact was that paul beck was jealous of his reputation as a musician it was satisfactory to him to think that he was so indispensable that no one could take his place he had sent word to the committee that he should be unable to play for them supposing of course that they would be compelled to give up the party when intelligence was brought to him during the afternoon that it would come off and that another musician had been engaged in his place he was not only disturbed but angry though of course the latter feeling was wholly unreasonable he determined that he would be present at any rate no matter how unfit his sickness rendered him for the evenings work he resolved to have no rival and to permit no one to take his place in his own town it did not seem to occur to mr beck that having formally declined the engagement on account of sickness he had no claim whatever on the committee and was in fact an interloper it was in vain that his sister protested against his imprudence he was an old bachelor and his sister kept house for him he insisted on dressing himself and making his way to the hall where as was to be expected his arrival produced considerable embarrassment paul beck stood in sullen impatience awaiting the arrival of his rival it so happened that no one had thought to mention to him that it was a boy he was prepared to see a fullgrown man philip followed andrew blake up to the central group who is it i say mr beck was inquiring that engaged another musician to take my place no one sir answered andrew blake firmly for mr becks unreasonableness provoked him i engaged a musician to play this evening but it was not in your place for you had sent us word that you could not appear where is he i say continued paul beck sourly here he is replied blake drawing toward our hero who felt that he was placed in an awkward position why hes only a baby said beck surveying our hero contemptuously philips cheek flushed and he too began to feel angry he isnt as old as you are mr beck said andrew blake manfully but youll find he understands his business i certainly didnt expect you to get a child in my place said paul beck scornfully i suppose a musicain may know how to play if he isnt sixtyfive said miss maria snodgrass who had listened indignantly to mr becks contemptuous remarks about our hero whose cause she so enthusiastically championed poor mr beck he was sensitive about his age and nothing could have cut him more cruelly than this exaggeration of it he was really fiftyfive and looked at least sixty but he fondly flattered himself that he looked under fifty sixtyfive he repeated furiously who says i am sixtyfive well you look about that age said maria with malicious pleasure i shall have to live a good many years before i am sixty said paul beck angrily but thats either here nor there you engaged me to play tonight and i am ready to do it andrew blake felt the difficulty of his position but he did not mean to desert the boymusician whom he had engaged mr beck said he we shall be glad to have you serve us on another occasion but tonight mr gray here is engaged you gave up the engagement of your own accord and that ended the matter so far as you are concerned do you refuse to let me play demanded paul beck his pale cheek glowing with anger and mortification you understand why answered blake this young man is engaged and we have no right to break the engagement philip who had felt the embarrassment of his position had meanwhile made up his mind what to do the three dollars he expected to earn were important to him but he didnt care to make trouble he did not doubt that his lodging and meals would be given him and that would be something accordingly he spoke i have been engaged it is true he said but if mr beck wants to play i will resign my engagement and stay and hear him no no exclaimed several mr blake and miss snodgrass being among them mr gray you were regularly engaged said one of the committee thats true answered philip and he couldnt help adding i should be justified in insisting upon playing but since mr beck seems to feel so bad about it i will give way to him he spoke manfully and there was no sign of weakness or submission about him he asserted his rights while he expressed his willingness to surrender them there was a little consultation among the committee they were all disgusted with the conduct of paul beck and were unwilling that he should triumph at the same time as they might need his services at some future time they did not wish wholly to alienate him finally they announced their decision through andrew blake we are not willing to accept mr grays resignation wholly he said but we propose that he and mr beck shall divide the evenings work between them each to receive half the usual compensation there was considerable applause for it seemed to be a suitable compromise and would enable the company to compare the merits of the rival musicians i agree said philip promptly what do you say mr beck asked andrew blake now while paul beck did not like to give up half the honor he felt thoroughly convinced that philip was only a beginner and that he as an experienced player could easily eclipse him and thus gain a triumph which would be very gratifying to his pride as for the compensation to do him justice he did not much care for that being a man of very good means he played more for glory than for pay though he of course had no objection to receiving compensation i have no objections he said if you want to give the boy a chance to practice a little i am willing philip understood the sneer and he secretly determined to do his best the committee was much pleased at the satisfactory conclusion of what had threatened to be a very troublesome dispute and it was arranged philip consenting that mr beck should play first the old musician played in a confident manner a familiar dancingtune accompanying his playing with various contortions of the face and twistings of his figure supposed to express feeling it was a fair performance but mechanical and did not indicate anything but very ordinary talent his time was good and dancers always found his playing satisfactory when paul beck had completed his task he looked about him complacently as if to say let the boy beat that if he can and sat down philip had listened to mr beck with attention he was anxious to learn how powerful a rival he had to compete with what he heard did not alarm him but rather gave him confidence chapter xxiii an hour of triumph when paul rose and stood before this audience violin in hand he certainly presented quite a strong contrast to his rival paul beck as we have already said was a tall thin lanternjawed man clad in solemn black his face of a sickly sallow hue philip was of fair height for his age with a bright expressive face his hair of a chestnut shade and looking the very picture of boyish health his very appearance made a pleasant impression upon those present hes a nicelooking boy thought more than one but he looks too young to know much about the violin but when philip began to play there was general surprise in a dancingtune there was not much chance for the exhibition of talent but his delicate touch and evident perfect mastery of his instrument were immediately apparent in comparison the playing of paul beck seemed wooden and mechanical there was a murmur of approbation and when philip had finished his first part of the program he was saluted by hearty applause which he acknowledged by a modest and graceful bow paul becks face as his young rival proceeded in his playing was an interesting study he was very disagreeably surprised he had made up his mind that philip could not play at all or at any rate would prove to be a mere tyro and bungler and he could hardly believe his ears when he heard the sounds which philip evoked from his violin in spite of his selfconceit he secretly acknowledged that philip even now was his superior and in time would leave him so far behind that there could be no comparison between them it was not a pleasant discovery for a man who had prided himself for many years on his superiority as a musician if it had been a man of established fame it would have been different but to be compelled to yield the palm to an unknown boy was certainly mortifying when he heard the applause that followed philips performance and remembered that none had been called forth by his own he determined that he would not play again that evening he did not like to risk the comparison which he was sure would be made between himself and philip so when andrew blake came up to him and asked him to play for the next dance he shook his head i dont feel well enough he said i thought i was stronger than i am do you want the boy to play all the rest of the evening yes he plays very fairly said beck in a patronizing manner which implied his own superiority there can be no doubt about that said andrew blake with emphasis for he understood mr becks meaning and resented it as one of the warmest admirers of the boymusician whom he had engaged but paul beck would not for the world have revealed his real opinion of philips merits yes he continued he plays better than i expected i guess you can get along with him how shall we arrange about the compensation mr beck asked blake we ought in that case to give him more than half oh you can give him the whole answered beck carelessly if i felt well enough to play i would do my part but i think it will be better for me to go home and go to bed his decision was communicated to philip who felt impelled by politeness to express his regrets to mr beck i am sorry you dont feel able to play mr beck he said politely oh its of no consequence as theyve got some one to take my place returned beck coldly i should be glad to hear you play again continued philip paul beck nodded slightly but he felt too much mortified to reciprocate philips friendly advances half an hour later he left the hall the dancers by no means regretted the change of arrangement they evidently preferred the young musician to his elderly rival the only one to express regret was miss maria snodgrass i declare its a shame mr beck has given up she said i wanted you to dance with me mr gray i am sure if you can dance as well as you can play you would get along perfectly lovely now youve got to play and cant dance at all it isnt leapyear maria said jedidiah burbank in a jealous tone miss snodgrass turned upon him angrily you neednt put in your oar jedidiah burbank she said i guess i know what im about if it was leapyear fifty times over i wouldnt offer myself to you and the young lady tossed her head in a very decided manner now dont get mad maria implored jedidiah feeling that at the prompting of jealousy he had put his foot in it i didnt mean nothing then youd better say nothing next time retorted the young lady meanwhile philip acknowledged the young ladys politeness by a smile and a bow assuring her that if it had been possible it would have given him great pleasure to dance with her if mr burbank will play for me he said with a glance at the young man i shall be glad to dance miss snodgrass burst out laughing jedidiah couldnt play well enough for an old cow to dance by she said there aint any old cows here said jedidiah vexed at being ridiculed well there are some calves anyway retorted maria laughing heartily poor jedidiah it is to be feared that he will have a hard time when he becomes the husband of the fair maria she will undoubtedly be the head of the new matrimonial firm there was nothing further to mar the harmony of the evening it had begun with indications of a storm but the clouds had vanished and when mr beck left the hall there was nothing left to disturb the enjoyment of those present the favorable opinions expressed when philip commenced playing were repeated again and again as the evening slipped away i tell you hes a regular genius one enthusiastic admirer said to his companion paul beck cant hold a candle to him thats so hes smart and no mistake poor mr beck it was fortunate he was unable to hear these comparisons made he could not brook a rival near the throne and had gone home in low spirits feeling that he could never again hold his head as high as he had done when the dancing was over there was a brief conference of the committee of management the subject of which was soon made known andrew blake approached philip and said mr gray some of us would like to hear you play something else if you are not tired not a dancingtune i shall be very happy to comply with your request answered philip he spoke sincerely for he saw that all were pleased with him and it is gratifying to be appreciated he paused a moment in thought and then began to play the carnival of venice with variations it had been taught him by his father and he had played it so often that his execution was all that could be desired the variations were of a showy and popular character and very well adapted to impress an audience like that to which he was playing beautiful beautiful exclaimed the young ladies while their partners pronounced it tiptop and firstrate by which they probably meant very much the same thing oh mr gray exclaimed miss snodgrass fervently you play like a seraphim thank you said philip smiling i never heard a seraphim play on the violin but i am sure your remark is very complimentary i wish you could play like that jedidiah said maria ill learn to play if you want me to said mr burbank thank you youre very obliging said maria but i wont trouble you you havent got a genius for it like mr gray the evening was over at length and again philip was made the happy recipient of three dollars his first week had certainly been unexpectedly prosperous this is better than staying in the norton poorhouse he said to himself chapter xxiv lorenzo riccabocca philips reputation as a musician was materially increased by his second nights performance to adopt a military term he had crossed swords with the veteran fiddler paul beck and in the opinion of all who heard both had far surpassed him this was said openly to philip by more than one but he was modest and had too much tact and good taste to openly agree with them this modesty raised him higher in the opinion of his admirers he was invited by the blakes to prolong his visit but preferred to continue on his journey though his plans were necessarily not clearly defined andrew blake carried him five miles on his way and from that point our hero used the means of locomotion with which nature had supplied him some six miles farther on there was a manufacturing town of considerable size named wilkesville and it occurred to him that this would be a good place at which to pass the night something might turn up for him there he hardly knew what but the two unexpected strokes of luck which he had had thus far encouraged him to think that a third might come to him philip continued on his way his small pack of clothing in one hand and his violin under his arm being in no especial hurry for it was only the middle of the forenoon he bethought himself to sit down and rest at the first convenient and inviting place he soon came to a large elm tree which with its spreading branches offered a pleasant and grateful shade he threw himself down and lay back on the greensward in pleasant contemplation when he heard a gentle cough as of one who wished to attract attention looking up he observed close at hand a tall man dressed in black with long hair which fell over his shirt collar and shoulders he wore a broad collar and black satin necktie and his hair was parted in the middle his appearance was certainly peculiar and excited our heros curiosity my young friend he said you have chosen a pleasant restingplace beneath this umbrageous monarch of the grove yes sir answered philip wondering whether the stranger was a poet may i also recline beneath it asked the newcomer certainly sir it is large enough to shelter us both quite true but i did not wish to intrude upon your meditations my meditations are not of much account answered philip laughing i see you are modest am i right in supposing that yonder case contains a violin yes sir then you are a musician a little of one replied philip may i ask excuse my curiosity if you play professionally perhaps he may help me to an engagement thought our hero and he said readily i do indeed said the stranger appearing pleased what style of music do you play for each of the last two evenings i have played for dancingparties alone yes you do not confine yourself to dancingmusic oh no i prefer other kinds but dancingtunes seem most in demand and i have my living to make the stranger seemed still more gratified i am delighted to have met you mr ahem he paused and looked inquiringly at philip gray mr gray i believe providence has brought us together i see you are surprised philip certainly did look puzzled as he well might i must explain myself more clearly i am professor lorenzo riccabocca the famous elocutionist and dramatic reader philip bowed doubtless you have heard of me said the professor inquiringly i have never lived in large places answered philip in some embarrassment or no doubt your name would be familiar to me to be sure that must make a difference for years said the professor i have given dramatic readings to crowded houses and everywhere my merits have been conceded by the educated and refined philip could not help wondering how it happened in that case that the professor should look so seedy a genius appreciated so highly ought to have brought in more gold and silver perhaps professor riccabocca understood philips expressive look for he went to to say the public has repaid me richly for the exercise of my talent but alas my young friend i must confess that i have no head for business i invested my savings unwisely and ascertained a month since that i had lost all that was a great pity said philip sympathizingly it was indeed it quite unmanned me said the professor wiping away a tear i felt that all ambition was quite gone and i was mad and sick indeed only a week since i rose from a sickbed but lorenzo is himself again he exclaimed striking his breast energetically i will not succumb to fate i will again court the favor of the public and this time i will take care of the ducats my admirers bestow upon me i should think that was a good plan said philip i will begin at once nearby is a town devoted to the mammon of trade yet among its busy thousands there must be many that will appreciate the genius of lorenzo riccabocca i hope so answered philip politely he could not help thinking that the professor was rather selfconceited and he hardly thought it in good taste for him to refer so boastfully to his genius i wish you mr gray to assist me in my project continued the professor how can i do so sir inquired philip let me tell you i propose that we enter into a professional partnership that we give an entertainment partly musical partly dramatic i will draw up a program including some of my most humorous recitations and impersonations while interspersed among them will be musical selections contributed by yourself do you comprehend yes answered philip nodding and what do you think of it i think well of it replied the boymusician he did think well of it it might not draw a large audience this mixed entertainment but it would surely pay something and it would interfere with no plans of his own for in truth he had none then you will cooperate with me said the professor yes professor give me your hand exclaimed riccabocca dramatically mr gray it is a perfect bonanza of an idea i may tell you in confidence i was always a genius for ideas might i ask a favor of you certainly sir give me a touch of your quality let me hear you play philip drew his violin from its case and played for his new professional partner the carnival of venice with variations the same which had been received with so much favor the evening previous professor riccabocca listened attentively and was evidently agreeably surprised he was not a musician but he saw that philip was a much better player than he had anticipated and this of course was likely to improve their chances of pecuniary success you are a splendid performer he said enthusiastically you shall come out under my auspices and win fame i predict for you a professional triumph thank you said philip gratified by this tribute from a man of worldly experience i hope you will prove a true prophet and now mr gray let us proceed on our way we must get lodgings in wilkesville and make arrangements for our entertainment i feel new courage now that i have obtained so able a partner wilkesville little knows what is in store for her we shall go see and conquer an hour later philip and his new partner entered wilkesville chapter xxv a change of name wilkesville was an inland city of from fifteen to twenty thousand inhabitants as philip and the professor passed along the principal street they saw various stores of different kinds with here and there a large high plainlooking structure which they were told was used for the manufacture of shoes wilkesville will give us a large audience he said in a tone of satisfaction i hope so said our hero hope so i know so said the professor confidently the town is full of young men employed in shoemaking they are fond of amusement and they will gladly seize an opportunity of patronizing a firstclass entertainment like ours the professors reasoning seemed good but logic sometimes fails and philip was not quite so sanguine he said nothing however to dampen the ardor of his partner let me see said the professor pausing yonder stands the wilkesville hotel we had better put up there it was a brick structure of considerable size and seemed to have some pretensions to fashion do you know how much they charge asked philip prudently no i neither know nor care answered professor riccabocca loftily but said philip i havent much money nor i admitted riccabocca but it is absolutely necessary for us to stop at a firstclass place we must not let the citizens suppose that we are tramps or vagabonds they will judge us by our surroundings there is something in that said philip but suppose we dont succeed succeed we must succeed said the professor striking an attitude in the vocabulary of youth theres no such word as fail away with timid caution our watchword be success of course you have much more experience than i said philip certainly i have we must keep up appearances be guided by me and all will come right philip reflected that they could not very well make less than their expenses and accordingly he acceded to the professors plans they entered the hotel and professor riccabocca assuming a dignified important step walked up to the office sir said he to the clerk my companion and myself would like an apartment one eligibly located and of ample size you can be accommodated sir answered the young man politely will you enter your names opening the hotel register the elocutionist with various flourishes entered this name professor lorenzo riccabocca elocutionist and dramatic reader shall i enter your name he asked of philip if you please this was the way professor riccabocca complied with his request philip de gray the wonderful boymusician he turned the book so that the clerk could see the entries we propose to give an entertainment in wilkesville he said i am glad to hear it said the clerk politely after dinner i will consult you as to what steps to take is there anything in the way of amusement going on in town this evening yes there is a concert chiefly of hometalent in music hall there is nothing announced for tomorrow evening then we will fix upon tomorrow evening it will give us more time to get out handbills etc is there a printingoffice in town oh yes sir we have a daily paper is the office near at hand yes sir it is on the corner of the next street that will do for the present we will go up to our apartment will dinner be ready soon in half an hour here the servant made his appearance and the professor with a wave of his hand said lead on mr de gray i will follow chapter xxvi a promising plan they were shown into a front room of good size containing two beds the servant handed them the key and left them this looks very comfortable mr de gray said the professor rubbing his hands with satisfaction why do you call me mr de gray asked philip thinking he had been misunderstood it is plain gray without any de i am only using your professional name answered the professor dont you know people will think a great deal more of you if they suppose you to be a foreigner philip laughed is lorenzo riccabocca your true or professional name professor he asked professional of course my real name i impart it to you in the strictest confidence is lemuel jones think of it how would that look on a poster it would not be so impressive as the other of course not and the public need to be impressed i thank thee for that word mr de gray by the way its rather a pity i didnt give you a spanish or italian name but i cant speak either language it would be seen through at once people wouldnt think of asking youd be safe enough they will generally swallow all you choose to say they went down to dinner presently and the professor philip could not help thinking ate as if he were halfstarved he explained afterward that elocutionary effort taxes the strength severely and makes hearty eating a necessity after dinner was over the professor said are you content mr de gray to leave me to make the necessary arrangements i should prefer that you would said philip and he spoke sincerely probably you understand much better than i what needs to be done tis well your confidence is well placed said the professor with a wave of his hand shall you remain in the hotel no i think i will walk about the town and see a little of it i have never been here before philip took a walk through the principal streets surveying with curiosity the principal buildings for though there was nothing particularly remarkable about them he was a young traveler to whom everything was new he could not help thinking of his late home and in particular of frank dunbar his special friend and he resolved during the afternoon to write a letter to frank apprising him of his luck thus far he knew that frank would feel anxious about him and would be delighted to hear of his success as a musician he went into a bookstore and bought a sheet of paper and an envelope he had just completed his letter when his partner entered the readingroom of the hotel with a brisk step mr de gray he said i have made all necessary arrangements i have hired the hall for tomorrow evening five dollars ordered some tickets and posters at the printingoffice and secured a firstclass notice in tomorrow mornings paper everybody in wilkesville will know before tomorrow night that they will have the opportunity of attending a firstclass performance at the music hall it seems to me the necessary expenses are considerable said philip uneasily of course they are but what does that matter what is to be the price of tickets general admission twentyfive cents reserved seats fifty cents and children under twelve fifteen cents how does that strike you will anyone be willing to pay fifty cents to hear us asked philip fifty cents it will be richly worth a dollar said the professor loftily i suppose he knows best thought philip i hope all will come out right if it does we can try the combination in other places chapter xxvii unexpected honors the next morning at breakfast professor riccabocca handed philip a copy of the wilkesville daily bulletin pointing to a paragraph on the editorial page he said in a tone of pride and satisfaction read that mr de gray it ran thus we congratulate the citizens of wilkesville on the remarkable entertainment which they will have an opportunity of enjoying this evening at the music hall professor lorenzo riccabocca whose fame as an elocutionist and dramatic reader has made his name a household word throughout europe and america will give some of his choice recitals and personations assisted by philip de gray the wonderful boymusician whose talent as a violinplayer has been greeted with rapturous applause in all parts of the united states it is universally acknowledged that no one of his age has ever equaled him he as well as professor riccabocca will give but a limited series of entertainments in this country having received flattering inducements to cross the atlantic and appear professionally in london paris and the chief cities of the continent fifty cents is the pitiful sum for which our citizens will have it put in their power to hear this wonderful combination of talent this secures a reserved seat philip read this notice with increasing amazement what do you think of that mr de gray asked the professor gleefully wont that make wilkesville open its eyes eh it has made me open my eyes professor said philip ha ha said the professor appearing amused how soon are we to sail for europe asked philip smiling when queen victoria sends our passagemoney answered riccabocca laughing i see that your name is a household word in europe were you ever there never then how can that be mr de gray your performances have been greeted with applause in all parts of the united states how do you explain that i dont pretend to explain it i wasnt aware that my name had ever been heard of a hundred miles from here it has not but it will be i have only been predicting a little the paragraph isnt true now but it will be some time if we live and prosper but i dont like to be looked upon as a humbug professor said philip uneasily you wont be you are really a fine player or i wouldnt consent to appear with you the name of riccabocca mr de gray i may truthfully say is well known i have appeared in the leading cities of america they were particularly enthusiastic in chicago he added pensively i wish i could find a paragraph from one of their leading papers comparing my rendering of the soliloquy in hamlet to edwin booths rather to the disadvantage of that tragedian i would like to read the notice said philip who had very strong doubts as to whether such a paragraph had ever appeared in print you shall see it it will turn up somewhere i laid it aside carefully for i confess mr de gray it gratified me much i have only one thing to regret i should myself have gone on the stage and essayed leading tragic roles it may not be too late now what do you think i can tell better after i have heard you professor answered philip true you can mr de gray continued the professor lowering his voice notice how much attention we are receiving from the guests at the tables they have doubtless read the notice of our evening entertainment philip looked round the room which was of good size and contained some thirty or more guests and he saw that the professor was right he met several curious glances some fair ladies expressing interest as well as curiosity and his face flushed gratifying isnt it said the professor smiling no i dont think it is answered our hero why not demanded professor riccabocca appearing amazed if all were true it might be replied philip as it is i feel like a humbug humbug pays in this world said the professor cheerfully by the way theres another little paragraph to which i will call your attention philip read this additional item we understand that professor riecabocca and mr philip de gray have received a cable despatch from the prince of wales inviting them to instruct his sons in elocution and music at a very liberal salary they have this proposal under consideration though they are naturally rather reluctant to give up the plaudits of the public even for so honorable a position professor riccabocca said philip considerably annoyed by this audacious invention you ought to have consulted me before publishing such a falsehood as this falsehood mr de gray really im shocked gentlemen dont use such words or make such charges you dont mean to say its true that we have received any such telegram no of course not then why didnt i use the right word its an innocent little fiction my young friend a fiction that will do no one any harm but will cause us to be regarded with extraordinary interest here the thought occurred to philip that he the future instructor of british royalty had only just escaped from a poorhouse and it seemed to him so droll that he burst out laughing why do you laugh mr de gray asked the professor a little suspiciously i was thinking of something amusing said philip well well we shall have cause to laugh when we play this evening to a crowded house i hope so but professor if we keep together you mustnt print any more such paragraphs about me of course i am not responsible for what you say about yourself oh it will be all right said riccabocca what are you going to do with yourself i shall practice a little in my room for i want to play well tonight when i get tired i shall take a walk very wise very judicious i dont need to do it being as i may say a veteran reader i wouldnt rehearse if i were to play this evening before the president and all the distinguished men of the nation i dont feel so confident of myself said philip no of course not by the way can you lend me fifty cents mr de gray certainly i dont want to break a ten professor riccabocca didnt mention that the only ten he had was a tencent piece slipping philips halfdollar into his vest pocket he said carelessly well take this into the account when we divide the proceeds of the entertainment very well said philip he went up to his room and played for an hour or more rehearsing the different pieces he had selected for the evening and then feeling the need of a little fresh air he took a walk in different parts of the town he saw posters on which his name was printed in large letters it seems almost like a joke he said to himself just then he heard his name called and looking up he recognized a young fellow of sixteen or thereabouts who had formerly lived in norton it seemed pleasant to see a familiar face why morris lovett he exclaimed i didnt know you were here yes im clerk in a store are you the one that is going to give an entertainment tonight yes answered philip smiling i didnt know you were such a great player said morris regarding our hero with new respect he had read the morning paper nor i said philip laughing are you going to europe soon it isnt decided yet philip answered laughing i wish i had your chance come and hear me this evening at any rate said philip call at the hotel at six oclock and ill give you a ticket ill be sure to come said morris well pleased chapter xxviii a triumphant success philip took another walk in the afternoon and was rather amused to see how much attention he received when he drew near the hotel he was stared at by several gaping youngsters who apparently were stationed there for no other purpose he overheard their whispers thats him thats philip de gray the wonderful fiddler i never suspected when i lived at norton that i was so much of a curiosity he said to himself i wish i knew what theyll say about me tomorrow at six oclock morris lovett called and received his ticket youll have a big house tonight philip he said i know a lot of fellows that are going i am glad to hear it said philip well pleased for he concluded that if such were the case his purse would be considerably heavier the next day its strange how quick youve come up said morris i never expected youd be so famous nor i said philip laughing id give anything if i could have my name posted round like yours perhaps you will have some time oh no i couldnt play moren a pig said morris decidedly ill have to be a clerk and stick to business youll make more money in the end that way morris even if your name isnt printed in capitals they retired into a small room adjoining the stage to prepare for their appearance the professor rubbed his hands in glee did you see what a house we have mr de gray yes professor i think therell be a hundred dollars over and above expenses that will be splendid said philip naturally elated the firm of riccaboeca and de gray is starting swimmingly so it is i hope it will continue so here is the program mr de gray you will observe that i appear first in my famous soliloquy you will follow with the carnival of venice do you feel agitated oh no i am so used to playing that i shall not feel at all bashful that is well i would like to be on the stage professor to hear you certainly i have anticipated your desire and provided an extra chair the time came and professor riccabocca stepped upon the stage his manner full of dignity and advanced to the desk philip took a chair a little to the rear their entrance was greeted by hearty applause the professor made a stately bow and a brief introductory speech in which he said several things about philip and himself which rather astonished our hero then he began to recite the soliloquy probably it was never before so amazingly recited professor riccaboccas gestures facial contortions and inflections were very remarkable philip almost suspected that he was essaying a burlesque role the mature portion of the audience were evidently puzzled but the small boys were delighted and with some of the young men stamped vigorously at the close professor riccabocea bowed modestly and said gentlemen and ladies you will now have the pleasure of listening to the young and talented philip de gray the wonderful boymusician in his unrivaled rendition of the carnival of venice philip rose coloring a little with shame a i this highflown introduction and came forward all applauded heartily for sympathy is always felt for a young performer especially when he has a manly bearing and an attractive face such as our hero possessed philip was determined to do his best indeed after being advertised and announced as a boy wonder he felt that he could not do otherwise he commenced and soon lost himself in the music he loved so well so that before he had half finished he had quite forgotten his audience and half started at the boisterous applause which followed he bowed his acknowledgments but found this would not do he was forced to play it a second time greatly to the apparent satisfaction of the audience it was clear that whatever might be thought of professor riccaboceas recitation the young violinist had not disappointed his audience philip could see in a seat near the stage the beaming face of his friend morris lovett who was delighted at the success of his old acquaintance and anticipated the reflected glory which he received from its being known that he was a friend of the wonderful young musician professor riccabocca came forward again and recited a poem called the maniac each stanza ending with the line i am not mad but soon shall be he stamped raved tore his hair and made altogether a very grotesque appearance philip could hardly forbear laughing and some of the boys in the front seats didnt restrain themselves some of the older people wondered how such a man should be selected by the prince of wales to instruct his sons in elocution not suspecting that the newspaper paragraph making mention of this was only a daring invention of the eminent professor next came another musical selection by philip which was as cordially received as the first i do not propose to weary the reader by a recital of the program and a detailed account of each performance it is enough to say that professor riccabocca excited some amusement but was only tolerated for the sake of philips playing naturally our hero was better received on account of his youth but had he been twice as old his playing would have given satisfaction and pleasure so passed an hour and a half and the musical entertainment was over philip felt that he had reason to be satisfied highly as he had been heralded no one appeared to feel disappointed by his part of the performance mr de gray said the professor when they reached the hotel you did splendidly we have made a complete success it is very gratifying said philip i felt sure that the public would appreciate us i think i managed everything shrewdly how much was paid in at the door asked philip who naturally felt interested in this phase of success one hundred and fortyfive dollars and a half answered the professor philips eyes sparkled and how much will that be over and above expenses he asked my dear mr de gray we will settle all bills and make a fair and equitable division in the morning i think there will be a little more than fifty dollars to come to each of us fifty dollars for one evenings work repeated philip his eyes sparkling oh i have done much better than that said the professor i remember once at st louis i made for myself alone one hundred and eighty dollars net and in chicago a little more i didnt think it was such a moneymaking business said philip elated yes mr de gray the american people are willing to recognize talent when it is genuine you are on the threshold of a great career my dear young friend and only a week since i was in the norton poorhouse thought philip it is certainly a case of romance in real life the two went to bed soon being fatigued by their exertions the apartment was large and contained two beds a larger and smaller one the latter was occupied by our hero when he awoke in the morning the sun was shining brightly into the room philip looked toward the opposite bed it was empty professor riccabocca must have got up early he thought probably he did not wish to wake me he dressed and went downstairs where is the professor he asked of the clerk he started away two hours since said he was going to take a walk went away without his breakfast too he must be fond of walking philip turned pale he was disturbed by a terrible suspicion had the professor gone off for good carrying all the money with him chapter xxix beset by credit ors philip was still a boy and though he had discovered that the professor was something of a humbug and a good deal of a braggart it had not for a moment occurred to him that he would prove dishonest even now he did not want to believe it though he was nervously apprehensive that it might prove true i will take my breakfast he said as coolly as was possible and the professor will probably join me before i am through the clerk and the landlord thought otherwise they were pretty well convinced that riccabocca was dishonest and quietly sent for those to whom the combination was indebted namely the printer and publisher of the daily bulletin the agent of the musichall and the billsticker who had posted notices of the entertainment these parties arrived while philip was at breakfast gentlemen said the landlord the boy is at breakfast i think he is all right but i dont know the professor i fear is a swindle the boy is liable for our debts said the agent he belongs to the combination i am afraid he is a victim as well as you said the landlord he seemed surprised to hear that the professor had gone out it may all be put on perhaps he is in the plot and is to meet the old fraud at some place fixed upon and divide the booty suggested the agent the boy looks honest said the landlord i like his appearance we will see what he has to say so when philip had finished his breakfast he was summoned to the parlor where he met the creditors of the combination these gentlemen said the landlord have bills against you and the professor it makes no difference whether they receive pay from you or him poor philips heart sank within him i was hoping professor riccabocca had settled your bills he said please show them to me this was done with alacrity philip found that they owed five dollars for the hall five dollars for advertising and printing and one dollar for billposting eleven dollars in all mr gates said our hero uneasily to the landlord did professor riccabocca say anything about coming back when he went out this morning he told my clerk he would be back to breakfast said the landlord adding with a shrug of the shoulders that was two hours and a half ago he cant be very hungry he didnt pay his bill i suppose no of course not he had not given up his room philip became more and more uneasy didnt you know anything about his going out asked the landlord no sir i was fast asleep is the professor in the habit of taking long morning walks i dont know that is strange since you travel together remarked the publisher i never saw him till day before yesterday said philip the creditors looked at each other significantly they began to suspect that philip also was a victim do you know how much money was received for tickets last evening about a hundred and fifty dollars how much of this were you to receive half of what was left after the bills were paid have you received it asked the agent not a cent answered philip what do you think about the situation i think that professor riccabocca has swindled us all answered philip promptly our bills ought to be paid said the agent who was rather a hard man in his dealings i agree with you said philip i wish i were able to pay them but i have only six dollars in my possession that will pay me and leave a dollar over suggested the agent if it comes to that said the printer i claim that i ought to be paid first i am a poor man said the billsticker i need my money poor philip was very much disconcerted it was a new thing for him to owe money which he could not repay gentlemen he said i have myself been cheated out of fifty dollars at least my share of the profits i wish i could pay you all i cannot do so now whenever i can i will certainly do it you can pay us a part with the money you have said the agent i owe mr gates for nearly two days board he said that is my own affair and i must pay him first i dont see why he should be preferred to me grumbled the agent then with a sudden happy thought as he termed it he said i will tell you how you can pay us all how asked philip you have a violin you can sell that for enough to pay our bills poor philip his violin was his dependence besides the natural attachment he felt for it he relied upon it to secure him a living and the thought of parting with it was bitter gentlemen he said if you take my violin i have no way of making a living if you will consider that i too am a victim of this man i think you will not wish to inflict such an injury upon me i do not for one said the publisher i am not a rich man and i need all the money that is due me but i wouldnt deprive the boy of his violin nor i said the billsticker thats all very fine said the agent but i am not so soft as you two who knows but the boy is in league with the professor i know it said the landlord stoutly the boy is all right or i am no judge of human nature thank you mr gates said philip extending his hand to his generous defender do you expect we will let you off without paying anything demanded the agent harshly if i live sir you shall lose nothing by me said philip that wont do said the man coarsely i insist upon the fiddle being sold ill give five dollars for it and call it square mr gunn said the landlord in a tone of disgust since you are disposed to persecute this boy i will myself pay your bill and trust to him to repay me when he can but mr gates said philip i accept said the agent with alacrity receipt your bill said the landlord mr gunn did so and received a fivedollar bill in return now sir said the landlord coldly if you have no further business here we can dispense with your company it strikes me you are rather hard on a man because he wants to be paid his honest dues whined gunn rather uncomfortably we understand you sir said the landlord we have not forgotten how you turned a poor family into the street in the dead of winter because they could not pay their rent could i afford to give them houseroom inquired gunn perhaps not at any rate i dont feel inclined to give you houseroom any longer mr gunn slunk out of the room under the impression that his company was no longer desired mr gray said the publisher i hope you dont class me with the man who has just gone out i would sooner never be paid than deprive you of your violin let the account stand and if you are ever able to pay me half of my bill your share i shall be glad to receive it thank you sir said philip you shall not repent your confidence in me i say ditto to my friend the publisher said the billposter wait a moment gentlemen said philip there is a bare possibility that i can do something for you for the first time since he left norton he thought of the letter which he was not to open till he was fifty miles from norton mr gates he said can you tell me how far norton is from here about sixty miles answered the landlord in surprise then its all right chapter xxx a timely gift the reader has not forgotten that farmer lovett when philip refused to accept any compensation for assisting to frustrate the attempt at burglary handed him a sealed envelope which he requested him not to open till he was fifty miles away from norton philip had carried this about in his pocket ever since he had thought of it as likely to contain some good advice at the time but it had since occurred to him that the farmer had not had time to write down anything in that line he was disposed to think that the mysterious envelope might contain a fivedollar bill as a slight acknowledgment of his services though philip had declined receiving any payment it did seem to him now that this amount of money would relieve him from considerable embarrassment he therefore drew a penknife from his pocket and cut open the envelope what was his amazement when he drew out three bills two twenties and a ten fifty dollars in all there was a slip of paper on which was written in pencil dont hesitate to use this money if you need it as you doubtless will i can spare it as well as not and shall be glad if it proves of use to one who has done me a great service john lovett whats that asked the landlord regarding philip with interest some money which i did not know i possessed answered philip how much is there fifty dollars and you didnt know you had it asked the publisher rather incredulously it must be owned no sir i was told not to open this envelope till i was fifty miles away from where it was given me of course mr gates i am now able to pay all my bills and to repay you for what you handed mr gunn i am pleased with your good fortune said the landlord cordially thank you sir but i am sorry your knavish partner has cheated you out of so much money i shall make him pay it if i can said philip resolutely i approve your pluck and i wish you success he owes you money too mr gates give me the bill and i will do my best to collect it if you collect it you may have it said gates i dont care much for the money but i should like to have the scamp compelled to fork it over i wish i knew where he was likely to be said philip he may go to knoxville suggested the publisher how far is that ten miles what makes you think he will go to knoxville asked the landlord he may think of giving a performance there it is a pretty large place but wouldnt he be afraid to do it after the pranks he has played here perhaps so at any rate he is very likely to go there i will go there and risk it said philip he neednt think he is going to get off so easily even if it is only a boy he has cheated thats the talk mr gray said the landlord how are you going he asked a minute later i can walk ten miles well enough answered philip he had considerable money now but he reflected that he should probably need it all especially if he did not succeed in making the professor refund and decided that it would be well to continue to practice economy i have no doubt you can said the landlord but it will be better not to let the professor get too much the start of you i will myself have a horse harnessed and take you most of the distance in my buggy but mr gates wont it be putting you to a great deal of trouble not at all i shall enjoy a ride this morning and the road to knoxville is a very pleasant one let me pay something for the ride then not a cent you will need all your money and i can carry you just as well as not said the landlord heartily i am very fortunate in such a kind friend said philip gratefully oh it isnt worth talking about here jim go out and harness the horse directly when the horse was brought round philip was all ready and jumped in would you like to drive mr gray asked the landlord yes answered philip with alacrity take the lines then said the landlord most boys of philips age are fond of driving and our hero was no exception to the rule as the landlord supposed youll promise not to upset me said mr gates smiling i am getting stout and the consequences might be serious oh i am used to driving said philip and i will take care not to tip over the horse was a good one and to philips satisfaction went over the road in good style philip enjoyed driving but of course his mind could not help dwelling on the special object of his journey i hope we are on the right track he said i shouldnt like to miss the professor you will soon know at any rate said gates it seems to me he continued that riccabocca made a great mistake in running off with that money he thought it would be safe to cheat a boy yes but admitting all that you two were likely to make money in wilkesville your profits were a hundred dollars in one evening half of that belonged to the professor at any rate he has lost his partner and gained only fifty dollars which would not begin to pay him for your loss perhaps he thought he would draw as well alone then he is very much mistaken to tell the plain truth our people thought very little of his share of the performance i saw some of them laughing when he was ranting away it was you they enjoyed hearing i am glad of that said philip gratified theres no humbug about your playing you understand it it was you that saved the credit of the evening and sent people away well satisfied i am glad of that at any rate even if i didnt get a cent for my playing said philip well pleased the moneys the practical part of it said the landlord of course i am glad when travelers like my hotel but if they should run off without paying like the professor i shouldnt enjoy it so much no i suppose not said philip with a laugh they had ridden some seven miles and were therefore only three miles from knoxville without the slightest intimation as to whether or not they were on the right track to be sure they had not expected to obtain any clue so soon but it would have been very satisfactory of course to obtain one a little farther on they saw approaching a buggy similar to their own driven by a man of middle age it turned out to be an acquaintance of the landlords and the two stopped to speak going to knoxville on business mr gates asked the newcomer well not exactly i am driving this young man over by the way have you seen anything of a tall man with long black hair dressed in black yes do you want to see him this young man has some business with him where did you see him he arrived at our hotel about an hour since i calculate philips heart bounded with satisfaction at this important news did he put up there yes i believe he is going to give a reading this evening thank you the professor must be a fool said the landlord as they drove away i begin to think so myself replied philip thats all in our favor however we shall get back that money yet the horse was put to his speed and in fifteen minutes they reached knoxville chapter xxxi the professors flight professor lorenzo riccabocca was not a wise man it would have been much more to his interest to deal honestly with philip paying his share of the profits of the first performance and retaining his services as associate and partner but the professor was dazzled by the money and unwilling to give it up moreover he had the vanity to think that he would draw nearly as well alone thus retaining in his own hands the entire proceeds of any entertainments he might give when he met philip on the road he was wellnigh penniless now including the sum of which he had defrauded our hero and his creditors in wilkesville he had one hundred and fifty dollars when the professor went to bed he had not formed the plan of deserting philip but on awaking in the morning it flashed upon him as an excellent step which would put money in his pocket he accordingly rose dressed himself quietly and with one cautious look at philip who was fast asleep descended the stairs to the office only the bookkeeper was in the office you are stirring early professor he said yes answered riccabocca i generally take a morning walk to get an appetite for breakfast my appetite comes without the walk said the bookkeeper smiling if mr de gray comes downstairs please tell him i will be back soon said riccabocca the bookkeeper readily promised to do this not having the slightest suspicion that the distinguished professor was about to take french leave when professor riccabocca had walked half a mile he began to feel faint his appetite had come i wish i had stopped to breakfast he reflected i dont believe de gray will be down for an hour or two it was too late to go back and repair his mistake that would spoil all he saw across the street a bakers shop just opening for the day and this gave him an idea he entered bought some rolls and obtained a glass of milk and fortified with these he resumed his journey he had walked three miles when he was overtaken by a farm wagon which was going his way he hailed the driver a young man of nineteen or thereabouts ascertained that he was driving to knoxville and for a small sum secured passage there this brings us to the point of time when philip and mr gates drove up to the hotel at knoxville i can see the professor said philip in eager excitement when they had come within a few rods of the inn where is he he is in the office sitting with his back to the front window i wonder what he will have to say for himself so do i said the landlord curiously shall we go in together questioned philip no let us surprise him a little i will drive around to the sheds back of the hotel and fasten my horse then we will go round to the front and you can go in while i stand outside ready to appear a little later philip thought this a good plan he enjoyed the prospect of confronting the rogue who had taken advantage of his inexperience and attempted such a bold scheme of fraud he didnt feel in the least nervous or afraid to encounter the professor though riccabocca was a man and he but a boy when all was ready philip entered through the front door which was open and turning into the office stood before the astonished professor the latter started in dismay at the sight of our hero he thought he might be quietly eating breakfast ten miles away unsuspiciously waiting for his return was his brilliant scheme to fail he quickly took his resolution a foolish one he would pretend not to know philip well professor riccabocca philip said in a sarcastic tone you took rather a long walk this morning the professor looked at him vacantly were you addressing me he inquired yes sir answered philip justly provoked i havent the pleasure of your acquaintance young man i wish i hadnt the pleasure of yours retorted philip do you come here to insult me demanded riccabocca frowning i came here to demand my share of the money received for the entertainment last evening as well as the money paid for the hall the printer and billposter you must be crazy said riccabocca shrugging his shoulders i dont know you i dont owe you any money do you mean to say we didnt give an entertainment together last evening at wilkesville asked philip rather taken aback by the mans sublime impudence my young friend you have been dreaming prove what you say and i will admit your claim up to this point those present deceived by the professors coolness really supposed him to be in the right that was what riccabocca anticipated and hoped to get off before the discovery of the truth could be made but he did not know that philip had a competent witness at hand mr gates called philip the portly landlord of the wilkesville hotel entered the room and riccaboeca saw that the game was up mr gates will you be kind enough to convince this gentleman that he owes me money asked philip i think he wont deny it now said gates significantly he walked off from my hotel this morning leaving his bill unpaid professor riccabocca it strikes me you had better settle with us unless you wish to pass the night in the lockup professor riccabocca gave a forced laugh why mr de gray he said you ought to have known that i was only playing a trick on you i supposed you were said philip no i dont mean that i was only pretending i didnt know you to see if i could act naturally enough to deceive you why did you desert me asked philip suspiciously i started to take a walk didnt the bookkeeper tell you and finding a chance to ride over here thought i would do so and make arrangements for our appearance here of course i intended to come back and pay our good friend the landlord and give you your share of the common fund neither gates nor philip believed a word of this it seemed to them quite too transparent you may as well pay us now professor riccabocca said the landlord dryly i hope you dont suspect my honor or integrity said riccabocca appearing to be wounded at the thought never mind about that said mr gates shortly actions speak louder than words i am quite ready to settle quite said the professor the money is in my room i will go up and get it there seemed to be no objection to this and our two friends saw him ascend the staircase to the second story philip felt pleased to think that he had succeeded in his quest for his share of the concert money would be nearly seventy dollars that with the balance of the money received from farmer lovett would make over a hundred dollars they waited five minutes and the professor did not come down what can keep him said philip just then one of the hostlers entered and caught what our hero had said a man has just run out of the back door he said and is cutting across the fields at a great rate he must have gone down the back stairs said the clerk in what direction would he go asked philip hastily to the railroad station there is a train leaves in fifteen minutes what shall we do mr gates asked philip in dismay jump into my buggy well get to the depot before the train starts we must intercept the rascal chapter xxxii the race across fields it so happened that professor riccabocca had once before visited knoxville and remembered the location of the railroad station moreover at the hotel before the arrival of philip he had consulted a schedule of trains posted up in the office and knew that one would leave precisely at ten oclock the impulse to leave town by this train was sudden he had in his pocket the wallet containing the hundred and fifty dollars of which a large part belonged to philip and could have settled at once without the trouble of going upstairs to his room he only asked leave to go up there in order to gain time for thought at the head of the staircase he saw another narrower flight of stairs descending to the back of the house that gave him the idea of eluding his two creditors by flight i have said before that professor riccabocca was not a wise man or he would have reflected that he was only postponing the inevitable reckoning moreover it would destroy the last chance of making an arrangement with philip to continue the combination which thus far had proved so profitable the professor did not take this into consideration but dashed down the back stairs and opened the back door into the yard do you want anything sir asked a maidservant eyeing the professor suspiciously nothing at all my good girl returned the professor you seem to be in a hurry she continued with renewed suspicion so i am i am in a great hurry to meet an engagement why didnt you go out the front door asked the girl oh bother what business is it of yours demanded the professor impatiently and not stopping for further inquiries he vaulted over a fence and took his way across the fields to the station here sam called the girl her suspicions confirmed that something was wrong go after that man as fast as you can this was addressed to a boy who was employed at the hotel to go on errands and do odd jobs whats he done asked sam i dont know but hes either run off without paying his bill or hes stolen something what goodll it do me to chase him asked sam if hes cheated master hell pay you for catching the man thats so thought sam besides ill be a detective just like that boy i read about in the paper im off fired by youthful ambition sam also vaulted the fence and ran along the footpath in pursuit of the professor lorenzo riccabocca did not know he was pursued he felt himself so safe from this on account of the secrecy of his departure that he never took the trouble to look behind him he knew the way well enough for the fields he was crossing were level and half a mile away perhaps a little more he could see the roof of the brownpainted depot which was his destination once there he would buy a ticket get on the train and get started away from knoxville before the troublesome acquaintances who were waiting for him to come downstairs had any idea where he was gone the professor ran at a steady even pace looking straight before him his eyes were fixed on the haven of his hopes and he did not notice a stone of considerable size which lay in his path the result was that he stumbled over it and fell forward with considerable force he rose jarred and sore but there was no time to take account of his physical damages he must wait till he got on the train the force with which he was thrown forward was such that the wallet was thrown from his pocket and fell in the grass beside the path the professor went on his way quite unconscious of his loss but there were other eyes that did not overlook it sam who was thirty rods behind noticed professor riccaboccas fall and he likewise noticed the wallet when he reached the spot of the catastrophe my eyes he exclaimed opening those organs wide in delight heres luck the old gentleman has dropped his pocketbook most likely its stolen ill carry it back and give it to mr perry sam very sensibly decided that it wasnt worth while to continue the pursuit now that the thief as he supposed riccabocca to be had dropped his booty sam was led by curiosity to open the wallet when he saw the thick roll of bills he was filled with amazement and delight oh what a rascal he was ejaculated the boy i guess hes been robbing a safe i wonder how much is here he was tempted to sit down on the grass and count the bills but he was prevented by the thought that the professor might discover his loss and returning upon his track question him as to whether he had found it sam determined that he wouldnt give it up at any rate i guess i could wrastle with him he thought he looks rather spindlin but then hes bigger than i am and he might lick me after all i desire to say emphatically that sam was strictly honest and never for a moment thought of appropriating any of the money to his own use he felt that as a detective he had been successful and this made him feel proud and happy i may as well go home he said if hes stolen this money from mr perry ill come in for a reward sam did not hurry however he was not now in pursuit of any one and could afford to loiter and recover his breath meanwhile professor riccabocca in happy unconsciousness of his loss continued his run to the station he arrived there breathless and hurried to the ticketoffice give me a ticket to chambersburg he said all right sir ninety cents if riccabocca had been compelled to take out his wallet he would at once have discovered his loss and the ticket would not have been bought but he had a twodollar bill in his vest and it was out of this that he paid for the ticket to chambersburg armed with the ticket he waited anxiously for the train he had five minutes to wait five anxious moments in which his flight might be discovered he paced the platform looking out anxiously for the train at length he heard the welcome sound of the approaching locomotive the train came to a stop and among the first to enter it was the eminent elocutionist he took a seat beside the window looking out toward the village what did he see that brought such an anxious look in his face a buggy was approaching the depot at breakneck speed it contained mr gates the landlord and the young musician mr gates was lashing the horse and evidently was exceedingly anxious to arrive at the depot before the train started beads of perspiration stood on the anxious brow of the professor his heart was filled with panic terror the girl must have told them of my flight he said to himself oh why didnt i think to give her a quarter to keep her lips closed why doesnt the train start the buggy was only about ten rods away it looked as if philip and his companion would be able to intercept the fugitive just then the scream of the locomotive was heard the train began to move professor riccabocca gave a sigh of relief i shall escape them after all he said triumphantly to himself he opened the window and with laughing face nodded to his pursuers weve lost him said philip in a tone of disappointment what can we do find out where he is going and telegraph to have him stopped said mr gates that will put a spoke in his wheel chapter xxxiii the lost wallet mr gates was acquainted with the depotmaster and lost no time in seeking him too late for the train asked the latter who observed in the landlord evidences of haste not for the train but for one of the passengers by the train responded the landlord did you take notice of a man dressed in a shabby suit of black wearing a soft hat and having very long black hair yes where is he going asked mr gates eagerly he bought a ticket for chambersburg ha well i want you to telegraph for me to chambersburg the stationmaster was also the telegraphoperator as it chanced certainly just write out your message and i will send it at once mr gates telegraphed to a deputy sheriff at chambersburg to be at the depot on arrival of the train and to arrest and detain the professor till he could communicate further with him now said he turning to philip i think we shall he able to stop the flight of your friend dont call him my friend said philip he is anything but a friend you are right there well i will amend and call him your partner now mr de gray my name is gray not de gray the professor put in thede because he thought it would sound foreign i presume you have as much right to the name as he has to the title of professor said gates i dont doubt it returned philip smiling well as i was about to say we may as well go back to the hotel and await the course of events i think there is some chance of your getting your money back when they reached the hotel they found a surprise in store for them sam had carried the professors wallet to mr perry and been told by them to wait and hand it in person to philip and his friend mr gates who were then at the depot when they arrived sam was waiting on the stoop wallet in hand what have you got there sam asked mr gates who often came to knoxville and knew the boy its the wallet of that man you were after said sam how did you get it asked philip eagerly i chased him cross lots said sam you didnt knock him over and take the wallet from him did you sam asked mr gates not so bad as that answered sam grinning you see he tripped over a big rock and came down on his hands and knees the wallet jumped out of his pocket but he didnt see it i picked it up and brought it home didnt he know you were chasing him i guess not he never looked back what made you think of running after him one of the girls told me to the way he ran out of the back door made her think there was something wrong suppose he had turned round i guess i could have wrastled with him said sam to the amusement of those who heard him it is well you were not obliged to who shall i give the wallet to asked sam mr gray here is the professors partner and half the money belongs to him you can give it to him have i a right to take it asked philip who did not wish to do anything unlawful he was assured that as the business partner of the professor he had as much right as riccabocca to the custody of the common fund but half of it belongs to the professor hell come back for it in the custody of the sheriff i didnt think i was doing the man a good turn when i telegraphed to have him stopped the first thing philip did was to take from his own funds a fivedollar bill which he tendered to sam is it all for me asked the boy his eyes sparkling his joy yes but for you i should probably have lost a good deal more thank you besides and philip offered his hand to sam who grasped it fervently i say youre a tiptop chap said sam you aint like a man that lost a pocketbook last summer with a hundred dollars in it and gave me five cents for finding it no i hope im not as mean as that said philip smiling he opened the wallet and found a memorandum containing an exact statement of the proceeds of the concert this was of great service to him as it enabled him to calculate his own share of the profits the aggregate receipts were one hundred and fifty dollars and fifty cents deducting bills paid viz rent of hall printing etc billposter total there was a balance of of which philip was entitled to onehalf namely this he took together with the eleven dollars which he had himself paid to the creditors of the combination and handed the wallet with the remainder of the money to mr perry landlord of the knoxville hotel with a request that he would keep it till called for by professor riccabocca you may hand me three dollars and a half mr perry said mr gates that is the amount the professor owes me for a day and threequarters at my hotel if he makes a fuss you can tell him he is quite at liberty to go to law about it meanwhile where was the professor and when did he discover his loss after the train was a mile or two on its way he felt in his pocket for the wallet meaning to regale himself with a sight of its contents now as he considered all his own thrusting his hand into his pocket it met vacancy pale with excitement he continued his search extending it to all his other pockets but the treasure had disappeared professor riccabocca was panicstricken he could hardly suppress a groan a good woman sitting opposite judging from his pallor that he was ill leaned over and asked in a tone of sympathy are you took sick no maam answered the professor sharply you look as if you was goin to have a fit continued the sympathizing woman jest take some chamomile tea the first chance you get its the sovereignest thing i know of will chamomile tea bring back a lost pocketbook demanded the professor sharply oh lor you dont say you lost your money yes i do said riccabocca glaring at her oh dear do you think theres pickpockets in the car asked the old lady nervously very likely answered the professor tragically the good woman kept her hand in her pocket all the rest of the way eyeing all her fellow passengers sharply but the professor guessed the truth he had lost his wallet when he stumbled in the field he was in a fever of impatience to return and hunt for it instead of going on to chambersburg he got out at the next station five miles from knoxville and walked back on the railroadtrack so it happened that the telegram did no good the professor walked back to the hotel across the fields hunting diligently but saw nothing of the lost wallet he entered the hotel footsore weary and despondent the first person he saw was philip sitting tranquilly in the office did you just come down from your room asked our hero coolly i am a most unfortunate man sighed riccabocca sinking into a seat whats the matter ive lost all our money i am glad you say our money i began to think you considered it all yours didnt i see you on the train i had a bad headache stammered the professor and i didnt know what i was doing does riding in the cars benefit your head professor riccabocca looked confused the wallet was found said philip not wishing to keep him any longer in suspense where is it asked the professor eagerly mr perry will give it to you i have taken out my share of the money and mr gates has received the amount of his bill it would have been better for you to attend to these matters yourselff like an honest man professor riccabocca was so overjoyed to have back his own money that he made no fuss about philips proceedings indeed his own intended dishonesty was so apparent that it would have required even more assurance than he possessed to make a protest chapter xxxiv a new business proposal professor riccabocca put the wallet in his pocket with a sigh of satisfaction there were still sixty dollars or more in it and it was long since he had been so rich he began to think now that it might be well to revive the combination there was some doubt however as to how philip would receive the proposal he looked at his young partner and was not much encouraged he felt that he must conciliate him mr de gray he began call me gray my name is not de gray well mr gray then i hope you dont have any hard feelings about what inquired philip surveying the professor curiously about the past stammered the professor you mean about your running off with my money returned philip plainly professor riccabocca winced he did not quite like this form of statement i am afraid you misjudge me he said rather confused i shall be glad to listen to any explanation you have to offer said our hero i will explain it all to you in time said the professor recovering his old assurance in the meantime i have a proposition to make to you what is it suppose we give an entertainment in knoxville on the same terms as the last i shouldnt think you would like to appear before an audience here professor riccabocca why not before night everybody will have heard of your running away with the proceeds of the last concert public men are always misjudged they must expect it said the professor with the air of a martyr i should think you would be more afraid of being justly judged mr gray said the professor i have done wrong i admit but it was under the influence of neuralgia when i have a neuralgic headache i am not myself i do things which in a normal condition i should not dream of i am the victim of a terrible physical malady philip did not believe a word of this but he felt amused at the professors singular excuse come mr gray what do you say i think i must decline returned philip but here professor riccabocca received unexpected help mr perry the landlord who had listened to the colloquy approached the two speakers and said gentlemen i have a proposal to make to you both both philip and the professor looked up with interest some of the young men in the village said the landlord have formed a literary club meeting weekly they have hired and furnished a room over one of our stores provided it with games and subscribed for a few periodicals they find however that the outlay has been greater than they anticipated and are in debt i have been talking with the secretary and he thinks he would like to engage you to give an entertainment the proceeds beyond a fixed sum to go to the benefit of the club what do you say when is it proposed to have the entertainment asked philip i suppose we should have to name tomorrow evening in order to advertise it sufficiently i am willing to make any engagement that will suit the club said philip and i too said professor riccabocca the secretary authorizes me to offer you ten dollars each and to pay your hotel expenses in the meantime said mr perry that is satisfactory said our hero i agree said the professor then i will at once notify the secretary and he will take steps to advertise the entertainment ten dollars was a small sum compared with what philip had obtained for his evening in wilkesville but a week since he would have regarded it as very large for one weeks work he felt that it was for his interest to accept the proposal he secretly resolved that if the entertainment should not prove as successful as was anticipated he would give up a part of the sum which was promised him for his services professor riccabocca assented the more readily to the proposal because he thought it might enable him again to form a business alliance with our hero from whom his conduct had estranged him suppose we take a room together mr de gray he said with an ingratiating smile gray if you please professor i dont like sailing under false colors excuse me the force of habit you know well do you agree the professor has more assurance than any man i ever heard of thought philip you must excuse me professor he said after what has happened i should feel safer in a room by myself why will you dwell upon the past mr gray said the professor reproachfully because i am prudent and learn from experience answered philip i assure you you will have nothing to complain of said riccabocca earnestly if we are together we can consult about the program we shall have plenty of time to do that during the day professor then you dont care to room with me said riccabocca looking disappointed no i dont what are you afraid of i am afraid you might have an attack of neuralgic headache during the night said philip laughing professor riccabocca saw that it would be of no use for him to press the request and allowed himself to be conducted to the same room which he had so unceremoniously left a short time before during the afternoon philip had a call from john turner the secretary of the young mens club he was a pleasant straightforward young man of perhaps twenty we are very much obliged to you mr gray he said for kindly consenting to play for our benefit it is for my interest said philip frankly i may as well remain here and earn ten dollars as to be idle but you made a great deal more i understand in wilkesville yes but i might not be as fortunate here i had not intended to appear here at all and should not have done so unless you had invited me how many have you in your club only about twentyfive so far and some of us are not able to pay much how long has your club been formed asked philip only about three months we wanted a place where we could meet together socially in the evening and have a good time before we had only the stores and barrooms to go to and there we were tempted to drink our club was started in the interests of temperance and we can see already that it is exerting a good influence then i am very glad to assist you said philip cordially you must come round and see our room are you at leisure now yes mr turner philip accompanied his new friend to the neatly furnished room leased by the society he was so well pleased with its appearance that he thought he should himself like to belong to such an association whenever he found a permanent home at present he was only a wanderer our debt is thirtyfour dollars said the secretary you may not think it large but its large for us i hope our entertainment will enable you to clear it off if it should it will give us new courage on the evening of the next day philip and the professor entered the hall engaged for the entertainment and took seats on the platform the hall was well filled the scale of prices being the same as at wilkesville mr gray whispered the secretary joyfully it is a great success after paying all bills the club will clear fifty dollars i am delighted to hear it said philip the professor commenced the entertainment and was followed by philip as philip began to play his attention was drawn to three persons who were entering the hall these were a lady a little girl and a stout gentleman in whom philip almost petrified with amazement recognized his old acquaintance squire pope of norton who had shown himself so anxious to provide him a home in the poorhouse chapter xxxv squire pope is amazed though philip did not know it it chanced that squire popes only sister mrs cunningham lived in knoxville she was a widow fairly well off with a young daughter carrie a girl of twelve squire pope had long thought of visiting his sister and happening about this time to have a little business in a town nearby he decided to carry out his longdeferred plan he arrived by the afternoon train in time for supper i am glad you are here tonight brother said mrs cunningham why particularly tonight sister ellen asked the squire because there is to be an entertainment for the benefit of the young mens literary club it is expected to be very interesting what sort of an entertainment ellen asked the squire the celebrated elocutionist professor riccabocca is to give some readings riccabocca repeated the squire in a musing tone i cant say i ever heard of him nor i but i hear hes very celebrated is there anything else yes theres a young musician going to play he is said to be wonderful he plays on the violin hes a very handsome boy said carrie enthusiastically hes staying at the hotel i saw him this afternoon when i was passing so hes goodlooking is he carrie asked the squire laughing hes ever so goodlooking answered carrie emphatically then we must certainly go for carries sake said the squire squire pope had not the slightest idea that the young musician about whom his niece spoke so enthusiastically was the boy whom he had so recently persecuted if carrie had mentioned his name the secret would have been out but she had not yet heard it in honor of her brothers arrival mrs cunningham prepared a more elaborate supper than usual and to this it was owing that the three entered the hall late just as philip was about to commence playing the squire and his companions were obliged to take seats some distance away from the platform and as his eyesight was poor he didnt immediately recognize as an old acquaintance the boy who was standing before the audience with his violin in his hand thats he thats the young violinplayer whispered carrie in a tone of delight isnt he handsome uncle wait till i get my glasses on said the squire fumbling in his pocket for his spectaclecase adjusting his glasses squire pope directed a glance at the stage he instantly recognized philip and his surprise was boundless he gave a sudden start by gracious i couldnt have believed it he ejaculated couldnt have believed what brother asked mrs cunningham i know that boy he said in a tone of excitement you know him uncle said carrie delighted then you must introduce me to him i want to meet him ever so much where did you ever see him where did i see him im his guardian he ran away from me a little more than a week since and i never knew where he went you the guardian of the wonderful boyplayer said carrie astonished isnt it strange his father died a short time since and left him in my care said the squire not scrupling to make a misstatement but ill tell you more about it when the performance is over when philip first saw squire pope entering the hall it disconcerted him but he reflected that the squire really had no authority over him and consequently he had nothing to fear from him should his pretended guardian make any effort to recover him he was resolved to make a desperate resistance and even if necessary to invoke the help of the law meanwhile his pride stimulated him to play his best and the hearty applause of the audience when he had finished his piece encouraged him as he was bowing his thanks he could not help directing a triumphant glance at squire pope who was carefully scrutinizing him through his goldbowed spectacles he was glad that the squire had a chance to see for himself that he was well able to make his own way with the help of the violin of which the norton official had attempted to deprive him in truth squire pope who knew little of philips playing except that he did play was amazed to find him so proficient instead however of concluding that a boy so gifted was abundantly able to paddle his own canoe as the saying is he was the more resolved to carry him back to norton and to take into his own care any the boy might have earned in the middle of the entertainment was a recess of ten minutes which most of the audience spent in conversation miss carrie began again to speak of philip oh uncle she said im so glad you know that lovely boyplayer he is earning lots of money is he asked the squire pricking up his ears who told you so one of the young men that belongs to the club told me they were to pay him ten dollars for playing tonight ten dollars ejaculated the squire in amazement i dont believe it its ridiculous oh yes it is true said mrs cunningham john turner told carrie and he is secretary and ought to know that isnt all continued carrie mr turner says it is very kind of mr gray mr gray repeated the squire amused well philip then i suppose you call him philip as you are his guardian well what were you going to say mr turner says that it is very kind of philip to play for so little for he made a good deal more money by his entertainment in wilkesville did he give a concert in wilkesville asked the squire quickly yes he and the professor he was liked very much there and you heard that he made a good deal of money there yes lots of it then thought the squire he must have considerable money with him as his guardian i ought to have the care of it hes a boy and isnt fit to have the charge of money its very lucky i came here just as i did its my duty as his guardian to look after him the squire determined to seek an interview with our hero as soon as the entertainment was over chapter xxxvi the pretended guardian philip played with excellent effect and his efforts were received with as much favor at knoxville as at wilkesville he was twice encored and at the end of each of his selections he was greeted with applause as for professor riccabocca people hardly knew what to make of him he was as eccentric and extravagant as ever and his recitations were received with goodnatured amusement he didnt lack for applause however there were some boys on the front seats who applauded him just for the fun of it though the applause was ironical the professor persuaded himself that it was genuine and posed before the audience at each outburst with his hand on his heart and his head bent so far over that he seemed likely to lose his balance we are making a grand success mr gray he said during the interval of ten minutes already referred to did you notice how they applauded me yes answered philip with a smile they evidently appreciate true genius it reminds me of the ovation they gave me at cincinnati last winter does it asked philip still smiling yes i was a great favorite in that intellectual city by the way i noticed that they seemed well pleased with your playing also this he said carelessly as if philips applause was not to be compared to his yes they treat me very kindly answered philip you are fortunate in having me to introduce you to the public said the professor emphatically the name of riccabocca is so well known that it is of great advantage to you the professor deluded himself with the idea that he was a great elocutionist and that the public rated him as highly as he did himself when anything occurred that did not seem to favor this view he closed his eyes to it preferring to believe that he was a popular favorite i hope i shall never be so deceived about myself thought philip when the entertainment was over mr caswell president of the club came up to philip and said cordially mr gray we are very much indebted to you thanks to you we are out of debt and shall have a balance of from twelve to fifteen dollars in the treasury i am very glad of it said philip so am i said the professor pushing forward jealous lest philip should get more than his share of credit and we are indebted to you also professor riccabocca said the president taking the hint you are entirely welcome sir said riccabocca loftily my help has often been asked in behalf of charitable organizations i remember once in philadelphia i alone raised five hundred dollars for a a i think it was a hospital this was an invention but professor riccabocca had no scruple in getting up little fictions which he thought likely to redound to his credit and increase his reputation doubtless you are often called upon also mr gray suggested mr caswell with a smile no answered philip this is the first time that i have ever had the opportunity theres no humbug about the boy thought mr caswell as for the professor he is full of it i have pleasure in handing you the price agreed upon said the president presenting each with a tendollar bill thank you said philip professor riccabocca carelessly tucked the bill into his vest pocket as if it were a mere trifle at this moment mr turner came up with all the other gentleman mr gray he said here is a gentleman who wishes to speak to you philip looked up and saw the wellknown figure of squire pope chapter xxxvii his own master ahem philip said the squire i should like a little conversation with you good evening squire pope said our hero not pretending to be cordial but with suitable politeness i didnt expect to see you here pursued the squire nor i you sir i am visiting my sister mrs cunningham who lives in knoxville will you come around with me and make a call now considering the treatment which philip had received from the squire before he left norton the reader can hardly feel surprised that our hero didnt care to trust himself with his unscrupulous fellow townsman thank you squire pope said philip but it is rather late for me to call at a private house i am staying at the hotel and if you will take the trouble to go around there with me we will have a chance to converse very well said the squire hesitating just then up came his niece carrie who was determined to get acquainted with philip uncle she said introduce me to mr gray this is my niece caroline cunningham said the squire stiffly i am glad to meet miss cunningham said philip extending his hand with a smile what a lovely player you are mr gray she said impulsively i am afraid you are flattering me miss cunningham dont call me miss cunningham my name is carrie miss carrie then i was ever so much surprised to hear that uncle was your guardian philip looked quickly at the squire but did not contradict it he only said we used to live in the same town during this conversation squire pope looked embarrassed and impatient its getting late carrie he said you had better go home arent you coming too uncle i am going to the hotel to settle some business with philip what business i wonder thought our hero arrived at the hotel they went upstairs to philips chamber you left norton very abruptly philip commenced the squire there was good reason for it answered philip significantly it appears to me you are acting as if you were your own master observed the squire i am my own master replied philip firmly you seem to forget that i am your guardian i dont forget it for i never knew it said our hero it is generally understood that such is the case i cant help it i dont need a guardian and shall get along without one ahem perhaps that isnt to be decided by you if i am to have a guardian squire pope said philip bluntly i shant select you i shall select mr dunbar i have much more knowledge of business than mr dunbar said the squire shifting his ground that may be but there is one important objection what is that you are not my friend and mr dunbar is really this is very extraordinary ejaculated the squire i am not your friend how do you know that you tried to make a pauper out of me when as you must perceive i am entirely able to earn my own living is it true that you were paid ten dollars for playing this evening asked the squire curiously yes sir it beats all said the squire in amazement yet you wanted to sell my violin for a good deal less than i have earned in one evening said philip enjoying his enemys surprise you gave an entertainment at wilkesville also i hear yes sir did you make as much there i made between sixty and seventy dollars over and above expenses you dont expect me to believe that said the squire i dont care whether you believe it or not its true have you got the money with you yes then youd better give it to me to keep for you thank you i feel capable of taking care of it myself but its improper for a boy of your age to carry round so much money said the squire sharply if i need help to take care of it i will ask mr dunbar come philip said the squire condescending to assume a persuasive manner you must remember that i am your guardian i dispute that said philip i wont insist upon your going back with me to norton as long as you are able to support yourself then you wouldnt advise me to go back to the poorhouse said philip with some sarcasm in his voice i didnt mean to have you stay there long said the squire rather confused youd better give me most of your money and ill take care of it for you and when youre twentyone youll have quite a little sum i am much obliged to you sir but i wont put you to the trouble of taking care of my money answered philip coldly squire pope continued to argue with philip but made no impression at length he was obliged to say good night i will call round in the morning he said at parting perhaps youll listen to reason then when he called round in the morning he learned to his disappointment that philip was gone chapter xxxviii an offer declined after his interview with squire pope philip came down to the office where he saw professor riccabocca apparently waiting for him well mr gray where shall we go next asked the professor with suavity i havent decided where to go have you asked philip coolly i suppose we had better go to raymond that is a goodsized place i think we can get together a good audience there you seem to be under the impression that we are in partnership said philip of course answered riccabocca i have made no agreement of that sort professor but of course it is understood said riccabocca quickly as long as we draw so well you must excuse me professor riccabocca i must decline the proposal but why inquired the professor anxiously i hope you wont press me for an explanation but i do i cant understand why you should act so against your own interest you cant expect people will come just to hear you play you need me to help you it may be as you say professor but if you insist upon my speaking plainly i dont care to travel with a man who has treated me as you have i dont understand you said riccabocca nervously but it was evident from his expression that he did then you seem very forgetful said philip you tried to deprive me of my share of the proceeds of the entertainment at wilkesville and would have succeeded but for a lucky accident i told you that it was all owing to neuralgia said professor riccabocca i had such an attack of neuralgic headache that it nearly drove me wild then said philip i would rather find a partner who is not troubled with neuralgic headache i think it would be safer it wont happen again mr gray i assure you said the professor apologetically he endeavored to persuade philip to renew the combination but our hero steadily refused he admitted that it might be to his pecuniary advantage but he had lost all confidence in the eminent professor and he thought it better to part now than to give him another opportunity of playing a similar trick upon him the professor thereupon consulted the landlord as to whether it would be advisable for him to give another entertainment unaided and was assured very emphatically that it would not pay expenses you make a great mistake mr gray said riccabocca it would be a great advantage for you to have my assistance at this stage of your professional career i dont expect to have any professional career answered philip dont you intend to become a professional musician asked the professor surprised probably not i have only been playing because i needed money and my violin helped me to a living you cant make as much money in any other way not at present but i want to get a chance to enter upon some kind of business i am going to new york you will some time have a chance to hear me there in the academy of music said riccabocca pompously i will go and hear you said philip laughing if i can afford a ticket say the word and we will appear there together mr gray i think not professor in fact though philip had found himself unexpectedly successful as a musician he knew very well that he was only a clever amateur and that years of study would be needed to make him distinguished he was glad that he had the means of paying his expenses for a considerable time and had in his violin a trusty friend upon which he could rely in case he got into financial trouble directly after breakfast he set out on his journey chapter xxxix an ambitious wayfarer the large sums which philip had received for his playing might have dazzled a less sensible boy he was quite conscious that he played unusually well for a boy but when it came to selecting music as a profession he felt it would not be wise to come to too hasty a decision to be a commonplace performer did not seem to him very desirable and would not have satisfied his ambition he had told professor riccabocca that he intended to go to new york this design had not been hastily formed he had heard a great deal of the great city in his home in the western part of the state of which it was the metropolis and he was desirous of seeing it perhaps there might be some opening for him in its multitude of business houses philip had plenty of money and could easily have bought a railroad ticket which would have landed him in new york inside of twentyfour hours for he was only about four hundred miles distant but he was in no hurry and rather enjoyed traveling leisurely through the country towns with his violin in his hand it reminded him of a biography he had read of the famous doctor goldsmith author of the vicar of wakefield who made a tour on the continent of europe paying his way with music evoked from a similar instrument three days later he found himself on the outskirts of a village which i will call cranston it was afternoon and he had walked far enough to be tired he was looking about for a pleasant place to lounge when his attention was drawn to a boy of about his own age who was sitting on the stone wall under a large tree he was rather a slender boy and had originally been well dressed but his suit was travelstained and covered with dust now boys have a natural attraction for each other and philip determined to introduce himself to the stranger this he did in boyfashion by saying hello hello said the stranger looking up but he spoke slowly and wearily and to philip he seemed out of spirits do you live in cranston asked philip taking a seat beside the other boy upon the top of the stone wall no do you no where do you live i dont live anywhere just at present answered philip with a smile i am traveling so am i said the other boy i am traveling to new york philip continued and i am traveling from there said his new acquaintance then both boys surveyed each other curiously whats your name asked the stranger philip gray whats yours mine is henry taylor what have you got there a violin do you play on it yes a little i should think youd be tired lugging it round philip smiled it is about all the property i have he said so it wont do for me to get tired of it youre richer than i am then said henry are you poor then asked philip in a tone of sympathy i havent got a cent in my pocket and i havent had anything to eat since breakfast then im glad i met you said philip warmly i will see that you have a good supper how long is it since you left new york about a week what made you leave it henry taylor hesitated and finally answered in a confused tone ive run away from home i wanted to go out west to kill indians philip stared at his new acquaintance in astonishment chapter xl the indian hunter philip had lived so long in a country village that he had never chanced to read any of those absorbing romances in which one boy of tender years proves himself a match for a dozen indians more or less and therefore he was very much amazed at henry taylors avowal that he was going out west to kill indians what do you want to kill indians for he asked after an astonished pause now it was henrys turn to be astonished every boy wants to kill indians he answered looking pityingly at our hero what for what good will it do asked philip it shows hes brave answered his new friend didnt you ever read the story of bully bill or the hero of the plains i never heard of it said philip you must have lived in the woods then said henry taylor rather contemptuously its a tiptop story bully bill was only fourteen and killed ever so many indians twenty or thirty i guess as well as a lot of lions and bears oh he must have had lots of fun why didnt the indians kill him asked philip desirous of being enlightened they didnt stand still and let him kill them did they no of course not they fought awful hard how did one young boy manage to overcome so many indians oh youll have to read the story to find out bully bill was a great hero and everybody admired him so you wanted to imitate his example asked philip to be sure i did how did you happen to get out of money well said henry you see me and another boy got awful excited after reading the story and both concluded nothing could make us so happy as to go out west together and do as bill did of course it was no use to ask the old man the old man queried philip the govnor father of course so we got hold of some money you got hold of some money queried philip thats what i said didnt i rejoined henry irritably yes then whats the use of repeating it philip intended to ask where or how henry got hold of the money but he saw pretty clearly that this would not be agreeable to his new acquaintance though without much experience in the world he suspected that the money was not obtained honestly and did not press the question well me and tom started about a week ago first of all we bought some revolvers as of course we should need them to shoot indians they cost more than we expected and then we found it cost more to travel than we thought how much money did you have after paying for our revolvers tom and me had about thirty dollars said henry only thirty dollars to go west with exclaimed philip in amazement why you see the revolvers cost more than we expected then we stopped at a hotel in albany where they charged us frightfully that is where tom left me tom left you at albany yes he got homesick said henry contemptuously he thought we hadnt money enough and he said he didnt know as he cared so much about killing indians i agree with tom said philip i dont think i should care very much about killing indians myself and i should decidedly object to being killed by an indian i shouldnt like to be scalped would you oh id take care of that said henry i wouldnt let them have the chance it seems to me the best way would be to stay at home said philip smiling if i stayed at home id have to go to school and study i dont care much about studying i like it said philip so tom left you did he yes but i wasnt going to give up so easy he took half the money that was left though i thought he ought to have given it to me as i needed it more i wasnt going home just as id started then youve spent all your money now yes answered henry gloomily have you got much money he asked after a pause yes i have about a hundred dollarssay ninetyfive you dont mean it ejaculated henry hie eyes sparkling yes i do how did you get it i earned most of it by playing on the violin i say exclaimed henry in excitement suppose you and me go into partnership together and go out west to kill indians asked philip smiling yes with all that money well get along besides if we get short you can earn some more but what advantage am i to get out of it i am to furnish all the capital and pay all expenses as far as i can understand generally both partners put in something i put in my revolver said henry one revolver wont do for us both oh well you can buy one come what do you say asked henry eagerly let me ask you a few questions first where does your father live in new york what is his business he is a broker in wall street i suppose he is rich oh hes got plenty of money i expect we live in a nice house on madison avenue thats one of the best streets i suppose you know i never was in new york is your mother living no answered henry she died three years ago if his mother had been living probably the boy would never have made such an escapade but his father being engrossed by business cares was able to give very little attention to his son and this accounts in part for the folly of which he had been guilty have you got any brothers or sisters he asked i have one sister about three years younger than i her name is jennie i wish i were as well off as you said philip how do you mean i mean i wish i had a father and sister havent you my father is dead said philip gravely and i never had a sister oh well i dont know as im so lucky said henry sisters are a bother they want you to go round with them and the old man is always finding fault philips relations with his father had always been so affectionate that he could not understand how henry could talk in such a way of his i dont know what makes you ask me such a lot of questions said henry showing impatience come what do you say to my offer about forming a partnership yes id rather not in that way in what way i mean for the purpose of going out west to kill indians youve no idea what fun it would be said henry disappointed no i suppose not said philip smiling then i suppose i shall have to give it up said henry now i have a proposal to make to you said philip what is it if you agree to go home ill pay your expenses and go along with you ive never been to new york and id like to have some one with me that could show me round the city i can do that said henry i know the way all about then will you agree yes then come along and well stop at the first convenient place and get some supper chapter xli an adventure in the woods i shall do a good thing if i induce henry to go home thought philip that is rather a queer idea of his about wanting to kill indians it seems to me as much murder to kill an indian as any one else he only thought this but did not express it as he did not care to get into a discussion with his new acquaintance lest the latter should recall his consent to go home i say philip said henry who had now learned our heros name we aint in any hurry to go to new york are we i thought we might take a train tomorrow morning and go straight through but id rather take it easy and travel through the country and have adventures but you forget that your father will be anxious about you yes i suppose he will ill tell you what ill do if youll write a letter to your father and let him know that you are safe with me ill do as you say all right said henry in a tone of satisfaction ill do it fatherll pay you all you have to spend for me henry added after a moments pause very well then i will be your banker philip was not foolish enough to protest that he did not care to be repaid all he had in the world was a little less than a hundred dollars and when that was gone he was not absolutely sure of making any more at once though he felt tolerably confident that he could suppose you let me have ten dollars now suggested henry i think i would rather keep the money and pay the bills said philip quietly he was not sure but that henry if he had a supply of money in his pockets would reconsider his promise to go home and take french leave of course it would be extremely foolish but his present expedition did not indicate the possession of much wisdom i dont see what difference it makes said henry looking dissatisfied i wont argue the point answered philip goodnaturedly i wish i was in new york near a good restaurant said henry after a pause oh i forgot you are hungry awfully i dont believe theres a hotel within two or three miles i dont think i can hold out to walk much farther a few rods farther on was a farmhouse standing back from the road oldfashionedlooking but of comfortable aspect a young girl appeared at the side door and rang a noisy bell with great vigor theyre going to have supper said henry wistfully i wish it was a hotel philip had lived in the country and understood the hospitable ways of country people come along henry he said ill ask them to sell us some supper i am sure they will be willing followed by his new acquaintance he walked up to the side door and knocked for there was no bell the young girl probably about philips age opened the door and regarded them with some surprise philip bowed will you be kind enough to tell us if there is any hotel nearby he asked theres one about three miles and a half farther on henry groaned inwardly i am going to ask you a favor said philip my friend and i have traveled a considerable distance and stand in need of supper we are willing to pay as much as we should have to at a hotel if you will let us take supper here ill ask mother said the young girl and forthwith she disappeared she came back in company with a stout motherlylooking woman philip repeated his request why to be sure she said heartily we always have enough and to spare come right in and well have supper as soon as the menfolks come in they entered a neat kitchen in the middle of which was set out a table with a savory supper upon it henrys eyes sparkled and his mouth watered for the poor boy was almost famished if you want to wash come right in here said the farmers wife leading the way into a small room adjoining the two boys gladly availed themselves of the permission though henry would not have minded sitting right down dusty as he was however he felt better after he had washed his face and bands and wiped them on the long roll towel that hung beside the sink they were scarcely through when their places were taken by the farmer and his son the latter a tall sunburned young man of about twenty who had just come in from a distant field the farmers wife soon explained the presence of the two young strangers sho said the farmer youre pretty young to be travelin you aint in any business be you henry was rather ashamed to mention that his business was killing indians though as yet he had not done anything in that line he had an idea that he might be laughed at i am a little of a musician said philip modestly sho do you make it pay pretty well so far but i think when i get to new york i shall try something else are you a musician as well as he asked the farmer of henry no sir come father youd better sit down to supper and do your talking afterward said the farmers wife so they sat down to the table and all did full justice to the wholesome fare particularly henry who felt absolutely ravenous never at the luxurious home of his father in madison avenue had the wandering city boy enjoyed his supper as much as at the plain table of this country farmer the good mistress of the household was delighted at the justice done to her viands considering it a tribute to her qualities as a cook when philip produced his purse to pay for their supper the farmer absolutely refused to receive anything but i would rather pay persisted our hero then ill tell you how you may pay give us one or two tunes on your violin this philip was quite willing to do and it is needless to say that his small audience was very much pleased i say said henry you play well enough to give concerts i have done it before now answered philip smiling they were invited to spend the night but desired to push on to the hotel being refreshed by their supper and feeling able to walk three or four miles farther about halfway their attention was drawn to what appeared a deserted cabin in the edge of the woods some twenty rods back from the road i say philip said henry theres an old hut that looks as if nobody lived in it wouldnt it be a lark for us to sleep there tonight it would save the expense of lodging at the hotel and would be an adventure i havent had any adventures yet i have no objection said philip well go at any rate and look at it they crossed the field which seemed to have been only partially cleared and soon reached the hut it was very bare within but on the floor in one corner was a blanket spread out there was a place for a window but the sash had been removed and it was easy to step in i wonder how this blanket came here said philip oh i guess the last people that lived here left it returned henry i say phil i begin to feel tired suppose we lie down im glad i havent got to walk any farther philip sympathized with his new friend and so without much parley the two boys threw themselves down on the blanket and were soon fast asleep how long philip slept he didnt know but he was awakened by a terrible screech and opening his eyes say henry sitting bolt upright with trembling limbs and distended eyeballs gazing fearfully at a tall muscularlooking indian who had just stepped into the cabin through the open window chapter xlii an indian at last whats the matter asked philip rubbing his eyes for he was hardly able so suddenly had he been roused from sleep to comprehend the situation henry as white as a sheet could only point at the tall indian who standing motionless was gazing as intently at the boys he made one step forward and henry thought he was about to be killed and scalped forthwith oh mr indian chief he exclaimed in tremulous accents dont kill me i i aint ready to die the indian looked amazed and laughed gutturally but did not speak his laugh increased henrys dismay ive got a revolver ill give it to you if you wont kill me continued henry then the indian spoke why should i kill white boy he asked in a mild tone which ought to have convinced henry that he had nothing to fear but the boy was so frenzied with terror and so possessed of the thought that the indian was just like the savage warriors of the plains of whom he had read so much that he still felt his life to be in danger and answered the question in a way not expected i suppose you want my scalp he said but i am only a boy and i dont mean any harm i hope youll spare my life another fit of guttural laughter from the indian which perplexed henry and after a pause he said me no want white boys scalp me good indian an immense burden seemed lifted from poor henrys breast then you dont want to kill me he said no then why do you come here me live here the secret was out a secret which philip had suspected from the first though henry had not dreamed of it they had lain down in the indians cabin appropriating his blanket and were simply intruders philip thought it was time for him to take part in the conversation i hope youll excuse us he said for coming here we had no idea any one lived here no matter said the indian civilly that being one of the phrases which his knowledge of english included henry said philip let us get up we are sleeping in this this gentlemans bed he felt a little at a loss how to designate the indian but felt that it was best to be as polite as possible the two boys started up in order to yield to the master of the house the bed which properly belonged to him no said the indian with a wave of his hand white boys stay there indian sleep anywhere so saying he lay down in one corner of the cabin and settled himself apparently to repose but said philip we dont want to take your bed no matter said the indian once more you are very kind said philip henry we may as well lay down again henry obeyed directions but he was not altogether free from alarm he had read that the indians are very crafty how did he know but their coppercolored host might get up in the night skillfully remove their scalps and leave them in a very uncomfortable plight hadnt we better get up and run away as soon as he is asleep he whispered to philip no hes friendly answered philip confidently as henry had read about friendly indians all he knew about indians by the way was derived from reading stories written by authors little wiser than himself he concluded that perhaps there was nothing to fear and after a while fell asleep again when the boys awoke it was morning they looked toward the corner where the indian had lain down but it was vacant hes gone said henry rather relieved you were pretty well frightened last night said philip smiling who wouldnt be asked henry to wake up and see a big indian in the room i dare say many boys would be frightened said philip but i dont think a boy who left home to go out west to kill indians ought to be afraid of one i guess ill give up going said henry rather abashed i think myself it would be as well observed philip quietly youd find it rather serious business if you should meet any real indian warriors i dont know but i should henry admitted rather awkwardly i didnt think much about it when i left home i suppose you thought youd be a match for half a dozen indian warriors said philip laughing that was the way with bully bill or the hero of the plains said henry he always came off best when he fought with the indians i dont think either you or i will ever prove a bully bill said philip i might enjoy going out west some time but i shouldnt expect to kill many indians i think they would stand a good deal better chance of shooting me henry said nothing but looked thoughtful his romantic ideas seemed to have received a sudden shock and he was trying to adjust his ideas to the new light he had received the boys were preparing to go out when their indian host suddenly reappeared he carried in his hand a largesized loaf of bakers bread which he had procured at the village store he was alive to the duties of hospitality and did not intend to let his guests go uninvited though they were without a breakfast though his stock of english was limited he made out to invite the boys to breakfast with him henry would have preferred to go to the hotel but philip signed to him to accept graciously the indians hospitality as the bread was fresh they partook of it with relish washing it down with drafts of clear spring water the indian looked on well pleased to see the justice done to his hospitality he explained to the boys that he made baskets caught fish and sometimes engaged in hunting managing in one way and another to satisfy his simple wants his name was winuca but his white neighbors called him tom when the boys were ready to go philip drew from his pocket a jackknife nearly new of which he asked the indians acceptance winuca seemed very much pleased and shook hands heartily with his young guests wishing them goodby the boys kept on to the hotel where they spent a few hours taking dinner there their breakfast had been so simple that they had a very good appetite for their midday meal while we are here henry suppose you write to your father and relieve his anxiety suggested philip why cant you write asked henry who cherished the general boyish distaste for letterwriting because it will be more proper for you to write i am a stranger to him you wont be long philip i shall want you to come and make me a visit perhaps youll be tired of me before we get to new york suggested philip with a smile there isnt much chance of it i like you better than any boy i know youre awful brave too you didnt seem to be at all scared last night when the indian came in it was because i felt sure that any indian to be found about here would be harmless i wish we could make a journey together some time id like to go west to kill indians no if theyll let me alone ill let them alone but there must be a lot of fun out on the prairies well henry go and write your letter and we can talk about that afterward the letter was written and mailed and arrived in new york several days before the boys did chapter xliii a welcome letter alexander taylor a wall street broker sat at breakfast in his fine house on madison avenue his daughter jennie about thirteen years old was the only other person at the table papa have you heard nothing of henry asked the little girl anxiously only that the boy who got started with him on his foolish tramp got back three days since is tom murray back then yes he showed himself more sensible than henry oh im afraid somethings happened to him papa why dont you advertise for him or send out a detective or something i will tell you jennie said mr taylor laying down the morning paper i want your brother to stay away long enough to see his folly but perhaps he may get out of money and not be able to get anything to eat you wouldnt want him to starve papa there isnt much chance of it if he is in danger of that he will have sense enough to ask for food or to write to me for help i rather hope he will have a hard time oh papa it will do him good if i sent for him and brought him back against his will he would probably start off again when he has a good chance jennie could not quite follow her father in his reasoning and was inclined to think him hard and unfeeling she missed her brother who whatever his faults treated her tolerably well and was at any rate a good deal of company being the only other young person in the house just then the servant entered with three letters which he laid down beside his masters plate mr taylor hastily scanned the addresses here is a letter from henry he said in a tone of satisfaction oh read it quick papa this was the letter which mr taylor read aloud almost too deliberately for the impatience of his daughter dear father i am alive and well and hope to see you in a few days i guess i made a mistake in running away though i didnt think so at the time for i wanted to see life and have adventures i dont know how i should have got along if i hadnt met philip gray hes a tiptop fellow and is paying my expenses i told him you would pay him back he has got me off the idea of going west to kill indians oh papa exclaimed jennie opening her eyes wide i didnt know that was what henry went for i dont think the indians would have felt very much frightened if they had heard of his intention however i will proceed i was all out of money when philip met me and i hadnt had anything to eat since morning he bought me some supper and is paying my expenses he is a poor boy coming to new york to get a place if he can he has got a violin and he plays beautifully he earned all the money he has by giving concerts i should like to see philip said jennie with interest i asked him if he wouldnt go out west with me but he wouldnt he told me he wouldnt do anything for me unless i would agree to come home he is a sensible boy commented mr taylor in a tone of approval we thought at first of coming right home on the cars but i wanted to walk and see something of the country and philip said he didnt mind he told me i must write and tell you so that you neednt feel anxious you will see us in a few days i will bring philip to the house your son henry taylor is that all asked jennie yes i consider it a very fair letter it is evident henry has made the acquaintance of a sensible boy i shall take care that he doesnt let it drop chapter xliv a fresh start five days later just as mr tayior was sitting down to dinner at the close of the day the doorbell rang violently there was a hurried step heard in the hall and the door opening quickly henry taylor rushed in his face beaming with smiles oh im so glad to see you henry said jennie embracing him i missed you awfully henry looked at his father a little doubtful of his reception are you well father he asked quite well responded mr taylor coolly where did you leave your scalps what ejaculated henry bewildered i thought you left home to kill indians oh said henry smiling faintly i didnt meet any indians except one and he was friendly then your expedition was a failure i guess ill leave the indians alone said henry sheepishly that strikes me as a sensible remark of course a few indian scalps would be of great use to you i fully expected a present of one as a trophy of my sons valor but still in case the indian objected to being scalped there might be a little risk in performing the operation i see you are laughing at me father said henry not at all you can see that i am very sober if you think you can make a good living hunting indians i dont know myself how much their scalps bring in the market i might set you up in the business i am not so foolish as i was i prefer some other business philip told me where is philip asked jennie eagerly i left him in the parlor he said i had better come in first go and call him invite him with my compliments to stay to dinner henry left the room and reappeared almost immediately with philip both boys were perfectly neat in appearance for philip had insisted on going to a hotel and washing and dressing themselves as he followed henry into the room with modest selfpossession his cheeks glowing with a healthy color both jennie and mr taylor were instantly prepossessed in his favor i am glad to see you philip said the broker and beg to thank you not only for the material help you gave henry but also for the good advice which i consider of still greater importance and value thank you sir i dont feel competent to give much advice but i thought his best course was to come home you havent as high an idea of hunting indians as henry i infer no sir answered philip smiling it seems to me they have as much right to live as we if they behave themselves i think so too said henry who was rather ashamed of what had once been his great ambition you havent introduced me to philip i mean mr gray said jennie this is my sister jennie phil said henry in an offhand manner i am very glad to see you mr gray said jennie extending her hand i am hardly used to that name said philip smiling when i get well acquainted with you i shall call you philip i hope you will within an hour miss jennie appeared to feel well acquainted with her brothers friend for she dropped mr gray altogether and called him philip at her solicitation he played on his violin both mr taylor and jennie were surprised at the excellence of his execution when philip rose to go mr taylor said cordially i cannot permit you to leave us philip you must remain here as our guest but sir i left my things at a hotel then henry will go with you and get them so philip found himself established in a fine house on madison avenue as a favored guest the next morning when mr taylor went to his office he asked philip to go with him arrived in wall street he sent a boy to the bank with a check on his return he selected five twentydollar bills and handed them to philip you have expended some money for henry he said yes sir but not quarter as much as this then accept the rest as a gift you will probably need some new clothes henry will take you to our tailor dont spare expense the bill will be sent to me but mr taylor i do not deserve such kindness let me be the judge of that in a few days i shall have a proposal to make to you this was the proposal and the way it was made i find philip said mr taylor some days later that henry is much attached to you and that your influence over him is excellent he has agreed to go to an academy in connecticut and study hard for a year provided you will go with him i take it for granted you havent completed your education no sir i shall pay all the bills and provide for you in every way exactly as i do for henry but mr taylor how can i ever repay you asked philip by being henrys friend and adviser perhaps i may say guardian for although you are about the same age you are far wiser and more judicious i will certainly do the best i can for him sir during the next week the two boys left new york and became pupils at doctor shelleys private academy at elmwood a pleasant country town not far from long island sound and there we bid them adieu the end
