the trembling of a leaf contents i the pacific ii mackintosh iii the fall of edward barnard iv red v the pool vi honolulu vii rain viii envoi the trembling of a leaf i the pacific the pacific is inconstant and uncertain like the soul of man sometimes it is grey like the english channel off beachy head with a heavy swell and sometimes it is rough capped with white crests and boisterous it is not so often that it is calm and blue then indeed the blue is arrogant the sun shines fiercely from an unclouded sky the trade wind gets into your blood and you are filled with an impatience for the unknown the billows magnificently rolling stretch widely on all sides of you and you forget your vanished youth with its memories cruel and sweet in a restless intolerable desire for life on such a sea as this ulysses sailed when he sought the happy isles but there are days also when the pacific is like a lake the sea is flat and shining the flying fish a gleam of shadow on the brightness of a mirror make little fountains of sparkling drops when they dip there are fleecy clouds on the horizon and at sunset they take strange shapes so that it is impossible not to believe that you see a range of lofty mountains they are the mountains of the country of your dreams you sail through an unimaginable silence upon a magic sea now and then a few gulls suggest that land is not far off a forgotten island hidden in a wilderness of waters but the gulls the melancholy gulls are the only sign you have of it you see never a tramp with its friendly smoke no stately bark or trim schooner not a fishing boat even it is an empty desert and presently the emptiness fills you with a vague foreboding ii mackintosh he splashed about for a few minutes in the sea it was too shallow to swim in and for fear of sharks he could not go out of his depth then he got out and went into the bathhouse for a shower the coldness of the fresh water was grateful after the heavy stickiness of the salt pacific so warm though it was only just after seven that to bathe in it did not brace you but rather increased your languor and when he had dried himself slipping into a bathgown he called out to the chinese cook that he would be ready for breakfast in five minutes he walked barefoot across the patch of coarse grass which walker the administrator proudly thought was a lawn to his own quarters and dressed this did not take long for he put on nothing but a shirt and a pair of duck trousers and then went over to his chiefs house on the other side of the compound the two men had their meals together but the chinese cook told him that walker had set out on horseback at five and would not be back for another hour mackintosh had slept badly and he looked with distaste at the pawpaw and the eggs and bacon which were set before him the mosquitoes had been maddening that night they flew about the net under which he slept in such numbers that their humming pitiless and menacing had the effect of a note infinitely drawn out played on a distant organ and whenever he dozed off he awoke with a start in the belief that one had found its way inside his curtains it was so hot that he lay naked he turned from side to side and gradually the dull roar of the breakers on the reef so unceasing and so regular that generally you did not hear it grew distinct on his consciousness its rhythm hammered on his tired nerves and he held himself with clenched hands in the effort to bear it the thought that nothing could stop that sound for it would continue to all eternity was almost impossible to bear and as though his strength were a match for the ruthless forces of nature he had an insane impulse to do some violent thing he felt he must cling to his selfcontrol or he would go mad and now looking out of the window at the lagoon and the strip of foam which marked the reef he shuddered with hatred of the brilliant scene the cloudless sky was like an inverted bowl that hemmed it in he lit his pipe and turned over the pile of auckland papers that had come over from apia a few days before the newest of them was three weeks old they gave an impression of incredible dullness then he went into the office it was a large bare room with two desks in it and a bench along one side a number of natives were seated on this and a couple of women they gossiped while they waited for the administrator and when mackintosh came in they greeted him talofa li he returned their greeting and sat down at his desk he began to write working on a report which the governor of samoa had been clamouring for and which walker with his usual dilatoriness had neglected to prepare mackintosh as he made his notes reflected vindictively that walker was late with his report because he was so illiterate that he had an invincible distaste for anything to do with pens and paper and now when it was at last ready concise and neatly official he would accept his subordinates work without a word of appreciation with a sneer rather or a gibe and send it on to his own superior as though it were his own composition he could not have written a word of it mackintosh thought with rage that if his chief pencilled in some insertion it would be childish in expression and faulty in language if he remonstrated or sought to put his meaning into an intelligible phrase walker would fly into a passion and cry what the hell do i care about grammar thats what i want to say and thats how i want to say it at last walker came in the natives surrounded him as he entered trying to get his immediate attention but he turned on them roughly and told them to sit down and hold their tongues he threatened that if they were not quiet he would have them all turned out and see none of them that day he nodded to mackintosh hulloa mac up at last i dont know how you can waste the best part of the day in bed you ought to have been up before dawn like me lazy beggar he threw himself heavily into his chair and wiped his face with a large bandana by heaven ive got a thirst he turned to the policeman who stood at the door a picturesque figure in his white jacket and lavalava the loin cloth of the samoan and told him to bring kava the kava bowl stood on the floor in the corner of the room and the policeman filled a half coconut shell and brought it to walker he poured a few drops on the ground murmured the customary words to the company and drank with relish then he told the policeman to serve the waiting natives and the shell was handed to each one in order of birth or importance and emptied with the same ceremonies then he set about the days work he was a little man considerably less than of middle height and enormously stout he had a large fleshy face cleanshaven with the cheeks hanging on each side in great dewlaps and three vast chins his small features were all dissolved in fat and but for a crescent of white hair at the back of his head he was completely bald he reminded you of mr pickwick he was grotesque a figure of fun and yet strangely enough not without dignity his blue eyes behind large goldrimmed spectacles were shrewd and vivacious and there was a great deal of determination in his face he was sixty but his native vitality triumphed over advancing years notwithstanding his corpulence his movements were quick and he walked with a heavy resolute tread as though he sought to impress his weight upon the earth he spoke in a loud gruff voice it was two years now since mackintosh had been appointed walkers assistant walker who had been for a quarter of a century administrator of talua one of the larger islands in the samoan group was a man known in person or by report through the length and breadth of the south seas and it was with lively curiosity that mackintosh looked forward to his first meeting with him for one reason or another he stayed a couple of weeks at apia before he took up his post and both at chaplins hotel and at the english club he heard innumerable stories about the administrator he thought now with irony of his interest in them since then he had heard them a hundred times from walker himself walker knew that he was a character and proud of his reputation deliberately acted up to it he was jealous of his legend and anxious that you should know the exact details of any of the celebrated stories that were told of him he was ludicrously angry with anyone who had told them to the stranger incorrectly there was a rough cordiality about walker which mackintosh at first found not unattractive and walker glad to have a listener to whom all he said was fresh gave of his best he was goodhumoured hearty and considerate to mackintosh who had lived the sheltered life of a government official in london till at the age of thirtyfour an attack of pneumonia leaving him with the threat of tuberculosis had forced him to seek a post in the pacific walkers existence seemed extraordinarily romantic the adventure with which he started on his conquest of circumstance was typical of the man he ran away to sea when he was fifteen and for over a year was employed in shovelling coal on a collier he was an undersized boy and both men and mates were kind to him but the captain for some reason conceived a savage dislike of him he used the lad cruelly so that beaten and kicked he often could not sleep for the pain that racked his limbs he loathed the captain with all his soul then he was given a tip for some race and managed to borrow twentyfive pounds from a friend he had picked up in belfast he put it on the horse an outsider at long odds he had no means of repaying the money if he lost but it never occurred to him that he could lose he felt himself in luck the horse won and he found himself with something over a thousand pounds in hard cash now his chance had come he found out who was the best solicitor in the town the collier lay then somewhere on the irish coast went to him and telling him that he heard the ship was for sale asked him to arrange the purchase for him the solicitor was amused at his small client he was only sixteen and did not look so old and moved perhaps by sympathy promised not only to arrange the matter for him but to see that he made a good bargain after a little while walker found himself the owner of the ship he went back to her and had what he described as the most glorious moment of his life when he gave the skipper notice and told him that he must get off his ship in half an hour he made the mate captain and sailed on the collier for another nine months at the end of which he sold her at a profit he came out to the islands at the age of twentysix as a planter he was one of the few white men settled in talua at the time of the german occupation and had then already some influence with the natives the germans made him administrator a position which he occupied for twenty years and when the island was seized by the british he was confirmed in his post he ruled the island despotically but with complete success the prestige of this success was another reason for the interest that mackintosh took in him but the two men were not made to get on mackintosh was an ugly man with ungainly gestures a tall thin fellow with a narrow chest and bowed shoulders he had sallow sunken cheeks and his eyes were large and sombre he was a great reader and when his books arrived and were unpacked walker came over to his quarters and looked at them then he turned to mackintosh with a coarse laugh what in hell have you brought all this muck for he asked mackintosh flushed darkly im sorry you think it muck i brought my books because i want to read them when you said youd got a lot of books coming i thought thered be something for me to read havent you got any detective stories detective stories dont interest me youre a damned fool then im content that you should think so every mail brought walker a mass of periodical literature papers from new zealand and magazines from america and it exasperated him that mackintosh showed his contempt for these ephemeral publications he had no patience with the books that absorbed mackintoshs leisure and thought it only a pose that he read gibbons decline and fall or burtons anatomy of melancholy and since he had never learned to put any restraint on his tongue he expressed his opinion of his assistant freely mackintosh began to see the real man and under the boisterous goodhumour he discerned a vulgar cunning which was hateful he was vain and domineering and it was strange that he had notwithstanding a shyness which made him dislike people who were not quite of his kidney he judged others navely by their language and if it was free from the oaths and the obscenity which made up the greater part of his own conversation he looked upon them with suspicion in the evening the two men played piquet he played badly but vaingloriously crowing over his opponent when he won and losing his temper when he lost on rare occasions a couple of planters or traders would drive over to play bridge and then walker showed himself in what mackintosh considered a characteristic light he played regardless of his partner calling up in his desire to play the hand and argued interminably beating down opposition by the loudness of his voice he constantly revoked and when he did so said with an ingratiating whine oh you wouldnt count it against an old man who can hardly see did he know that his opponents thought it as well to keep on the right side of him and hesitated to insist on the rigour of the game mackintosh watched him with an icy contempt when the game was over while they smoked their pipes and drank whisky they would begin telling stories walker told with gusto the story of his marriage he had got so drunk at the wedding feast that the bride had fled and he had never seen her since he had had numberless adventures commonplace and sordid with the women of the island and he described them with a pride in his own prowess which was an offence to mackintoshs fastidious ears he was a gross sensual old man he thought mackintosh a poor fellow because he would not share his promiscuous amours and remained sober when the company was drunk he despised him also for the orderliness with which he did his official work mackintosh liked to do everything just so his desk was always tidy his papers were always neatly docketed he could put his hand on any document that was needed and he had at his fingers ends all the regulations that were required for the business of their administration fudge fudge said walker ive run this island for twenty years without red tape and i dont want it now does it make it any easier for you that when you want a letter you have to hunt half an hour for it answered mackintosh youre nothing but a damned official but youre not a bad fellow when youve been out here a year or two youll be all right whats wrong about you is that you wont drink you wouldnt be a bad sort if you got soused once a week the curious thing was that walker remained perfectly unconscious of the dislike for him which every month increased in the breast of his subordinate although he laughed at him as he grew accustomed to him he began almost to like him he had a certain tolerance for the peculiarities of others and he accepted mackintosh as a queer fish perhaps he liked him unconsciously because he could chaff him his humour consisted of coarse banter and he wanted a butt mackintoshs exactness his morality his sobriety were all fruitful subjects his scots name gave an opportunity for the usual jokes about scotland he enjoyed himself thoroughly when two or three men were there and he could make them all laugh at the expense of mackintosh he would say ridiculous things about him to the natives and mackintosh his knowledge of samoan still imperfect would see their unrestrained mirth when walker had made an obscene reference to him he smiled goodhumouredly ill say this for you mac walker would say in his gruff loud voice you can take a joke was it a joke smiled mackintosh i didnt know scots wha hae shouted walker with a bellow of laughter theres only one way to make a scotchman see a joke and thats by a surgical operation walker little knew that there was nothing mackintosh could stand less than chaff he would wake in the night the breathless night of the rainy season and brood sullenly over the gibe that walker had uttered carelessly days before it rankled his heart swelled with rage and he pictured to himself ways in which he might get even with the bully he had tried answering him but walker had a gift of repartee coarse and obvious which gave him an advantage the dullness of his intellect made him impervious to a delicate shaft his selfsatisfaction made it impossible to wound him his loud voice his bellow of laughter were weapons against which mackintosh had nothing to counter and he learned that the wisest thing was never to betray his irritation he learned to control himself but his hatred grew till it was a monomania he watched walker with an insane vigilance he fed his own selfesteem by every instance of meanness on walkers part by every exhibition of childish vanity of cunning and of vulgarity walker ate greedily noisily filthily and mackintosh watched him with satisfaction he took note of the foolish things he said and of his mistakes in grammar he knew that walker held him in small esteem and he found a bitter satisfaction in his chiefs opinion of him it increased his own contempt for the narrow complacent old man and it gave him a singular pleasure to know that walker was entirely unconscious of the hatred he felt for him he was a fool who liked popularity and he blandly fancied that everyone admired him once mackintosh had overheard walker speaking of him hell be all right when ive licked him into shape he said hes a good dog and he loves his master mackintosh silently without a movement of his long sallow face laughed long and heartily but his hatred was not blind on the contrary it was peculiarly clearsighted and he judged walkers capabilities with precision he ruled his small kingdom with efficiency he was just and honest with opportunities to make money he was a poorer man than when he was first appointed to his post and his only support for his old age was the pension which he expected when at last he retired from official life his pride was that with an assistant and a halfcaste clerk he was able to administer the island more competently than upolu the island of which apia is the chief town was administered with its army of functionaries he had a few native policemen to sustain his authority but he made no use of them he governed by bluff and his irish humour they insisted on building a jail for me he said what the devil do i want a jail for im not going to put the natives in prison if they do wrong i know how to deal with them one of his quarrels with the higher authorities at apia was that he claimed entire jurisdiction over the natives of his island whatever their crimes he would not give them up to courts competent to deal with them and several times an angry correspondence had passed between him and the governor at upolu for he looked upon the natives as his children and that was the amazing thing about this coarse vulgar selfish man he loved the island on which he had lived so long with passion and he had for the natives a strange rough tenderness which was quite wonderful he loved to ride about the island on his old grey mare and he was never tired of its beauty sauntering along the grassy roads among the coconut trees he would stop every now and then to admire the loveliness of the scene now and then he would come upon a native village and stop while the head man brought him a bowl of kava he would look at the little group of bellshaped huts with their high thatched roofs like beehives and a smile would spread over his fat face his eyes rested happily on the spreading green of the breadfruit trees by george its like the garden of eden sometimes his rides took him along the coast and through the trees he had a glimpse of the wide sea empty with never a sail to disturb the loneliness sometimes he climbed a hill so that a great stretch of country with little villages nestling among the tall trees was spread out before him like the kingdom of the world and he would sit there for an hour in an ecstasy of delight but he had no words to express his feelings and to relieve them would utter an obscene jest it was as though his emotion was so violent that he needed vulgarity to break the tension mackintosh observed this sentiment with an icy disdain walker had always been a heavy drinker he was proud of his capacity to see men half his age under the table when he spent a night in apia and he had the sentimentality of the toper he could cry over the stories he read in his magazines and yet would refuse a loan to some trader in difficulties whom he had known for twenty years he was close with his money once mackintosh said to him no one could accuse you of giving money away he took it as a compliment his enthusiasm for nature was but the drivelling sensibility of the drunkard nor had mackintosh any sympathy for his chiefs feelings towards the natives he loved them because they were in his power as a selfish man loves his dog and his mentality was on a level with theirs their humour was obscene and he was never at a loss for the lewd remark he understood them and they understood him he was proud of his influence over them he looked upon them as his children and he mixed himself in all their affairs but he was very jealous of his authority if he ruled them with a rod of iron brooking no contradiction he would not suffer any of the white men on the island to take advantage of them he watched the missionaries suspiciously and if they did anything of which he disapproved was able to make life so unendurable to them that if he could not get them removed they were glad to go of their own accord his power over the natives was so great that on his word they would refuse labour and food to their pastor on the other hand he showed the traders no favour he took care that they should not cheat the natives he saw that they got a fair reward for their work and their copra and that the traders made no extravagant profit on the wares they sold them he was merciless to a bargain that he thought unfair sometimes the traders would complain at apia that they did not get fair opportunities they suffered for it walker then hesitated at no calumny at no outrageous lie to get even with them and they found that if they wanted not only to live at peace but to exist at all they had to accept the situation on his own terms more than once the store of a trader obnoxious to him had been burned down and there was only the appositeness of the event to show that the administrator had instigated it once a swedish halfcaste ruined by the burning had gone to him and roundly accused him of arson walker laughed in his face you dirty dog your mother was a native and you try to cheat the natives if your rotten old store is burned down its a judgment of providence thats what it is a judgment of providence get out and as the man was hustled out by two native policemen the administrator laughed fatly a judgment of providence and now mackintosh watched him enter upon the days work he began with the sick for walker added doctoring to his other activities and he had a small room behind the office full of drugs an elderly man came forward a man with a crop of curly grey hair in a blue lavalava elaborately tatooed with the skin of his body wrinkled like a wineskin what have you come for walker asked him abruptly in a whining voice the man said that he could not eat without vomiting and that he had pains here and pains there go to the missionaries said walker you know that i only cure children i have been to the missionaries and they do me no good then go home and prepare yourself to die have you lived so long and still want to go on living youre a fool the man broke into querulous expostulation but walker pointing to a woman with a sick child in her arms told her to bring it to his desk he asked her questions and looked at the child i will give you medicine he said he turned to the halfcaste clerk go into the dispensary and bring me some calomel pills he made the child swallow one there and then and gave another to the mother take the child away and keep it warm tomorrow it will be dead or better he leaned back in his chair and lit his pipe wonderful stuff calomel ive saved more lives with it than all the hospital doctors at apia put together walker was very proud of his skill and with the dogmatism of ignorance had no patience with the members of the medical profession the sort of case i like he said is the one that all the doctors have given up as hopeless when the doctors have said they cant cure you i say to them come to me did i ever tell you about the fellow who had a cancer frequently said mackintosh i got him right in three months youve never told me about the people you havent cured he finished this part of the work and went on to the rest it was a queer medley there was a woman who could not get on with her husband and a man who complained that his wife had run away from him lucky dog said walker most men wish their wives would too there was a long complicated quarrel about the ownership of a few yards of land there was a dispute about the sharing out of a catch of fish there was a complaint against a white trader because he had given short measure walker listened attentively to every case made up his mind quickly and gave his decision then he would listen to nothing more if the complainant went on he was hustled out of the office by a policeman mackintosh listened to it all with sullen irritation on the whole perhaps it might be admitted that rough justice was done but it exasperated the assistant that his chief trusted his instinct rather than the evidence he would not listen to reason he browbeat the witnesses and when they did not see what he wished them to called them thieves and liars he left to the last a group of men who were sitting in the corner of the room he had deliberately ignored them the party consisted of an old chief a tall dignified man with short white hair in a new lavalava bearing a huge fly wisp as a badge of office his son and half a dozen of the important men of the village walker had had a feud with them and had beaten them as was characteristic of him he meant now to rub in his victory and because he had them down to profit by their helplessness the facts were peculiar walker had a passion for building roads when he had come to talua there were but a few tracks here and there but in course of time he had cut roads through the country joining the villages together and it was to this that a great part of the islands prosperity was due whereas in the old days it had been impossible to get the produce of the land copra chiefly down to the coast where it could be put on schooners or motor launches and so taken to apia now transport was easy and simple his ambition was to make a road right round the island and a great part of it was already built in two years i shall have done it and then i can die or they can fire me i dont care his roads were the joy of his heart and he made excursions constantly to see that they were kept in order they were simple enough wide tracks grass covered cut through the scrub or through the plantations but trees had to be rooted out rocks dug up or blasted and here and there levelling had been necessary he was proud that he had surmounted by his own skill such difficulties as they presented he rejoiced in his disposition of them so that they were not only convenient but showed off the beauties of the island which his soul loved when he spoke of his roads he was almost a poet they meandered through those lovely scenes and walker had taken care that here and there they should run in a straight line giving you a green vista through the tall trees and here and there should turn and curve so that the heart was rested by the diversity it was amazing that this coarse and sensual man should exercise so subtle an ingenuity to get the effects which his fancy suggested to him he had used in making his roads all the fantastic skill of a japanese gardener he received a grant from headquarters for the work but took a curious pride in using but a small part of it and the year before had spent only a hundred pounds of the thousand assigned to him what do they want money for he boomed theyll only spend it on all kinds of muck they dont want what the missionaries leave them that is to say for no particular reason except perhaps pride in the economy of his administration and the desire to contrast his efficiency with the wasteful methods of the authorities at apia he got the natives to do the work he wanted for wages that were almost nominal it was owing to this that he had lately had difficulty with the village whose chief men now were come to see him the chiefs son had been in upolu for a year and on coming back had told his people of the large sums that were paid at apia for the public works in long idle talks he had inflamed their hearts with the desire for gain he held out to them visions of vast wealth and they thought of the whisky they could buy it was dear since there was a law that it must not be sold to natives and so it cost them double what the white man had to pay for it they thought of the great sandalwood boxes in which they kept their treasures and the scented soap and potted salmon the luxuries for which the kanaka will sell his soul so that when the administrator sent for them and told them he wanted a road made from their village to a certain point along the coast and offered them twenty pounds they asked him a hundred the chiefs son was called manuma he was a tall handsome fellow coppercoloured with his fuzzy hair dyed red with lime a wreath of red berries round his neck and behind his ear a flower like a scarlet flame against his brown face the upper part of his body was naked but to show that he was no longer a savage since he had lived in apia he wore a pair of dungarees instead of a lavalava he told them that if they held together the administrator would be obliged to accept their terms his heart was set on building the road and when he found they would not work for less he would give them what they asked but they must not move whatever he said they must not abate their claim they had asked a hundred and that they must keep to when they mentioned the figure walker burst into a shout of his long deepvoiced laughter he told them not to make fools of themselves but to set about the work at once because he was in a good humour that day he promised to give them a feast when the road was finished but when he found that no attempt was made to start work he went to the village and asked the men what silly game they were playing manuma had coached them well they were quite calm they did not attempt to argue and argument is a passion with the kanaka they merely shrugged their shoulders they would do it for a hundred pounds and if he would not give them that they would do no work he could please himself they did not care then walker flew into a passion he was ugly then his short fat neck swelled ominously his red face grew purple he foamed at the mouth he set upon the natives with invective he knew well how to wound and how to humiliate he was terrifying the older men grew pale and uneasy they hesitated if it had not been for manuma with his knowledge of the great world and their dread of his ridicule they would have yielded it was manuma who answered walker pay us a hundred pounds and we will work walker shaking his fist at him called him every name he could think of he riddled him with scorn manuma sat still and smiled there may have been more bravado than confidence in his smile but he had to make a good show before the others he repeated his words pay us a hundred pounds and we will work they thought that walker would spring on him it would not have been the first time that he had thrashed a native with his own hands they knew his strength and though walker was three times the age of the young man and six inches shorter they did not doubt that he was more than a match for manuma no one had ever thought of resisting the savage onslaught of the administrator but walker said nothing he chuckled i am not going to waste my time with a pack of fools he said talk it over again you know what i have offered if you do not start in a week take care he turned round and walked out of the chiefs hut he untied his old mare and it was typical of the relations between him and the natives that one of the elder men hung on to the off stirrup while walker from a convenient boulder hoisted himself heavily into the saddle that same night when walker according to his habit was strolling along the road that ran past his house he heard something whizz past him and with a thud strike a tree something had been thrown at him he ducked instinctively with a shout whos that he ran towards the place from which the missile had come and he heard the sound of a man escaping through the bush he knew it was hopeless to pursue in the darkness and besides he was soon out of breath so he stopped and made his way back to the road he looked about for what had been thrown but could find nothing it was quite dark he went quickly back to the house and called mackintosh and the chinese boy one of those devils has thrown something at me come along and lets find out what it was he told the boy to bring a lantern and the three of them made their way back to the place they hunted about the ground but could not find what they sought suddenly the boy gave a guttural cry they turned to look he held up the lantern and there sinister in the light that cut the surrounding darkness was a long knife sticking into the trunk of a coconut tree it had been thrown with such force that it required quite an effort to pull it out by george if he hadnt missed me id have been in a nice state walker handled the knife it was one of those knives made in imitation of the sailor knives brought to the islands a hundred years before by the first white men used to divide the coconuts in two so that the copra might be dried it was a murderous weapon and the blade twelve inches long was very sharp walker chuckled softly the devil the impudent devil he had no doubt it was manuma who had flung the knife he had escaped death by three inches he was not angry on the contrary he was in high spirits the adventure exhilarated him and when they got back to the house calling for drinks he rubbed his hands gleefully ill make them pay for this his little eyes twinkled he blew himself out like a turkeycock and for the second time within half an hour insisted on telling mackintosh every detail of the affair then he asked him to play piquet and while they played he boasted of his intentions mackintosh listened with tightened lips but why should you grind them down like this he asked twenty pounds is precious little for the work you want them to do they ought to be precious thankful i give them anything hang it all its not your own money the government allots you a reasonable sum they wont complain if you spend it theyre a bunch of fools at apia mackintosh saw that walkers motive was merely vanity he shrugged his shoulders it wont do you much good to score off the fellows at apia at the cost of your life bless you they wouldnt hurt me these people they couldnt do without me they worship me manuma is a fool he only threw that knife to frighten me the next day walker rode over again to the village it was called matautu he did not get off his horse when he reached the chiefs house he saw that the men were sitting round the floor in a circle talking and he guessed they were discussing again the question of the road the samoan huts are formed in this way trunks of slender trees are placed in a circle at intervals of perhaps five or six feet a tall tree is set in the middle and from this downwards slopes the thatched roof venetian blinds of coconut leaves can be pulled down at night or when it is raining ordinarily the hut is open all round so that the breeze can blow through freely walker rode to the edge of the hut and called out to the chief oh there tangatu your son left his knife in a tree last night i have brought it back to you he flung it down on the ground in the midst of the circle and with a low burst of laughter ambled off on monday he went out to see if they had started work there was no sign of it he rode through the village the inhabitants were about their ordinary avocations some were weaving mats of the pandanus leaf one old man was busy with a kava bowl the children were playing the women went about their household chores walker a smile on his lips came to the chiefs house talofali said the chief talofa answered walker manuma was making a net he sat with a cigarette between his lips and looked up at walker with a smile of triumph you have decided that you will not make the road the chief answered not unless you pay us one hundred pounds you will regret it he turned to manuma and you my lad i shouldnt wonder if your back was very sore before youre much older he rode away chuckling he left the natives vaguely uneasy they feared the fat sinful old man and neither the missionaries abuse of him nor the scorn which manuma had learnt in apia made them forget that he had a devilish cunning and that no man had ever braved him without in the long run suffering for it they found out within twentyfour hours what scheme he had devised it was characteristic for next morning a great band of men women and children came into the village and the chief men said that they had made a bargain with walker to build the road he had offered them twenty pounds and they had accepted now the cunning lay in this that the polynesians have rules of hospitality which have all the force of laws an etiquette of absolute rigidity made it necessary for the people of the village not only to give lodging to the strangers but to provide them with food and drink as long as they wished to stay the inhabitants of matautu were outwitted every morning the workers went out in a joyous band cut down trees blasted rocks levelled here and there and then in the evening tramped back again and ate and drank ate heartily danced sang hymns and enjoyed life for them it was a picnic but soon their hosts began to wear long faces the strangers had enormous appetites and the plantains and the breadfruit vanished before their rapacity the alligatorpear trees whose fruit sent to apia might sell for good money were stripped bare ruin stared them in the face and then they found that the strangers were working very slowly had they received a hint from walker that they might take their time at this rate by the time the road was finished there would not be a scrap of food in the village and worse than this they were a laughingstock when one or other of them went to some distant hamlet on an errand he found that the story had got there before him and he was met with derisive laughter there is nothing the kanaka can endure less than ridicule it was not long before much angry talk passed among the sufferers manuma was no longer a hero he had to put up with a good deal of plain speaking and one day what walker had suggested came to pass a heated argument turned into a quarrel and half a dozen of the young men set upon the chiefs son and gave him such a beating that for a week he lay bruised and sore on the pandanus mats he turned from side to side and could find no ease every day or two the administrator rode over on his old mare and watched the progress of the road he was not a man to resist the temptation of taunting the fallen foe and he missed no opportunity to rub into the shamed inhabitants of matautu the bitterness of their humiliation he broke their spirit and one morning putting their pride in their pockets a figure of speech since pockets they had not they all set out with the strangers and started working on the road it was urgent to get it done quickly if they wanted to save any food at all and the whole village joined in but they worked silently with rage and mortification in their hearts and even the children toiled in silence the women wept as they carried away bundles of brushwood when walker saw them he laughed so much that he almost rolled out of his saddle the news spread quickly and tickled the people of the island to death this was the greatest joke of all the crowning triumph of that cunning old white man whom no kanaka had ever been able to circumvent and they came from distant villages with their wives and children to look at the foolish folk who had refused twenty pounds to make the road and now were forced to work for nothing but the harder they worked the more easily went the guests why should they hurry when they were getting good food for nothing and the longer they took about the job the better the joke became at last the wretched villagers could stand it no longer and they were come this morning to beg the administrator to send the strangers back to their own homes if he would do this they promised to finish the road themselves for nothing for him it was a victory complete and unqualified they were humbled a look of arrogant complacence spread over his large naked face and he seemed to swell in his chair like a great bullfrog there was something sinister in his appearance so that mackintosh shivered with disgust then in his booming tones he began to speak is it for my good that i make the road what benefit do you think i get out of it it is for you so that you can walk in comfort and carry your copra in comfort i offered to pay you for your work though it was for your own sake the work was done i offered to pay you generously now you must pay i will send the people of manua back to their homes if you will finish the road and pay the twenty pounds that i have to pay them there was an outcry they sought to reason with him they told him they had not the money but to everything they said he replied with brutal gibes then the clock struck dinner time he said turn them all out he raised himself heavily from his chair and walked out of the room when mackintosh followed him he found him already seated at table a napkin tied round his neck holding his knife and fork in readiness for the meal the chinese cook was about to bring he was in high spirits i did em down fine he said as mackintosh sat down i shant have much trouble with the roads after this i suppose you were joking said mackintosh icily what do you mean by that youre not really going to make them pay twenty pounds you bet your life i am im not sure youve got any right to aint you i guess ive got the right to do any damned thing i like on this island i think youve bullied them quite enough walker laughed fatly he did not care what mackintosh thought when i want your opinion ill ask for it mackintosh grew very white he knew by bitter experience that he could do nothing but keep silence and the violent effort at selfcontrol made him sick and faint he could not eat the food that was before him and with disgust he watched walker shovel meat into his vast mouth he was a dirty feeder and to sit at table with him needed a strong stomach mackintosh shuddered a tremendous desire seized him to humiliate that gross and cruel man he would give anything in the world to see him in the dust suffering as much as he had made others suffer he had never loathed the bully with such loathing as now the day wore on mackintosh tried to sleep after dinner but the passion in his heart prevented him he tried to read but the letters swam before his eyes the sun beat down pitilessly and he longed for rain but he knew that rain would bring no coolness it would only make it hotter and more steamy he was a native of aberdeen and his heart yearned suddenly for the icy winds that whistled through the granite streets of that city here he was a prisoner imprisoned not only by that placid sea but by his hatred for that horrible old man he pressed his hands to his aching head he would like to kill him but he pulled himself together he must do something to distract his mind and since he could not read he thought he would set his private papers in order it was a job which he had long meant to do and which he had constantly put off he unlocked the drawer of his desk and took out a handful of letters he caught sight of his revolver an impulse no sooner realised than set aside to put a bullet through his head and so escape from the intolerable bondage of life flashed through his mind he noticed that in the damp air the revolver was slightly rusted and he got an oil rag and began to clean it it was while he was thus occupied that he grew aware of someone slinking round the door he looked up and called who is there there was a moments pause then manuma showed himself what do you want the chiefs son stood for a moment sullen and silent and when he spoke it was with a strangled voice we cant pay twenty pounds we havent the money what am i to do said mackintosh you heard what mr walker said manuma began to plead half in samoan and half in english it was a singsong whine with the quavering intonations of a beggar and it filled mackintosh with disgust it outraged him that the man should let himself be so crushed he was a pitiful object i can do nothing said mackintosh irritably you know that mr walker is master here manuma was silent again he still stood in the doorway i am sick he said at last give me some medicine what is the matter with you i do not know i am sick i have pains in my body dont stand there said mackintosh sharply come in and let me look at you manuma entered the little room and stood before the desk i have pains here and here he put his hands to his loins and his face assumed an expression of pain suddenly mackintosh grew conscious that the boys eyes were resting on the revolver which he had laid on the desk when manuma appeared in the doorway there was a silence between the two which to mackintosh was endless he seemed to read the thoughts which were in the kanakas mind his heart beat violently and then he felt as though something possessed him so that he acted under the compulsion of a foreign will himself did not make the movements of his body but a power that was strange to him his throat was suddenly dry and he put his hand to it mechanically in order to help his speech he was impelled to avoid manumas eyes just wait here he said his voice sounded as though someone had seized him by the windpipe and ill fetch you something from the dispensary he got up was it his fancy that he staggered a little manuma stood silently and though he kept his eyes averted mackintosh knew that he was looking dully out of the door it was this other person that possessed him that drove him out of the room but it was himself that took a handful of muddled papers and threw them on the revolver in order to hide it from view he went to the dispensary he got a pill and poured out some blue draught into a small bottle and then came out into the compound he did not want to go back into his own bungalow so he called to manuma come here he gave him the drugs and instructions how to take them he did not know what it was that made it impossible for him to look at the kanaka while he was speaking to him he kept his eyes on his shoulder manuma took the medicine and slunk out of the gate mackintosh went into the diningroom and turned over once more the old newspapers but he could not read them the house was very still walker was upstairs in his room asleep the chinese cook was busy in the kitchen the two policemen were out fishing the silence that seemed to brood over the house was unearthly and there hammered in mackintoshs head the question whether the revolver still lay where he had placed it he could not bring himself to look the uncertainty was horrible but the certainty would be more horrible still he sweated at last he could stand the silence no longer and he made up his mind to go down the road to the traders a man named jervis who had a store about a mile away he was a halfcaste but even that amount of white blood made him possible to talk to he wanted to get away from his bungalow with the desk littered with untidy papers and underneath them something or nothing he walked along the road as he passed the fine hut of a chief a greeting was called out to him then he came to the store behind the counter sat the traders daughter a swarthy broadfeatured girl in a pink blouse and a white drill skirt jervis hoped he would marry her he had money and he had told mackintosh that his daughters husband would be welltodo she flushed a little when she saw mackintosh fathers just unpacking some cases that have come in this morning ill tell him youre here he sat down and the girl went out behind the shop in a moment her mother waddled in a huge old woman a chiefess who owned much land in her own right and gave him her hand her monstrous obesity was an offence but she managed to convey an impression of dignity she was cordial without obsequiousness affable but conscious of her station youre quite a stranger mr mackintosh teresa was saying only this morning why we never see mr mackintosh now he shuddered a little as he thought of himself as that old natives soninlaw it was notorious that she ruled her husband notwithstanding his white blood with a firm hand hers was the authority and hers the business head she might be no more than mrs jervis to the white people but her father had been a chief of the blood royal and his father and his fathers father had ruled as kings the trader came in small beside his imposing wife a dark man with a black beard going grey in ducks with handsome eyes and flashing teeth he was very british and his conversation was slangy but you felt he spoke english as a foreign tongue with his family he used the language of his native mother he was a servile man cringing and obsequious ah mr mackintosh this is a joyful surprise get the whisky teresa mr mackintosh will have a gargle with us he gave all the latest news of apia watching his guests eyes the while so that he might know the welcome thing to say and how is walker weve not seen him just lately mrs jervis is going to send him a suckingpig one day this week i saw him riding home this morning said teresa heres how said jervis holding up his whisky mackintosh drank the two women sat and looked at him mrs jervis in her black mother hubbard placid and haughty and teresa anxious to smile whenever she caught his eye while the trader gossiped insufferably they were saying in apia it was about time walker retired he aint so young as he was things have changed since he first come to the islands and he aint changed with them hell go too far said the old chiefess the natives arent satisfied that was a good joke about the road laughed the trader when i told them about it in apia they fair split their sides with laughing good old walker mackintosh looked at him savagely what did he mean by talking of him in that fashion to a halfcaste trader he was mr walker it was on his tongue to utter a harsh rebuke for the impertinence he did not know what held him back when he goes i hope youll take his place mr mackintosh said jervis we all like you on the island you understand the natives theyre educated now they must be treated differently to the old days it wants an educated man to be administrator now walker was only a trader same as i am teresas eyes glistened when the time comes if theres anything anyone can do here you bet your bottom dollar well do it id get all the chiefs to go over to apia and make a petition mackintosh felt horribly sick it had not struck him that if anything happened to walker it might be he who would succeed him it was true that no one in his official position knew the island so well he got up suddenly and scarcely taking his leave walked back to the compound and now he went straight to his room he took a quick look at his desk he rummaged among the papers the revolver was not there his heart thumped violently against his ribs he looked for the revolver everywhere he hunted in the chairs and in the drawers he looked desperately and all the time he knew he would not find it suddenly he heard walkers gruff hearty voice what the devil are you up to mac he started walker was standing in the doorway and instinctively he turned round to hide what lay upon his desk tidying up quizzed walker ive told em to put the grey in the trap im going down to tafoni to bathe youd better come along all right said mackintosh so long as he was with walker nothing could happen the place they were bound for was about three miles away and there was a freshwater pool separated by a thin barrier of rock from the sea which the administrator had blasted out for the natives to bathe in he had done this at spots round the island wherever there was a spring and the fresh water compared with the sticky warmth of the sea was cool and invigorating they drove along the silent grassy road splashing now and then through fords where the sea had forced its way in past a couple of native villages the bellshaped huts spaced out roomily and the white chapel in the middle and at the third village they got out of the trap tied up the horse and walked down to the pool they were accompanied by four or five girls and a dozen children soon they were all splashing about shouting and laughing while walker in a lavalava swam to and fro like an unwieldy porpoise he made lewd jokes with the girls and they amused themselves by diving under him and wriggling away when he tried to catch them when he was tired he lay down on a rock while the girls and children surrounded him it was a happy family and the old man huge with his crescent of white hair and his shining bald crown looked like some old sea god once mackintosh caught a queer soft look in his eyes theyre dear children he said they look upon me as their father and then without a pause he turned to one of the girls and made an obscene remark which sent them all into fits of laughter mackintosh started to dress with his thin legs and thin arms he made a grotesque figure a sinister don quixote and walker began to make coarse jokes about him they were acknowledged with little smothered laughs mackintosh struggled with his shirt he knew he looked absurd but he hated being laughed at he stood silent and glowering if you want to get back in time for dinner you ought to come soon youre not a bad fellow mac only youre a fool when youre doing one thing you always want to do another thats not the way to live but all the same he raised himself slowly to his feet and began to put on his clothes they sauntered back to the village drank a bowl of kava with the chief and then after a joyful farewell from all the lazy villagers drove home after dinner according to his habit walker lighting his cigar prepared to go for a stroll mackintosh was suddenly seized with fear dont you think its rather unwise to go out at night by yourself just now walker stared at him with his round blue eyes what the devil do you mean remember the knife the other night youve got those fellows backs up pooh they wouldnt dare someone dared before that was only a bluff they wouldnt hurt me they look upon me as a father they know that whatever i do is for their own good mackintosh watched him with contempt in his heart the mans selfcomplacency outraged him and yet something he knew not what made him insist remember what happened this morning it wouldnt hurt you to stay at home just tonight ill play piquet with you ill play piquet with you when i come back the kanaka isnt born yet who can make me alter my plans youd better let me come with you you stay where you are mackintosh shrugged his shoulders he had given the man full warning if he did not heed it that was his own lookout walker put on his hat and went out mackintosh began to read but then he thought of something perhaps it would be as well to have his own whereabouts quite clear he crossed over to the kitchen and inventing some pretext talked for a few minutes with the cook then he got out the gramophone and put a record on it but while it ground out its melancholy tune some comic song of a london musichall his ear was strained for a sound away there in the night at his elbow the record reeled out its loudness the words were raucous but notwithstanding he seemed to be surrounded by an unearthly silence he heard the dull roar of the breakers against the reef he heard the breeze sigh far up in the leaves of the coconut trees how long would it be it was awful he heard a hoarse laugh wonders will never cease its not often you play yourself a tune mac walker stood at the window redfaced bluff and jovial well you see im alive and kicking what were you playing for walker came in nerves a bit dicky eh playing a tune to keep your pecker up i was playing your requiem what the devils that alf o bitter an a pint of stout a rattling good song too i dont mind how often i hear it now im ready to take your money off you at piquet they played and walker bullied his way to victory bluffing his opponent chaffing him jeering at his mistakes up to every dodge browbeating him exulting presently mackintosh recovered his coolness and standing outside himself as it were he was able to take a detached pleasure in watching the overbearing old man and in his own cold reserve somewhere manuma sat quietly and awaited his opportunity walker won game after game and pocketed his winnings at the end of the evening in high good humour youll have to grow a little bit older before you stand much chance against me mac the fact is i have a natural gift for cards i dont know that theres much gift about it when i happen to deal you fourteen aces good cards come to good players retorted walker id have won if id had your hands he went on to tell long stories of the various occasions on which he had played cards with notorious sharpers and to their consternation had taken all their money from them he boasted he praised himself and mackintosh listened with absorption he wanted now to feed his hatred and everything walker said every gesture made him more detestable at last walker got up well im going to turn in he said with a loud yawn ive got a long day tomorrow what are you going to do im driving over to the other side of the island ill start at five but i dont expect i shall get back to dinner till late they generally dined at seven wed better make it half past seven then i guess it would be as well mackintosh watched him knock the ashes out of his pipe his vitality was rude and exuberant it was strange to think that death hung over him a faint smile flickered in mackintoshs cold gloomy eyes would you like me to come with you what in gods name should i want that for im using the mare and shell have enough to do to carry me she dont want to drag you over thirty miles of road perhaps you dont quite realise what the feeling is at matautu i think it would be safer if i came with you walker burst into contemptuous laughter youd be a fine lot of use in a scrap im not a great hand at getting the wind up now the smile passed from mackintoshs eyes to his lips it distorted them painfully quem deus vult perdere prius dementat what the hell is that said walker latin answered mackintosh as he went out and now he chuckled his mood had changed he had done all he could and the matter was in the hands of fate he slept more soundly than he had done for weeks when he awoke next morning he went out after a good night he found a pleasant exhilaration in the freshness of the early air the sea was a more vivid blue the sky more brilliant than on most days the trade wind was fresh and there was a ripple on the lagoon as the breeze brushed over it like velvet brushed the wrong way he felt himself stronger and younger he entered upon the days work with zest after luncheon he slept again and as evening drew on he had the bay saddled and sauntered through the bush he seemed to see it all with new eyes he felt more normal the extraordinary thing was that he was able to put walker out of his mind altogether so far as he was concerned he might never have existed he returned late hot after his ride and bathed again then he sat on the verandah smoking his pipe and looked at the day declining over the lagoon in the sunset the lagoon rosy and purple and green was very beautiful he felt at peace with the world and with himself when the cook came out to say that dinner was ready and to ask whether he should wait mackintosh smiled at him with friendly eyes he looked at his watch its halfpast seven better not wait one cant tell when the bossll be back the boy nodded and in a moment mackintosh saw him carry across the yard a bowl of steaming soup he got up lazily went into the diningroom and ate his dinner had it happened the uncertainty was amusing and mackintosh chuckled in the silence the food did not seem so monotonous as usual and even though there was hamburger steak the cooks invariable dish when his poor invention failed him it tasted by some miracle succulent and spiced after dinner he strolled over lazily to his bungalow to get a book he liked the intense stillness and now that the night had fallen the stars were blazing in the sky he shouted for a lamp and in a moment the chink pattered over on his bare feet piercing the darkness with a ray of light he put the lamp on the desk and noiselessly slipped out of the room mackintosh stood rooted to the floor for there half hidden by untidy papers was his revolver his heart throbbed painfully and he broke into a sweat it was done then he took up the revolver with a shaking hand four of the chambers were empty he paused a moment and looked suspiciously out into the night but there was no one there he quickly slipped four cartridges into the empty chambers and locked the revolver in his drawer he sat down to wait an hour passed a second hour passed there was nothing he sat at his desk as though he were writing but he neither wrote nor read he merely listened he strained his ears for a sound travelling from a far distance at last he heard hesitating footsteps and knew it was the chinese cook ahsung he called the boy came to the door boss velly late he said dinner no good mackintosh stared at him wondering whether he knew what had happened and whether when he knew he would realise on what terms he and walker had been he went about his work sleek silent and smiling and who could tell his thoughts i expect hes had dinner on the way but you must keep the soup hot at all events the words were hardly out of his mouth when the silence was suddenly broken into by a confusion cries and a rapid patter of naked feet a number of natives ran into the compound men and women and children they crowded round mackintosh and they all talked at once they were unintelligible they were excited and frightened and some of them were crying mackintosh pushed his way through them and went to the gateway though he had scarcely understood what they said he knew quite well what had happened and as he reached the gate the dogcart arrived the old mare was being led by a tall kanaka and in the dogcart crouched two men trying to hold walker up a little crowd of natives surrounded it the mare was led into the yard and the natives surged in after it mackintosh shouted to them to stand back and the two policemen sprang suddenly from god knows where pushed them violently aside by now he had managed to understand that some lads who had been fishing on their way back to their village had come across the cart on the home side of the ford the mare was nuzzling about the herbage and in the darkness they could just see the great white bulk of the old man sunk between the seat and the dashboard at first they thought he was drunk and they peered in grinning but then they heard him groan and guessed that something was amiss they ran to the village and called for help it was when they returned accompanied by half a hundred people that they discovered walker had been shot with a sudden thrill of horror mackintosh asked himself whether he was already dead the first thing at all events was to get him out of the cart and that owing to walkers corpulence was a difficult job it took four strong men to lift him they jolted him and he uttered a dull groan he was still alive at last they carried him into the house up the stairs and placed him on his bed then mackintosh was able to see him for in the yard lit only by half a dozen hurricane lamps everything had been obscured walkers white ducks were stained with blood and the men who had carried him wiped their hands red and sticky on their lavalavas mackintosh held up the lamp he had not expected the old man to be so pale his eyes were closed he was breathing still his pulse could be just felt but it was obvious that he was dying mackintosh had not bargained for the shock of horror that convulsed him he saw that the native clerk was there and in a voice hoarse with fear told him to go into the dispensary and get what was necessary for a hypodermic injection one of the policemen had brought up the whisky and mackintosh forced a little into the old mans mouth the room was crowded with natives they sat about the floor speechless now and terrified and every now and then one wailed aloud it was very hot but mackintosh felt cold his hands and his feet were like ice and he had to make a violent effort not to tremble in all his limbs he did not know what to do he did not know if walker was bleeding still and if he was how he could stop the bleeding the clerk brought the hypodermic needle you give it to him said mackintosh youre more used to that sort of thing than i am his head ached horribly it felt as though all sorts of little savage things were beating inside it trying to get out they watched for the effect of the injection presently walker opened his eyes slowly he did not seem to know where he was keep quiet said mackintosh youre at home youre quite safe walkers lips outlined a shadowy smile theyve got me he whispered ill get jervis to send his motorboat to apia at once well get a doctor out by tomorrow afternoon there was a long pause before the old man answered i shall be dead by then a ghastly expression passed over mackintoshs pale face he forced himself to laugh what rot you keep quiet and youll be as right as rain give me a drink said walker a stiff one with shaking hand mackintosh poured out whisky and water half and half and held the glass while walker drank greedily it seemed to restore him he gave a long sigh and a little colour came into his great fleshy face mackintosh felt extraordinarily helpless he stood and stared at the old man if youll tell me what to do ill do it he said theres nothing to do just leave me alone im done for he looked dreadfully pitiful as he lay on the great bed a huge bloated old man but so wan so weak it was heartrending as he rested his mind seemed to grow clearer you were right mac he said presently you warned me i wish to god id come with you youre a good chap mac only you dont drink there was another long silence and it was clear that walker was sinking there was an internal hmorrhage and even mackintosh in his ignorance could not fail to see that his chief had but an hour or two to live he stood by the side of the bed stock still for half an hour perhaps walker lay with his eyes closed then he opened them theyll give you my job he said slowly last time i was in apia i told them you were all right finish my road i want to think thatll be done all round the island i dont want your job youll get all right walker shook his head wearily ive had my day treat them fairly thats the great thing theyre children you must always remember that you must be firm with them but you must be kind and you must be just ive never made a bob out of them i havent saved a hundred pounds in twenty years the roads the great thing get the road finished something very like a sob was wrung from mackintosh youre a good fellow mac i always liked you he closed his eyes and mackintosh thought that he would never open them again his mouth was so dry that he had to get himself something to drink the chinese cook silently put a chair for him he sat down by the side of the bed and waited he did not know how long a time passed the night was endless suddenly one of the men sitting there broke into uncontrollable sobbing loudly like a child and mackintosh grew aware that the room was crowded by this time with natives they sat all over the floor on their haunches men and women staring at the bed what are all these people doing here said mackintosh theyve got no right turn them out turn them out all of them his words seemed to rouse walker for he opened his eyes once more and now they were all misty he wanted to speak but he was so weak that mackintosh had to strain his ears to catch what he said let them stay theyre my children they ought to be here mackintosh turned to the natives stay where you are he wants you but be silent a faint smile came over the old mans white face come nearer he said mackintosh bent over him his eyes were closed and the words he said were like a wind sighing through the fronds of the coconut trees give me another drink ive got something to say this time mackintosh gave him his whisky neat walker collected his strength in a final effort of will dont make a fuss about this in ninetyfive when there were troubles white men were killed and the fleet came and shelled the villages a lot of people were killed whod had nothing to do with it theyre damned fools at apia if they make a fuss theyll only punish the wrong people i dont want anyone punished he paused for a while to rest you must say it was an accident no ones to blame promise me that ill do anything you like whispered mackintosh good chap one of the best theyre children im their father a father dont let his children get into trouble if he can help it a ghost of a chuckle came out of his throat it was astonishingly weird and ghastly youre a religious chap mac whats that about forgiving them you know for a while mackintosh did not answer his lips trembled forgive them for they know not what they do thats right forgive them ive loved them you know always loved them he sighed his lips faintly moved and now mackintosh had to put his ears quite close to them in order to hear hold my hand he said mackintosh gave a gasp his heart seemed wrenched he took the old mans hand so cold and weak a coarse rough hand and held it in his own and thus he sat until he nearly started out of his seat for the silence was suddenly broken by a long rattle it was terrible and unearthly walker was dead then the natives broke out with loud cries the tears ran down their faces and they beat their breasts mackintosh disengaged his hand from the dead mans and staggering like one drunk with sleep he went out of the room he went to the locked drawer in his writingdesk and took out the revolver he walked down to the sea and walked into the lagoon he waded out cautiously so that he should not trip against a coral rock till the water came to his armpits then he put a bullet through his head an hour later half a dozen slim brown sharks were splashing and struggling at the spot where he fell iii the fall of edward barnard bateman hunter slept badly for a fortnight on the boat that brought him from tahiti to san francisco he had been thinking of the story he had to tell and for three days on the train he had repeated to himself the words in which he meant to tell it but in a few hours now he would be in chicago and doubts assailed him his conscience always very sensitive was not at ease he was uncertain that he had done all that was possible it was on his honour to do much more than the possible and the thought was disturbing that in a matter which so nearly touched his own interest he had allowed his interest to prevail over his quixotry selfsacrifice appealed so keenly to his imagination that the inability to exercise it gave him a sense of disillusion he was like the philanthropist who with altruistic motives builds model dwellings for the poor and finds that he has made a lucrative investment he cannot prevent the satisfaction he feels in the ten per cent which rewards the bread he had cast upon the waters but he has an awkward feeling that it detracts somewhat from the savour of his virtue bateman hunter knew that his heart was pure but he was not quite sure how steadfastly when he told her his story he would endure the scrutiny of isabel longstaffes cool grey eyes they were farseeing and wise she measured the standards of others by her own meticulous uprightness and there could be no greater censure than the cold silence with which she expressed her disapproval of a conduct that did not satisfy her exacting code there was no appeal from her judgment for having made up her mind she never changed it but bateman would not have had her different he loved not only the beauty of her person slim and straight with the proud carriage of her head but still more the beauty of her soul with her truthfulness her rigid sense of honour her fearless outlook she seemed to him to collect in herself all that was most admirable in his countrywomen but he saw in her something more than the perfect type of the american girl he felt that her exquisiteness was peculiar in a way to her environment and he was assured that no city in the world could have produced her but chicago a pang seized him when he remembered that he must deal so bitter a blow to her pride and anger flamed up in his heart when he thought of edward barnard but at last the train steamed in to chicago and he exulted when he saw the long streets of grey houses he could hardly bear his impatience at the thought of state and wabash with their crowded pavements their hustling traffic and their noise he was at home and he was glad that he had been born in the most important city in the united states san francisco was provincial new york was effete the future of america lay in the development of its economic possibilities and chicago by its position and by the energy of its citizens was destined to become the real capital of the country i guess i shall live long enough to see it the biggest city in the world bateman said to himself as he stepped down to the platform his father had come to meet him and after a hearty handshake the pair of them tall slender and wellmade with the same fine ascetic features and thin lips walked out of the station mr hunters automobile was waiting for them and they got in mr hunter caught his sons proud and happy glance as he looked at the street glad to be back son he asked i should just think i was said bateman his eyes devoured the restless scene i guess theres a bit more traffic here than in your south sea island laughed mr hunter did you like it there give me chicago dad answered bateman you havent brought edward barnard back with you no how was he bateman was silent for a moment and his handsome sensitive face darkened id sooner not speak about him dad he said at last thats all right my son i guess your mother will be a happy woman today they passed out of the crowded streets in the loop and drove along the lake till they came to the imposing house an exact copy of a chteau on the loire which mr hunter had built himself some years before as soon as bateman was alone in his room he asked for a number on the telephone his heart leaped when he heard the voice that answered him goodmorning isabel he said gaily goodmorning bateman how did you recognise my voice it is not so long since i heard it last besides i was expecting you when may i see you unless you have anything better to do perhaps youll dine with us tonight you know very well that i couldnt possibly have anything better to do i suppose that youre full of news he thought he detected in her voice a note of apprehension yes he answered well you must tell me tonight goodbye she rang off it was characteristic of her that she should be able to wait so many unnecessary hours to know what so immensely concerned her to bateman there was an admirable fortitude in her restraint at dinner at which beside himself and isabel no one was present but her father and mother he watched her guide the conversation into the channels of an urbane smalltalk and it occurred to him that in just such a manner would a marquise under the shadow of the guillotine toy with the affairs of a day that would know no morrow her delicate features the aristocratic shortness of her upper lip and her wealth of fair hair suggested the marquise again and it must have been obvious even if it were not notorious that in her veins flowed the best blood in chicago the diningroom was a fitting frame to her fragile beauty for isabel had caused the house a replica of a palace on the grand canal at venice to be furnished by an english expert in the style of louis xv and the graceful decoration linked with the name of that amorous monarch enhanced her loveliness and at the same time acquired from it a more profound significance for isabels mind was richly stored and her conversation however light was never flippant she spoke now of the musicale to which she and her mother had been in the afternoon of the lectures which an english poet was giving at the auditorium of the political situation and of the old master which her father had recently bought for fifty thousand dollars in new york it comforted bateman to hear her he felt that he was once more in the civilised world at the centre of culture and distinction and certain voices troubling and yet against his will refusing to still their clamour were at last silent in his heart gee but its good to be back in chicago he said at last dinner was over and when they went out of the diningroom isabel said to her mother im going to take bateman along to my den we have various things to talk about very well my dear said mrs longstaffe youll find your father and me in the madame du barry room when youre through isabel led the young man upstairs and showed him into the room of which he had so many charming memories though he knew it so well he could not repress the exclamation of delight which it always wrung from him she looked round with a smile i think its a success she said the main thing is that its right theres not even an ashtray that isnt of the period i suppose thats what makes it so wonderful like all you do its so superlatively right they sat down in front of a log fire and isabel looked at him with calm grave eyes now what have you to say to me she asked i hardly know how to begin is edward barnard coming back no there was a long silence before bateman spoke again and with each of them it was filled with many thoughts it was a difficult story he had to tell for there were things in it which were so offensive to her sensitive ears that he could not bear to tell them and yet in justice to her no less than in justice to himself he must tell her the whole truth it had all begun long ago when he and edward barnard still at college had met isabel longstaffe at the teaparty given to introduce her to society they had both known her when she was a child and they longlegged boys but for two years she had been in europe to finish her education and it was with a surprised delight that they renewed acquaintance with the lovely girl who returned both of them fell desperately in love with her but bateman saw quickly that she had eyes only for edward and devoted to his friend he resigned himself to the role of confidant he passed bitter moments but he could not deny that edward was worthy of his good fortune and anxious that nothing should impair the friendship he so greatly valued he took care never by a hint to disclose his own feelings in six months the young couple were engaged but they were very young and isabels father decided that they should not marry at least till edward graduated they had to wait a year bateman remembered the winter at the end of which isabel and edward were to be married a winter of dances and theatreparties and of informal gaieties at which he the constant third was always present he loved her no less because she would shortly be his friends wife her smile a gay word she flung him the confidence of her affection never ceased to delight him and he congratulated himself somewhat complacently because he did not envy them their happiness then an accident happened a great bank failed there was a panic on the exchange and edward barnards father found himself a ruined man he came home one night told his wife that he was penniless and after dinner going into his study shot himself a week later edward barnard with a tired white face went to isabel and asked her to release him her only answer was to throw her arms round his neck and burst into tears dont make it harder for me sweet he said do you think i can let you go now i love you how can i ask you to marry me the whole things hopeless your father would never let you i havent a cent what do i care i love you he told her his plans he had to earn money at once and george braunschmidt an old friend of his family had offered to take him into his own business he was a south sea merchant and he had agencies in many of the islands of the pacific he had suggested that edward should go to tahiti for a year or two where under the best of his managers he could learn the details of that varied trade and at the end of that time he promised the young man a position in chicago it was a wonderful opportunity and when he had finished his explanations isabel was once more all smiles you foolish boy why have you been trying to make me miserable his face lit up at her words and his eyes flashed isabel you dont mean to say youll wait for me dont you think youre worth it she smiled ah dont laugh at me now i beseech you to be serious it may be for two years have no fear i love you edward when you come back i will marry you edwards employer was a man who did not like delay and he had told him that if he took the post he offered he must sail that day week from san francisco edward spent his last evening with isabel it was after dinner that mr longstaffe saying he wanted a word with edward took him into the smokingroom mr longstaffe had accepted goodnaturedly the arrangement which his daughter had told him of and edward could not imagine what mysterious communication he had now to make he was not a little perplexed to see that his host was embarrassed he faltered he talked of trivial things at last he blurted it out i guess youve heard of arnold jackson he said looking at edward with a frown edward hesitated his natural truthfulness obliged him to admit a knowledge he would gladly have been able to deny yes i have but its a long time ago i guess i didnt pay very much attention there are not many people in chicago who havent heard of arnold jackson said mr longstaffe bitterly and if there are theyll have no difficulty in finding someone wholl be glad to tell them did you know he was mrs longstaffes brother yes i knew that of course weve had no communication with him for many years he left the country as soon as he was able to and i guess the country wasnt sorry to see the last of him we understand he lives in tahiti my advice to you is to give him a wide berth but if you do hear anything about him mrs longstaffe and i would be very glad if youd let us know sure that was all i wanted to say to you now i daresay youd like to join the ladies there are few families that have not among their members one whom if their neighbours permitted they would willingly forget and they are fortunate when the lapse of a generation or two has invested his vagaries with a romantic glamour but when he is actually alive if his peculiarities are not of the kind that can be condoned by the phrase he is nobodys enemy but his own a safe one when the culprit has no worse to answer for than alcoholism or wandering affections the only possible course is silence and it was this which the longstaffes had adopted towards arnold jackson they never talked of him they would not even pass through the street in which he had lived too kind to make his wife and children suffer for his misdeeds they had supported them for years but on the understanding that they should live in europe they did everything they could to blot out all recollection of arnold jackson and yet were conscious that the story was as fresh in the public mind as when first the scandal burst upon a gaping world arnold jackson was as black a sheep as any family could suffer from a wealthy banker prominent in his church a philanthropist a man respected by all not only for his connections in his veins ran the blue blood of chicago but also for his upright character he was arrested one day on a charge of fraud and the dishonesty which the trial brought to light was not of the sort which could be explained by a sudden temptation it was deliberate and systematic arnold jackson was a rogue when he was sent to the penitentiary for seven years there were few who did not think he had escaped lightly when at the end of this last evening the lovers separated it was with many protestations of devotion isabel all tears was consoled a little by her certainty of edwards passionate love it was a strange feeling that she had it made her wretched to part from him and yet she was happy because he adored her this was more than two years ago he had written to her by every mail since then twentyfour letters in all for the mail went but once a month and his letters had been all that a lovers letters should be they were intimate and charming humorous sometimes especially of late and tender at first they suggested that he was homesick they were full of his desire to get back to chicago and isabel and a little anxiously she wrote begging him to persevere she was afraid that he might throw up his opportunity and come racing back she did not want her lover to lack endurance and she quoted to him the lines i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honour more but presently he seemed to settle down and it made isabel very happy to observe his growing enthusiasm to introduce american methods into that forgotten corner of the world but she knew him and at the end of the year which was the shortest time he could possibly stay in tahiti she expected to have to use all her influence to dissuade him from coming home it was much better that he should learn the business thoroughly and if they had been able to wait a year there seemed no reason why they should not wait another she talked it over with bateman hunter always the most generous of friends during those first few days after edward went she did not know what she would have done without him and they decided that edwards future must stand before everything it was with relief that she found as the time passed that he made no suggestion of returning hes splendid isnt he she exclaimed to bateman hes white through and through reading between the lines of his letter i know he hates it over there but hes sticking it out because she blushed a little and bateman with the grave smile which was so attractive in him finished the sentence for her because he loves you it makes me feel so humble she said youre wonderful isabel youre perfectly wonderful but the second year passed and every month isabel continued to receive a letter from edward and presently it began to seem a little strange that he did not speak of coming back he wrote as though he were settled definitely in tahiti and what was more comfortably settled she was surprised then she read his letters again all of them several times and now reading between the lines indeed she was puzzled to notice a change which had escaped her the later letters were as tender and as delightful as the first but the tone was different she was vaguely suspicious of their humour she had the instinctive mistrust of her sex for that unaccountable quality and she discerned in them now a flippancy which perplexed her she was not quite certain that the edward who wrote to her now was the same edward that she had known one afternoon the day after a mail had arrived from tahiti when she was driving with bateman he said to her did edward tell you when he was sailing no he didnt mention it i thought he might have said something to you about it not a word you know what edward is she laughed in reply he has no sense of time if it occurs to you next time you write you might ask him when hes thinking of coming her manner was so unconcerned that only batemans acute sensitiveness could have discerned in her request a very urgent desire he laughed lightly yes ill ask him i cant imagine what hes thinking about a few days later meeting him again she noticed that something troubled him they had been much together since edward left chicago they were both devoted to him and each in his desire to talk of the absent one found a willing listener the consequence was that isabel knew every expression of batemans face and his denials now were useless against her keen instinct something told her that his harassed look had to do with edward and she did not rest till she had made him confess the fact is he said at last i heard in a roundabout way that edward was no longer working for braunschmidt and co and yesterday i took the opportunity to ask mr braunschmidt himself well edward left his employment with them nearly a year ago how strange he should have said nothing about it bateman hesitated but he had gone so far now that he was obliged to tell the rest it made him feel dreadfully embarrassed he was fired in heavens name what for it appears they warned him once or twice and at last they told him to get out they say he was lazy and incompetent edward they were silent for a while and then he saw that isabel was crying instinctively he seized her hand oh my dear dont dont he said i cant bear to see it she was so unstrung that she let her hand rest in his he tried to console her its incomprehensible isnt it its so unlike edward i cant help feeling there must be some mistake she did not say anything for a while and when she spoke it was hesitatingly has it struck you that there was anything queer in his letters lately she asked looking away her eyes all bright with tears he did not quite know how to answer i have noticed a change in them he admitted he seems to have lost that high seriousness which i admired so much in him one would almost think that the things that matter well dont matter isabel did not reply she was vaguely uneasy perhaps in his answer to your letter hell say when hes coming home all we can do is to wait for that another letter came from edward for each of them and still he made no mention of his return but when he wrote he could not have received batemans enquiry the next mail would bring them an answer to that the next mail came and bateman brought isabel the letter he had just received but the first glance of his face was enough to tell her that he was disconcerted she read it through carefully and then with slightly tightened lips read it again its a very strange letter she said i dont quite understand it one might almost think that he was joshing me said bateman flushing it reads like that but it must be unintentional thats so unlike edward he says nothing about coming back if i werent so confident of his love i should think i hardly know what i should think it was then that bateman had broached the scheme which during the afternoon had formed itself in his brain the firm founded by his father in which he was now a partner a firm which manufactured all manner of motor vehicles was about to establish agencies in honolulu sidney and wellington and bateman proposed that himself should go instead of the manager who had been suggested he could return by tahiti in fact travelling from wellington it was inevitable to do so and he could see edward theres some mystery and im going to clear it up thats the only way to do it oh bateman how can you be so good and kind she exclaimed you know theres nothing in the world i want more than your happiness isabel she looked at him and she gave him her hands youre wonderful bateman i didnt know there was anyone in the world like you how can i ever thank you i dont want your thanks i only want to be allowed to help you she dropped her eyes and flushed a little she was so used to him that she had forgotten how handsome he was he was as tall as edward and as well made but he was dark and pale of face while edward was ruddy of course she knew he loved her it touched her she felt very tenderly towards him it was from this journey that bateman hunter was now returned the business part of it took him somewhat longer than he expected and he had much time to think of his two friends he had come to the conclusion that it could be nothing serious that prevented edward from coming home a pride perhaps which made him determined to make good before he claimed the bride he adored but it was a pride that must be reasoned with isabel was unhappy edward must come back to chicago with him and marry her at once a position could be found for him in the works of the hunter motor traction and automobile company bateman with a bleeding heart exulted at the prospect of giving happiness to the two persons he loved best in the world at the cost of his own he would never marry he would be godfather to the children of edward and isabel and many years later when they were both dead he would tell isabels daughter how long long ago he had loved her mother batemans eyes were veiled with tears when he pictured this scene to himself meaning to take edward by surprise he had not cabled to announce his arrival and when at last he landed at tahiti he allowed a youth who said he was the son of the house to lead him to the hotel de la fleur he chuckled when he thought of his friends amazement on seeing him the most unexpected of visitors walk into his office by the way he asked as they went along can you tell me where i shall find mr edward barnard barnard said the youth i seem to know the name hes an american a tall fellow with light brown hair and blue eyes hes been here over two years of course now i know who you mean you mean mr jacksons nephew whose nephew mr arnold jackson i dont think were speaking of the same person answered bateman frigidly he was startled it was queer that arnold jackson known apparently to all and sundry should live here under the disgraceful name in which he had been convicted but bateman could not imagine whom it was that he passed off as his nephew mrs longstaffe was his only sister and he had never had a brother the young man by his side talked volubly in an english that had something in it of the intonation of a foreign tongue and bateman with a sidelong glance saw what he had not noticed before that there was in him a good deal of native blood a touch of hauteur involuntarily entered into his manner they reached the hotel when he had arranged about his room bateman asked to be directed to the premises of braunschmidt co they were on the front facing the lagoon and glad to feel the solid earth under his feet after eight days at sea he sauntered down the sunny road to the waters edge having found the place he sought bateman sent in his card to the manager and was led through a lofty barnlike room half store and half warehouse to an office in which sat a stout spectacled baldheaded man can you tell me where i shall find mr edward barnard i understand he was in this office for some time that is so i dont know just where he is but i thought he came here with a particular recommendation from mr braunschmidt i know mr braunschmidt very well the fat man looked at bateman with shrewd suspicious eyes he called to one of the boys in the warehouse say henry wheres barnard now dyou know hes working at camerons i think came the answer from someone who did not trouble to move the fat man nodded if you turn to your left when you get out of here youll come to camerons in about three minutes bateman hesitated i think i should tell you that edward barnard is my greatest friend i was very much surprised when i heard hed left braunschmidt co the fat mans eyes contracted till they seemed like pinpoints and their scrutiny made bateman so uncomfortable that he felt himself blushing i guess braunschmidt co and edward barnard didnt see eye to eye on certain matters he replied bateman did not quite like the fellows manner so he got up not without dignity and with an apology for troubling him bade him goodday he left the place with a singular feeling that the man he had just interviewed had much to tell him but no intention of telling it he walked in the direction indicated and soon found himself at camerons it was a traders store such as he had passed half a dozen of on his way and when he entered the first person he saw in his shirt sleeves measuring out a length of trade cotton was edward it gave him a start to see him engaged in so humble an occupation but he had scarcely appeared when edward looking up caught sight of him and gave a joyful cry of surprise bateman who ever thought of seeing you here he stretched his arm across the counter and wrung batemans hand there was no selfconsciousness in his manner and the embarrassment was all on batemans side just wait till ive wrapped this package with perfect assurance he ran his scissors across the stuff folded it made it into a parcel and handed it to the darkskinned customer pay at the desk please then smiling with bright eyes he turned to bateman how did you show up here gee i am delighted to see you sit down old man make yourself at home we cant talk here come along to my hotel i suppose you can get away this he added with some apprehension of course i can get away were not so businesslike as all that in tahiti he called out to a chinese who was standing behind the opposite counter ahling when the boss comes tell him a friend of mines just arrived from america and ive gone out to have a drain with him alllight said the chinese with a grin edward slipped on a coat and putting on his hat accompanied bateman out of the store bateman attempted to put the matter facetiously i didnt expect to find you selling three and a half yards of rotten cotton to a greasy nigger he laughed braunschmidt fired me you know and i thought that would do as well as anything else edwards candour seemed to bateman very surprising but he thought it indiscreet to pursue the subject i guess you wont make a fortune where you are he answered somewhat dryly i guess not but i earn enough to keep body and soul together and im quite satisfied with that you wouldnt have been two years ago we grow wiser as we grow older retorted edward gaily bateman took a glance at him edward was dressed in a suit of shabby white ducks none too clean and a large straw hat of native make he was thinner than he had been deeply burned by the sun and he was certainly better looking than ever but there was something in his appearance that disconcerted bateman he walked with a new jauntiness there was a carelessness in his demeanour a gaiety about nothing in particular which bateman could not precisely blame but which exceedingly puzzled him im blest if i can see what hes got to be so darned cheerful about he said to himself they arrived at the hotel and sat on the terrace a chinese boy brought them cocktails edward was most anxious to hear all the news of chicago and bombarded his friend with eager questions his interest was natural and sincere but the odd thing was that it seemed equally divided among a multitude of subjects he was as eager to know how batemans father was as what isabel was doing he talked of her without a shade of embarrassment but she might just as well have been his sister as his promised wife and before bateman had done analysing the exact meaning of edwards remarks he found that the conversation had drifted to his own work and the buildings his father had lately erected he was determined to bring the conversation back to isabel and was looking for the occasion when he saw edward wave his hand cordially a man was advancing towards them on the terrace but batemans back was turned to him and he could not see him come and sit down said edward gaily the newcomer approached he was a very tall thin man in white ducks with a fine head of curly white hair his face was thin too long with a large hooked nose and a beautiful expressive mouth this is my old friend bateman hunter ive told you about him said edward his constant smile breaking on his lips im pleased to meet you mr hunter i used to know your father the stranger held out his hand and took the young mans in a strong friendly grasp it was not till then that edward mentioned the others name mr arnold jackson bateman turned white and he felt his hands grow cold this was the forger the convict this was isabels uncle he did not know what to say he tried to conceal his confusion arnold jackson looked at him with twinkling eyes i daresay my name is familiar to you bateman did not know whether to say yes or no and what made it more awkward was that both jackson and edward seemed to be amused it was bad enough to have forced on him the acquaintance of the one man on the island he would rather have avoided but worse to discern that he was being made a fool of perhaps however he had reached this conclusion too quickly for jackson without a pause added i understand youre very friendly with the longstaffes mary longstaffe is my sister now bateman asked himself if arnold jackson could think him ignorant of the most terrible scandal that chicago had ever known but jackson put his hand on edwards shoulder i cant sit down teddie he said im busy but you two boys had better come up and dine tonight thatll be fine said edward its very kind of you mr jackson said bateman frigidly but im here for so short a time my boat sails tomorrow you know i think if youll forgive me i wont come oh nonsense ill give you a native dinner my wifes a wonderful cook teddie will show you the way come early so as to see the sunset i can give you both a shakedown if you like of course well come said edward theres always the devil of a row in the hotel on the night a boat arrives and we can have a good yarn up at the bungalow i cant let you off mr hunter jackson continued with the utmost cordiality i want to hear all about chicago and mary he nodded and walked away before bateman could say another word we dont take refusals in tahiti laughed edward besides youll get the best dinner on the island what did he mean by saying his wife was a good cook i happen to know his wifes in geneva thats a long way off for a wife isnt it said edward and its a long time since he saw her i guess its another wife hes talking about for some time bateman was silent his face was set in grave lines but looking up he caught the amused look in edwards eyes and he flushed darkly arnold jackson is a despicable rogue he said i greatly fear he is answered edward smiling i dont see how any decent man can have anything to do with him perhaps im not a decent man do you see much of him edward yes quite a lot hes adopted me as his nephew bateman leaned forward and fixed edward with his searching eyes do you like him very much but dont you know doesnt everyone here know that hes a forger and that hes been a convict he ought to be hounded out of civilised society edward watched a ring of smoke that floated from his cigar into the still scented air i suppose he is a pretty unmitigated rascal he said at last and i cant flatter myself that any repentance for his misdeeds offers one an excuse for condoning them he was a swindler and a hypocrite you cant get away from it i never met a more agreeable companion hes taught me everything i know what has he taught you cried bateman in amazement how to live bateman broke into ironical laughter a fine master is it owing to his lessons that you lost the chance of making a fortune and earn your living now by serving behind a counter in a ten cent store he has a wonderful personality said edward smiling goodnaturedly perhaps youll see what i mean tonight im not going to dine with him if thats what you mean nothing would induce me to set foot within that mans house come to oblige me bateman weve been friends for so many years you wont refuse me a favour when i ask it edwards tone had in it a quality new to bateman its gentleness was singularly persuasive if you put it like that edward im bound to come he smiled bateman reflected moreover that it would be as well to learn what he could about arnold jackson it was plain that he had a great ascendency over edward and if it was to be combated it was necessary to discover in what exactly it consisted the more he talked with edward the more conscious he became that a change had taken place in him he had an instinct that it behooved him to walk warily and he made up his mind not to broach the real purport of his visit till he saw his way more clearly he began to talk of one thing and another of his journey and what he had achieved by it of politics in chicago of this common friend and that of their days together at college at last edward said he must get back to his work and proposed that he should fetch bateman at five so that they could drive out together to arnold jacksons house by the way i rather thought youd be living at this hotel said bateman as he strolled out of the garden with edward i understand its the only decent one here not i laughed edward its a deal too grand for me i rent a room just outside the town its cheap and clean if i remember right those werent the points that seemed most important to you when you lived in chicago chicago i dont know what you mean by that edward its the greatest city in the world i know said edward bateman glanced at him quickly but his face was inscrutable when are you coming back to it i often wonder smiled edward this answer and the manner of it staggered bateman but before he could ask for an explanation edward waved to a halfcaste who was driving a passing motor give us a ride down charlie he said he nodded to bateman and ran after the machine that had pulled up a few yards in front bateman was left to piece together a mass of perplexing impressions edward called for him in a rickety trap drawn by an old mare and they drove along a road that ran by the sea on each side of it were plantations coconut and vanilla and now and then they saw a great mango its fruit yellow and red and purple among the massy green of the leaves now and then they had a glimpse of the lagoon smooth and blue with here and there a tiny islet graceful with tall palms arnold jacksons house stood on a little hill and only a path led to it so they unharnessed the mare and tied her to a tree leaving the trap by the side of the road to bateman it seemed a happygolucky way of doing things but when they went up to the house they were met by a tall handsome native woman no longer young with whom edward cordially shook hands he introduced bateman to her this is my friend mr hunter were going to dine with you lavina all right she said with a quick smile arnold aint back yet well go down and bathe let us have a couple of pareos the woman nodded and went into the house who is that asked bateman oh thats lavina shes arnolds wife bateman tightened his lips but said nothing in a moment the woman returned with a bundle which she gave to edward and the two men scrambling down a steep path made their way to a grove of coconut trees on the beach they undressed and edward showed his friend how to make the strip of red trade cotton which is called a pareo into a very neat pair of bathingdrawers soon they were splashing in the warm shallow water edward was in great spirits he laughed and shouted and sang he might have been fifteen bateman had never seen him so gay and afterwards when they lay on the beach smoking cigarettes in the limpid air there was such an irresistible lightheartedness in him that bateman was taken aback you seem to find life mighty pleasant said he i do they heard a soft movement and looking round saw that arnold jackson was coming towards them i thought id come down and fetch you two boys back he said did you enjoy your bath mr hunter very much said bateman arnold jackson no longer in spruce ducks wore nothing but a pareo round his loins and walked barefoot his body was deeply browned by the sun with his long curling white hair and his ascetic face he made a fantastic figure in the native dress but he bore himself without a trace of selfconsciousness if youre ready well go right up said jackson ill just put on my clothes said bateman why teddie didnt you bring a pareo for your friend i guess hed rather wear clothes smiled edward i certainly would answered bateman grimly as he saw edward gird himself in the loincloth and stand ready to start before he himself had got his shirt on wont you find it rough walking without your shoes he asked edward it struck me the path was a trifle rocky oh im used to it its a comfort to get into a pareo when one gets back from town said jackson if you were going to stay here i should strongly recommend you to adopt it its one of the most sensible costumes i have ever come across its cool convenient and inexpensive they walked up to the house and jackson took them into a large room with whitewashed walls and an open ceiling in which a table was laid for dinner bateman noticed that it was set for five eva come and show yourself to teddies friend and then shake us a cocktail called jackson then he led bateman to a long low window look at that he said with a dramatic gesture look well below them coconut trees tumbled down steeply to the lagoon and the lagoon in the evening light had the colour tender and varied of a doves breast on a creek at a little distance were the clustered huts of a native village and towards the reef was a canoe sharply silhouetted in which were a couple of natives fishing then beyond you saw the vast calmness of the pacific and twenty miles away airy and unsubstantial like the fabric of a poets fancy the unimaginable beauty of the island which is called murea it was all so lovely that bateman stood abashed ive never seen anything like it he said at last arnold jackson stood staring in front of him and in his eyes was a dreamy softness his thin thoughtful face was very grave bateman glancing at it was once more conscious of its intense spirituality beauty murmured arnold jackson you seldom see beauty face to face look at it well mr hunter for what you see now you will never see again since the moment is transitory but it will be an imperishable memory in your heart you touch eternity his voice was deep and resonant he seemed to breathe forth the purest idealism and bateman had to urge himself to remember that the man who spoke was a criminal and a cruel cheat but edward as though he heard a sound turned round quickly here is my daughter mr hunter bateman shook hands with her she had dark splendid eyes and a red mouth tremulous with laughter but her skin was brown and her curling hair rippling down hershoulders was coal black she wore but one garment a mother hubbard of pink cotton her feet were bare and she was crowned with a wreath of white scented flowers she was a lovely creature she was like a goddess of the polynesian spring she was a little shy but not more shy than bateman to whom the whole situation was highly embarrassing and it did not put him at his ease to see this sylphlike thing take a shaker and with a practised hand mix three cocktails let us have a kick in them child said jackson she poured them out and smiling delightfully handed one to each of the men bateman flattered himself on his skill in the subtle art of shaking cocktails and he was not a little astonished on tasting this one to find that it was excellent jackson laughed proudly when he saw his guests involuntary look of appreciation not bad is it i taught the child myself and in the old days in chicago i considered that there wasnt a bartender in the city that could hold a candle to me when i had nothing better to do in the penitentiary i used to amuse myself by thinking out new cocktails but when you come down to brasstacks theres nothing to beat a dry martini bateman felt as though someone had given him a violent blow on the funnybone and he was conscious that he turned red and then white but before he could think of anything to say a native boy brought in a great bowl of soup and the whole party sat down to dinner arnold jacksons remark seemed to have aroused in him a train of recollections for he began to talk of his prison days he talked quite naturally without malice as though he were relating his experiences at a foreign university he addressed himself to bateman and bateman was confused and then confounded he saw edwards eyes fixed on him and there was in them a flicker of amusement he blushed scarlet for it struck him that jackson was making a fool of him and then because he felt absurd and knew there was no reason why he should he grew angry arnold jackson was impudent there was no other word for it and his callousness whether assumed or not was outrageous the dinner proceeded bateman was asked to eat sundry messes raw fish and he knew not what which only his civility induced him to swallow but which he was amazed to find very good eating then an incident happened which to bateman was the most mortifying experience of the evening there was a little circlet of flowers in front of him and for the sake of conversation he hazarded a remark about it its a wreath that eva made for you said jackson but i guess she was too shy to give it you bateman took it up in his hand and made a polite little speech of thanks to the girl you must put it on she said with a smile and a blush i i dont think ill do that its the charming custom of the country said arnold jackson there was one in front of him and he placed it on his hair edward did the same i guess im not dressed for the part said bateman uneasily would you like a pareo said eva quickly ill get you one in a minute no thank you im quite comfortable as i am show him how to put it on eva said edward at that moment bateman hated his greatest friend eva got up from the table and with much laughter placed the wreath on his black hair it suits you very well said mrs jackson dont it suit him arnold of course it does bateman sweated at every pore isnt it a pity its dark said eva we could photograph you all three together bateman thanked his stars it was he felt that he must look prodigiously foolish in his blue serge suit and high collar very neat and gentlemanly with that ridiculous wreath of flowers on his head he was seething with indignation and he had never in his life exercised more selfcontrol than now when he presented an affable exterior he was furious with that old man sitting at the head of the table halfnaked with his saintly face and the flowers on his handsome white locks the whole position was monstrous then dinner came to an end and eva and her mother remained to clear away while the three men sat on the verandah it was very warm and the air was scented with the white flowers of the night the full moon sailing across an unclouded sky made a pathway on the broad sea that led to the boundless realms of forever arnold jackson began to talk his voice was rich and musical he talked now of the natives and of the old legends of the country he told strange stories of the past stories of hazardous expeditions into the unknown of love and death of hatred and revenge he told of the adventurers who had discovered those distant islands of the sailors who settling in them had married the daughters of great chieftains and of the beachcombers who had led their varied lives on those silvery shores bateman mortified and exasperated at first listened sullenly but presently some magic in the words possessed him and he sat entranced the mirage of romance obscured the light of common day had he forgotten that arnold jackson had a tongue of silver a tongue by which he had charmed vast sums out of the credulous public a tongue which very nearly enabled him to escape the penalty of his crimes no one had a sweeter eloquence and no one had a more acute sense of climax suddenly he rose well you two boys havent seen one another for a long time i shall leave you to have a yarn teddie will show you your quarters when you want to go to bed oh but i wasnt thinking of spending the night mr jackson said bateman youll find it more comfortable well see that youre called in good time then with a courteous shake of the hand stately as though he were a bishop in canonicals arnold jackson took leave of his guest of course ill drive you back to papeete if you like said edward but i advise you to stay its bully driving in the early morning for a few minutes neither of them spoke bateman wondered how he should begin on the conversation which all the events of the day made him think more urgent when are you coming back to chicago he asked suddenly for a moment edward did not answer then he turned rather lazily to look at his friend and smiled i dont know perhaps never what in heavens name do you mean cried bateman im very happy here wouldnt it be folly to make a change man alive you cant live here all your life this is no life for a man its a living death oh edward come away at once before its too late ive felt that something was wrong youre infatuated with the place youve succumbed to evil influences but it only requires a wrench and when youre free from these surroundings youll thank all the gods there be youll be like a dopefiend when hes broken from his drug youll see then that for two years youve been breathing poisoned air you cant imagine what a relief it will be when you fill your lungs once more with the fresh pure air of your native country he spoke quickly the words tumbling over one another in his excitement and there was in his voice sincere and affectionate emotion edward was touched it is good of you to care so much old friend come with me tomorrow edward it was a mistake that you ever came to this place this is no life for you you talk of this sort of life and that how do you think a man gets the best out of life why i should have thought there could be no two answers to that by doing his duty by hard work by meeting all the obligations of his state and station and what is his reward his reward is the consciousness of having achieved what he set out to do it all sounds a little portentous to me said edward and in the lightness of the night bateman could see that he was smiling im afraid youll think ive degenerated sadly there are several things i think now which i daresay would have seemed outrageous to me three years ago have you learnt them from arnold jackson asked bateman scornfully you dont like him perhaps you couldnt be expected to i didnt when i first came i had just the same prejudice as you hes a very extraordinary man you saw for yourself that he makes no secret of the fact that he was in a penitentiary i do not know that he regrets it or the crimes that led him there the only complaint he ever made in my hearing was that when he came out his health was impaired i think he does not know what remorse is he is completely unmoral he accepts everything and he accepts himself as well hes generous and kind he always was interrupted bateman on other peoples money ive found him a very good friend is it unnatural that i should take a man as i find him the result is that you lose the distinction between right and wrong no they remain just as clearly divided in my mind as before but what has become a little confused in me is the distinction between the bad man and the good one is arnold jackson a bad man who does good things or a good man who does bad things its a difficult question to answer perhaps we make too much of the difference between one man and another perhaps even the best of us are sinners and the worst of us are saints who knows you will never persuade me that white is black and that black is white said bateman im sure i shant bateman bateman could not understand why the flicker of a smile crossed edwards lips when he thus agreed with him edward was silent for a minute when i saw you this morning bateman he said then i seemed to see myself as i was two years ago the same collar and the same shoes the same blue suit the same energy the same determination by god i was energetic the sleepy methods of this place made my blood tingle i went about and everywhere i saw possibilities for development and enterprise there were fortunes to be made here it seemed to me absurd that the copra should be taken away from here in sacks and the oil extracted in america it would be far more economical to do all that on the spot with cheap labour and save freight and i saw already the vast factories springing up on the island then the way they extracted it from the coconut seemed to me hopelessly inadequate and i invented a machine which divided the nut and scooped out the meat at the rate of two hundred and forty an hour the harbour was not large enough i made plans to enlarge it then to form a syndicate to buy land put up two or three large hotels and bungalows for occasional residents i had a scheme for improving the steamer service in order to attract visitors from california in twenty years instead of this half french lazy little town of papeete i saw a great american city with tenstory buildings and streetcars a theatre and an opera house a stock exchange and a mayor but go ahead edward cried bateman springing up from the chair in excitement youve got the ideas and the capacity why youll become the richest man between australia and the states edward chuckled softly but i dont want to he said do you mean to say you dont want money big money money running into millions do you know what you can do with it do you know the power it brings and if you dont care about it for yourself think what you can do opening new channels for human enterprise giving occupation to thousands my brain reels at the visions your words have conjured up sit down then my dear bateman laughed edward my machine for cutting the coconuts will always remain unused and so far as im concerned streetcars shall never run in the idle streets of papeete bateman sank heavily into his chair i dont understand you he said it came upon me little by little i came to like the life here with its ease and its leisure and the people with their goodnature and their happy smiling faces i began to think id never had time to do that before i began to read you always read i read for examinations i read in order to be able to hold my own in conversation i read for instruction here i learned to read for pleasure i learned to talk do you know that conversation is one of the greatest pleasures in life but it wants leisure id always been too busy before and gradually all the life that had seemed so important to me began to seem rather trivial and vulgar what is the use of all this hustle and this constant striving i think of chicago now and i see a dark grey city all stone it is like a prison and a ceaseless turmoil and what does all that activity amount to does one get there the best out of life is that what we come into the world for to hurry to an office and work hour after hour till night then hurry home and dine and go to a theatre is that how i must spend my youth youth lasts so short a time bateman and when i am old what have i to look forward to to hurry from my home in the morning to my office and work hour after hour till night and then hurry home again and dine and go to a theatre that may be worth while if you make a fortune i dont know it depends on your nature but if you dont is it worth while then i want to make more out of my life than that bateman what do you value in life then im afraid youll laugh at me beauty truth and goodness dont you think you can have those in chicago some men can perhaps but not i edward sprang up now i tell you when i think of the life i led in the old days i am filled with horror he cried violently i tremble with fear when i think of the danger i have escaped i never knew i had a soul till i found it here if i had remained a rich man i might have lost it for good and all i dont know how you can say that cried bateman indignantly we often used to have discussions about it yes i know they were about as effectual as the discussions of deaf mutes about harmony i shall never come back to chicago bateman and what about isabel edward walked to the edge of the verandah and leaning over looked intently at the blue magic of the night there was a slight smile on his face when he turned back to bateman isabel is infinitely too good for me i admire her more than any woman i have ever known she has a wonderful brain and shes as good as shes beautiful i respect her energy and her ambition she was born to make a success of life i am entirely unworthy of her she doesnt think so but you must tell her so bateman i cried bateman im the last person who could ever do that edward had his back to the vivid light of the moon and his face could not be seen is it possible that he smiled again its no good your trying to conceal anything from her bateman with her quick intelligence shell turn you inside out in five minutes youd better make a clean breast of it right away i dont know what you mean of course i shall tell her ive seen you bateman spoke in some agitation honestly i dont know what to say to her tell her that i havent made good tell her that im not only poor but that im content to be poor tell her i was fired from my job because i was idle and inattentive tell her all youve seen tonight and all ive told you the idea which on a sudden flashed through batemans brain brought him to his feet and in uncontrollable perturbation he faced edward man alive dont you want to marry her edward looked at him gravely i can never ask her to release me if she wishes to hold me to my word i will do my best to make her a good and loving husband do you wish me to give her that message edward oh i cant its terrible its never dawned on her for a moment that you dont want to marry her she loves you how can i inflict such a mortification on her edward smiled again why dont you marry her yourself bateman youve been in love with her for ages youre perfectly suited to one another youll make her very happy dont talk to me like that i cant bear it i resign in your favour bateman you are the better man there was something in edwards tone that made bateman look up quickly but edwards eyes were grave and unsmiling bateman did not know what to say he was disconcerted he wondered whether edward could possibly suspect that he had come to tahiti on a special errand and though he knew it was horrible he could not prevent the exultation in his heart what will you do if isabel writes and puts an end to her engagement with you he said slowly survive said edward bateman was so agitated that he did not hear the answer i wish you had ordinary clothes on he said somewhat irritably its such a tremendously serious decision youre taking that fantastic costume of yours makes it seem terribly casual i assure you i can be just as solemn in a pareo and a wreath of roses as in a high hat and a cutaway coat then another thought struck bateman edward its not for my sake youre doing this i dont know but perhaps this is going to make a tremendous difference to my future youre not sacrificing yourself for me i couldnt stand for that you know no bateman i have learnt not to be silly and sentimental here i should like you and isabel to be happy but i have not the least wish to be unhappy myself the answer somewhat chilled bateman it seemed to him a little cynical he would not have been sorry to act a noble part do you mean to say youre content to waste your life here its nothing less than suicide when i think of the great hopes you had when we left college it seems terrible that you should be content to be no more than a salesman in a cheapjohn store oh im only doing that for the present and im gaining a great deal of valuable experience i have another plan in my head arnold jackson has a small island in the paumotas about a thousand miles from here a ring of land round a lagoon hes planted coconut there hes offered to give it me why should he do that asked bateman because if isabel releases me i shall marry his daughter you bateman was thunderstruck you cant marry a halfcaste you wouldnt be so crazy as that shes a good girl and she has a sweet and gentle nature i think she would make me very happy are you in love with her i dont know answered edward reflectively im not in love with her as i was in love with isabel i worshipped isabel i thought she was the most wonderful creature i had ever seen i was not half good enough for her i dont feel like that with eva shes like a beautiful exotic flower that must be sheltered from bitter winds i want to protect her no one ever thought of protecting isabel i think she loves me for myself and not for what i may become whatever happens to me i shall never disappoint her she suits me bateman was silent we must turn out early in the morning said edward at last its really about time we went to bed then bateman spoke and his voice had in it a genuine distress im so bewildered i dont know what to say i came here because i thought something was wrong i thought you hadnt succeeded in what you set out to do and were ashamed to come back when youd failed i never guessed i should be faced with this im so desperately sorry edward im so disappointed i hoped you would do great things its almost more than i can bear to think of you wasting your talents and your youth and your chance in this lamentable way dont be grieved old friend said edward i havent failed ive succeeded you cant think with what zest i look forward to life how full it seems to me and how significant sometimes when you are married to isabel you will think of me i shall build myself a house on my coral island and i shall live there looking after my trees getting the fruit out of the nuts in the same old way that they have done for unnumbered years i shall grow all sorts of things in my garden and i shall fish there will be enough work to keep me busy and not enough to make me dull i shall have my books and eva children i hope and above all the infinite variety of the sea and the sky the freshness of the dawn and the beauty of the sunset and the rich magnificence of the night i shall make a garden out of what so short a while ago was a wilderness i shall have created something the years will pass insensibly and when i am an old man i hope that i shall be able to look back on a happy simple peaceful life in my small way i too shall have lived in beauty do you think it is so little to have enjoyed contentment we know that it will profit a man little if he gain the whole world and lose his soul i think i have won mine edward led him to a room in which there were two beds and he threw himself on one of them in ten minutes bateman knew by his regular breathing peaceful as a childs that edward was asleep but for his part he had no rest he was disturbed in mind and it was not till the dawn crept into the room ghostlike and silent that he fell asleep bateman finished telling isabel his long story he had hidden nothing from her except what he thought would wound her or what made himself ridiculous he did not tell her that he had been forced to sit at dinner with a wreath of flowers round his head and he did not tell her that edward was prepared to marry her uncles halfcaste daughter the moment she set him free but perhaps isabel had keener intuitions than he knew for as he went on with his tale her eyes grew colder and her lips closed upon one another more tightly now and then she looked at him closely and if he had been less intent on his narrative he might have wondered at her expression what was this girl like she asked when he finished uncle arnolds daughter would you say there was any resemblance between her and me bateman was surprised at the question it never struck me you know ive never had eyes for anyone but you and i could never think that anyone was like you who could resemble you was she pretty said isabel smiling slightly at his words i suppose so i daresay some men would say she was very beautiful well its of no consequence i dont think we need give her any more of our attention what are you going to do isabel he asked then isabel looked down at the hand which still bore the ring edward had given her on their betrothal i wouldnt let edward break our engagement because i thought it would be an incentive to him i wanted to be an inspiration to him i thought if anything could enable him to achieve success it was the thought that i loved him i have done all i could its hopeless it would only be weakness on my part not to recognise the facts poor edward hes nobodys enemy but his own he was a dear nice fellow but there was something lacking in him i suppose it was backbone i hope hell be happy she slipped the ring off her finger and placed it on the table bateman watched her with a heart beating so rapidly that he could hardly breathe youre wonderful isabel youre simply wonderful she smiled and standing up held out her hand to him how can i ever thank you for what youve done for me she said youve done me a great service i knew i could trust you he took her hand and held it she had never looked more beautiful oh isabel i would do so much more for you than that you know that i only ask to be allowed to love and serve you youre so strong bateman she sighed it gives me such a delicious feeling of confidence isabel i adore you he hardly knew how the inspiration had come to him but suddenly he clasped her in his arms and she all unresisting smiled into his eyes isabel you know i wanted to marry you the very first day i saw you he cried passionately then why on earth didnt you ask me she replied she loved him he could hardly believe it was true she gave him her lovely lips to kiss and as he held her in his arms he had a vision of the works of the hunter motor traction and automobile company growing in size and importance till they covered a hundred acres and of the millions of motors they would turn out and of the great collection of pictures he would form which should beat anything they had in new york he would wear horn spectacles and she with the delicious pressure of his arms about her sighed with happiness for she thought of the exquisite house she would have full of antique furniture and of the concerts she would give and of the ths dansants and the dinners to which only the most cultured people would come bateman should wear horn spectacles poor edward she sighed iv red the skipper thrust his hand into one of his trouser pockets and with difficulty for they were not at the sides but in front and he was a portly man pulled out a large silver watch he looked at it and then looked again at the declining sun the kanaka at the wheel gave him a glance but did not speak the skippers eyes rested on the island they were approaching a white line of foam marked the reef he knew there was an opening large enough to get his ship through and when they came a little nearer he counted on seeing it they had nearly an hour of daylight still before them in the lagoon the water was deep and they could anchor comfortably the chief of the village which he could already see among the coconut trees was a friend of the mates and it would be pleasant to go ashore for the night the mate came forward at that minute and the skipper turned to him well take a bottle of booze along with us and get some girls in to dance he said i dont see the opening said the mate he was a kanaka a handsome swarthy fellow with somewhat the look of a later roman emperor inclined to stoutness but his face was fine and cleancut im dead sure theres one right here said the captain looking through his glasses i cant understand why i cant pick it up send one of the boys up the mast to have a look the mate called one of the crew and gave him the order the captain watched the kanaka climb and waited for him to speak but the kanaka shouted down that he could see nothing but the unbroken line of foam the captain spoke samoan like a native and he cursed him freely shall he stay up there asked the mate what the hell good does that do answered the captain the blame fool cant see worth a cent you bet your sweet life id find the opening if i was up there he looked at the slender mast with anger it was all very well for a native who had been used to climbing up coconut trees all his life he was fat and heavy come down he shouted youre no more use than a dead dog well just have to go along the reef till we find the opening it was a seventyton schooner with paraffin auxiliary and it ran when there was no head wind between four and five knots an hour it was a bedraggled object it had been painted white a very long time ago but it was now dirty dingy and mottled it smelt strongly of paraffin and of the copra which was its usual cargo they were within a hundred feet of the reef now and the captain told the steersman to run along it till they came to the opening but when they had gone a couple of miles he realised that they had missed it he went about and slowly worked back again the white foam of the reef continued without interruption and now the sun was setting with a curse at the stupidity of the crew the skipper resigned himself to waiting till next morning put her about he said i cant anchor here they went out to sea a little and presently it was quite dark they anchored when the sail was furled the ship began to roll a good deal they said in apia that one day she would roll right over and the owner a germanamerican who managed one of the largest stores said that no money was big enough to induce him to go out in her the cook a chinese in white trousers very dirty and ragged and a thin white tunic came to say that supper was ready and when the skipper went into the cabin he found the engineer already seated at table the engineer was a long lean man with a scraggy neck he was dressed in blue overalls and a sleeveless jersey which showed his thin arms tatooed from elbow to wrist hell having to spend the night outside said the skipper the engineer did not answer and they ate their supper in silence the cabin was lit by a dim oil lamp when they had eaten the canned apricots with which the meal finished the chink brought them a cup of tea the skipper lit a cigar and went on the upper deck the island now was only a darker mass against the night the stars were very bright the only sound was the ceaseless breaking of the surf the skipper sank into a deckchair and smoked idly presently three or four members of the crew came up and sat down one of them had a banjo and another a concertina they began to play and one of them sang the native song sounded strange on these instruments then to the singing a couple began to dance it was a barbaric dance savage and primeval rapid with quick movements of the hands and feet and contortions of the body it was sensual sexual even but sexual without passion it was very animal direct weird without mystery natural in short and one might almost say childlike at last they grew tired they stretched themselves on the deck and slept and all was silent the skipper lifted himself heavily out of his chair and clambered down the companion he went into his cabin and got out of his clothes he climbed into his bunk and lay there he panted a little in the heat of the night but next morning when the dawn crept over the tranquil sea the opening in the reef which had eluded them the night before was seen a little to the east of where they lay the schooner entered the lagoon there was not a ripple on the surface of the water deep down among the coral rocks you saw little coloured fish swim when he had anchored his ship the skipper ate his breakfast and went on deck the sun shone from an unclouded sky but in the early morning the air was grateful and cool it was sunday and there was a feeling of quietness a silence as though nature were at rest which gave him a peculiar sense of comfort he sat looking at the wooded coast and felt lazy and well at ease presently a slow smile moved his lips and he threw the stump of his cigar into the water i guess ill go ashore he said get the boat out he climbed stiffly down the ladder and was rowed to a little cove the coconut trees came down to the waters edge not in rows but spaced out with an ordered formality they were like a ballet of spinsters elderly but flippant standing in affected attitudes with the simpering graces of a bygone age he sauntered idly through them along a path that could be just seen winding its tortuous way and it led him presently to a broad creek there was a bridge across it but a bridge constructed of single trunks of coconut trees a dozen of them placed end to end and supported where they met by a forked branch driven into the bed of the creek you walked on a smooth round surface narrow and slippery and there was no support for the hand to cross such a bridge required sure feet and a stout heart the skipper hesitated but he saw on the other side nestling among the trees a white mans house he made up his mind and rather gingerly began to walk he watched his feet carefully and where one trunk joined on to the next and there was a difference of level he tottered a little it was with a gasp of relief that he reached the last tree and finally set his feet on the firm ground of the other side he had been so intent on the difficult crossing that he never noticed anyone was watching him and it was with surprise that he heard himself spoken to it takes a bit of nerve to cross these bridges when youre not used to them he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him he had evidently come out of the house which he had seen i saw you hesitate the man continued with a smile on his lips and i was watching to see you fall in not on your life said the captain who had now recovered his confidence ive fallen in myself before now i remember one evening i came back from shooting and i fell in gun and all now i get a boy to carry my gun for me he was a man no longer young with a small beard now somewhat grey and a thin face he was dressed in a singlet without arms and a pair of duck trousers he wore neither shoes nor socks he spoke english with a slight accent are you neilson asked the skipper i am ive heard about you i thought you lived somewheres round here the skipper followed his host into the little bungalow and sat down heavily in the chair which the other motioned him to take while neilson went out to fetch whisky and glasses he took a look round the room it filled him with amazement he had never seen so many books the shelves reached from floor to ceiling on all four walls and they were closely packed there was a grand piano littered with music and a large table on which books and magazines lay in disorder the room made him feel embarrassed he remembered that neilson was a queer fellow no one knew very much about him although he had been in the islands for so many years but those who knew him agreed that he was queer he was a swede youve got one big heap of books here he said when neilson returned they do no harm answered neilson with a smile have you read them all asked the skipper most of them im a bit of a reader myself i have the saturday evening post sent me regler neilson poured his visitor a good stiff glass of whisky and gave him a cigar the skipper volunteered a little information i got in last night but i couldnt find the opening so i had to anchor outside i never been this run before but my people had some stuff they wanted to bring over here gray dyou know him yes hes got a store a little way along well there was a lot of canned stuff that he wanted over an hes got some copra they thought i might just as well come over as lie idle at apia i run between apia and pagopago mostly but theyve got smallpox there just now and theres nothing stirring he took a drink of his whisky and lit a cigar he was a taciturn man but there was something in neilson that made him nervous and his nervousness made him talk the swede was looking at him with large dark eyes in which there was an expression of faint amusement this is a tidy little place youve got here ive done my best with it you must do pretty well with your trees they look fine with copra at the price it is now i had a bit of a plantation myself once in upolu it was but i had to sell it he looked round the room again where all those books gave him a feeling of something incomprehensible and hostile i guess you must find it a bit lonesome here though he said ive got used to it ive been here for twentyfive years now the captain could think of nothing more to say and he smoked in silence neilson had apparently no wish to break it he looked at his guest with a meditative eye he was a tall man more than six feet high and very stout his face was red and blotchy with a network of little purple veins on the cheeks and his features were sunk into its fatness his eyes were bloodshot his neck was buried in rolls of fat but for a fringe of long curly hair nearly white at the back of his head he was quite bald and that immense shiny surface of forehead which might have given him a false look of intelligence on the contrary gave him one of peculiar imbecility he wore a blue flannel shirt open at the neck and showing his fat chest covered with a mat of reddish hair and a very old pair of blue serge trousers he sat in his chair in a heavy ungainly attitude his great belly thrust forward and his fat legs uncrossed all elasticity had gone from his limbs neilson wondered idly what sort of man he had been in his youth it was almost impossible to imagine that this creature of vast bulk had ever been a boy who ran about the skipper finished his whisky and neilson pushed the bottle towards him help yourself the skipper leaned forward and with his great hand seized it and how come you in these parts anyways he said oh i came out to the islands for my health my lungs were bad and they said i hadnt a year to live you see they were wrong i meant how come you to settle down right here i am a sentimentalist oh neilson knew that the skipper had not an idea what he meant and he looked at him with an ironical twinkle in his dark eyes perhaps just because the skipper was so gross and dull a man the whim seized him to talk further you were too busy keeping your balance to notice when you crossed the bridge but this spot is generally considered rather pretty its a cute little house youve got here ah that wasnt here when i first came there was a native hut with its beehive roof and its pillars overshadowed by a great tree with red flowers and the croton bushes their leaves yellow and red and golden made a pied fence around it and then all about were the coconut trees as fanciful as women and as vain they stood at the waters edge and spent all day looking at their reflections i was a young man then good heavens its a quarter of a century ago and i wanted to enjoy all the loveliness of the world in the short time allotted to me before i passed into the darkness i thought it was the most beautiful spot i had ever seen the first time i saw it i had a catch at my heart and i was afraid i was going to cry i wasnt more than twentyfive and though i put the best face i could on it i didnt want to die and somehow it seemed to me that the very beauty of this place made it easier for me to accept my fate i felt when i came here that all my past life had fallen away stockholm and its university and then bonn it all seemed the life of somebody else as though now at last i had achieved the reality which our doctors of philosophy i am one myself you know had discussed so much a year i cried to myself i have a year i will spend it here and then i am content to die we are foolish and sentimental and melodramatic at twentyfive but if we werent perhaps we should be less wise at fifty now drink my friend dont let the nonsense i talk interfere with you he waved his thin hand towards the bottle and the skipper finished what remained in his glass you aint drinking nothin he said reaching for the whisky i am of a sober habit smiled the swede i intoxicate myself in ways which i fancy are more subtle but perhaps that is only vanity anyhow the effects are more lasting and the results less deleterious they say theres a deal of cocaine taken in the states now said the captain neilson chuckled but i do not see a white man often he continued and for once i dont think a drop of whisky can do me any harm he poured himself out a little added some soda and took a sip and presently i found out why the spot had such an unearthly loveliness here love had tarried for a moment like a migrant bird that happens on a ship in midocean and for a little while folds its tired wings the fragrance of a beautiful passion hovered over it like the fragrance of hawthorn in may in the meadows of my home it seems to me that the places where men have loved or suffered keep about them always some faint aroma of something that has not wholly died it is as though they had acquired a spiritual significance which mysteriously affects those who pass i wish i could make myself clear he smiled a little though i cannot imagine that if i did you would understand he paused i think this place was beautiful because here i had been loved beautifully and now he shrugged his shoulders but perhaps it is only that my sthetic sense is gratified by the happy conjunction of young love and a suitable setting even a man less thickwitted than the skipper might have been forgiven if he were bewildered by neilsons words for he seemed faintly to laugh at what he said it was as though he spoke from emotion which his intellect found ridiculous he had said himself that he was a sentimentalist and when sentimentality is joined with scepticism there is often the devil to pay he was silent for an instant and looked at the captain with eyes in which there was a sudden perplexity you know i cant help thinking that ive seen you before somewhere or other he said i couldnt say as i remember you returned the skipper i have a curious feeling as though your face were familiar to me its been puzzling me for some time but i cant situate my recollection in any place or at any time the skipper massively shrugged his heavy shoulders its thirty years since i first come to the islands a man cant figure on remembering all the folk he meets in a while like that the swede shook his head you know how one sometimes has the feeling that a place one has never been to before is strangely familiar thats how i seem to see you he gave a whimsical smile perhaps i knew you in some past existence perhaps perhaps you were the master of a galley in ancient rome and i was a slave at the oar thirty years have you been here every bit of thirty years i wonder if you knew a man called red red that is the only name ive ever known him by i never knew him personally i never even set eyes on him and yet i seem to see him more clearly than many men my brothers for instance with whom i passed my daily life for many years he lives in my imagination with the distinctness of a paolo malatesta or a romeo but i daresay you have never read dante or shakespeare i cant say as i have said the captain neilson smoking a cigar leaned back in his chair and looked vacantly at the ring of smoke which floated in the still air a smile played on his lips but his eyes were grave then he looked at the captain there was in his gross obesity something extraordinarily repellent he had the plethoric selfsatisfaction of the very fat it was an outrage it set neilsons nerves on edge but the contrast between the man before him and the man he had in mind was pleasant it appears that red was the most comely thing you ever saw ive talked to quite a number of people who knew him in those days white men and they all agree that the first time you saw him his beauty just took your breath away they called him red on account of his flaming hair it had a natural wave and he wore it long it must have been of that wonderful colour that the preraphaelites raved over i dont think he was vain of it he was much too ingenuous for that but no one could have blamed him if he had been he was tall six feet and an inch or two in the native house that used to stand here was the mark of his height cut with a knife on the central trunk that supported the roof and he was made like a greek god broad in the shoulders and thin in the flanks he was like apollo with just that soft roundness which praxiteles gave him and that suave feminine grace which has in it something troubling and mysterious his skin was dazzling white milky like satin his skin was like a womans i had kind of a white skin myself when i was a kiddie said the skipper with a twinkle in his bloodshot eyes but neilson paid no attention to him he was telling his story now and interruption made him impatient and his face was just as beautiful as his body he had large blue eyes very dark so that some say they were black and unlike most redhaired people he had dark eyebrows and long dark lashes his features were perfectly regular and his mouth was like a scarlet wound he was twenty on these words the swede stopped with a certain sense of the dramatic he took a sip of whisky he was unique there never was anyone more beautiful there was no more reason for him than for a wonderful blossom to flower on a wild plant he was a happy accident of nature one day he landed at that cove into which you must have put this morning he was an american sailor and he had deserted from a manofwar in apia he had induced some goodhumoured native to give him a passage on a cutter that happened to be sailing from apia to safoto and he had been put ashore here in a dugout i do not know why he deserted perhaps life on a manofwar with its restrictions irked him perhaps he was in trouble and perhaps it was the south seas and these romantic islands that got into his bones every now and then they take a man strangely and he finds himself like a fly in a spiders web it may be that there was a softness of fibre in him and these green hills with their soft airs this blue sea took the northern strength from him as delilah took the nazarites anyhow he wanted to hide himself and he thought he would be safe in this secluded nook till his ship had sailed from samoa there was a native hut at the cove and as he stood there wondering where exactly he should turn his steps a young girl came out and invited him to enter he knew scarcely two words of the native tongue and she as little english but he understood well enough what her smiles meant and her pretty gestures and he followed her he sat down on a mat and she gave him slices of pineapple to eat i can speak of red only from hearsay but i saw the girl three years after he first met her and she was scarcely nineteen then you cannot imagine how exquisite she was she had the passionate grace of the hibiscus and the rich colour she was rather tall slim with the delicate features of her race and large eyes like pools of still water under the palm trees her hair black and curling fell down her back and she wore a wreath of scented flowers her hands were lovely they were so small so exquisitely formed they gave your heartstrings a wrench and in those days she laughed easily her smile was so delightful that it made your knees shake her skin was like a field of ripe corn on a summer day good heavens how can i describe her she was too beautiful to be real and these two young things she was sixteen and he was twenty fell in love with one another at first sight that is the real love not the love that comes from sympathy common interests or intellectual community but love pure and simple that is the love that adam felt for eve when he awoke and found her in the garden gazing at him with dewy eyes that is the love that draws the beasts to one another and the gods that is the love that makes the world a miracle that is the love which gives life its pregnant meaning you have never heard of the wise cynical french duke who said that with two lovers there is always one who loves and one who lets himself be loved it is a bitter truth to which most of us have to resign ourselves but now and then there are two who love and two who let themselves be loved then one might fancy that the sun stands still as it stood when joshua prayed to the god of israel and even now after all these years when i think of these two so young so fair so simple and of their love i feel a pang it tears my heart just as my heart is torn when on certain nights i watch the full moon shining on the lagoon from an unclouded sky there is always pain in the contemplation of perfect beauty they were children she was good and sweet and kind i know nothing of him and i like to think that then at all events he was ingenuous and frank i like to think that his soul was as comely as his body but i daresay he had no more soul than the creatures of the woods and forests who made pipes from reeds and bathed in the mountain streams when the world was young and you might catch sight of little fawns galloping through the glade on the back of a bearded centaur a soul is a troublesome possession and when man developed it he lost the garden of eden well when red came to the island it had recently been visited by one of those epidemics which the white man has brought to the south seas and one third of the inhabitants had died it seems that the girl had lost all her near kin and she lived now in the house of distant cousins the household consisted of two ancient crones bowed and wrinkled two younger women and a man and a boy for a few days he stayed there but perhaps he felt himself too near the shore with the possibility that he might fall in with white men who would reveal his hidingplace perhaps the lovers could not bear that the company of others should rob them for an instant of the delight of being together one morning they set out the pair of them with the few things that belonged to the girl and walked along a grassy path under the coconuts till they came to the creek you see they had to cross the bridge you crossed and the girl laughed gleefully because he was afraid she held his hand till they came to the end of the first tree and then his courage failed him and he had to go back he was obliged to take off all his clothes before he could risk it and she carried them over for him on her head they settled down in the empty hut that stood here whether she had any rights over it land tenure is a complicated business in the islands or whether the owner had died during the epidemic i do not know but anyhow no one questioned them and they took possession their furniture consisted of a couple of grassmats on which they slept a fragment of lookingglass and a bowl or two in this pleasant land that is enough to start housekeeping on they say that happy people have no history and certainly a happy love has none they did nothing all day long and yet the days seemed all too short the girl had a native name but red called her sally he picked up the easy language very quickly and he used to lie on the mat for hours while she chattered gaily to him he was a silent fellow and perhaps his mind was lethargic he smoked incessantly the cigarettes which she made him out of the native tobacco and pandanus leaf and he watched her while with deft fingers she made grass mats often natives would come in and tell long stories of the old days when the island was disturbed by tribal wars sometimes he would go fishing on the reef and bring home a basket full of coloured fish sometimes at night he would go out with a lantern to catch lobster there were plantains round the hut and sally would roast them for their frugal meal she knew how to make delicious messes from coconuts and the breadfruit tree by the side of the creek gave them its fruit on feastdays they killed a little pig and cooked it on hot stones they bathed together in the creek and in the evening they went down to the lagoon and paddled about in a dugout with its great outrigger the sea was deep blue winecoloured at sundown like the sea of homeric greece but in the lagoon the colour had an infinite variety aquamarine and amethyst and emerald and the setting sun turned it for a short moment to liquid gold then there was the colour of the coral brown white pink red purple and the shapes it took were marvellous it was like a magic garden and the hurrying fish were like butterflies it strangely lacked reality among the coral were pools with a floor of white sand and here where the water was dazzling clear it was very good to bathe then cool and happy they wandered back in the gloaming over the soft grass road to the creek walking hand in hand and now the mynah birds filled the coconut trees with their clamour and then the night with that great sky shining with gold that seemed to stretch more widely than the skies of europe and the soft airs that blew gently through the open hut the long night again was all too short she was sixteen and he was barely twenty the dawn crept in among the wooden pillars of the hut and looked at those lovely children sleeping in one anothers arms the sun hid behind the great tattered leaves of the plantains so that it might not disturb them and then with playful malice shot a golden ray like the outstretched paw of a persian cat on their faces they opened their sleepy eyes and they smiled to welcome another day the weeks lengthened into months and a year passed they seemed to love one another as i hesitate to say passionately for passion has in it always a shade of sadness a touch of bitterness or anguish but as whole heartedly as simply and naturally as on that first day on which meeting they had recognised that a god was in them if you had asked them i have no doubt that they would have thought it impossible to suppose their love could ever cease do we not know that the essential element of love is a belief in its own eternity and yet perhaps in red there was already a very little seed unknown to himself and unsuspected by the girl which would in time have grown to weariness for one day one of the natives from the cove told them that some way down the coast at the anchorage was a british whalingship gee he said i wonder if i could make a trade of some nuts and plantains for a pound or two of tobacco the pandanus cigarettes that sally made him with untiring hands were strong and pleasant enough to smoke but they left him unsatisfied and he yearned on a sudden for real tobacco hard rank and pungent he had not smoked a pipe for many months his mouth watered at the thought of it one would have thought some premonition of harm would have made sally seek to dissuade him but love possessed her so completely that it never occurred to her any power on earth could take him from her they went up into the hills together and gathered a great basket of wild oranges green but sweet and juicy and they picked plantains from around the hut and coconuts from their trees and breadfruit and mangoes and they carried them down to the cove they loaded the unstable canoe with them and red and the native boy who had brought them the news of the ship paddled along outside the reef it was the last time she ever saw him next day the boy came back alone he was all in tears this is the story he told when after their long paddle they reached the ship and red hailed it a white man looked over the side and told them to come on board they took the fruit they had brought with them and red piled it up on the deck the white man and he began to talk and they seemed to come to some agreement one of them went below and brought up tobacco red took some at once and lit a pipe the boy imitated the zest with which he blew a great cloud of smoke from his mouth then they said something to him and he went into the cabin through the open door the boy watching curiously saw a bottle brought out and glasses red drank and smoked they seemed to ask him something for he shook his head and laughed the man the first man who had spoken to them laughed too and he filled reds glass once more they went on talking and drinking and presently growing tired of watching a sight that meant nothing to him the boy curled himself up on the deck and slept he was awakened by a kick and jumping to his feet he saw that the ship was slowly sailing out of the lagoon he caught sight of red seated at the table with his head resting heavily on his arms fast asleep he made a movement towards him intending to wake him but a rough hand seized his arm and a man with a scowl and words which he did not understand pointed to the side he shouted to red but in a moment he was seized and flung overboard helpless he swam round to his canoe which was drifting a little way off and pushed it on to the reef he climbed in and sobbing all the way paddled back to shore what had happened was obvious enough the whaler by desertion or sickness was short of hands and the captain when red came aboard had asked him to sign on on his refusal he had made him drunk and kidnapped him sally was beside herself with grief for three days she screamed and cried the natives did what they could to comfort her but she would not be comforted she would not eat and then exhausted she sank into a sullen apathy she spent long days at the cove watching the lagoon in the vain hope that red somehow or other would manage to escape she sat on the white sand hour after hour with the tears running down her cheeks and at night dragged herself wearily back across the creek to the little hut where she had been happy the people with whom she had lived before red came to the island wished her to return to them but she would not she was convinced that red would come back and she wanted him to find her where he had left her four months later she was delivered of a stillborn child and the old woman who had come to help her through her confinement remained with her in the hut all joy was taken from her life if her anguish with time became less intolerable it was replaced by a settled melancholy you would not have thought that among these people whose emotions though so violent are very transient a woman could be found capable of so enduring a passion she never lost the profound conviction that sooner or later red would come back she watched for him and every time someone crossed this slender little bridge of coconut trees she looked it might at last be he neilson stopped talking and gave a faint sigh and what happened to her in the end asked the skipper neilson smiled bitterly oh three years afterwards she took up with another white man the skipper gave a fat cynical chuckle thats generally what happens to them he said the swede shot him a look of hatred he did not know why that gross obese man excited in him so violent a repulsion but his thoughts wandered and he found his mind filled with memories of the past he went back five and twenty years it was when he first came to the island weary of apia with its heavy drinking its gambling and coarse sensuality a sick man trying to resign himself to the loss of the career which had fired his imagination with ambitious thoughts he set behind him resolutely all his hopes of making a great name for himself and strove to content himself with the few poor months of careful life which was all that he could count on he was boarding with a halfcaste trader who had a store a couple of miles along the coast at the edge of a native village and one day wandering aimlessly along the grassy paths of the coconut groves he had come upon the hut in which sally lived the beauty of the spot had filled him with a rapture so great that it was almost painful and then he had seen sally she was the loveliest creature he had ever seen and the sadness in those dark magnificent eyes of hers affected him strangely the kanakas were a handsome race and beauty was not rare among them but it was the beauty of shapely animals it was empty but those tragic eyes were dark with mystery and you felt in them the bitter complexity of the groping human soul the trader told him the story and it moved him do you think hell ever come back asked neilson no fear why itll be a couple of years before the ship is paid off and by then hell have forgotten all about her i bet he was pretty mad when he woke up and found hed been shanghaied and i shouldnt wonder but he wanted to fight somebody but hed got to grin and bear it and i guess in a month he was thinking it the best thing that had ever happened to him that he got away from the island but neilson could not get the story out of his head perhaps because he was sick and weakly the radiant health of red appealed to his imagination himself an ugly man insignificant of appearance he prized very highly comeliness in others he had never been passionately in love and certainly he had never been passionately loved the mutual attraction of those two young things gave him a singular delight it had the ineffable beauty of the absolute he went again to the little hut by the creek he had a gift for languages and an energetic mind accustomed to work and he had already given much time to the study of the local tongue old habit was strong in him and he was gathering together material for a paper on the samoan speech the old crone who shared the hut with sally invited him to come in and sit down she gave him kava to drink and cigarettes to smoke she was glad to have someone to chat with and while she talked he looked at sally she reminded him of the psyche in the museum at naples her features had the same dear purity of line and though she had borne a child she had still a virginal aspect it was not till he had seen her two or three times that he induced her to speak then it was only to ask him if he had seen in apia a man called red two years had passed since his disappearance but it was plain that she still thought of him incessantly it did not take neilson long to discover that he was in love with her it was only by an effort of will now that he prevented himself from going every day to the creek and when he was not with sally his thoughts were at first looking upon himself as a dying man he asked only to look at her and occasionally hear her speak and his love gave him a wonderful happiness he exulted in its purity he wanted nothing from her but the opportunity to weave around her graceful person a web of beautiful fancies but the open air the equable temperature the rest the simple fare began to have an unexpected effect on his health his temperature did not soar at night to such alarming heights he coughed less and began to put on weight six months passed without his having a hmorrhage and on a sudden he saw the possibility that he might live he had studied his disease carefully and the hope dawned upon him that with great care he might arrest its course it exhilarated him to look forward once more to the future he made plans it was evident that any active life was out of the question but he could live on the islands and the small income he had insufficient elsewhere would be ample to keep him he could grow coconuts that would give him an occupation and he would send for his books and a piano but his quick mind saw that in all this he was merely trying to conceal from himself the desire which obsessed him he wanted sally he loved not only her beauty but that dim soul which he divined behind her suffering eyes he would intoxicate her with his passion in the end he would make her forget and in an ecstasy of surrender he fancied himself giving her too the happiness which he had thought never to know again but had now so miraculously achieved he asked her to live with him she refused he had expected that and did not let it depress him for he was sure that sooner or later she would yield his love was irresistible he told the old woman of his wishes and found somewhat to his surprise that she and the neighbours long aware of them were strongly urging sally to accept his offer after all every native was glad to keep house for a white man and neilson according to the standards of the island was a rich one the trader with whom he boarded went to her and told her not to be a fool such an opportunity would not come again and after so long she could not still believe that red would ever return the girls resistance only increased neilsons desire and what had been a very pure love now became an agonising passion he was determined that nothing should stand in his way he gave sally no peace at last worn out by his persistence and the persuasions by turns pleading and angry of everyone around her she consented but the day after when exultant he went to see her he found that in the night she had burnt down the hut in which she and red had lived together the old crone ran towards him full of angry abuse of sally but he waved her aside it did not matter they would build a bungalow on the place where the hut had stood a european house would really be more convenient if he wanted to bring out a piano and a vast number of books and so the little wooden house was built in which he had now lived for many years and sally became his wife but after the first few weeks of rapture during which he was satisfied with what she gave him he had known little happiness she had yielded to him through weariness but she had only yielded what she set no store on the soul which he had dimly glimpsed escaped him he knew that she cared nothing for him she still loved red and all the time she was waiting for his return at a sign from him neilson knew that notwithstanding his love his tenderness his sympathy his generosity she would leave him without a moments hesitation she would never give a thought to his distress anguish seized him and he battered at that impenetrable self of hers which sullenly resisted him his love became bitter he tried to melt her heart with kindness but it remained as hard as before he feigned indifference but she did not notice it sometimes he lost his temper and abused her and then she wept silently sometimes he thought she was nothing but a fraud and that soul simply an invention of his own and that he could not get into the sanctuary of her heart because there was no sanctuary there his love became a prison from which he longed to escape but he had not the strength merely to open the door that was all it needed and walk out into the open air it was torture and at last he became numb and hopeless in the end the fire burnt itself out and when he saw her eyes rest for an instant on the slender bridge it was no longer rage that filled his heart but impatience for many years now they had lived together bound by the ties of habit and convenience and it was with a smile that he looked back on his old passion she was an old woman for the women on the islands age quickly and if he had no love for her any more he had tolerance she left him alone he was contented with his piano and his books his thoughts led him to a desire for words when i look back now and reflect on that brief passionate love of red and sally i think that perhaps they should thank the ruthless fate that separated them when their love seemed still to be at its height they suffered but they suffered in beauty they were spared the real tragedy of love i dont know exactly as i get you said the skipper the tragedy of love is not death or separation how long do you think it would have been before one or other of them ceased to care oh it is dreadfully bitter to look at a woman whom you have loved with all your heart and soul so that you felt you could not bear to let her out of your sight and realise that you would not mind if you never saw her again the tragedy of love is indifference but while he was speaking a very extraordinary thing happened though he had been addressing the skipper he had not been talking to him he had been putting his thoughts into words for himself and with his eyes fixed on the man in front of him he had not seen him but now an image presented itself to them an image not of the man he saw but of another man it was as though he were looking into one of those distorting mirrors that make you extraordinarily squat or outrageously elongate but here exactly the opposite took place and in the obese ugly old man he caught the shadowy glimpse of a stripling he gave him now a quick searching scrutiny why had a haphazard stroll brought him just to this place a sudden tremor of his heart made him slightly breathless an absurd suspicion seized him what had occurred to him was impossible and yet it might be a fact what is your name he asked abruptly the skippers face puckered and he gave a cunning chuckle he looked then malicious and horribly vulgar its such a damned long time since i heard it that i almost forget it myself but for thirty years now in the islands theyve always called me red his huge form shook as he gave a low almost silent laugh it was obscene neilson shuddered red was hugely amused and from his bloodshot eyes tears ran down his cheeks neilson gave a gasp for at that moment a woman came in she was a native a woman of somewhat commanding presence stout without being corpulent dark for the natives grow darker with age with very grey hair she wore a black mother hubbard and its thinness showed her heavy breasts the moment had come she made an observation to neilson about some household matter and he answered he wondered if his voice sounded as unnatural to her as it did to himself she gave the man who was sitting in the chair by the window an indifferent glance and went out of the room the moment had come and gone neilson for a moment could not speak he was strangely shaken then he said id be very glad if youd stay and have a bit of dinner with me pot luck i dont think i will said red i must go after this fellow gray ill give him his stuff and then ill get away i want to be back in apia tomorrow ill send a boy along with you to show you the way thatll be fine red heaved himself out of his chair while the swede called one of the boys who worked on the plantation he told him where the skipper wanted to go and the boy stepped along the bridge red prepared to follow him dont fall in said neilson not on your life neilson watched him make his way across and when he had disappeared among the coconuts he looked still then he sank heavily in his chair was that the man who had prevented him from being happy was that the man whom sally had loved all these years and for whom she had waited so desperately it was grotesque a sudden fury seized him so that he had an instinct to spring up and smash everything around him he had been cheated they had seen each other at last and had not known it he began to laugh mirthlessly and his laughter grew till it became hysterical the gods had played him a cruel trick and he was old now at last sally came in to tell him dinner was ready he sat down in front of her and tried to eat he wondered what she would say if he told her now that the fat old man sitting in the chair was the lover whom she remembered still with the passionate abandonment of her youth years ago when he hated her because she made him so unhappy he would have been glad to tell her he wanted to hurt her then as she hurt him because his hatred was only love but now he did not care he shrugged his shoulders listlessly what did that man want she asked presently he did not answer at once she was old too a fat old native woman he wondered why he had ever loved her so madly he had laid at her feet all the treasures of his soul and she had cared nothing for them waste what waste and now when he looked at her he felt only contempt his patience was at last exhausted he answered her question hes the captain of a schooner hes come from apia yes he brought me news from home my eldest brother is very ill and i must go back will you be gone long he shrugged his shoulders v the pool when i was introduced to lawson by chaplin the owner of the hotel metropole at apia i paid no particular attention to him we were sitting in the lounge over an early cocktail and i was listening with amusement to the gossip of the island chaplin entertained me he was by profession a mining engineer and perhaps it was characteristic of him that he had settled in a place where his professional attainments were of no possible value it was however generally reported that he was an extremely clever mining engineer he was a small man neither fat nor thin with black hair scanty on the crown turning grey and a small untidy moustache his face partly from the sun and partly from liquor was very red he was but a figurehead for the hotel though so grandly named but a frame building of two storeys was managed by his wife a tall gaunt australian of five and forty with an imposing presence and a determined air the little man excitable and often tipsy was terrified of her and the stranger soon heard of domestic quarrels in which she used her fist and her foot in order to keep him in subjection she had been known after a night of drunkenness to confine him for twentyfour hours to his own room and then he could be seen afraid to leave his prison talking somewhat pathetically from his verandah to people in the street below he was a character and his reminiscences of a varied life whether true or not made him worth listening to so that when lawson strolled in i was inclined to resent the interruption although not midday it was clear that he had had enough to drink and it was without enthusiasm that i yielded to his persistence and accepted his offer of another cocktail i knew already that chaplins head was weak the next round which in common politeness i should be forced to order would be enough to make him lively and then mrs chaplin would give me black looks nor was there anything attractive in lawsons appearance he was a little thin man with a long sallow face and a narrow weak chin a prominent nose large and bony and great shaggy black eyebrows they gave him a peculiar look his eyes very large and very dark were magnificent he was jolly but his jollity did not seem to me sincere it was on the surface a mask which he wore to deceive the world and i suspected that it concealed a mean nature he was plainly anxious to be thought a good sport and he was hailfellowwellmet but i do not know why i felt that he was cunning and shifty he talked a great deal in a raucous voice and he and chaplin capped one anothers stories of beanos which had become legendary stories of wet nights at the english club of shooting expeditions where an incredible amount of whisky had been consumed and of jaunts to sydney of which their pride was that they could remember nothing from the time they landed till the time they sailed a pair of drunken swine but even in their intoxication for by now after four cocktails each neither was sober there was a great difference between chaplin rough and vulgar and lawson lawson might be drunk but he was certainly a gentleman at last he got out of his chair a little unsteadily well ill be getting along home he said see you before dinner missus all right said chaplin yes he went out there was a peculiar note in the monosyllable of his answer which made me look up good chap said chaplin flatly as lawson went out of the door into the sunshine one of the best pity he drinks this from chaplin was an observation not without humour and when hes drunk he wants to fight people is he often drunk dead drunk three or four days a week its the island done it and ethel whos ethel ethels his wife married a halfcaste old brevalds daughter took her away from here only thing to do but she couldnt stand it and now theyre back again hell hang himself one of these days if he dont drink himself to death before good chap nasty when hes drunk chaplin belched loudly ill go and put my head under the shower i oughtnt to have had that last cocktail its always the last one that does you in he looked uncertainly at the staircase as he made up his mind to go to the cubby hole in which was the shower and then with unnatural seriousness got up pay you to cultivate lawson he said a well read chap youd be surprised when hes sober clever too worth talking to chaplin had told me the whole story in these few speeches when i came in towards evening from a ride along the seashore lawson was again in the hotel he was heavily sunk in one of the cane chairs in the lounge and he looked at me with glassy eyes it was plain that he had been drinking all the afternoon he was torpid and the look on his face was sullen and vindictive his glance rested on me for a moment but i could see that he did not recognise me two or three other men were sitting there shaking dice and they took no notice of him his condition was evidently too usual to attract attention i sat down and began to play youre a damned sociable lot said lawson suddenly he got out of his chair and waddled with bent knees towards the door i do not know whether the spectacle was more ridiculous than revolting when he had gone one of the men sniggered lawsons fairly soused today he said if i couldnt carry my liquor better than that said another id climb on the waggon and stay there who would have thought that this wretched object was in his way a romantic figure or that his life had in it those elements of pity and terror which the theorist tells us are necessary to achieve the effect of tragedy i did not see him again for two or three days i was sitting one evening on the first floor of the hotel on a verandah that overlooked the street when lawson came up and sank into a chair beside me he was quite sober he made a casual remark and then when i had replied somewhat indifferently added with a laugh which had in it an apologetic tone i was devilish soused the other day i did not answer there was really nothing to say i pulled away at my pipe in the vain hope of keeping the mosquitoes away and looked at the natives going home from their work they walked with long steps slowly with care and dignity and the soft patter of their naked feet was strange to hear their dark hair curling or straight was often white with lime and then they had a look of extraordinary distinction they were tall and finely built then a gang of solomon islanders indentured labourers passed by singing they were shorter and slighter than the samoans coal black with great heads of fuzzy hair dyed red now and then a white man drove past in his buggy or rode into the hotel yard in the lagoon two or three schooners reflected their grace in the tranquil water i dont know what there is to do in a place like this except to get soused said lawson at last dont you like samoa i asked casually for something to say its pretty isnt it the word he chose seemed so inadequate to describe the unimaginable beauty of the island that i smiled and smiling i turned to look at him i was startled by the expression in those fine sombre eyes of his an expression of intolerable anguish they betrayed a tragic depth of emotion of which i should never have thought him capable but the expression passed away and he smiled his smile was simple and a little nave it changed his face so that i wavered in my first feeling of aversion from him i was all over the place when i first came out he said he was silent for a moment i went away for good about three years ago but i came back he hesitated my wife wanted to come back she was born here you know oh yes he was silent again and then hazarded a remark about robert louis stevenson he asked me if i had been up to vailima for some reason he was making an effort to be agreeable to me he began to talk of stevensons books and presently the conversation drifted to london i suppose covent gardens still going strong he said i think i miss the opera as much as anything here have you seen tristan and isolde he asked me the question as though the answer were really important to him and when i said a little casually i daresay that i had he seemed pleased he began to speak of wagner not as a musician but as the plain man who received from him an emotional satisfaction that he could not analyse i suppose bayreuth was the place to go really he said i never had the money worse luck but of course one might do worse than covent garden all the lights and the women dressed up to the nines and the music the first act of the walkres all right isnt it and the end of tristan golly his eyes were flashing now and his face was lit up so that he hardly seemed the same man there was a flush on his sallow thin cheeks and i forgot that his voice was harsh and unpleasant there was even a certain charm about him by george id like to be in london tonight do you know the pall mall restaurant i used to go there a lot piccadilly circus with the shops all lit up and the crowd i think its stunning to stand there and watch the buses and taxis streaming along as though theyd never stop and i like the strand too what are those lines about god and charing cross i was taken aback thompsons dyou mean i asked i quoted them and when so sad thou canst not sadder cry and upon thy so sore loss shall shine the traffic of jacobs ladder pitched between heaven and charing cross he gave a faint sigh ive read the hound of heaven its a bit of all right its generally thought so i murmured you dont meet anybody here whos read anything they think its swank there was a wistful look on his face and i thought i divined the feeling that made him come to me i was a link with the world he regretted and a life that he would know no more because not so very long before i had been in the london which he loved he looked upon me with awe and envy he had not spoken for five minutes perhaps when he broke out with words that startled me by their intensity im fed up he said im fed up then why dont you clear out i asked his face grew sullen my lungs are a bit dicky i couldnt stand an english winter now at that moment another man joined us on the verandah and lawson sank into a moody silence its about time for a drain said the newcomer wholl have a drop of scotch with me lawson lawson seemed to arise from a distant world he got up lets go down to the bar he said when he left me i remained with a more kindly feeling towards him than i should have expected he puzzled and interested me and a few days later i met his wife i knew they had been married for five or six years and i was surprised to see that she was still extremely young when he married her she could not have been more than sixteen she was adorably pretty she was no darker than a spaniard small and very beautifully made with tiny hands and feet and a slight lithe figure her features were lovely but i think what struck me most was the delicacy of her appearance the halfcaste as a rule have a certain coarseness they seem a little roughly formed but she had an exquisite daintiness which took your breath away there was something extremely civilised about her so that it surprised you to see her in those surroundings and you thought of those famous beauties who had set all the world talking at the court of the emperor napoleon iii though she wore but a muslin frock and a straw hat she wore them with an elegance that suggested the woman of fashion she must have been ravishing when lawson first saw her he had but lately come out from england to manage the local branch of an english bank and reaching samoa at the beginning of the dry season he had taken a room at the hotel he quickly made the acquaintance of all and sundry the life of the island is pleasant and easy he enjoyed the long idle talks in the lounge of the hotel and the gay evenings at the english club when a group of fellows would play pool he liked apia straggling along the edge of the lagoon with its stores and bungalows and its native village then there were weekends when he would ride over to the house of one planter or another and spend a couple of nights on the hills he had never before known freedom or leisure and he was intoxicated by the sunshine when he rode through the bush his head reeled a little at the beauty that surrounded him the country was indescribably fertile in parts the forest was still virgin a tangle of strange trees luxuriant undergrowth and vine it gave an impression that was mysterious and troubling but the spot that entranced him was a pool a mile or two away from apia to which in the evenings he often went to bathe there was a little river that bubbled over the rocks in a swift stream and then after forming the deep pool ran on shallow and crystalline past a ford made by great stones where the natives came sometimes to bathe or to wash their clothes the coconut trees with their frivolous elegance grew thickly on the banks all clad with trailing plants and they were reflected in the green water it was just such a scene as you might see in devonshire among the hills and yet with a difference for it had a tropical richness a passion a scented languor which seemed to melt the heart the water was fresh but not cold and it was delicious after the heat of the day to bathe there refreshed not only the body but the soul at the hour when lawson went there was not a soul and he lingered for a long time now floating idly in the water now drying himself in the evening sun enjoying the solitude and the friendly silence he did not regret london then nor the life that he had abandoned for life as it was seemed complete and exquisite it was here that he first saw ethel occupied till late by letters which had to be finished for the monthly sailing of the boat next day he rode down one evening to the pool when the light was almost failing he tied up his horse and sauntered to the bank a girl was sitting there she glanced round as he came and noiselessly slid into the water she vanished like a naiad startled by the approach of a mortal he was surprised and amused he wondered where she had hidden herself he swam downstream and presently saw her sitting on a rock she looked at him with uncurious eyes he called out a greeting in samoan talofa she answered him suddenly smiling and then let herself into the water again she swam easily and her hair spread out behind her he watched her cross the pool and climb out on the bank like all the natives she bathed in a mother hubbard and the water had made it cling to her slight body she wrung out her hair and as she stood there unconcerned she looked more than ever like a wild creature of the water or the woods he saw now that she was halfcaste he swam towards her and getting out addressed her in english youre having a late swim she shook back her hair and then let it spread over her shoulders in luxuriant curls i like it when im alone she said so do i she laughed with the childlike frankness of the native she slipped a dry mother hubbard over her head and letting down the wet one stepped out of it she wrung it out and was ready to go she paused a moment irresolutely and then sauntered off the night fell suddenly lawson went back to the hotel and describing her to the men who were in the lounge shaking dice for drinks soon discovered who she was her father was a norwegian called brevald who was often to be seen in the bar of the hotel metropole drinking rum and water he was a little old man knotted and gnarled like an ancient tree who had come out to the islands forty years before as mate of a sailing vessel he had been a blacksmith a trader a planter and at one time fairly welltodo but ruined by the great hurricane of the nineties he had now nothing to live on but a small plantation of coconut trees he had had four native wives and as he told you with a cracked chuckle more children than he could count but some had died and some had gone out into the world so that now the only one left at home was ethel shes a peach said nelson the supercargo of the moana ive given her the glad eye once or twice but i guess theres nothing doing old brevalds not that sort of a fool sonny put in another a man called miller he wants a soninlaw whos prepared to keep him in comfort for the rest of his life it was distasteful to lawson that they should speak of the girl in that fashion he made a remark about the departing mail and so distracted their attention but next evening he went again to the pool ethel was there and the mystery of the sunset the deep silence of the water the lithe grace of the coconut trees added to her beauty giving it a profundity a magic which stirred the heart to unknown emotions for some reason that time he had the whim not to speak to her she took no notice of him she did not even glance in his direction she swam about the green pool she dived she rested on the bank as though she were quite alone he had a queer feeling that he was invisible scraps of poetry half forgotten floated across his memory and vague recollections of the greece he had negligently studied in his school days when she had changed her wet clothes for dry ones and sauntered away he found a scarlet hibiscus where she had been it was a flower that she had worn in her hair when she came to bathe and having taken it out on getting into the water had forgotten or not cared to put in again he took it in his hands and looked at it with a singular emotion he had an instinct to keep it but his sentimentality irritated him and he flung it away it gave him quite a little pang to see it float down the stream he wondered what strangeness it was in her nature that urged her to go down to this hidden pool when there was no likelihood that anyone should be there the natives of the islands are devoted to the water they bathe somewhere or other every day once always and often twice but they bathe in bands laughing and joyous a whole family together and you often saw a group of girls dappled by the sun shining through the trees with the halfcastes among them splashing about the shallows of the stream it looked as though there were in this pool some secret which attracted ethel against her will now the night had fallen mysterious and silent and he let himself down in the water softly in order to make no sound and swam lazily in the warm darkness the water seemed fragrant still from her slender body he rode back to the town under the starry sky he felt at peace with the world now he went every evening to the pool and every evening he saw ethel presently he overcame her timidity she became playful and friendly they sat together on the rocks above the pool where the water ran fast and they lay side by side on the ledge that overlooked it watching the gathering dusk envelop it with mystery it was inevitable that their meetings should become known in the south seas everyone seems to know everyones business and he was subjected to much rude chaff by the men at the hotel he smiled and let them talk it was not even worth while to deny their coarse suggestions his feelings were absolutely pure he loved ethel as a poet might love the moon he thought of her not as a woman but as something not of this earth she was the spirit of the pool one day at the hotel passing through the bar he saw that old brevald as ever in his shabby blue overalls was standing there because he was ethels father he had a desire to speak to him so he went in nodded and ordering his own drink casually turned and invited the old man to have one with him they chatted for a few minutes of local affairs and lawson was uneasily conscious that the norwegian was scrutinising him with sly blue eyes his manner was not agreeable it was sycophantic and yet behind the cringing air of an old man who had been worsted in his struggle with fate was a shadow of old truculence lawson remembered that he had once been captain of a schooner engaged in the slave trade a blackbirder they call it in the pacific and he had a large hernia in the chest which was the result of a wound received in a scrap with solomon islanders the bell rang for luncheon well i must be off said lawson why dont you come along to my place one time said brevald in his wheezy voice its not very grand but youll be welcome you know ethel ill come with pleasure sunday afternoons the best time brevalds bungalow shabby and bedraggled stood among the coconut trees of the plantation a little away from the main road that ran up to vailima immediately around it grew huge plantains with their tattered leaves they had the tragic beauty of a lovely woman in rags everything was slovenly and neglected little black pigs thin and highbacked rooted about and chickens clucked noisily as they picked at the refuse scattered here and there three or four natives were lounging about the verandah when lawson asked for brevald the old mans cracked voice called out to him and he found him in the sittingroom smoking an old briar pipe sit down and make yerself at home he said ethels just titivating she came in she wore a blouse and skirt and her hair was done in the european fashion although she had not the wild timid grace of the girl who came down every evening to the pool she seemed now more usual and consequently more approachable she shook hands with lawson it was the first time he had touched her hand i hope youll have a cup of tea with us she said he knew she had been at a mission school and he was amused and at the same time touched by the company manners she was putting on for his benefit tea was already set out on the table and in a minute old brevalds fourth wife brought in the teapot she was a handsome native no longer very young and she spoke but a few words of english she smiled and smiled tea was rather a solemn meal with a great deal of bread and butter and a variety of very sweet cakes and the conversation was formal then a wrinkled old woman came in softly thats ethels granny said old brevald noisily spitting on the floor she sat on the edge of a chair uncomfortably so that you saw it was unusual for her and she would have been more at ease on the ground and remained silently staring at lawson with fixed shining eyes in the kitchen behind the bungalow someone began to play the concertina and two or three voices were raised in a hymn but they sang for the pleasure of the sounds rather than from piety when lawson walked back to the hotel he was strangely happy he was touched by the higgledypiggledy way in which those people lived and in the smiling goodnature of mrs brevald in the little norwegians fantastic career and in the shining mysterious eyes of the old grandmother he found something unusual and fascinating it was a more natural life than any he had known it was nearer to the friendly fertile earth civilisation repelled him at that moment and by mere contact with these creatures of a more primitive nature he felt a greater freedom he saw himself rid of the hotel which already was beginning to irk him settled in a little bungalow of his own trim and white in front of the sea so that he had before his eyes always the multicoloured variety of the lagoon he loved the beautiful island london and england meant nothing to him any more he was content to spend the rest of his days in that forgotten spot rich in the best of the worlds goods love and happiness he made up his mind that whatever the obstacles nothing should prevent him from marrying ethel but there were no obstacles he was always welcome at the brevalds house the old man was ingratiating and mrs brevald smiled without ceasing he had brief glimpses of natives who seemed somehow to belong to the establishment and once he found a tall youth in a lavalava his body tattooed his hair white with lime sitting with brevald and was told he was mrs brevalds brothers son but for the most part they kept out of his way ethel was delightful with him the light in her eyes when she saw him filled him with ecstasy she was charming and nave he listened enraptured when she told him of the mission school at which she was educated and of the sisters he went with her to the cinema which was given once a fortnight and danced with her at the dance which followed it they came from all parts of the island for this since gaieties are few in upolu and you saw there all the society of the place the white ladies keeping a good deal to themselves the halfcastes very elegant in american clothes the natives strings of dark girls in white mother hubbards and young men in unaccustomed ducks and white shoes it was all very smart and gay ethel was pleased to show her friends the white admirer who did not leave her side the rumour was soon spread that he meant to marry her and her friends looked at her with envy it was a great thing for a halfcaste to get a white man to marry her even the less regular relation was better than nothing but one could never tell what it would lead to and lawsons position as manager of the bank made him one of the catches of the island if he had not been so absorbed in ethel he would have noticed that many eyes were fixed on him curiously and he would have seen the glances of the white ladies and noticed how they put their heads together and gossiped afterwards when the men who lived at the hotel were having a whisky before turning in nelson burst out with say they say lawsons going to marry that girl hes a damned fool then said miller miller was a germanamerican who had changed his name from mller a big man fat and baldheaded with a round cleanshaven face he wore large goldrimmed spectacles which gave him a benign look and his ducks were always clean and white he was a heavy drinker invariably ready to stay up all night with the boys but he never got drunk he was jolly and affable but very shrewd nothing interfered with his business he represented a firm in san francisco jobbers of the goods sold in the islands calico machinery and what not and his goodfellowship was part of his stockintrade he dont know what hes up against said nelson someone ought to put him wise if youll take my advice you wont interfere in what dont concern you said miller when a mans made up his mind to make a fool of himself theres nothing like letting him im all for having a good time with the girls out here but when it comes to marrying them this child aint taking any ill tell the world chaplin was there and now he had his say ive seen a lot of fellows do it and its no good you ought to have a talk with him chaplin said nelson you know him better than anyone else does my advice to chaplin is to leave it alone said miller even in those days lawson was not popular and really no one took enough interest in him to bother mrs chaplin talked it over with two or three of the white ladies but they contented themselves with saying that it was a pity and when he told her definitely that he was going to be married it seemed too late to do anything for a year lawson was happy he took a bungalow at the point of the bay round which apia is built on the borders of a native village it nestled charmingly among the coconut trees and faced the passionate blue of the pacific ethel was lovely as she went about the little house lithe and graceful like some young animal of the woods and she was gay they laughed a great deal they talked nonsense sometimes one or two of the men at the hotel would come over and spend the evening and often on a sunday they would go for a day to some planter who had married a native now and then one or other of the halfcaste traders who had a store in apia would give a party and they went to it the halfcastes treated lawson quite differently now his marriage had made him one of themselves and they called him bertie they put their arms through his and smacked him on the back he liked to see ethel at these gatherings her eyes shone and she laughed it did him good to see her radiant happiness sometimes ethels relations would come to the bungalow old brevald of course and her mother but cousins too vague native women in mother hubbards and men and boys in lavalavas with their hair dyed red and their bodies elaborately tattooed he would find them sitting there when he got back from the bank he laughed indulgently dont let them eat us out of hearth and home he said theyre my own family i cant help doing something for them when they ask me he knew that when a white man marries a native or a halfcaste he must expect her relations to look upon him as a gold mine he took ethels face in his hands and kissed her red lips perhaps he could not expect her to understand that the salary which had amply sufficed for a bachelor must be managed with some care when it had to support a wife and a house then ethel was delivered of a son it was when lawson first held the child in his arms that a sudden pang shot through his heart he had not expected it to be so dark after all it had but a fourth part of native blood and there was no reason really why it should not look just like an english baby but huddled together in his arms sallow its head covered already with black hair with huge black eyes it might have been a native child since his marriage he had been ignored by the white ladies of the colony when he came across men in whose houses he had been accustomed to dine as a bachelor they were a little selfconscious with him and they sought to cover their embarrassment by an exaggerated cordiality mrs lawson well they would say youre a lucky fellow damned pretty girl but if they were with their wives and met him and ethel they would feel it awkward when their wives gave ethel a patronising nod lawson had laughed theyre as dull as ditchwater the whole gang of them he said its not going to disturb my nights rest if they dont ask me to their dirty parties but now it irked him a little the little dark baby screwed up its face that was his son he thought of the halfcaste children in apia they had an unhealthy look sallow and pale and they were odiously precocious he had seen them on the boat going to school in new zealand and a school had to be chosen which took children with native blood in them they were huddled together brazen and yet timid with traits which set them apart strangely from white people they spoke the native language among themselves and when they grew up the men accepted smaller salaries because of their native blood girls might marry a white man but boys had no chance they must marry a halfcaste like themselves or a native lawson made up his mind passionately that he would take his son away from the humiliation of such a life at whatever cost he must get back to europe and when he went in to see ethel frail and lovely in her bed surrounded by native women his determination was strengthened if he took her away among his own people she would belong more completely to him he loved her so passionately he wanted her to be one soul and one body with him and he was conscious that here with those deep roots attaching her to the native life she would always keep something from him he went to work quietly urged by an obscure instinct of secrecy and wrote to a cousin who was partner in a shipping firm in aberdeen saying that his health on account of which like so many more he had come out to the islands was so much better there seemed no reason why he should not return to europe he asked him to use what influence he could to get him a job no matter how poorly paid on deeside where the climate was particularly suitable to such as suffered from diseases of the lungs it takes five or six weeks for letters to get from aberdeen to samoa and several had to be exchanged he had plenty of time to prepare ethel she was as delighted as a child he was amused to see how she boasted to her friends that she was going to england it was a step up for her she would be quite english there and she was excited at the interest the approaching departure gave her when at length a cable came offering him a post in a bank in kincardineshire she was beside herself with joy when their long journey over they were settled in the little scots town with its granite houses lawson realised how much it meant to him to live once more among his own people he looked back on the three years he had spent in apia as exile and returned to the life that seemed the only normal one with a sigh of relief it was good to play golf once more and to fish to fish properly that was poor fun in the pacific when you just threw in your line and pulled out one big sluggish fish after another from the crowded sea and it was good to see a paper every day with that days news and to meet men and women of your own sort people you could talk to and it was good to eat meat that was not frozen and to drink milk that was not canned they were thrown upon their own resources much more than in the pacific and he was glad to have ethel exclusively to himself after two years of marriage he loved her more devotedly than ever he could hardly bear her out of his sight and the need in him grew urgent for a more intimate communion between them but it was strange that after the first excitement of arrival she seemed to take less interest in the new life than he had expected she did not accustom herself to her surroundings she was a little lethargic as the fine autumn darkened into winter she complained of the cold she lay half the morning in bed and the rest of the day on a sofa reading novels sometimes but more often doing nothing she looked pinched never mind darling he said youll get used to it very soon and wait till the summer comes it can be almost as hot as in apia he felt better and stronger than he had done for years the carelessness with which she managed her house had not mattered in samoa but here it was out of place when anyone came he did not want the place to look untidy and laughing chaffing ethel a little he set about putting things in order ethel watched him indolently she spent long hours playing with her son she talked to him in the baby language of her own country to distract her lawson bestirred himself to make friends among the neighbours and now and then they went to little parties where the ladies sang drawingroom ballads and the men beamed in silent good nature ethel was shy she seemed to sit apart sometimes lawson seized with a sudden anxiety would ask her if she was happy yes im quite happy she answered but her eyes were veiled by some thought he could not guess she seemed to withdraw into herself so that he was conscious that he knew no more of her than when he had first seen her bathing in the pool he had an uneasy feeling that she was concealing something from him and because he adored her it tortured him you dont regret apia do you he asked her once oh no i think its very nice here an obscure misgiving drove him to make disparaging remarks about the island and the people there she smiled and did not answer very rarely she received a bundle of letters from samoa and then she went about for a day or two with a set pale face nothing would induce me ever to go back there he said once its no place for a white man but he grew conscious that sometimes when he was away ethel cried in apia she had been talkative chatting volubly about all the little details of their common life the gossip of the place but now she gradually became silent and though he increased his efforts to amuse her she remained listless it seemed to him that her recollections of the old life were drawing her away from him and he was madly jealous of the island and of the sea of brevald and all the darkskinned people whom he remembered now with horror when she spoke of samoa he was bitter and satirical one evening late in the spring when the birch trees were bursting into leaf coming home from a round of golf he found her not as usual lying on the sofa but at the window standing she had evidently been waiting for his return she addressed him the moment he came into the room to his amazement she spoke in samoan i cant stand it i cant live here any more i hate it i hate it for gods sake speak in a civilised language he said irritably she went up to him and clasped her arms around his body awkwardly with a gesture that had in it something barbaric lets go away from here lets go back to samoa if you make me stay here i shall die i want to go home her passion broke suddenly and she burst into tears his anger vanished and he drew her down on his knees he explained to her that it was impossible for him to throw up his job which after all meant his bread and butter his place in apia was long since filled he had nothing to go back to there he tried to put it to her reasonably the inconveniences of life there the humiliation to which they must be exposed and the bitterness it must cause their son scotlands wonderful for education and that sort of thing schools are good and cheap and he can go to the university at aberdeen ill make a real scot of him they had called him andrew lawson wanted him to become a doctor he would marry a white woman im not ashamed of being half native ethel said sullenly of course not darling theres nothing to be ashamed of with her soft cheek against his he felt incredibly weak you dont know how much i love you he said id give anything in the world to be able to tell you what ive got in my heart he sought her lips the summer came the highland valley was green and fragrant and the hills were gay with the heather one sunny day followed another in that sheltered spot and the shade of the birch trees was grateful after the glare of the high road ethel spoke no more of samoa and lawson grew less nervous he thought that she was resigned to her surroundings and he felt that his love for her was so passionate that it could leave no room in her heart for any longing one day the local doctor stopped him in the street i say lawson your missus ought to be careful how she bathes in our highland streams its not like the pacific you know lawson was surprised and had not the presence of mind to conceal the fact i didnt know she was bathing the doctor laughed a good many people have seen her it makes them talk a bit you know because it seems a rum place to choose the pool up above the bridge and bathing isnt allowed there but theres no harm in that i dont know how she can stand the water lawson knew the pool the doctor spoke of and suddenly it occurred to him that in a way it was just like that pool at upolu where ethel had been in the habit of bathing every evening a clear highland stream ran down a sinuous course rocky splashing gaily and then formed a deep smooth pool with a little sandy beach trees overshadowed it thickly not coconut trees but beeches and the sun played fitfully through the leaves on the sparkling water it gave him a shock with his imagination he saw ethel go there every day and undress on the bank and slip into the water cold colder than that of the pool she loved at home and for a moment regain the feeling of the past he saw her once more as the strange wild spirit of the stream and it seemed to him fantastically that the running water called her that afternoon he went along to the river he made his way cautiously among the trees and the grassy path deadened the sound of his steps presently he came to a spot from which he could see the pool ethel was sitting on the bank looking down at the water she sat quite still it seemed as though the water drew her irresistibly he wondered what strange thoughts wandered through her head at last she got up and for a minute or two she was hidden from his gaze then he saw her again wearing a mother hubbard and with her little bare feet she stepped delicately over the mossy bank she came to the waters edge and softly without a splash let herself down she swam about quietly and there was something not quite of a human being in the way she swam he did not know why it affected him so queerly he waited till she clambered out she stood for a moment with the wet folds of her dress clinging to her body so that its shape was outlined and then passing her hands slowly over her breasts gave a little sigh of delight then she disappeared lawson turned away and walked back to the village he had a bitter pain in his heart for he knew that she was still a stranger to him and his hungry love was destined ever to remain unsatisfied he did not make any mention of what he had seen he ignored the incident completely but he looked at her curiously trying to divine what was in her mind he redoubled the tenderness with which he used her he sought to make her forget the deep longing of her soul by the passion of his love then one day when he came home he was astonished to find her not in the house wheres mrs lawson he asked the maid she went into aberdeen sir with the baby the maid answered a little surprised at the question she said she would not be back till the last train oh all right he was vexed that ethel had said nothing to him about the excursion but he was not disturbed since of late she had been in now and again to aberdeen and he was glad that she should look at the shops and perhaps visit a cinema he went to meet the last train but when she did not come he grew suddenly frightened he went up to the bedroom and saw at once that her toilet things were no longer in their place he opened the wardrobe and the drawers they were half empty she had bolted he was seized with a passion of anger it was too late that night to telephone to aberdeen and make enquiries but he knew already all that his enquiries might have taught him with fiendish cunning she had chosen a time when they were making up their periodical accounts at the bank and there was no chance that he could follow her he was imprisoned by his work he took up a paper and saw that there was a boat sailing for australia next morning she must be now well on the way to london he could not prevent the sobs that were wrung painfully from him ive done everything in the world for her he cried and she had the heart to treat me like this how cruel how monstrously cruel after two days of misery he received a letter from her it was written in her schoolgirl hand she had always written with difficulty dear bertie i couldnt stand it any more im going back home goodbye ethel she did not say a single word of regret she did not even ask him to come too lawson was prostrated he found out where the ship made its first stop and though he knew very well she would not come sent a cable beseeching her to return he waited with pitiful anxiety he wanted her to send him just one word of love she did not even answer he passed through one violent phase after another at one moment he told himself that he was well rid of her and at the next that he would force her to return by withholding money he was lonely and wretched he wanted his boy and he wanted her he knew that whatever he pretended to himself there was only one thing to do and that was to follow her he could never live without her now all his plans for the future were like a house of cards and he scattered them with angry impatience he did not care whether he threw away his chances for the future for nothing in the world mattered but that he should get ethel back again as soon as he could he went into aberdeen and told the manager of his bank that he meant to leave at once the manager remonstrated the short notice was inconvenient lawson would not listen to reason he was determined to be free before the next boat sailed and it was not until he was on board of her having sold everything he possessed that in some measure he regained his calm till then to those who had come in contact with him he seemed hardly sane his last action in england was to cable to ethel at apia that he was joining her he sent another cable from sydney and when at last with the dawn his boat crossed the bar at apia and he saw once more the white houses straggling along the bay he felt an immense relief the doctor came on board and the agent they were both old acquaintances and he felt kindly towards their familiar faces he had a drink or two with them for old times sake and also because he was desperately nervous he was not sure if ethel would be glad to see him when he got into the launch and approached the wharf he scanned anxiously the little crowd that waited she was not there and his heart sank but then he saw brevald in his old blue clothes and his heart warmed towards him wheres ethel he said as he jumped on shore shes down at the bungalow shes living with us lawson was dismayed but he put on a jovial air well have you got room for me i daresay itll take a week or two to fix ourselves up oh yes i guess we can make room for you after passing through the customhouse they went to the hotel and there lawson was greeted by several of his old friends there were a good many rounds of drinks before it seemed possible to get away and when they did go out at last to brevalds house they were both rather gay he clasped ethel in his arms he had forgotten all his bitter thoughts in the joy of beholding her once more his motherinlaw was pleased to see him and so was the old wrinkled beldame her mother natives and halfcastes came in and they all sat round beaming on him brevald had a bottle of whisky and everyone who came was given a nip lawson sat with his little darkskinned boy on his knees they had taken his english clothes off him and he was stark with ethel by his side in a mother hubbard he felt like a returning prodigal in the afternoon he went down to the hotel again and when he got back he was more than gay he was drunk ethel and her mother knew that white men got drunk now and then it was what you expected of them and they laughed goodnaturedly as they helped him to bed but in a day or two he set about looking for a job he knew that he could not hope for such a position as that which he had thrown away to go to england but with his training he could not fail to be useful to one of the trading firms and perhaps in the end he would not lose by the change after all you cant make money in a bank he said trades the thing he had hopes that he would soon make himself so indispensable that he would get someone to take him into partnership and there was no reason why in a few years he should not be a rich man as soon as im fixed up well find ourselves a shack he told ethel we cant go on living here brevalds bungalow was so small that they were all piled on one another and there was no chance of ever being alone there was neither peace nor privacy well theres no hurry we shall be all right here till we find just what we want it took him a week to get settled and then he entered the firm of a man called bain but when he talked to ethel about moving she said she wanted to stay where she was till her baby was born for she was expecting another child lawson tried to argue with her if you dont like it she said go and live at the hotel he grew suddenly pale ethel how can you suggest that she shrugged her shoulders whats the good of having a house of our own when we can live here he yielded when lawson after his work went back to the bungalow he found it crowded with natives they lay about smoking sleeping drinking kava and they talked incessantly the place was grubby and untidy his child crawled about playing with native children and it heard nothing spoken but samoan he fell into the habit of dropping into the hotel on his way home to have a few cocktails for he could only face the evening and the crowd of friendly natives when he was fortified with liquor and all the time though he loved her more passionately than ever he felt that ethel was slipping away from him when the baby was born he suggested that they should get into a house of their own but ethel refused her stay in scotland seemed to have thrown her back on her own people now that she was once more among them with a passionate zest and she turned to her native ways with abandon lawson began to drink more every saturday night he went to the english club and got blind drunk he had the peculiarity that as he grew drunk he grew quarrelsome and once he had a violent dispute with bain his employer bain dismissed him and he had to look out for another job he was idle for two or three weeks and during these sooner than sit in the bungalow he lounged about in the hotel or at the english club and drank it was more out of pity than anything else that miller the germanamerican took him into his office but he was a business man and though lawsons financial skill made him valuable the circumstances were such that he could hardly refuse a smaller salary than he had had before and miller did not hesitate to offer it to him ethel and brevald blamed him for taking it since pedersen the halfcaste offered him more but he resented bitterly the thought of being under the orders of a halfcaste when ethel nagged him he burst out furiously ill see myself dead before i work for a nigger you may have to she said and in six months he found himself forced to this final humiliation the passion for liquor had been gaining on him he was often heavy with drink and he did his work badly miller warned him once or twice and lawson was not the man to accept remonstrance easily one day in the midst of an altercation he put on his hat and walked out but by now his reputation was well known and he could find no one to engage him for a while he idled and then he had an attack of delirium tremens when he recovered shameful and weak he could no longer resist the constant pressure and he went to pedersen and asked him for a job pedersen was glad to have a white man in his store and lawsons skill at figures made him useful from that time his degeneration was rapid the white people gave him the cold shoulder they were only prevented from cutting him completely by disdainful pity and by a certain dread of his angry violence when he was drunk he became extremely susceptible and was always on the lookout for affront he lived entirely among the natives and halfcastes but he had no longer the prestige of the white man they felt his loathing for them and they resented his attitude of superiority he was one of themselves now and they did not see why he should put on airs brevald who had been ingratiating and obsequious now treated him with contempt ethel had made a bad bargain there were disgraceful scenes and once or twice the two men came to blows when there was a quarrel ethel took the part of her family they found he was better drunk than sober for when he was drunk he would lie on the bed or on the floor sleeping heavily then he became aware that something was being hidden from him when he got back to the bungalow for the wretched half native supper which was his evening meal often ethel was not in if he asked where she was brevald told him she had gone to spend the evening with one or other of her friends once he followed her to the house brevald had mentioned and found she was not there on her return he asked her where she had been and she told him her father had made a mistake she had been to soandsos but he knew that she was lying she was in her best clothes her eyes were shining and she looked lovely dont try any monkey tricks on me my girl he said or ill break every bone in your body you drunken beast she said scornfully he fancied that mrs brevald and the old grandmother looked at him maliciously and he ascribed brevalds goodhumour with him so unusual those days to his satisfaction at having something up his sleeve against his soninlaw and then his suspicions aroused he imagined that the white men gave him curious glances when he came into the lounge of the hotel the sudden silence which fell upon the company convinced him that he had been the subject of the conversation something was going on and everyone knew it but himself he was seized with furious jealousy he believed that ethel was carrying on with one of the white men and he looked at one after the other with scrutinising eyes but there was nothing to give him even a hint he was helpless because he could find no one on whom definitely to fix his suspicions he went about like a raving maniac looking for someone on whom to vent his wrath chance caused him in the end to hit upon the man who of all others least deserved to suffer from his violence one afternoon when he was sitting in the hotel by himself moodily chaplin came in and sat down beside him perhaps chaplin was the only man on the island who had any sympathy for him they ordered drinks and chatted a few minutes about the races that were shortly to be run then chaplain said i guess we shall all have to fork out money for new dresses lawson sniggered since mrs chaplin held the pursestrings if she wanted a new frock for the occasion she would certainly not ask her husband for the money how is your missus asked chaplin desiring to be friendly what the hells that got to do with you said lawson knitting his dark brows i was only asking a civil question well keep your civil questions to yourself chaplin was not a patient man his long residence in the tropics the whisky bottle and his domestic affairs had given him a temper hardly more under control than lawsons look here my boy when youre in my hotel you behave like a gentleman or youll find yourself in the street before you can say knife lawsons lowering face grew dark and red let me just tell you once for all and you can pass it on to the others he said panting with rage if any of you fellows come messing round with my wife hed better look out who do you think wants to mess around with your wife im not such a fool as you think i can see a stone wall in front of me as well as most men and i warn you straight thats all im not going to put up with any hankypanky not on your life look here youd better clear out of here and come back when youre sober i shall clear out when i choose and not a minute before said lawson it was an unfortunate boast for chaplin in the course of his experience as a hotelkeeper had acquired a peculiar skill in dealing with gentlemen whose room he preferred to their company and the words were hardly out of lawsons mouth before he found himself caught by the collar and arm and hustled not without force into the street he stumbled down the steps into the blinding glare of the sun it was in consequence of this that he had his first violent scene with ethel smarting with humiliation and unwilling to go back to the hotel he went home that afternoon earlier than usual he found ethel dressing to go out as a rule she lay about in a mother hubbard barefoot with a flower in her dark hair but now in white silk stockings and highheeled shoes she was doing up a pink muslin dress which was the newest she had youre making yourself very smart he said where are you going im going to the crossleys ill come with you why she asked coolly i dont want you to gad about by yourself all the time youre not asked i dont care a damn about that youre not going without me youd better lie down till im ready she thought he was drunk and if he once settled himself on the bed would quickly drop off to sleep he sat down on a chair and began to smoke a cigarette she watched him with increasing irritation when she was ready he got up it happened by an unusual chance that there was no one in the bungalow brevald was working on the plantation and his wife had gone into apia ethel faced him im not going with you youre drunk thats a lie youre not going without me she shrugged her shoulders and tried to pass him but he caught her by the arm and held her let me go you devil she said breaking into samoan why do you want to go without me havent i told you im not going to put up with any monkey tricks she clenched her fist and hit him in the face he lost all control of himself all his love all his hatred welled up in him and he was beside himself ill teach you he shouted ill teach you he seized a ridingwhip which happened to be under his hand and struck her with it she screamed and the scream maddened him so that he went on striking her again and again her shrieks rang through the bungalow and he cursed her as he hit then he flung her on the bed she lay there sobbing with pain and terror he threw the whip away from him and rushed out of the room ethel heard him go and she stopped crying she looked round cautiously then she raised herself she was sore but she had not been badly hurt and she looked at her dress to see if it was damaged the native women are not unused to blows what he had done did not outrage her when she looked at herself in the glass and arranged her hair her eyes were shining there was a strange look in them perhaps then she was nearer loving him than she had ever been before but lawson driven forth blindly stumbled through the plantation and suddenly exhausted weak as a child flung himself on the ground at the foot of a tree he was miserable and ashamed he thought of ethel and in the yielding tenderness of his love all his bones seemed to grow soft within him he thought of the past and of his hopes and he was aghast at what he had done he wanted her more than ever he wanted to take her in his arms he must go to her at once he got up he was so weak that he staggered as he walked he went into the house and she was sitting in their cramped bedroom in front of her lookingglass oh ethel forgive me im so awfully ashamed of myself i didnt know what i was doing he fell on his knees before her and timidly stroked the skirt of her dress i cant bear to think of what i did its awful i think i was mad theres no one in the world i love as i love you id do anything to save you from pain and ive hurt you i can never forgive myself but for gods sake say you forgive me he heard her shrieks still it was unendurable she looked at him silently he tried to take her hands and the tears streamed from his eyes in his humiliation he hid his face in her lap and his frail body shook with sobs an expression of utter contempt came over her face she had the native womans disdain of a man who abased himself before a woman a weak creature and for a moment she had been on the point of thinking there was something in him he grovelled at her feet like a cur she gave him a little scornful kick get out she said i hate you he tried to hold her but she pushed him aside she stood up she began to take off her dress she kicked off her shoes and slid the stockings off her feet then she slipped on her old mother hubbard where are you going whats that got to do with you im going down to the pool let me come too he said he asked as though he were a child cant you even leave me that he hid his face in his hands crying miserably while she her eyes hard and cold stepped past him and went out from that time she entirely despised him and though herded together in the small bungalow lawson and ethel with her two children brevald his wife and her mother and the vague relations and hangerson who were always in and about they had to live cheek by jowl lawson ceasing to be of any account was hardly noticed he left in the morning after breakfast and came back only to have supper he gave up the struggle and when for want of money he could not go to the english club he spent the evening playing hearts with old brevald and the natives except when he was drunk he was cowed and listless ethel treated him like a dog she submitted at times to his fits of wild passion and she was frightened by the gusts of hatred with which they were followed but when afterwards he was cringing and lachrymose she had such a contempt for him that she could have spat in his face sometimes he was violent but now she was prepared for him and when he hit her she kicked and scratched and bit they had horrible battles in which he had not always the best of it very soon it was known all over apia that they got on badly there was little sympathy for lawson and at the hotel the general surprise was that old brevald did not kick him out of the place brevalds a pretty ugly customer said one of the men i shouldnt be surprised if he put a bullet into lawsons carcass one of these days ethel still went in the evenings to bathe in the silent pool it seemed to have an attraction for her that was not quite human just that attraction you might imagine that a mermaid who had won a soul would have for the cool salt waves of the sea and sometimes lawson went also i do not know what urged him to go for ethel was obviously irritated by his presence perhaps it was because in that spot he hoped to regain the clean rapture which had filled his heart when first he saw her perhaps only with the madness of those who love them that love them not from the feeling that his obstinacy could force love one day he strolled down there with a feeling that was rare with him now he felt suddenly at peace with the world the evening was drawing in and the dusk seemed to cling to the leaves of the coconut trees like a little thin cloud a faint breeze stirred them noiselessly a crescent moon hung just over their tops he made his way to the bank he saw ethel in the water floating on her back her hair streamed out all round her and she was holding in her hand a large hibiscus he stopped a moment to admire her she was like ophelia hulloa ethel he cried joyfully she made a sudden movement and dropped the red flower it floated idly away she swam a stroke or two till she knew there was ground within her depth and then stood up go away she said go away he laughed dont be selfish theres plenty of room for both of us why cant you leave me alone i want to be by myself hang it all i want to bathe he answered goodhumouredly go down to the bridge i dont want you here im sorry for that he said smiling still he was not in the least angry and he hardly noticed that she was in a passion he began to take off his coat go away she shrieked i wont have you here cant you even leave me this go away dont be silly darling she bent down and picked up a sharp stone and flung it quickly at him he had no time to duck it hit him on the temple with a cry he put his hand to his head and when he took it away it was wet with blood ethel stood still panting with rage he turned very pale and without a word taking up his coat went away ethel let herself fall back into the water and the stream carried her slowly down to the ford the stone had made a jagged wound and for some days lawson went about with a bandaged head he had invented a likely story to account for the accident when the fellows at the club asked him about it but he had no occasion to use it no one referred to the matter he saw them cast surreptitious glances at his head but not a word was said the silence could only mean that they knew how he came by his woundel commission but had a considerable drive towards doing the right thing about fuel and not one who had a singleminded unencumbered drive towards the right thing that said sir richmond is what makes life so interesting and in spite of a thousand tragic disappointments so hopeful every man is a bad man every man is a feeble man and every man is a good man my motives come and go yours do the same we vary in response to the circumstances about us given a proper atmosphere most men will be publicspirited rightliving generous given perplexities and darkness most of us can be cowardly and vile people say you cannot change human nature and perhaps that is true but you can change its responses endlessly the other day i was in bohemia discussing silesian coal with benes and i went to see the festival of the bohemian sokols opposite to where i sat far away across the arena was a great bank of men of the sokol organizations an unbroken brown mass wrapped in their brown uniform cloaks suddenly the sun came out and at a word the whole body flung back their cloaks showed their garibaldi shirts and became one solid blaze of red it was an amazing transformation until one understood what had happened yet nothing material had changed but the sunshine and given a change in laws and prevailing ideas and the very same people who are greedy traders grasping owners and revolting workers today will all throw their cloaks aside and you will find them working together cheerfully even generously for a common end they arent traders and owners and workers and so forth by any inner necessity those are just the ugly parts they play in the present drama which is nearly at the end of its run thats a hopeful view said miss grammont i dont see the flaw in it if there is a flaw there isnt one said sir richmond it is my chief discovery about life i began with the question of fuel and the energy it affords mankind and i have found that my generalization applies to all human affairs human beings are fools weaklings cowards passionate idiots i grant you that is the brown cloak side of them so to speak but they are not such fools and so forth that they cant do pretty well materially if once we hammer out a sane collective method of getting and using fuel which people generally will understand in the place of our present methods of snatch and wrangle of that i am absolutely convinced some work some help some willingness you can get out of everybody thats the red and the same principle applies to most labour and property problems to health to education to population social relationships and war and peace we havent got the right system we have inefficient halfbaked systems or no system at all and a wild confusion and war of ideas in all these respects but there is a right system possible none the less let us only hammer our way through to the sane and reasonable organization in this and that and the other human affairs and once we have got it we shall have got it for good we may not live to see even the beginnings of success but the spirit of order the spirit that has already produced organized science if only there are a few faithful persistent people to stick to the job will in the long run certainly save mankind and make human life clean and splendid happy work in a clear mind if i could live to see it and as for us in our time measured by the end we serve we dont matter you know we dont matter we have to find our fun in the building and in our confidence that we do really build so long as our confidence lasts there is no great hardship said sir richmond so long as our confidence lasts she repeated after him ah cried sir richmond there it is so long as our confidence lasts so long as one keeps ones mind steady that is what i came away with dr martineau to discuss i went to him for advice i havent known him for more than a month its amusing to find myself preaching forth to you it was just faith i had lost suddenly i had lost my power of work my confidence in the rightness of what i was doing evaporated my will failed me i dont know if you will understand what that means it wasnt that my reason didnt assure me just as certainly as ever that what i was trying to do was the right thing to try to do but somehow that seemed a cold and personally unimportant proposition the life had gone out of it he paused as if arrested by a momentary doubt i dont know why i tell you these things he said you tell them me she said its a little like a patient in a hydropath retailing his ailments no no go on i began to think now that what took the go out of me as my work went on was the lack of any real fellowship in what i was doing it was the pressure of the opposition in the committee day afterday it was being up against men who didnt reason against me but who just showed by everything they did that the things i wanted to achieve didnt matter to them one rap it was going back to a home lunching in clubs reading papers going about a world in which all the organization all the possibility of the organization i dream of is tacitly denied i dont know if it seems an extraordinary confession of weakness to you but that steady refusal of the majority of my committee to come into co operation with me has beaten me or at any rate has come very near to beating me most of them you know are such able men you can feel their knowledge and commonsense they and everybody about me seemed busy and intent upon more immediate things that seemed more real to them than this remote theoretical priggish end i have set for myself he paused go on said miss grammont i think i understand this and yet i know i am right i know you are right im certain go on if one of those ten thousand members of the sokol society had thrown back his brown cloak and shown red when all the others still kept them selves cloaked if he was a normal sensitive man he might have felt something of a fool he might have felt premature and presumptuous red he was and the others he knew were red also but why show it that is the peculiar distress of people like ourselves who have some sense of history and some sense of a larger life within us than our merely personal life we dont want to go on with the old story merely we want to live somehow in that larger life and to live for its greater ends and lose something unbearable of ourselves and in wanting to do that we are only wanting to do what nearly everybody perhaps is ripe to do and will presently want to do when the new age martineau talks about begins to come it may come very quickly as the red came at prague but for the present everyone hesitates about throwing back the cloak until the cloak becomes unbearable she said repeating his word i came upon this holiday in the queerest state i thought i was ill i thought i was overworked but the real trouble was a loneliness that robbed me of all driving force nobody seemed thinking and feeling with me i have never realized until now what a gregarious beast man is it needed only a day or so with martineau in the atmosphere of ideas and beliefs like my own to begin my restoration now as i talk to you that is why i have clutched at your company because here you are coming from thousands of miles away and you talk my ideas you fall into my ways of thought as though we had gone to the same school perhaps we have gone to the same school she said you mean disappointment disillusionment having to find something better in life than the first things it promised us but you disappointed i thought that in america people might be educating already on different lines even in america miss grammont said crops only grow on the ploughed land section glastonbury in the afternoon was wonderful they talked of avalon and of that vanished legendary world of king arthur and his knights and in the early evening they came to wells and a pleasant inn with a quaint little garden before its front door that gave directly upon the cathedral the three tourists devoted a golden half hour before dinner to the sculptures on the western face the great screen of wrought stone rose up warmly grey and clear and distinct against a clear blue sky in which the moon hung round and already bright that western facade with its hundreds of little figures tells the whole story of god and man from adam to the last judgment as the mediaeval mind conceived it it is an even fuller exposition than the carved bible history that goes round the chapter house at salisbury it presented the universe said sir richmond as a complete crystal globe it explained everything in life in a simple and natural manner hope heaven devil and despair generations had lived and died mentally within that crystal globe convinced that it was all and complete and now said miss grammont we are in limitless space and time the crystal globe is broken and said belinda amazingly for she had been silent for some time the goldfish are on the floor vv free to flop about are they any happier it was one of those sudden rhetorical triumphs that are best left alone i trow not said belinda giving the last touch to it after dinner sir richmond and miss grammont walked round the cathedral and along by the moat of the bishops palace and miss seyffert stayed in the hotel to send off postcards to her friends a duty she had neglected for some days the evening was warm and still and the moon was approaching its full and very bright insensibly the soft afterglow passed into moonlight at first the two companions talked very little sir richmond was well content with this tacit friendliness and miss grammont was preoccupied because she was very strongly moved to tell him things about herself that hitherto she had told to no one it was not merely that she wanted to tell him these things but also that for reasons she did not put as yet very clearly to herself she thought they were things he ought to know she talked of herself at first in general terms life comes on anyone with a rush childhood seems lasting for ever and then suddenly one tears into life she said it was even more so for women than it was for men you are shown life a crowded vast spectacle full of what seems to be intensely interesting activities and endless delightful and frightful and tragic possibilities and you have hardly had time to look at it before you are called upon to make decisions and there is something in your blood that urges you to decisive acts your mind your reason resists give me time it says they clamour at you with treats crowds shows theatres all sorts of things lovers buzz at you each trying to fix you part of his life when you are trying to get clear to live a little of your own her father had had one merit at any rate he had been jealous of her lovers and very ready to interfere i wanted a lover to love she said every girl of course wants that i wanted to be tremendously excited and at the same time i dreaded the enormous interference i wasnt temperamentally a cold girl men interested and excited me but there were a lot of men about and they clashed with each other perhaps way down in some out of the way place i should have fallen in love quite easily with the one man who came along but no man fixed his image after a year or so i think i began to lose the power which is natural to a young girl of falling very easily into love i became critical of the youths and men who were attracted to me and i became analytical about myself i suppose it is because you and i are going to part so soon that i can speak so freely to you but there are things about myself that i have never had out even with myself i can talk to myself in you she paused baffled i know exactly said sir richmond in my composition i perceive there have always been two ruling strains i was a spoilt child at home a rather reserved girl at school keen on my dignity i liked respect i didnt give myself away i suppose one would call that personal pride anyhow it was that streak made me value the position of being a rich married woman in new york that was why i became engaged to lake he seemed to be as good a man as there was about he said he adored me and wanted me to crown his life he wasnt illlooking or illmannered the second main streak in my nature wouldnt however fit in with that she stopped short the second streak said sir richmond oh love of beauty love of romance i want to give things their proper names i dont want to pretend to you it was more or less than that it was imaginative sensuousness why should i pretend it wasnt in me i believe that streak is in all women i believe so too in all properly constituted women i tried to devote that streak to lake she said i did my best for him but lake was much too much of a gentleman or an idealist about women or what you will to know his business as a lover and that side of me fell in love the rest of me protesting with a man named caston it was a notorious affair everybody in new york couples my name with caston except when my father is about his jealousy has blasted an area of silence in that matter all round him he will not know of that story and they dare not tell him i should pity anyone who tried to tell it him what sort of man was this caston miss grammont seemed to consider she did not look at sir richmond she kept her profile to him he was she said deliberately a very rotten sort of man she spoke like one resolved to be exact and judicial i believe i always knew he wasnt right but he was very handsome and ten years younger than lake and nobody else seemed to be all right so i swallowed that he was an artist a painter perhaps you know his work sir richmond shook his head he could make american business men look like characters out of the three musketeers they said and he was beginning to be popular he made love to me in exactly the way lake didnt if i shut my eyes to one or two things it was delightful i liked it but my father would have stood a painter as my husband almost as cheerfully as he would a man of colour i made a fool of myself as people say about caston well when the war came he talked in a way that irritated me he talked like an east side annunzio about art and war it made me furious to know it was all talk and that he didnt mean business i made him go she paused for a moment he hated to go then i relented or i missed him and i wanted to be made love to or i really wanted to go on my own account i forget i forget my motives altogether now that early war time was a queer time for everyone a kind of wildness got into the blood i threw over lake all the time things had been going on in new york i had still been engaged to lake i went to france i did good work i did do good work and also things were possible that would have seemed fantastic in america you know something of the wartime atmosphere there was death everywhere and people snatched at gratifications caston made tomorrow we die his text we contrived three days in paris together not very cleverly all sorts of people know about it we went very far she stopped short well said sir richmond he did die another long pause they told me caston had been killed but someone hinted or i guessed that there was more in it than an ordinary casualty nobody i think realizes that i know this is the first time i have ever confessed that i do know he was shot he was shot for cowardice that might happen to any man said sir richmond presently no man is a hero all round the twentyfour hours perhaps he was caught by circumstances unprepared he may have been taken by surprise it was the most calculated coldblooded cowardice imaginable he let three other men go on and get killed no it is no good your inventing excuses for a man you know nothing about it was vile contemptible cowardice and meanness it fitted in with a score of ugly little things i remembered it explained them all i know the evidence and the judgment against him were strictly just and true because they were exactly in character and that you see was my man that was the lover i had chosen that was the man to whom i had given myself with both hands her soft unhurrying voice halted for a time and then resumed in the same even tones of careful statement i wasnt disgusted not even with myself about him i was chiefly sorry intensely sorry because i had made him come out of a life that suited and protected him to the war about myself i was stunned and perplexed i had the clearest realization that what you and i have been calling the bright little personal life had broken off short and was spoilt and over and done with i felt as though it was my body they had shot and there i was with fifty years of life left in me and nothing particular to do with them that was just the prelude to life said sir richmond it didnt seem so at the time i felt i had to got hold of something or go to pieces i couldnt turn to religion i had no religion and duty what is duty i set myself to that i had a kind of revelation one night either i find out what all this world is about i said or i perish i have lost myself and i must forget myself by getting hold of something bigger than myself and becoming that thats why i have been making a sort of historical pilgrimage thats my story sir richmond thats my education somehow though your troubles are different it seems to me that my little muddle makes me understand how it is with you what youve got this idea of a scientific ordering of the world is what i in my younger less experienced way have been feeling my way towards i want to join on i want to got hold of this idea of a great fuel control in the world and of a still greater economic and educational control of which it is a part i want to make that idea a part of myself rather i want to make myself a part of it when you talk of it i believe in it altogether and i believe in it when i talk of it to you section sir richmond was stirred very deeply by miss grammonts confidences his dispute with dr martineau was present in his mind so that he did not want to make love to her but he was extremely anxious to express his vivid sense of the value of her friendship and while he hesitated over this difficult and unfamiliar task she began to talk again of herself and in such a way as to give a new turn to sir richmonds thoughts perhaps i ought to tell you a little more about myself she said now that i have told you so much i did a thing that still puzzles me i was filled with a sense of hopeless disaster in france and i suppose i had some sort of desperate idea of saving something out of the situation i renewed my correspondence with gunter lake he made the suggestion i knew he would make and i renewed our engagement to go back to wealth and dignity in new york yes but you dont love him thats always been plain to me but what i didnt realize until i had given my promise over again was that i dislike him acutely you hadnt realized that before i hadnt thought about him sufficiently but now i had to think about him a lot the other affair had given me an idea perhaps of what it means to be married to a man and here i am drifting back to him the horrible thing about him is the steady enveloping way in which he has always come at me without fellowship without any community of ideas ready to make the most extraordinary bargains so long as he can in any way fix me and get me what does it mean what is there behind those watching soliciting eyes of his i dont in the least love him and this desire and service and all the rest of it he offers me its not love its not even such love as caston gave me its a game he plays with his imagination she had released a flood of new ideas in sir richmonds mind this is illuminating he said you dislike lake acutely you always have disliked him i suppose i have but its only now i admit it to myself yes and you might for example have married him in new york before the war it came very near to that and then probably you wouldnt have discovered you disliked him you wouldnt have admitted it to yourself i suppose i shouldnt i suppose i should have tried to believe i loved him women do this sort of thing odd i never realized it before and there are endless wives suppressing an acute dislike my wife does i see now quite clearly that she detests me reasonably enough from her angle im entirely detestable but she wont admit it wont know of it she never will to the end of my life always she will keep that detestation unconfessed she puts a face on the matter we both do and this affair of yours have you thought how unjust it is to lake not nearly so much as i might have done it is unfair to him atrociously unfair hes not my sort of man perhaps but it will hurt him cruelly according to the peculiar laws of his being he seems to me a crawling sort of lover with an immense selfconceit at the back of his crawlingness he has she endorsed he backs himself to crawl until he crawls triumphantly right over you i dont like to think of the dream he has i take it he will lose is it fair to go into this game with him in the interests of lake she said smiling softly at sir richmond in the moonlight but you are perfectly right and suppose he doesnt lose sir richmond found himself uttering sentiments there is only one decent way in which a civilized man and a civilized woman may approach one another passionate desire is not enough what is called love is not enough pledges rational considerations all these things are worthless all these things are compatible with hate the primary essential is friendship clear understanding absolute confidence then within that condition in that elect relationship love is permissible mating marriage or no marriage as you will all things are permissible came a long pause between them dear old cathedral said miss grammont a little irrelevantly she had an air of having concluded something that to sir richmond seemed scarcely to have begun she stood looking at the great dark facade edged with moonlight for some moments and then turned towards the hotel which showed a pinklit window i wonder she said if belinda is still up and what she will think when i tell her of the final extinction of mr lake i think she rather looked forward to being the intimate friend secrets and everything of mrs gunter lake section sir richmond woke up at dawn and he woke out of an extraordinary dream he was saying to miss grammont there is no other marriage than the marriage of true minds there is no other marriage than the marriage of true minds he saw her as he had seen her the evening before light and cool coming towards him in the moonlight from the hotel but also in the inconsistent way of dreams he was very close to her kind faintly smiling face and his eyes were wet with tears and he was kissing her hand my dear wife and mate he was saying and suddenly he was kissing her cool lips he woke up and stared at his dream which faded out only very slowly before the fresh sun rise upon the red tiles and tree boughs outside the open window and before the first stir and clamour of the birds he felt like a court in which some overwhelmingly revolutionary piece of evidence had been tendered all the elaborate defence had broken down at one blow he sat up on the edge of his bed facing the new fact this is monstrous and ridiculous he said and martineau judged me exactly i am in love with her i am head over heels in love with her i have never been so much in love or so truly in love with anyone before section that was the dawn of a long day of tension for sir richmond and miss grammont because each was now vividly aware of being in love with the other and so neither was able to see how things were with the other they were afraid of each other a restraint had come upon them both a restraint that was greatly enhanced by their sense of belinda acutely observant ostentatiously tactful and selfeffacing and prepared at the slightest encouragement to be overwhelmingly romantic and sympathetic their talk waned and was revived to an artificial activity and waned again the historical interest had evaporated from the west of england and left only an urgent and embarrassing present but the loveliness of the weather did not fail and the whole day was set in severn landscapes they first saw the great river like a sea with the welsh mountains hanging in the sky behind as they came over the mendip crest above shipham they saw it again as they crossed the hill before clifton bridge and so they continued climbing to hill crests for views at alveston and near dursley and so to gloucester and the lowest bridge and thence back down stream again through fat meadow lands at first and much appleblossom and then over gentle hills through wide pale nownham and lidney and alvington and woolaston to old chepstow and its brown castle always with the widening estuary to the left of them and its foaming shoals and shining sand banks from chepstow they turned back north along the steep wye gorge to tintern and there at the snug little beaufort arms with its prim lawn and flower garden they ended the days journey tintern abbey they thought a poor graceless mass of ruin down beside the river and it was fenced about jealously and locked up from their invasion after dinner sir richmond and miss grammont went for a walk in the mingled twilight and moonlight up the hill towards chepstow both of them were absurdly and nervously pressing to belinda to come with them but she was far too wise to take this sudden desire for her company seriously her dinner shoes she said were too thin perhaps she would change and come out a little later yes come later said miss grammont and led the way to the door they passed through the garden i think we go up the hill said sir richmond yes she agreed up the hill followed a silence sir richmond made an effort but after some artificial and disconnected talk about tintern abbey concerning which she had no history ready and then still lamer about whether monmouthshire is in england or wales silence fell again the silence lengthened assumed a significance a dignity that no common words might break then sir richmond spoke i love you he said with all my heart her soft voice came back after a stillness i love you she said with all myself i had long ceased to hope said sir richmond that i should ever find a friend a lover perfect companionship they went on walking side by side without touching each other or turning to each other all the things i wanted to think i believe have come alive in me she said cool and sweet said sir richmond such happiness as i could not have imagined the light of a silent bicycle appeared above them up the hill and swept down upon them lit their two still faces brightly and passed my dear she whispered in the darkness between the high hedges they stopped short and stood quite still trembling he saw her face dim and tender looking up to his then he took her in his arms and kissed her lips as he had desired in his dream when they returned to the inn belinda seyffert offered flat explanations of why she had not followed them and enlarged upon the moonlight effect of the abbey ruins from the inn lawn but the scared congratulations in her eyes betrayed her recognition that momentous things had happened between the two pardpardeftabsaqlqnatural fbfs cf chapter the pardpardeftabqlqnatural fbfsfsmilli cf eighth full moon section sir richmond had talked in the moonlight and shadows of having found such happiness as he could not have imagined but when he awoke in the night that happiness had evaporated he awoke suddenly out of this love dream that had lasted now for nearly four days and he awoke in a mood of astonishment and dismay he had thought that when he parted from dr martineau he had parted also from that process of selfexploration that they had started together but now he awakened to find it established and in full activity in his mind something or someone a sort of etherealized martineauhardy an abstracted intellectual conscience was demanding what he thought he was doing with miss grammont and whither he thought he was taking her how he proposed to reconcile the close relationship with her that he was now embarked upon with in the first place his work upon and engagements with the fuel commission and in the second place martin leeds curiously enough lady hardy didnt come into the case at all he had done his utmost to keep martin leeds out of his head throughout the development of this affair now in an unruly and determined way that was extremely characteristic of her she seemed resolute to break in she appeared as an advocate without affection for her client but without any hostility of the claims of miss grammont to be let alone the elaborate pretence that sir richmond had maintained to himself that he had not made love to miss grammont that their mutual attraction had been irresistible and had achieved its end in spite of their resolute and complete detachment collapsed and vanished from his mind he admitted to himself that driven by a kind of instinctive necessity he had led their conversation step by step to a realization and declaration of love and that it did not exonerate him in the least that miss grammont had been quite ready and willing to help him and meet him half way she wanted love as a woman does more than a man does and he had steadily presented himself as a man free to love able to love and loving she wanted a man to love she wanted perfected fellowship and you have made her that tremendous promise that was implicit in your embrace and how can you keep that promise it was as if martin spoke it was her voice it was the very quality of her thought you belong to this work of yours which must needs be interrupted or abandoned if you take her whatever is not mortgaged to your work is mortgaged to me for the strange thing in all this is that you and i love one another and have no power to do otherwise in spite of all this you have nothing to give her but stolen goods said the shadow of martin you have nothing to give anyone personally any more think of the love that she desires and think of this love that you can give is there any new thing in you that you can give her that you havent given me you and i know each other very well perhaps i know you too well havent you loved me as much as you can love anyone think of all that there has been between us that you are ready now eager now to set aside and forget as though it had never been for four days you have kept me out of your mind in order to worship her yet you have known i was there for all you would not know no one else will ever be so intimate with you as i am we have quarrelled together wept together jested happily and jested bitterly you have spared me not at all pitiless and cruel you have been to me you have reckoned up all my faults against me as though they were sins you have treated me at times unlovingly never was lover treated so unlovingly as you have sometimes treated me and yet i have your love as no other woman can ever have it even now when you are wildly in love with this girls freshness and boldness and cleverness i come into your mind by right and necessity she is different argued sir richmond but you are the same said the shadow of martin with martins unsparing return your love has never been a steadfast thing it comes and goes like the wind you are an extravagantly imperfect lover but i have learnt to accept you as people accept the english weather never in all your life have you loved wholly fully steadfastly as people deserve to be loved not your mother nor your father not your wife nor your children nor me nor our child nor any living thing pleasant to all of us at times at times bitterly disappointing you do not even love this work of yours steadfastly this work to which you sacrifice us all in turn you do not love enough that is why you have these moods and changes that is why you have these lassitudes so it is you are made and that is why you must not take this brave young life so much simpler and braver than your own and exalt it as you can do and then fail it as you will do sir richmonds mind and body lay very still for a time should i fail her for a time martin leeds passed from the foreground of his mind he was astonished to think how planless instinctive and unforeseeing his treatment of miss grammont had been it had been just a blind drive to get hold of her and possess her suddenly his passion for her became active in its defence again but is there such a thing as a perfect love is yours a perfect love my dear martin with its insatiable jealousy its ruthless criticism has the world ever seen a perfect lover yet isnt it our imperfection that brings us together in a common need is miss grammont after all likely to get a more perfect love in all her life than this poor love of mine and isnt it good for her that she should love perfect love cherishes perfect love foregoes sir richmond found his mind wandering far away from the immediate question perfect love the phrase was his point of departure was it true that he could not love passionately and completely was that fundamentally what was the matter with him was that perhaps what was the matter with the whole world of mankind it had not yet come to that power of loving which makes action full and simple and direct and unhesitating man upon his planet has not grown up to love is still an eager egotistical and fluctuating adolescent he lacks the courage to love and the wisdom to love love is here but it comes and goes it is mixed with greeds and jealousies and cowardice and cowardly reservations one hears it only in snatches and single notes it is like something tuning up before the music begins the metaphor altogether ran away with sir richmonds half dreaming mind some day perhaps all life would go to music love was music and power if he had loved enough he need never have drifted away from his wife love would have created love would have tolerated and taught and inspired where there is perfect love there is neither greed nor impatience he would have done his work calmly he would have won his way with his committee instead of fighting and quarrelling with it perpetually flimsy creatures he whispered uncertain health uncertain strength a will that comes and goes moods of baseness moods of utter beastliness love like april sunshine april he dozed and dreamt for a time of spring passing into a high summer sunshine into a continuing music of love he thought of a world like some great playhouse in which players and orchestra and audience all cooperate in a noble production without dissent or conflict he thought he was the savage of thirty thousand years ago dreaming of the great world that is still perhaps thirty thousand years ahead his effort to see more of that coming world than indistinct and cloudy pinnacles and to hear more than a vague music dissolved his dream and left him awake again and wrestling with the problem of miss grammont section the shadow of martin stood over him inexorable he had to release miss grammont from the adventure into which he had drawn her this decision stood out sternand inevitable in his mind with no conceivable alternative as he looked at the task before him he began to realize its difficulty he was profoundly in love with her he was still only learning how deeply and she was not going to play a merely passive part in this affair she was perhaps as deeply in love with him he could not bring himself to the idea of confessions and disavowals he could not bear to think of her disillusionment he felt that he owed it to her not to disillusion her to spoil things for her in that fashion to turn into something mean and ugly after she has believed in me it would be like playing a practical joke upon her it would be like taking her into my arms and suddenly making a grimace at her it would scar her with a second humiliation should he take her on to bath or exeter tomorrow and contrive by some sudden arrival of telegrams that he had to go from her suddenly but a mere sudden parting would not end things between them now unless he went off abruptly without explanations or any arrangements for further communications at the outset of this escapade there had been a tacit but evident assumption that it was to end when she joined her father at falmouth it was with an effect of discovery that sir richmond realized that now it could not end in that fashion that with the whisper of love and the touching of lips something had been started that would go on that would develop to break off now and go away without a word would leave a raw and torn end would leave her perplexed and perhaps even more humiliated with an aching mystery to distress her why did he go was it something i said something he found out or imagined parting had disappeared as a possible solution of this problem she and he had got into each others lives to stay the real problem was the terms upon which they were to stay in each others lives close association had brought them to the point of being in the completest sense lovers that could not be and the real problem was the transmutation of their relationship to some form compatible with his honour and her happiness a word an idea from some recent reading floated into sir richmonds head sublimate he whispered we have to sublimate this affair we have to put this relationship upon a higher plane his mind stopped short at that presently his voice sounded out of the depths of his heart god how i loathe the higher plane god has put me into this higher plane business like some poor little kid who has to wear irons on its legs i want her do you hear martin i want her as if by a lightning flash he saw his car with himself and miss grammont miss seyffert had probably fallen out traversing europe and asia in headlong flight to a sunlit beach in the south seas his thoughts presently resumed as though these unmannerly and fantastic interruptions had not occurred we have to carry the whole affair on to a higher plane and keep it there we two love one another that has to be admitted now i ought never to have touched her i ought never to have thought of touching her but we two are too high our aims and work and obligations are too high for any ordinary love making that sort of thing would embarrass us would spoil everything spoil everything he repeated rather like a small boy who learns an unpalatable lesson for a time sir richmond exhausted by moral effort lay staring at the darkness it has to be done i believe i can carry her through with it if i can carry myself shes a finer thing than i am on the whole i am glad its only one more day belinda will be about afterwards we can write to each other if we can get over the next day it will be all right then we can write about fuel and politics and there wont be her voice and her presence we shall really sublimate first class idea sublimate and i will go back to dear old martin whos all alone there and miserable ill be kind to her and play my part and tell her her carbuncle scar rather becomes her and in a little while i shall be altogether in love with her again queer what a brute ive always been to martin queer that martin can come in a dream to me and take the upper hand with me queer that now i love martin he thought still more profoundly by the time the committee meets again i shall have been tremendously refreshed he repeated put things on the higher plane and keep them there then go back to martin and so to the work thats it nothing so pacifies the mind as a clearcut purpose sir richmond fell asleep during the fourth recapitulation of this programme section when miss grammont appeared at breakfast sir richmond saw at once that she too had had a restless night when she came into the little long breakfast room of the inn with its brown screens and its neat white tables it seemed to him that the miss grammont of his nocturnal speculations the beautiful young lady who had to be protected and managed and loved unselfishly vanished like some exorcised intruder instead was this real dear young woman who had been completely forgotten during the reign of her simulacrum and who now returned completely remembered familiar friendly intimate she touched his hand for a moment she met his eyes with the shadow of a smile in her own oranges said belinda from the table by the window beautiful oranges she had been preparing them poor transatlantic exile after the fashion in which grape fruits are prepared upon liners and in the civilized world of the west hes getting us tea spoons said belinda as they sat down this is realler england than ever she said ive been up an hour i found a little path down to the river bank its the greenest morning world and full of wild flowers look at these thats ladys smock said sir richmond its not really a flower its a quotation from shakespeare and there are cowslips cuckoo buds of yellow hue do paint the meadows with delight all the english flowers come out of shakespeare i dont know what we did before his time the waiter arrived with the tea spoons for the oranges belinda having distributed these resumed her discourse of enthusiasm for england she asked a score of questions about gloucester and chepstow the severn and the romans and the welsh and did not wait for the answers she did not want answers she talked to keep things going her talk masked a certain constraint that came upon her companions after the first mornings greetings were over sir richmond as he had planned upstairs produced two michelin maps today he said we will run back to bath from which it will be easy for you to train to falmouth we will go by monmouth and then turn back through the forest of dean where you will get glimpses of primitive coal mines still worked by two men and a boy with a windlass and a pail perhaps we will go through cirencester i dont know perhaps it is better to go straight to bath in the very heart of bath you will find yourselves in just the same world you visited at pompeii bath is pompeii overlaid by jane austens england he paused for a moment we can wire to your agents from here before we start and we can pick up their reply at gloucester or nailsworth or even bath itself so that if your father is nearer than we suppose but i think tomorrow afternoon will be soon enough for falmouth anyhow he stopped interrogatively miss grammonts face was white that will do very well she said section they started but presently they came to high banks that showed such masses of bluebells ragged robin great stitchwort and the like that belinda was not to be restrained she clamoured to stop the car and go up the bank and pick her hands full and so they drew up by the roadside and sir richmond and miss grammont sat down near the car while belinda carried her enthusiastic onslaught on the flowers up the steep bank and presently out of earshot the two lovers said unheeded things about the flowers to each other and then fell silent then miss grammont turned her head and seemed deliberately to measure her companions distance evidently she judged her out of earshot well said miss grammont in her soft even voice we love one another is that so still i could not love you more it wasnt a dream no and tomorrow we part he looked her in the eyes i have been thinking of that all night he said at last i too and you think that we must part just as we arranged it when was it three days or three ages ago there is nothing else in the world to do except for us to go our ways i love you that means for a woman it means that i want to be with you but that is impossible dont doubt whether i love you because i say impossible sir richmond faced with his own nocturnal decision was now moved to oppose it flatly nothing that one can do is impossible she glanced again at belinda and bent down towards him suppose she said you got back into that car with me suppose that instead of going on as we have planned you took me away how much of us would go you would go said sir richmond and my heart and this work of yours and your honour for the honour of a man in this new age of yours will be first of all in the work he does for the world and you will leave your work to be just a lover and the work that i might do because of my fathers wealth all that would vanish too we should leave all of that all of our usefulness all that much of ourselves but what has made me love you just your breadth of vision just the sense that you mattered what has made you love me just that i have understood the dream of your work all that we should have to leave behind we should specialize in our own scandal we should run away just for one thing to think by sharing the oldest simplest dearest indulgences in the world that we had got each other when really we had lost each other lost all that mattered her face was flushed with the earnestness of her conviction her eyes were bright with tears dont think i dont love you its so hard to say all this somehow it seems like going back on something something supreme our instincts have got us dont think id hold myself from you dear id give myself to you with both hands i love you when a woman loves i at any rate she loves altogether but this thing i am convinced cannot be i must go my own way the way i have to go my father is the man obstinate more than half a savage for me i know it he has the jealousy of ten husbands if you take me if our secret becomes manifest if you are to take me and keep me then his life and your life will become wholly this feud nothing but this feud you have to fight him anyhow that is why i of all people must keep out of the quarrel for him it would be an immense excitement full of the possibility of fierce satisfactions for you whether you won me or lost me it would be utter waste and ruin she paused and then went on and for me too waste and ruin i shall be a woman fought over i shall be fought over as dogs fight over a bone i shall sink back to the level of helen of troy i shall cease to be a free citizen a responsible free person whether you win me or lose me it will be waste and ruin for us both your fuel commission will go to pieces all the wide enduring work you have set me dreaming about will go the same way we shall just be another romantic story no sir richmond sat still a little like a sullen child she thought i hate all this he said slowly i didnt think of your father before and now i think of him it sets me bristling for a fight it makes all this harder to give up and yet do you know in the night i was thinking i was coming to conclusions very like yours for quite other reasons i thought we ought not to we have to keep friends anyhow and hear of each other that goes without saying i thought we ought not to go on to be lovers in any way that would affect you touch you too closely i was sorry i had kissed you not i no dont be sorry for that i am glad we have fallen in love more glad than i have been of anything else in my life and glad we have spoken plainly though we have to part and her whisper came close to him for a whole day yet all round the clock twice you and i have one another miss seyffert began speaking as soon as she was well within earshot i dont know the name of a single one of these flowers she cried except the bluebells look at this great handful ive gotten springtime in italy doesnt compare with it not for a moment section because belinda seyffert was in the dicky behind them with her alert interest in their emotions all too thinly and obviously veiled it seemed more convenient to sir richmond and miss grammont to talk not of themselves but of man and woman and of that new age according to the prophet martineau which sir richmond had partly described and mainly invented and ascribed to his departed friend they talked anthropologically philosophically speculatively with an absurd pretence of detachment they sat side by side in the little car scarcely glancing at one another but side by side and touching each other and all the while they were filled with tenderness and love and hunger for one another in the course of a day or so they had touched on nearly every phase in the growth of man and woman from that remote and brutish past which has left its traces in human bones mingled with the bones of hyaenas and cave bears beneath the stalagmites of wookey hole near wells in those nearly forgotten days the mind of man and woman had been no more than an evanescent succession of monstrous and infantile imaginations that brief journey in the west country had lit up phase after phase in the long teaching and discipline of man as he had developed depth of memory and fixity of purpose out of these raw beginnings through the dreaming childhood of avebury and stonehenge and the crude boyhood of ancient wars and massacres sir richmond recalled those phases now and how as they had followed one another mans idea of woman and womans idea of man had changed with them until nowadays in the minds of civilized men brute desire and possession and a limitless jealousy had become almost completely overlaid by the desire for fellowship and a free mutual loyalty overlaid he said the older passions are still there like the fires in an engine he invented a saying for dr martineau that the man in us today was still the old man of palaeolithic times with his will his wrath against the universe increased rather than diminished if to day he ceases to crack his brothers bones and rape and bully his womenkind it is because he has grown up to a greater game and means to crack this world and feed upon its marrow and wrench their secrets from the stars and furthermore it would seem that the prophet martineau had declared that in this new age that was presently to dawn for mankind jealousy was to be disciplined even as we had disciplined lust and anger instead of ruling our law it was to be ruled by law and custom no longer were the jealousy of strange peoples the jealousy of ownership and the jealousy of sex to determine the framework of human life there was to be one peace and law throughout the world one economic scheme and a universal freedom for men and women to possess and give themselves and how many generations yet must there be before we reach that utopia miss grammont asked i wouldnt put it at a very great distance but think of all the confusions of the world confusions merely the world is just a muddle of states and religions and theories and stupidities there are great lumps of disorderly strength in it but as a whole it is a weak world it goes on by habit theres no great idea in possession and the only possible great idea is this one the new age may be nearer than we dare to suppose if i could believe that there are many more people think as we do than you suppose are you and i such very strange and wonderful and exceptional people no i dont think so and yet the new world is already completely established in our hearts what has been done in our minds can be done in most minds in a little while the muddled angry mind of man upon his planet will grow clear and it will be this idea that will have made it clear and then life will be very different for everyone that tyranny of disorder which oppresses every life on earth now will be lifted there will be less and less insecurity less and less irrational injustice it will be a better instructed and a better behaved world we shall live at our ease not perpetually anxious not resentful and angry and that will alter all the rules of love then we shall think more of the loveliness of other people because it will no longer be necessary to think so much of the dangers and weaknesses and pitifulliesses of other people we shall not have to think of those who depend upon us for happiness and selfrespect we shall not have to choose between a wasteful fight for a personal end or the surrender of our hearts desire hearts desire she whispered am i indeed your hearts desire sir richmond sank his head and voice in response you are the best of all things and i have to let you go sir richmond suddenly remembered miss seyffert and half turned his face towards her her forehead was just visible over the hood of the open coupe she appeared to be intelligently intent upon the scenery then he broke out suddenly into a tirade against the world but i am bored by this jostling unreasonable world at the bottom of my heart i am bitterly resentful today this is a world of fools and brutes in which we live a world of idiotic traditions imbecile limitations cowardice habit greed and mean cruelty it is a slum of a world a congested district an insanitary jumble of souls and bodies every good thing every sweet desire is thwarted every one i have to lead the life of a slum missionary a sanitary inspector an underpaid teacher i am bored oh god how i am bored i am bored by our laws and customs i am bored by our rotten empire and its empty monarchy i am bored by its parades and its flags and its sham enthusiasms i am bored by london and its life by its smart life and by its servile life alike i am bored by theatres and by books and by every sort of thing that people call pleasure i am bored by the brag of people and the claims of people and the feelings of people damn people i am bored by profiteers and by the snatching they call business enterprise damn every business man i am bored by politics and the universal mismanagement of everything i am bored by france by anglosaxondom by german selfpity by bolshevik fanaticism i am bored by these fools squabbles that devastate the world i am bored by ireland orange and green curse the irish north and south together lord how i hate the irish from carson to the last sinn feiner and i am bored by india and by egypt i am bored by poland and by islam i am bored by anyone who professes to have rights damn their rights curse their rights i am bored to death by this year and by last year and by the prospect of next year i am bored i am horribly bored by my work i am bored by every sort of renunciation i want to live with the woman i love and i want to work within the limits of my capacity curse all hullo damn his eyes steady ah the spark good no skid he had come round a corner at five and twenty miles an hour and had stopped his spark and pulled up neatly within a yard of the forewheel of a waggon that was turning in the road so as to block the way completely that almost had me and now you feel better said miss grammont ever so much said sir richmond and chuckled the waggoner cleared the road and the car started up again for a minute or so neither spoke you ought to be smacked hard for that outbreak my dear said miss grammont i ought my dear i have no right to be illtempered we two are among the supremely fortunate ones of our time we have no excuse for misbehaviour got nothing to grumble at always i am lucky that with the waggon was a very near thing god spoils us we two he went on after a pause are among the most fortunate people alive we are both rich and easily rich that gives us freedoms few people have we have a vision of the whole world in which we live its in a mess but that is by the way the mass of mankind never gets enough education to have even a glimpse of the world as a whole they never get a chance to get the hang of it it is really possible for us to do things that will matter in the world all our time is our own all our abilities we are free to use most people most intelligent and educated people are caught in cages of pecuniary necessity they are tied to tasks they cant leave they are driven and compelled and limited by circumstances they can never master but we if we have tasks have tasks of our own choosing we may not like the world but anyhow we are free to do our best to alter it if i were a clerk in hoxton and you were a city typist then we might swear it was you who swore smiled miss grammont its the thought of that clerk in hoxton and that city typist who really keep me at my work any smacking ought to come from them i couldnt do less than i do in the face of their helplessness nevertheless a day will come through what we do and what we refrain from doing when there will be no bound and limited clerks in hoxton and no captive typists in the city and nobody at all to consider according to the prophet martineau said miss grammont and then you and i must contrive to be born again heighho cried miss grammont a thousand years ahead when fathers are civilized when all these phanton people who intervene on your side no i dont want to know anything about them but i know of them by instinct when they also dont matter then you and i can have things out with each other thoroughly said sir richmond with a surprising ferocity in his voice charging the little hill before him as though he charged at time section they had to wait at nailsworth for a telegram from mr grammonts agents they lunched there and drove on to bath in the afternoon they came into the town through unattractive and unworthy outskirts and only realized the charm of the place after they had garaged their car at the pulteney hotel and walked back over the pulteney bridge to see the avon with the pump room and the roman baths the pulteney they found hung with pictures and adorned with sculpture to an astonishing extent some former proprietor must have had a mania for replicas and the place is eventful with white marble fauns and sylphs and lions and caesars and queen victorias and packed like an exhibition with memories of rome florence milan paris the national gallery and the royal academy amidst which splendours a competent staff administers modern comforts with an oldfashioned civility but round and about the pulteney one has still the scenery of georgian england the white faintly classical terraces and houses of the days of fielding smollett fanny burney and jane austen the graceful bridge with the bright little shops full of presents from bath the pump room with its water drinkers and a fine array of the original bath chairs down below the pump room our travellers explored the memories of the days when the world was latin from york to the tigris and the corinthian capital flourished like a weed from bath to baalbek and they considered a little doubtfully the seventeenth century statue of bladud who is said to have been healed by the bath waters and to have founded the city in the days when stonehenge still flourished eight hundred years before the romans came in the afternoon miss seyffert came with sir richmond and miss grammont and was very enthusiastic about everything but in the evening after dinner it was clear that her role was to remain in the hotel sir richmond and miss grammont went out into the moonlit gloaming they crossed the bridge again and followed the road beside the river towards the old abbey church that lantern of the west away in some sunken gardens ahead of them a band was playing and a cluster of little lights about the bandstand showed a crowd of people down below dancing on the grass these little lights these bobbing black heads and the lilting music this little inflamed centre of throbbing sounds and ruddy illumination made the dome of the moonlit world about it seem very vast and cool and silent our visitors began to realize that bath could be very beautiful they went to the parapet above the river and stood there leaning over it elbow to elbow and smoking cigarettes miss grammont was moved to declare the pulteney bridge with its noble arch its effect of height over the swirling river and the cluster of houses above more beautiful than the ponte vecchio at florence down below was a man in waders with a fishingrod going to and fro along the foaming weir and a couple of boys paddled a boat against the rush of the water lower down the stream dear england said miss grammont surveying this gracious spectacle how full it is of homely and lovely and kindly things it is the home we come from you belong to it still no more than you do i belong to a big overworking modern place called london which stretches its tentacles all over the world i am as much a homecoming tourist as you are most of this western country i am seeing for the first time she said nothing for a space ive not a word to say to night she said im just full of a sort of animal satisfaction in being close to you and in being with you among lovely things somewhere before we part to night yes he said to her pause and his face came very near to hers i want you to kiss me yes he said awkwardly glancing over his shoulder acutely aware of the promenaders passing close to them its a promise yes very timidly and guiltily his hand sought hers beside it and gripped it and pressed it my dear he whispered tritest and most unavoidable of expressions it was not very like man and woman loving upon their planet it was much more like the shy endearments of the shop boys and work girls who made the darkling populous about them with their silent interchanges there are a thousand things i want to talk about to you she said after we have parted tomorrow i shall begin to think of them but now every rational thing seems dissolved in this moonlight presently she made an effort to restore the intellectual dignity of their relationship i suppose i ought to be more concerned tonight about the work i have to do in the world and anxious for you to tell me this and that but indeed i am not concerned at all about it i seem to have it in outline all perfectly clear i mean to play a mans part in the world just as my father wants me to do i mean to win his confidence and work with him like a partner then some day i shall be a power in the world of fuel and at the same time i must watch and read and think and learn how to be the servant of the world we two have to live like trusted servants who have been made guardians of a helpless minor we have to put things in order and keep them in order against the time when man man whom we call in america the common man can take hold of his world and release his servants said sir richmond all that is perfectly clear in my mind that is what i am going to live for that is what i have to do she stopped abruptly all that is about as interesting to night in comparison with the touch of your dear fingers as next months railway timetable but later she found a topic that could hold their attention for a time we have never said a word about religion she said sir richmond paused for a moment i am a godless man he said the stars and space and time overwhelm my imagination i cannot imagine anything above or beyond them she thought that over but there are divine things she said you are divine im not talking lovers nonsense he hastened to add i mean that there is something about human beings not just the everyday stuff of them but something that appears intermittently as though a light shone through something translucent if i believe in any divinity at all it is a divinity revealed to me by other people and even by myself in my own heart im never surprised at the badness of human beings said sir richmond seeing how they have come about and what they are but i have been surprised time after time by fine things often in people i disliked or thought little of i can understand that i find you full of divine quality because i am in love with you and all alive to you necessarily i keep on discovering loveliness in you but i have seen divine things in dear old martineau for example a vain man fussy timid and yet filled with a passion for truth ready to make great sacrifices and to toil tremendously for that and in those men i am always cursing my committee it is astonishing at times to discover what streaks of goodness even the really bad men can show but one cant make use of just anyones divinity i can see the divinity in martineau but it leaves me cold he tired me and bored me but i live on you its only through love that the god can reach over from one human being to another all real love is a divine thing a reassurance a release of courage it is wonderful enough that we should take food and drink and turn them into imagination invention and creative energy it is still more wonderful that we should take an animal urging and turn it into a light to discover beauty and an impulse towards the utmost achievements of which we are capable all love is a sacrament and all lovers are priests to each other you and i sir richmond broke off abruptly i spent three days trying to tell this to dr martineau but he wasnt the priest i had to confess to and the words wouldnt come i can confess it to you readily enough i cannot tell said miss grammont whether this is the last wisdom in life or moonshine i cannot tell whether i am thinking or feeling but the noise of the water going over the weir below is like the stir in my heart and i am swimming in love and happiness am i awake or am i dreaming you and are we dreaming one another hold my hand hold it hard and tight im trembling with love for you and all the world if i say more i shall be weeping for a long time they stood side by side saying not a word to one another presently the band down below and the dancing ceased and the little lights were extinguished the silent moon seemed to grow brighter and larger and the whisper of the waters louder a crowd of young people flowed out of the gardens and passed by on their way home sir richmond and miss grammont strolled through the dispersing crowd and over the toll bridge and went exploring down a little staircase that went down from the end of the bridge to the dark river and then came back to their old position at the parapet looking upon the weir and the pulteney bridge the gardens that had been so gay were already dark and silent as they returned and the streets echoed emptily to the few people who were still abroad its the most beautiful bridge in the world said miss grammont and gave him her hand again some deeptoned clock close by proclaimed the hour eleven the silence healed again well said sir richmond well said miss grammont smiling very faintly i suppose we must go out of all this beauty now back to the lights of the hotel and the watchful eyes of your dragon she has not been a very exacting dragon so far has she she is a miracle of tact she does not really watch but she is curious and very sympathetic she is wonderful that man is still fishing said miss grammont for a time she peered down at the dark figure wading in the foam below as though it was the only thing of interest in the world then she turned to sir richmond i would trust belinda with my life she said and anyhow now we need not worry about belinda section at the breakfast table it was belinda who was the most nervous of the three the most moved the most disposed to throw a sacramental air over their last meal together her companions had passed beyond the idea of separation it was as if they now cherished a secret satisfaction at the high dignity of their parting belinda in some way perceived they had become different they were no longer tremulous lovers they seemed sure of one another and with a new pride in their bearing it would have pleased belinda better seeing how soon they were to be torn apart if they had not made quite such excellent breakfasts she even suspected them of having slept well yet yesterday they had been deeply stirred they had stayed out late last night so late that she had not heard them come in perhaps then they had passed the climax of their emotions sir richmond she learnt was to take the party to exeter where there would be a train for falmouth a little after two if they started from bath about nine that would give them an ample margin of time in which to deal with a puncture or any such misadventure they crested the mendips above shepton mallet ran through tilchester and ilminster into the lovely hill country about upottery and so to honiton and the broad level road to exeter sir richmond and miss grammont were in a state of happy gravity they sat contentedly side by side talking very little they had already made their arrangements for writing to one another there was to be no stream of love letters or protestations that might prove a mutual torment their love was to be implicit they were to write at intervals about political matters and their common interests and to keep each other informed of their movements about the world we shall be working together she said speaking suddenly out of a train of thought she had been following we shall be closer together than many a couple who have never spent a day apart for twenty years then presently she said in the new age all lovers will have to be accustomed to meeting and parting we women will not be tied very much by domestic needs unless we see fit to have children we shall be going about our business like men we shall have worldwide businesses many of us just as men will it will be a world full of lovers meetings some day somewhere we two will certainly meet again even you have to force circumstances a little said sir richmond we shall meet she said without doing that but where he asked unanswered meetings and partings she said women will be used to seeing their lovers go away even to seeing them go away to other women who have borne them children and who have a closer claim on them no one began sir richmond startled but i dont mind very much its how things are if i were a perfectly civilized woman i shouldnt mind at all if men and women are not to be tied to each other there must needs be such things as this but you said sir richmond i at any rate am not like that i cannot bear the thought that you you need not bear it my dear i was just trying to imagine this world that is to be women i think are different from men in their jealousy men are jealous of the other man women are jealous for their man and careless about the other woman what i love in you i am sure about my mind was empty when it came to you and now it is full to overflowing i shall feel you moving about in the same world with me im not likely to think of anyone else for a very long time later on who knows i may marry i make no vows but i think until i know certainly that you do not want me any more it will be impossible for me to marry or to have a lover i dont know but that is how i believe it will be with me and my mind feels beautifully clear now and settled ive got your idea and made it my own your idea that we matter scarcely at all but that the work we do matters supremely ill find my rope and tug it never fear half way round the wed a small cross she was a little woman with brown dull hair very elaborately arranged and she had prominent blue eyes behind invisible pincenez her face was long like a sheeps but she gave no impression of foolishness rather of extreme alertness she had the quick movements of a bird the most remarkable thing about her was her voice high metallic and without inflection it fell on the ear with a hard monotony irritating to the nerves like the pitiless clamour of the pneumatic drill this must seem like home to you said dr macphail with his thin difficult smile ours are low islands you know not like these coral these are volcanic weve got another ten days journey to reach them in these parts thats almost like being in the next street at home said dr macphail facetiously well thats rather an exaggerated way of putting it but one does look at distances differently in the south seas so far youre right dr macphail sighed faintly im glad were not stationed here she went on they say this is a terribly difficult place to work in the steamers touching makes the people unsettled and then theres the naval station thats bad for the natives in our district we dont have difficulties like that to contend with there are one or two traders of course but we take care to make them behave and if they dont we make the place so hot for them theyre glad to go fixing the glasses on her nose she looked at the green island with a ruthless stare its almost a hopeless task for the missionaries here i can never be sufficiently thankful to god that we are at least spared that davidsons district consisted of a group of islands to the north of samoa they were widely separated and he had frequently to go long distances by canoe at these times his wife remained at their headquarters and managed the mission dr macphail felt his heart sink when he considered the efficiency with which she certainly managed it she spoke of the depravity of the natives in a voice which nothing could hush but with a vehemently unctuous horror her sense of delicacy was singular early in their acquaintance she had said to him you know their marriage customs when we first settled in the islands were so shocking that i couldnt possibly describe them to you but ill tell mrs macphail and shell tell you then he had seen his wife and mrs davidson their deckchairs close together in earnest conversation for about two hours as he walked past them backwards and forwards for the sake of exercise he had heard mrs davidsons agitated whisper like the distant flow of a mountain torrent and he saw by his wifes open mouth and pale face that she was enjoying an alarming experience at night in their cabin she repeated to him with bated breath all she had heard well what did i say to you cried mrs davidson exultant next morning did you ever hear anything more dreadful you dont wonder that i couldnt tell you myself do you even though you are a doctor mrs davidson scanned his face she had a dramatic eagerness to see that she had achieved the desired effect can you wonder that when we first went there our hearts sank youll hardly believe me when i tell you it was impossible to find a single good girl in any of the villages she used the word good in a severely technical manner mr davidson and i talked it over and we made up our minds the first thing to do was to put down the dancing the natives were crazy about dancing i was not averse to it myself when i was a young man said dr macphail i guessed as much when i heard you ask mrs macphail to have a turn with you last night i dont think theres any real harm if a man dances with his wife but i was relieved that she wouldnt under the circumstances i thought it better that we should keep ourselves to ourselves under what circumstances mrs davidson gave him a quick look through her pincenez but did not answer his question but among white people its not quite the same she went on though i must say i agree with mr davidson who says he cant understand how a husband can stand by and see his wife in another mans arms and as far as im concerned ive never danced a step since i married but the native dancing is quite another matter its not only immoral in itself but it distinctly leads to immorality however im thankful to god that we stamped it out and i dont think im wrong in saying that no one has danced in our district for eight years but now they came to the mouth of the harbour and mrs macphail joined them the ship turned sharply and steamed slowly in it was a great landlocked harbour big enough to hold a fleet of battleships and all around it rose high and steep the green hills near the entrance getting such breeze as blew from the sea stood the governors house in a garden the stars and stripes dangled languidly from a flagstaff they passed two or three trim bungalows and a tennis court and then they came to the quay with its warehouses mrs davidson pointed out the schooner moored two or three hundred yards from the side which was to take them to apia there was a crowd of eager noisy and goodhumoured natives come from all parts of the island some from curiosity others to barter with the travellers on their way to sydney and they brought pineapples and huge bunches of bananas tapa cloths necklaces of shells or sharks teeth kavabowls and models of war canoes american sailors neat and trim cleanshaven and frank of face sauntered among them and there was a little group of officials while their luggage was being landed the macphails and mrs davidson watched the crowd dr macphail looked at the yaws from which most of the children and the young boys seemed to suffer disfiguring sores like torpid ulcers and his professional eyes glistened when he saw for the first time in his experience cases of elephantiasis men going about with a huge heavy arm or dragging along a grossly disfigured leg men and women wore the lavalava its a very indecent costume said mrs davidson mr davidson thinks it should be prohibited by law how can you expect people to be moral when they wear nothing but a strip of red cotton round their loins its suitable enough to the climate said the doctor wiping the sweat off his head now that they were on land the heat though it was so early in the morning was already oppressive closed in by its hills not a breath of air came in to pagopago in our islands mrs davidson went on in her highpitched tones weve practically eradicated the lavalava a few old men still continue to wear it but thats all the women have all taken to the mother hubbard and the men wear trousers and singlets at the very beginning of our stay mr davidson said in one of his reports the inhabitants of these islands will never be thoroughly christianised till every boy of more than ten years is made to wear a pair of trousers but mrs davidson had given two or three of her birdlike glances at heavy grey clouds that came floating over the mouth of the harbour a few drops began to fall wed better take shelter she said they made their way with all the crowd to a great shed of corrugated iron and the rain began to fall in torrents they stood there for some time and then were joined by mr davidson he had been polite enough to the macphails during the journey but he had not his wifes sociability and had spent much of his time reading he was a silent rather sullen man and you felt that his affability was a duty that he imposed upon himself christianly he was by nature reserved and even morose his appearance was singular he was very tall and thin with long limbs loosely jointed hollow cheeks and curiously high cheekbones he had so cadaverous an air that it surprised you to notice how full and sensual were his lips he wore his hair very long his dark eyes set deep in their sockets were large and tragic and his hands with their big long fingers were finely shaped they gave him a look of great strength but the most striking thing about him was the feeling he gave you of suppressed fire it was impressive and vaguely troubling he was not a man with whom any intimacy was possible he brought now unwelcome news there was an epidemic of measles a serious and often fatal disease among the kanakas on the island and a case had developed among the crew of the schooner which was to take them on their journey the sick man had been brought ashore and put in hospital on the quarantine station but telegraphic instructions had been sent from apia to say that the schooner would not be allowed to enter the harbour till it was certain no other member of the crew was affected it means we shall have to stay here for ten days at least but im urgently needed at apia said dr macphail that cant be helped if no more cases develop on board the schooner will be allowed to sail with white passengers but all native traffic is prohibited for three months is there a hotel here asked mrs macphail davidson gave a low chuckle theres not what shall we do then ive been talking to the governor theres a trader along the front who has rooms that he rents and my proposition is that as soon as the rain lets up we should go along there and see what we can do dont expect comfort youve just got to be thankful if we get a bed to sleep on and a roof over our heads but the rain showed no sign of stopping and at length with umbrellas and waterproofs they set out there was no town but merely a group of official buildings a store or two and at the back among the coconut trees and plantains a few native dwellings the house they sought was about five minutes walk from the wharf it was a frame house of two storeys with broad verandahs on both floors and a roof of corrugated iron the owner was a halfcaste named horn with a native wife surrounded by little brown children and on the groundfloor he had a store where he sold canned goods and cottons the rooms he showed them were almost bare of furniture in the macphails there was nothing but a poor worn bed with a ragged mosquito net a rickety chair and a washstand they looked round with dismay the rain poured down without ceasing im not going to unpack more than we actually need said mrs macphail mrs davidson came into the room as she was unlocking a portmanteau she was very brisk and alert the cheerless surroundings had no effect on her if youll take my advice youll get a needle and cotton and start right in to mend the mosquito net she said or youll not be able to get a wink of sleep tonight will they be very bad asked dr macphail this is the season for them when youre asked to a party at government house at apia youll notice that all the ladies are given a pillowslip to put their their lower extremities in i wish the rain would stop for a moment said mrs macphail i could try to make the place comfortable with more heart if the sun were shining oh if you wait for that youll wait a long time pagopago is about the rainiest place in the pacific you see the hills and that bay they attract the water and one expects rain at this time of year anyway she looked from macphail to his wife standing helplessly in different parts of the room like lost souls and she pursed her lips she saw that she must take them in hand feckless people like that made her impatient but her hands itched to put everything in the order which came so naturally to her here you give me a needle and cotton and ill mend that net of yours while you go on with your unpacking dinners at one dr macphail youd better go down to the wharf and see that your heavy luggage has been put in a dry place you know what these natives are theyre quite capable of storing it where the rain will beat in on it all the time the doctor put on his waterproof again and went downstairs at the door mr horn was standing in conversation with the quartermaster of the ship they had just arrived in and a secondclass passenger whom dr macphail had seen several times on board the quartermaster a little shrivelled man extremely dirty nodded to him as he passed this is a bad job about the measles doc he said i see youve fixed yourself up already dr macphail thought he was rather familiar but he was a timid man and he did not take offence easily yes weve got a room upstairs miss thompson was sailing with you to apia so ive brought her along here the quartermaster pointed with his thumb to the woman standing by his side she was twentyseven perhaps plump and in a coarse fashion pretty she wore a white dress and a large white hat her fat calves in white cotton stockings bulged over the tops of long white boots in glac kid she gave macphail an ingratiating smile the fellers tryin to soak me a dollar and a half a day for the meanest sized room she said in a hoarse voice i tell you shes a friend of mine jo said the quartermaster she cant pay more than a dollar and youve sure got to take her for that the trader was fat and smooth and quietly smiling well if you put it like that mr swan ill see what i can do about it ill talk to mrs horn and if we think we can make a reduction we will dont try to pull that stuff with me said miss thompson well settle this right now you get a dollar a day for the room and not one bean more dr macphail smiled he admired the effrontery with which she bargained he was the sort of man who always paid what he was asked he preferred to be overcharged than to haggle the trader sighed well to oblige mr swan ill take it thats the goods said miss thompson come right in and have a shot of hooch ive got some real good rye in that grip if youll bring it along mr swan you come along too doctor oh i dont think i will thank you he answered im just going down to see that our luggage is all right he stepped out into the rain it swept in from the opening of the harbour in sheets and the opposite shore was all blurred he passed two or three natives clad in nothing but the lavalava with huge umbrellas over them they walked finely with leisurely movements very upright and they smiled and greeted him in a strange tongue as they went by it was nearly dinnertime when he got back and their meal was laid in the traders parlour it was a room designed not to live in but for purposes of prestige and it had a musty melancholy air a suite of stamped plush was arranged neatly round the walls and from the middle of the ceiling protected from the flies by yellow tissue paper hung a gilt chandelier davidson did not come i know he went to call on the governor said mrs davidson and i guess hes kept him to dinner a little native girl brought them a dish of hamburger steak and after a while the trader came up to see that they had everything they wanted i see we have a fellow lodger mr horn said dr macphail shes taken a room thats all answered the trader shes getting her own board he looked at the two ladies with an obsequious air i put her downstairs so she shouldnt be in the way she wont be any trouble to you is it someone who was on the boat asked mrs macphail yes maam she was in the second cabin she was going to apia she has a position as cashier waiting for her oh when the trader was gone macphail said i shouldnt think shed find it exactly cheerful having her meals in her room if she was in the second cabin i guess shed rather answered mrs davidson i dont exactly know who it can be i happened to be there when the quartermaster brought her along her names thompson its not the woman who was dancing with the quartermaster last night asked mrs davidson thats who it must be said mrs macphail i wondered at the time what she was she looked rather fast to me not good style at all said mrs davidson they began to talk of other things and after dinner tired with their early rise they separated and slept when they awoke though the sky was still grey and the clouds hung low it was not raining and they went for a walk on the high road which the americans had built along the bay on their return they found that davidson had just come in we may be here for a fortnight he said irritably ive argued it out with the governor but he says there is nothing to be done mr davidsons just longing to get back to his work said his wife with an anxious glance at him weve been away for a year he said walking up and down the verandah the mission has been in charge of native missionaries and im terribly nervous that theyve let things slide theyre good men im not saying a word against them godfearing devout and truly christian men their christianity would put many socalled christians at home to the blush but theyre pitifully lacking in energy they can make a stand once they can make a stand twice but they cant make a stand all the time if you leave a mission in charge of a native missionary no matter how trustworthy he seems in course of time youll find hes let abuses creep in mr davidson stood still with his tall spare form and his great eyes flashing out of his pale face he was an impressive figure his sincerity was obvious in the fire of his gestures and in his deep ringing voice i expect to have my work cut out for me i shall act and i shall act promptly if the tree is rotten it shall be cut down and cast into the flames and in the evening after the high tea which was their last meal while they sat in the stiff parlour the ladies working and dr macphail smoking his pipe the missionary told them of his work in the islands when we went there they had no sense of sin at all he said they broke the commandments one after the other and never knew they were doing wrong and i think that was the most difficult part of my work to instil into the natives the sense of sin the macphails knew already that davidson had worked in the solomons for five years before he met his wife she had been a missionary in china and they had become acquainted in boston where they were both spending part of their leave to attend a missionary congress on their marriage they had been appointed to the islands in which they had laboured ever since in the course of all the conversations they had had with mr davidson one thing had shone out clearly and that was the mans unflinching courage he was a medical missionary and he was liable to be called at any time to one or other of the islands in the group even the whaleboat is not so very safe a conveyance in the stormy pacific of the wet season but often he would be sent for in a canoe and then the danger was great in cases of illness or accident he never hesitated a dozen times he had spent the whole night baling for his life and more than once mrs davidson had given him up for lost id beg him not to go sometimes she said or at least to wait till the weather was more settled but hed never listen hes obstinate and when hes once made up his mind nothing can move him how can i ask the natives to put their trust in the lord if i am afraid to do so myself cried davidson and im not im not they know that if they send for me in their trouble ill come if its humanly possible and do you think the lord is going to abandon me when i am on his business the wind blows at his bidding and the waves toss and rage at his word dr macphail was a timid man he had never been able to get used to the hurtling of the shells over the trenches and when he was operating in an advanced dressingstation the sweat poured from his brow and dimmed his spectacles in the effort he made to control his unsteady hand he shuddered a little as he looked at the missionary i wish i could say that ive never been afraid he said i wish you could say that you believed in god retorted the other but for some reason that evening the missionarys thoughts travelled back to the early days he and his wife had spent on the islands sometimes mrs davidson and i would look at one another and the tears would stream down our cheeks we worked without ceasing day and night and we seemed to make no progress i dont know what i should have done without her then when i felt my heart sink when i was very near despair she gave me courage and hope mrs davidson looked down at her work and a slight colour rose to her thin cheeks her hands trembled a little she did not trust herself to speak we had no one to help us we were alone thousands of miles from any of our own people surrounded by darkness when i was broken and weary she would put her work aside and take the bible and read to me till peace came and settled upon me like sleep upon the eyelids of a child and when at last she closed the book shed say well save them in spite of themselves and i felt strong again in the lord and i answered yes with gods help ill save them i must save them he came over to the table and stood in front of it as though it were a lectern you see they were so naturally depraved that they couldnt be brought to see their wickedness we had to make sins out of what they thought were natural actions we had to make it a sin not only to commit adultery and to lie and thieve but to expose their bodies and to dance and not to come to church i made it a sin for a girl to show her bosom and a sin for a man not to wear trousers how asked dr macphail not without surprise i instituted fines obviously the only way to make people realise that an action is sinful is to punish them if they commit it i fined them if they didnt come to church and i fined them if they danced i fined them if they were improperly dressed i had a tariff and every sin had to be paid for either in money or work and at last i made them understand but did they never refuse to pay how could they asked the missionary it would be a brave man who tried to stand up against mr davidson said his wife tightening her lips dr macphail looked at davidson with troubled eyes what he heard shocked him but he hesitated to express his disapproval you must remember that in the last resort i could expel them from their church membership did they mind that davidson smiled a little and gently rubbed his hands they couldnt sell their copra when the men fished they got no share of the catch it meant something very like starvation yes they minded quite a lot tell him about fred ohlson said mrs davidson the missionary fixed his fiery eyes on dr macphail fred ohlson was a danish trader who had been in the islands a good many years he was a pretty rich man as traders go and he wasnt very pleased when we came you see hed had things very much his own way he paid the natives what he liked for their copra and he paid in goods and whiskey he had a native wife but he was flagrantly unfaithful to her he was a drunkard i gave him a chance to mend his ways but he wouldnt take it he laughed at me davidsons voice fell to a deep bass as he said the last words and he was silent for a minute or two the silence was heavy with menace in two years he was a ruined man hed lost everything hed saved in a quarter of a century i broke him and at last he was forced to come to me like a beggar and beseech me to give him a passage back to sydney i wish you could have seen him when he came to see mr davidson said the missionarys wife he had been a fine powerful man with a lot of fat on him and he had a great big voice but now he was half the size and he was shaking all over hed suddenly become an old man with abstracted gaze davidson looked out into the night the rain was falling again suddenly from below came a sound and davidson turned and looked questioningly at his wife it was the sound of a gramophone harsh and loud wheezing out a syncopated tune whats that he asked mrs davidson fixed her pincenez more firmly on her nose one of the secondclass passengers has a room in the house i guess it comes from there they listened in silence and presently they heard the sound of dancing then the music stopped and they heard the popping of corks and voices raised in animated conversation i daresay shes giving a farewell party to her friends on board said dr macphail the ship sails at twelve doesnt it davidson made no remark but he looked at his watch are you ready he asked his wife she got up and folded her work yes i guess i am she answered its early to go to bed yet isnt it said the doctor we have a good deal of reading to do explained mrs davidson wherever we are we read a chapter of the bible before retiring for the night and we study it with the commentaries you know and discuss it thoroughly its a wonderful training for the mind the two couples bade one another good night dr and mrs macphail were left alone for two or three minutes they did not speak i think ill go and fetch the cards the doctor said at last mrs macphail looked at him doubtfully her conversation with the davidsons had left her a little uneasy but she did not like to say that she thought they had better not play cards when the davidsons might come in at any moment dr macphail brought them and she watched him though with a vague sense of guilt while he laid out his patience below the sound of revelry continued it was fine enough next day and the macphails condemned to spend a fortnight of idleness at pagopago set about making the best of things they went down to the quay and got out of their boxes a number of books the doctor called on the chief surgeon of the naval hospital and went round the beds with him they left cards on the governor they passed miss thompson on the road the doctor took off his hat and she gave him a good morning doc in a loud cheerful voice she was dressed as on the day before in a white frock and her shiny white boots with their high heels her fat legs bulging over the tops of them were strange things on that exotic scene i dont think shes very suitably dressed i must say said mrs macphail she looks extremely common to me when they got back to their house she was on the verandah playing with one of the traders dark children say a word to her dr macphail whispered to his wife shes all alone here and it seems rather unkind to ignore her mrs macphail was shy but she was in the habit of doing what her husband bade her i think were fellow lodgers here she said rather foolishly terrible aint it bein cooped up in a onehorse burg like this answered miss thompson and they tell me im lucky to have gotten a room i dont see myself livin in a native house and thats what some have to do i dont know why they dont have a hotel they exchanged a few more words miss thompson loudvoiced and garrulous was evidently quite willing to gossip but mrs macphail had a poor stock of small talk and presently she said well i think we must go upstairs in the evening when they sat down to their hightea davidson on coming in said i see that woman downstairs has a couple of sailors sitting there i wonder how shes gotten acquainted with them she cant be very particular said mrs davidson they were all rather tired after the idle aimless day if theres going to be a fortnight of this i dont know what we shall feel like at the end of it said dr macphail the only thing to do is to portion out the day to different activities answered the missionary i shall set aside a certain number of hours to study and a certain number to exercise rain or fine in the wet season you cant afford to pay any attention to the rain and a certain number to recreation dr macphail looked at his companion with misgiving davidsons programme oppressed him they were eating hamburger steak again it seemed the only dish the cook knew how to make then below the gramophone began davidson started nervously when he heard it but said nothing mens voices floated up miss thompsons guests were joining in a wellknown song and presently they heard her voice too hoarse and loud there was a good deal of shouting and laughing the four people upstairs trying to make conversation listened despite themselves to the clink of glasses and the scrape of chairs more people had evidently come miss thompson was giving a party i wonder how she gets them all in said mrs macphail suddenly breaking into a medical conversation between the missionary and her husband it showed whither her thoughts were wandering the twitch of davidsons face proved that though he spoke of scientific things his mind was busy in the same direction suddenly while the doctor was giving some experience of practice on the flanders front rather prosily he sprang to his feet with a cry whats the matter alfred asked mrs davidson of course it never occurred to me shes out of iwelei she cant be she came on board at honolulu its obvious and shes carrying on her trade here here he uttered the last word with a passion of indignation whats iwelei asked mrs macphail he turned his gloomy eyes on her and his voice trembled with horror the plague spot of honolulu the red light district it was a blot on our civilisation iwelei was on the edge of the city you went down side streets by the harbour in the darkness across a rickety bridge till you came to a deserted road all ruts and holes and then suddenly you came out into the light there was parking room for motors on each side of the road and there were saloons tawdry and bright each one noisy with its mechanical piano and there were barbers shops and tobacconists there was a stir in the air and a sense of expectant gaiety you turned down a narrow alley either to the right or to the left for the road divided iwelei into two parts and you found yourself in the district there were rows of little bungalows trim and neatly painted in green and the pathway between them was broad and straight it was laid out like a gardencity in its respectable regularity its order and spruceness it gave an impression of sardonic horror for never can the search for love have been so systematised and ordered the pathways were lit by a rare lamp but they would have been dark except for the lights that came from the open windows of the bungalows men wandered about looking at the women who sat at their windows reading or sewing for the most part taking no notice of the passersby and like the women they were of all nationalities there were americans sailors from the ships in port enlisted men off the gunboats sombrely drunk and soldiers from the regiments white and black quartered on the island there were japanese walking in twos and threes hawaiians chinese in long robes and filipinos in preposterous hats they were silent and as it were oppressed desire is sad it was the most crying scandal of the pacific exclaimed davidson vehemently the missionaries had been agitating against it for years and at last the local press took it up the police refused to stir you know their argument they say that vice is inevitable and consequently the best thing is to localise and control it the truth is they were paid paid they were paid by the saloonkeepers paid by the bullies paid by the women themselves at last they were forced to move i read about it in the papers that came on board in honolulu said dr macphail iwelei with its sin and shame ceased to exist on the very day we arrived the whole population was brought before the justices i dont know why i didnt understand at once what that woman was now you come to speak of it said mrs macphail i remember seeing her come on board only a few minutes before the boat sailed i remember thinking at the time she was cutting it rather fine how dare she come here cried davidson indignantly im not going to allow it he strode towards the door what are you going to do asked macphail what do you expect me to do im going to stop it im not going to have this house turned into into he sought for a word that should not offend the ladies ears his eyes were flashing and his pale face was paler still in his emotion it sounds as though there were three or four men down there said the doctor dont you think its rather rash to go in just now the missionary gave him a contemptuous look and without a word flung out of the room you know mr davidson very little if you think the fear of personal danger can stop him in the performance of his duty said his wife she sat with her hands nervously clasped a spot of colour on her high cheek bones listening to what was about to happen below they all listened they heard him clatter down the wooden stairs and throw open the door the singing stopped suddenly but the gramophone continued to bray out its vulgar tune they heard davidsons voice and then the noise of something heavy falling the music stopped he had hurled the gramophone on the floor then again they heard davidsons voice they could not make out the words then miss thompsons loud and shrill then a confused clamour as though several people were shouting together at the top of their lungs mrs davidson gave a little gasp and she clenched her hands more tightly dr macphail looked uncertainly from her to his wife he did not want to go down but he wondered if they expected him to then there was something that sounded like a scuffle the noise now was more distinct it might be that davidson was being thrown out of the room the door was slammed there was a moments silence and they heard davidson come up the stairs again he went to his room i think ill go to him said mrs davidson she got up and went out if you want me just call said mrs macphail and then when the other was gone i hope he isnt hurt why couldnt he mind his own business said dr macphail they sat in silence for a minute or two and then they both started for the gramophone began to play once more defiantly and mocking voices shouted hoarsely the words of an obscene song next day mrs davidson was pale and tired she complained of headache and she looked old and wizened she told mrs macphail that the missionary had not slept at all he had passed the night in a state of frightful agitation and at five had got up and gone out a glass of beer had been thrown over him and his clothes were stained and stinking but a sombre fire glowed in mrs davidsons eyes when she spoke of miss thompson shell bitterly rue the day when she flouted mr davidson she said mr davidson has a wonderful heart and no one who is in trouble has ever gone to him without being comforted but he has no mercy for sin and when his righteous wrath is excited hes terrible why what will he do asked mrs macphail i dont know but i wouldnt stand in that creatures shoes for anything in the world mrs macphail shuddered there was something positively alarming in the triumphant assurance of the little womans manner they were going out together that morning and they went down the stairs side by side miss thompsons door was open and they saw her in a bedraggled dressinggown cooking something in a chafingdish good morning she called is mr davidson better this morning they passed her in silence with their noses in the air as if she did not exist they flushed however when she burst into a shout of derisive laughter mrs davidson turned on her suddenly dont you dare to speak to me she screamed if you insult me i shall have you turned out of here say did i ask mr davidson to visit with me dont answer her whispered mrs macphail hurriedly they walked on till they were out of earshot shes brazen brazen burst from mrs davidson her anger almost suffocated her and on their way home they met her strolling towards the quay she had all her finery on her great white hat with its vulgar showy flowers was an affront she called out cheerily to them as she went by and a couple of american sailors who were standing there grinned as the ladies set their faces to an icy stare they got in just before the rain began to fall again i guess shell get her fine clothes spoilt said mrs davidson with a bitter sneer davidson did not come in till they were half way through dinner he was wet through but he would not change he sat morose and silent refusing to eat more than a mouthful and he stared at the slanting rain when mrs davidson told him of their two encounters with miss thompson he did not answer his deepening frown alone showed that he had heard dont you think we ought to make mr horn turn her out of here asked mrs davidson we cant allow her to insult us there doesnt seem to be any other place for her to go said macphail she can live with one of the natives in weather like this a native hut must be a rather uncomfortable place to live in i lived in one for years said the missionary when the little native girl brought in the fried bananas which formed the sweet they had every day davidson turned to her ask miss thompson when it would be convenient for me to see her he said the girl nodded shyly and went out what do you want to see her for alfred asked his wife its my duty to see her i wont act till ive given her every chance you dont know what she is shell insult you let her insult me let her spit on me she has an immortal soul and i must do all that is in my power to save it mrs davidsons ears rang still with the harlots mocking laughter shes gone too far too far for the mercy of god his eyes lit up suddenly and his voice grew mellow and soft never the sinner may be deeper in sin than the depth of hell itself but the love of the lord jesus can reach him still the girl came back with the message miss thompsons compliments and as long as rev davidson dont come in business hours shell be glad to see him any time the party received it in stony silence and dr macphail quickly effaced from his lips the smile which had come upon them he knew his wife would be vexed with him if he found miss thompsons effrontery amusing they finished the meal in silence when it was over the two ladies got up and took their work mrs macphail was making another of the innumerable comforters which she had turned out since the beginning of the war and the doctor lit his pipe but davidson remained in his chair and with abstracted eyes stared at the table at last he got up and without a word went out of the room they heard him go down and they heard miss thompsons defiant come in when he knocked at the door he remained with her for an hour and dr macphail watched the rain it was beginning to get on his nerves it was not like our soft english rain that drops gently on the earth it was unmerciful and somehow terrible you felt in it the malignancy of the primitive powers of nature it did not pour it flowed it was like a deluge from heaven and it rattled on the roof of corrugated iron with a steady persistence that was maddening it seemed to have a fury of its own and sometimes you felt that you must scream if it did not stop and then suddenly you felt powerless as though your bones had suddenly become soft and you were miserable and hopeless macphail turned his head when the missionary came back the two women looked up ive given her every chance i have exhorted her to repent she is an evil woman he paused and dr macphail saw his eyes darken and his pale face grow hard and stern now i shall take the whips with which the lord jesus drove the usurers and the money changers out of the temple of the most high he walked up and down the room his mouth was close set and his black brows were frowning if she fled to the uttermost parts of the earth i should pursue her with a sudden movement he turned round and strode out of the room they heard him go downstairs again what is he going to do asked mrs macphail i dont know mrs davidson took off her pincenez and wiped them when he is on the lords work i never ask him questions she sighed a little what is the matter hell wear himself out he doesnt know what it is to spare himself dr macphail learnt the first results of the missionarys activity from the halfcaste trader in whose house they lodged he stopped the doctor when he passed the store and came out to speak to him on the stoop his fat face was worried the rev davidson has been at me for letting miss thompson have a room here he said but i didnt know what she was when i rented it to her when people come and ask if i can rent them a room all i want to know is if theyve the money to pay for it and she paid me for hers a week in advance dr macphail did not want to commit himself when alls said and done its your house were very much obliged to you for taking us in at all horn looked at him doubtfully he was not certain yet how definitely macphail stood on the missionarys side the missionaries are in with one another he said hesitatingly if they get it in for a trader he may just as well shut up his store and quit did he want you to turn her out no he said so long as she behaved herself he couldnt ask me to do that he said he wanted to be just to me i promised she shouldnt have no more visitors ive just been and told her how did she take it she gave me hell the trader squirmed in his old ducks he had found miss thompson a rough customer oh well i daresay shell get out i dont suppose she wants to stay here if she cant have anyone in theres nowhere she can go only a native house and no nativell take her now not now that the missionaries have got their knife in her dr macphail looked at the falling rain well i dont suppose its any good waiting for it to clear up in the evening when they sat in the parlour davidson talked to them of his early days at college he had had no means and had worked his way through by doing odd jobs during the vacations there was silence downstairs miss thompson was sitting in her little room alone but suddenly the gramophone began to play she had set it on in defiance to cheat her loneliness but there was no one to sing and it had a melancholy note it was like a cry for help davidson took no notice he was in the middle of a long anecdote and without change of expression went on the gramophone continued miss thompson put on one reel after another it looked as though the silence of the night were getting on her nerves it was breathless and sultry when the macphails went to bed they could not sleep they lay side by side with their eyes wide open listening to the cruel singing of the mosquitoes outside their curtain whats that whispered mrs macphail at last they heard a voice davidsons voice through the wooden partition it went on with a monotonous earnest insistence he was praying aloud he was praying for the soul of miss thompson two or three days went by now when they passed miss thompson on the road she did not greet them with ironic cordiality or smile she passed with her nose in the air a sulky look on her painted face frowning as though she did not see them the trader told macphail that she had tried to get lodging elsewhere but had failed in the evening she played through the various reels of her gramophone but the pretence of mirth was obvious now the ragtime had a cracked heartbroken rhythm as though it were a onestep of despair when she began to play on sunday davidson sent horn to beg her to stop at once since it was the lords day the reel was taken off and the house was silent except for the steady pattering of the rain on the iron roof i think shes getting a bit worked up said the trader next day to macphail she dont know what mr davidsons up to and it makes her scared macphail had caught a glimpse of her that morning and it struck him that her arrogant expression had changed there was in her face a hunted look the halfcaste gave him a sidelong glance i suppose you dont know what mr davidson is doing about it he hazarded no i dont it was singular that horn should ask him that question for he also had the idea that the missionary was mysteriously at work he had an impression that he was weaving a net around the woman carefully systematically and suddenly when everything was ready would pull the strings tight he told me to tell her said the trader that if at any time she wanted him she only had to send and hed come what did she say when you told her that she didnt say nothing i didnt stop i just said what he said i was to and then i beat it i thought she might be going to start weepin i have no doubt the loneliness is getting on her nerves said the doctor and the rain thats enough to make anyone jumpy he continued irritably doesnt it ever stop in this confounded place it goes on pretty steady in the rainy season we have three hundred inches in the year you see its the shape of the bay it seems to attract the rain from all over the pacific damn the shape of the bay said the doctor he scratched his mosquito bites he felt very shorttempered when the rain stopped and the sun shone it was like a hothouse seething humid sultry breathless and you had a strange feeling that everything was growing with a savage violence the natives blithe and childlike by reputation seemed then with their tattooing and their dyed hair to have something sinister in their appearance and when they pattered along at your heels with their naked feet you looked back instinctively you felt they might at any moment come behind you swiftly and thrust a long knife between your shoulder blades you could not tell what dark thoughts lurked behind their wideset eyes they had a little the look of ancient egyptians painted on a temple wall and there was about them the terror of what is immeasurably old the missionary came and went he was busy but the macphails did not know what he was doing horn told the doctor that he saw the governor every day and once davidson mentioned him he looks as if he had plenty of determination he said but when you come down to brass tacks he has no backbone i suppose that means he wont do exactly what you want suggested the doctor facetiously the missionary did not smile i want him to do whats right it shouldnt be necessary to persuade a man to do that but there may be differences of opinion about what is right if a man had a gangrenous foot would you have patience with anyone who hesitated to amputate it gangrene is a matter of fact and evil what davidson had done soon appeared the four of them had just finished their midday meal and they had not yet separated for the siesta which the heat imposed on the ladies and on the doctor davidson had little patience with the slothful habit the door was suddenly flung open and miss thompson came in she looked round the room and then went up to davidson you lowdown skunk what have you been saying about me to the governor she was spluttering with rage there was a moments pause then the missionary drew forward a chair wont you be seated miss thompson ive been hoping to have another talk with you you poor lowlife bastard she burst into a torrent of insult foul and insolent davidson kept his grave eyes on her im indifferent to the abuse you think fit to heap on me miss thompson he said but i must beg you to remember that ladies are present tears by now were struggling with her anger her face was red and swollen as though she were choking what has happened asked dr macphail a fellers just been in here and he says i gotter beat it on the next boat was there a gleam in the missionarys eyes his face remained impassive you could hardly expect the governor to let you stay here under the circumstances you done it she shrieked you cant kid me you done it i dont want to deceive you i urged the governor to take the only possible step consistent with his obligations why couldnt you leave me be i wasnt doin you no harm you may be sure that if you had i should be the last man to resent it do you think i want to stay on in this poor imitation of a burg i dont look no busher do i in that case i dont see what cause of complaint you have he answered she gave an inarticulate cry of rage and flung out of the room there was a short silence its a relief to know that the governor has acted at last said davidson finally hes a weak man and he shillyshallied he said she was only here for a fortnight anyway and if she went on to apia that was under british jurisdiction and had nothing to do with him the missionary sprang to his feet and strode across the room its terrible the way the men who are in authority seek to evade their responsibility they speak as though evil that was out of sight ceased to be evil the very existence of that woman is a scandal and it does not help matters to shift it to another of the islands in the end i had to speak straight from the shoulder davidsons brow lowered and he protruded his firm chin he looked fierce and determined what do you mean by that our mission is not entirely without influence at washington i pointed out to the governor that it wouldnt do him any good if there was a complaint about the way he managed things here when has she got to go asked the doctor after a pause the san francisco boat is due here from sydney next tuesday shes to sail on that that was in five days time it was next day when he was coming back from the hospital where for want of something better to do macphail spent most of his mornings that the halfcaste stopped him as he was going upstairs excuse me dr macphail miss thompsons sick will you have a look at her certainly horn led him to her room she was sitting in a chair idly neither reading nor sewing staring in front of her she wore her white dress and the large hat with the flowers on it macphail noticed that her skin was yellow and muddy under her powder and her eyes were heavy im sorry to hear youre not well he said oh i aint sick really i just said that because i just had to see you ive got to clear on a boat thats going to frisco she looked at him and he saw that her eyes were suddenly startled she opened and clenched her hands spasmodically the trader stood at the door listening so i understand said the doctor she gave a little gulp i guess it aint very convenient for me to go to frisco just now i went to see the governor yesterday afternoon but i couldnt get to him i saw the secretary and he told me id got to take that boat and that was all there was to it i just had to see the governor so i waited outside his house this morning and when he come out i spoke to him he didnt want to speak to me ill say but i wouldnt let him shake me off and at last he said he hadnt no objection to my staying here till the next boat to sydney if the rev davidson will stand for it she stopped and looked at dr macphail anxiously i dont know exactly what i can do he said well i thought maybe you wouldnt mind asking him i swear to god i wont start anything here if hell just only let me stay i wont go out of the house if thatll suit him its no moren a fortnight ill ask him he wont stand for it said horn hell have you out on tuesday so you may as well make up your mind to it tell him i can get work in sydney straight stuff i mean taint asking very much ill do what i can and come and tell me right away will you i cant set down to a thing till i get the dope one way or the other it was not an errand that much pleased the doctor and characteristically perhaps he went about it indirectly he told his wife what miss thompson had said to him and asked her to speak to mrs davidson the missionarys attitude seemed rather arbitrary and it could do no harm if the girl were allowed to stay in pagopago another fortnight but he was not prepared for the result of his diplomacy the missionary came to him straightway mrs davidson tells me that thompson has been speaking to you dr macphail thus directly tackled had the shy mans resentment at being forced out into the open he felt his temper rising and he flushed i dont see that it can make any difference if she goes to sydney rather than to san francisco and so long as she promises to behave while shes here its dashed hard to persecute her the missionary fixed him with his stern eyes why is she unwilling to go back to san francisco i didnt enquire answered the doctor with some asperity and i think one does better to mind ones own business perhaps it was not a very tactful answer the governor has ordered her to be deported by the first boat that leaves the island hes only done his duty and i will not interfere her presence is a peril here i think youre very harsh and tyrannical the two ladies looked up at the doctor with some alarm but they need not have feared a quarrel for the missionary smiled gently im terribly sorry you should think that of me dr macphail believe me my heart bleeds for that unfortunate woman but im only trying to do my duty the doctor made no answer he looked out of the window sullenly for once it was not raining and across the bay you saw nestling among the trees the huts of a native village i think ill take advantage of the rain stopping to go out he said please dont bear me malice because i cant accede to your wish said davidson with a melancholy smile i respect you very much doctor and i should be sorry if you thought ill of me i have no doubt you have a sufficiently good opinion of yourself to bear mine with equanimity he retorted thats one on me chuckled davidson when dr macphail vexed with himself because he had been uncivil to no purpose went downstairs miss thompson was waiting for him with her door ajar well she said have you spoken to him yes im sorry he wont do anything he answered not looking at her in his embarrassment but then he gave her a quick glance for a sob broke from her he saw that her face was white with fear it gave him a shock of dismay and suddenly he had an idea but dont give up hope yet i think its a shame the way theyre treating you and im going to see the governor myself now he nodded her face brightened say thats real good of you im sure hell let me stay if you speak for me i just wont do a thing i didnt ought all the time im here dr macphail hardly knew why he had made up his mind to appeal to the governor he was perfectly indifferent to miss thompsons affairs but the missionary had irritated him and with him temper was a smouldering thing he found the governor at home he was a large handsome man a sailor with a grey toothbrush moustache and he wore a spotless uniform of white drill ive come to see you about a woman whos lodging in the same house as we are he said her names thompson i guess ive heard nearly enough about her dr macphail said the governor smiling ive given her the order to get out next tuesday and thats all i can do i wanted to ask you if you couldnt stretch a point and let her stay here till the boat comes in from san francisco so that she can go to sydney i will guarantee her good behaviour the governor continued to smile but his eyes grew small and serious id be very glad to oblige you dr macphail but ive given the order and it must stand the doctor put the case as reasonably as he could but now the governor ceased to smile at all he listened sullenly with averted gaze macphail saw that he was making no impression im sorry to cause any lady inconvenience but shell have to sail on tuesday and thats all there is to it but what difference can it make pardon me doctor but i dont feel called upon to explain my official actions except to the proper authorities macphail looked at him shrewdly he remembered davidsons hint that he had used threats and in the governors attitude he read a singular embarrassment davidsons a damned busybody he said hotly between ourselves dr macphail i dont say that i have formed a very favourable opinion of mr davidson but i am bound to confess that he was within his rights in pointing out to me the danger that the presence of a woman of miss thompsons character was to a place like this where a number of enlisted men are stationed among a native population he got up and dr macphail was obliged to do so too i must ask you to excuse me i have an engagement please give my respects to mrs macphail the doctor left him crestfallen he knew that miss thompson would be waiting for him and unwilling to tell her himself that he had failed he went into the house by the back door and sneaked up the stairs as though he had something to hide at supper he was silent and illatease but the missionary was jovial and animated dr macphail thought his eyes rested on him now and then with triumphant goodhumour it struck him suddenly that davidson knew of his visit to the governor and of its ill success but how on earth could he have heard of it there was something sinister about the power of that man after supper he saw horn on the verandah and as though to have a casual word with him went out she wants to know if youve seen the governor the trader whispered yes he wouldnt do anything im awfully sorry i cant do anything more i knew he wouldnt they darent go against the missionaries what are you talking about said davidson affably coming out to join them i was just saying there was no chance of your getting over to apia for at least another week said the trader glibly he left them and the two men returned into the parlour mr davidson devoted one hour after each meal to recreation presently a timid knock was heard at the door come in said mrs davidson in her sharp voice the door was not opened she got up and opened it they saw miss thompson standing at the threshold but the change in her appearance was extraordinary this was no longer the flaunting hussy who had jeered at them in the road but a broken frightened woman her hair as a rule so elaborately arranged was tumbling untidily over her neck she wore bedroom slippers and a skirt and blouse they were unfresh and bedraggled she stood at the door with the tears streaming down her face and did not dare to enter what do you want said mrs davidson harshly may i speak to mr davidson she said in a choking voice the missionary rose and went towards her come right in miss thompson he said in cordial tones what can i do for you she entered the room say im sorry for what i said to you the other day an for for everythin else i guess i was a bit lit up i beg pardon oh it was nothing i guess my backs broad enough to bear a few hard words she stepped towards him with a movement that was horribly cringing youve got me beat im all in you wont make me go back to frisco his genial manner vanished and his voice grew on a sudden hard and stern why dont you want to go back there she cowered before him i guess my people live there i dont want them to see me like this ill go anywhere else you say why dont you want to go back to san francisco ive told you he leaned forward staring at her and his great shining eyes seemed to try to bore into her soul he gave a sudden gasp the penitentiary she screamed and then she fell at his feet clasping his legs dont send me back there i swear to you before god ill be a good woman ill give all this up she burst into a torrent of confused supplication and the tears coursed down her painted cheeks he leaned over her and lifting her face forced her to look at him is that it the penitentiary i beat it before they could get me she gasped if the bulls grab me its three years for mine he let go his hold of her and she fell in a heap on the floor sobbing bitterly dr macphail stood up this alters the whole thing he said you cant make her go back when you know this give her another chance she wants to turn over a new leaf im going to give her the finest chance shes ever had if she repents let her accept her punishment she misunderstood the words and looked up there was a gleam of hope in her heavy eyes youll let me go no you shall sail for san francisco on tuesday she gave a groan of horror and then burst into low hoarse shrieks which sounded hardly human and she beat her head passionately on the ground dr macphail sprang to her and lifted her up come on you mustnt do that youd better go to your room and lie down ill get you something he raised her to her feet and partly dragging her partly carrying her got her downstairs he was furious with mrs davidson and with his wife because they made no effort to help the halfcaste was standing on the landing and with his assistance he managed to get her on the bed she was moaning and crying she was almost insensible he gave her a hypodermic injection he was hot and exhausted when he went upstairs again ive got her to lie down the two women and davidson were in the same positions as when he had left them they could not have moved or spoken since he went i was waiting for you said davidson in a strange distant voice i want you all to pray with me for the soul of our erring sister he took the bible off a shelf and sat down at the table at which they had supped it had not been cleared and he pushed the teapot out of the way in a powerful voice resonant and deep he read to them the chapter in which is narrated the meeting of jesus christ with the woman taken in adultery now kneel with me and let us pray for the soul of our dear sister sadie thompson he burst into a long passionate prayer in which he implored god to have mercy on the sinful woman mrs macphail and mrs davidson knelt with covered eyes the doctor taken by surprise awkward and sheepish knelt too the missionarys prayer had a savage eloquence he was extraordinarily moved and as he spoke the tears ran down his cheeks outside the pitiless rain fell fell steadily with a fierce malignity that was all too human at last he stopped he paused for a moment and said we will now repeat the lords prayer they said it and then following him they rose from their knees mrs davidsons face was pale and restful she was comforted and at peace but the macphails felt suddenly bashful they did not know which way to look ill just go down and see how she is now said dr macphail when he knocked at her door it was opened for him by horn miss thompson was in a rockingchair sobbing quietly what are you doing there exclaimed macphail i told you to lie down i cant lie down i want to see mr davidson my poor child what do you think is the good of it youll never move him he said hed come if i sent for him macphail motioned to the trader go and fetch him he waited with her in silence while the trader went upstairs davidson came in excuse me for asking you to come here she said looking at him sombrely i was expecting you to send for me i knew the lord would answer my prayer they stared at one another for a moment and then she looked away she kept her eyes averted when she spoke ive been a bad woman i want to repent thank god thank god he has heard our prayers he turned to the two men leave me alone with her tell mrs davidson that our prayers have been answered they went out and closed the door behind them gee whizz said the trader that night dr macphail could not get to sleep till late and when he heard the missionary come upstairs he looked at his watch it was two oclock but even then he did not go to bed at once for through the wooden partition that separated their rooms he heard him praying aloud till he himself exhausted fell asleep when he saw him next morning he was surprised at his appearance he was paler than ever tired but his eyes shone with an inhuman fire it looked as though he were filled with an overwhelming joy i want you to go down presently and see sadie he said i cant hope that her body is better but her soul her soul is transformed the doctor was feeling wan and nervous you were with her very late last night he said yes she couldnt bear to have me leave her you look as pleased as punch the doctor said irritably davidsons eyes shone with ecstasy a great mercy has been vouchsafed me last night i was privileged to bring a lost soul to the loving arms of jesus miss thompson was again in the rockingchair the bed had not been made the room was in disorder she had not troubled to dress herself but wore a dirty dressinggown and her hair was tied in a sluttish knot she had given her face a dab with a wet towel but it was all swollen and creased with crying she looked a drab she raised her eyes dully when the doctor came in she was cowed and broken wheres mr davidson she asked hell come presently if you want him answered macphail acidly i came here to see how you were oh i guess im o k you neednt worry about that have you had anything to eat horn brought me some coffee she looked anxiously at the door dyou think hell come down soon i feel as if it wasnt so terrible when hes with me are you still going on tuesday yes he says ive got to go please tell him to come right along you cant do me any good hes the only one as can help me now very well said dr macphail during the next three days the missionary spent almost all his time with sadie thompson he joined the others only to have his meals dr macphail noticed that he hardly ate hes wearing himself out said mrs davidson pitifully hell have a breakdown if he doesnt take care but he wont spare himself she herself was white and pale she told mrs macphail that she had no sleep when the missionary came upstairs from miss thompson he prayed till he was exhausted but even then he did not sleep for long after an hour or two he got up and dressed himself and went for a tramp along the bay he had strange dreams this morning he told me that hed been dreaming about the mountains of nebraska said mrs davidson thats curious said dr macphail he remembered seeing them from the windows of the train when he crossed america they were like huge molehills rounded and smooth and they rose from the plain abruptly dr macphail remembered how it struck him that they were like a womans breasts davidsons restlessness was intolerable even to himself but he was buoyed up by a wonderful exhilaration he was tearing out by the roots the last vestiges of sin that lurked in the hidden corners of that poor womans heart he read with her and prayed with her its wonderful he said to them one day at supper its a true rebirth her soul which was black as night is now pure and white like the newfallen snow i am humble and afraid her remorse for all her sins is beautiful i am not worthy to touch the hem of her garment have you the heart to send her back to san francisco said the doctor three years in an american prison i should have thought you might have saved her from that ah but dont you see its necessary do you think my heart doesnt bleed for her i love her as i love my wife and my sister all the time that she is in prison i shall suffer all the pain that she suffers bunkum cried the doctor impatiently you dont understand because youre blind shes sinned and she must suffer i know what shell endure shell be starved and tortured and humiliated i want her to accept the punishment of man as a sacrifice to god i want her to accept it joyfully she has an opportunity which is offered to very few of us god is very good and very merciful davidsons voice trembled with excitement he could hardly articulate the words that tumbled passionately from his lips all day i pray with her and when i leave her i pray again i pray with all my might and main so that jesus may grant her this great mercy i want to put in her heart the passionate desire to be punished so that at the end even if i offered to let her go she would refuse i want her to feel that the bitter punishment of prison is the thankoffering that she places at the feet of our blessed lord who gave his life for her the days passed slowly the whole household intent on the wretched tortured woman downstairs lived in a state of unnatural excitement she was like a victim that was being prepared for the savage rites of a bloody idolatry her terror numbed her she could not bear to let davidson out of her sight it was only when he was with her that she had courage and she hung upon him with a slavish dependence she cried a great deal and she read the bible and prayed sometimes she was exhausted and apathetic then she did indeed look forward to her ordeal for it seemed to offer an escape direct and concrete from the anguish she was enduring she could not bear much longer the vague terrors which now assailed her with her sins she had put aside all personal vanity and she slopped about her room unkempt and dishevelled in her tawdry dressinggown she had not taken off her nightdress for four days nor put on stockings her room was littered and untidy meanwhile the rain fell with a cruel persistence you felt that the heavens must at last be empty of water but still it poured down straight and heavy with a maddening iteration on the iron roof everything was damp and clammy there was mildew on the walls and on the boots that stood on the floor through the sleepless nights the mosquitoes droned their angry chant if it would only stop raining for a single day it wouldnt be so bad said dr macphail they all looked forward to the tuesday when the boat for san francisco was to arrive from sydney the strain was intolerable so far as dr macphail was concerned his pity and his resentment were alike extinguished by his desire to be rid of the unfortunate woman the inevitable must be accepted he felt he would breathe more freely when the ship had sailed sadie thompson was to be escorted on board by a clerk in the governors office this person called on the monday evening and told miss thompson to be prepared at eleven in the morning davidson was with her ill see that everything is ready i mean to come on board with her myself miss thompson did not speak when dr macphail blew out his candle and crawled cautiously under his mosquito curtains he gave a sigh of relief well thank god thats over by this time tomorrow shell be gone mrs davidson will be glad too she says hes wearing himself to a shadow said mrs macphail shes a different woman who sadie i should never have thought it possible it makes one humble dr macphail did not answer and presently he fell asleep he was tired out and he slept more soundly than usual he was awakened in the morning by a hand placed on his arm and starting up saw horn by the side of his bed the trader put his finger on his mouth to prevent any exclamation from dr macphail and beckoned to him to come as a rule he wore shabby ducks but now he was barefoot and wore only the lavalava of the natives he looked suddenly savage and dr macphail getting out of bed saw that he was heavily tattooed horn made him a sign to come on to the verandah dr macphail got out of bed and followed the trader out dont make a noise he whispered youre wanted put on a coat and some shoes quick dr macphails first thought was that something had happened to miss thompson what is it shall i bring my instruments hurry please hurry dr macphail crept back into the bedroom put on a waterproof over his pyjamas and a pair of rubbersoled shoes he rejoined the trader and together they tiptoed down the stairs the door leading out to the road was open and at it were standing half a dozen natives what is it repeated the doctor come along with me said horn he walked out and the doctor followed him the natives came after them in a little bunch they crossed the road and came on to the beach the doctor saw a group of natives standing round some object at the waters edge they hurried along a couple of dozen yards perhaps and the natives opened out as the doctor came up the trader pushed him forwards then he saw lying half in the water and half out a dreadful object the body of davidson dr macphail bent down he was not a man to lose his head in an emergency and turned the body over the throat was cut from ear to ear and in the right hand was still the razor with which the deed was done hes quite cold said the doctor he must have been dead some time one of the boys saw him lying there on his way to work just now and came and told me do you think he did it himself yes someone ought to go for the police horn said something in the native tongue and two youths started off we must leave him here till they come said the doctor they mustnt take him into my house i wont have him in my house youll do what the authorities say replied the doctor sharply in point of fact i expect theyll take him to the mortuary they stood waiting where they were the trader took a cigarette from a fold in his lavalava and gave one to dr macphail they smoked while they stared at the corpse dr macphail could not understand why do you think he did it asked horn the doctor shrugged his shoulders in a little while native police came along under the charge of a marine with a stretcher and immediately afterwards a couple of naval officers and a naval doctor they managed everything in a businesslike manner what about the wife said one of the officers now that youve come ill go back to the house and get some things on ill see that its broken to her shed better not see him till hes been fixed up a little i guess thats right said the naval doctor when dr macphail went back he found his wife nearly dressed mrs davidsons in a dreadful state about her husband she said to him as soon as he appeared he hasnt been to bed all night she heard him leave miss thompsons room at two but he went out if hes been walking about since then hell be absolutely dead dr macphail told her what had happened and asked her to break the news to mrs davidson but why did he do it she asked horrorstricken i dont know but i cant i cant you must she gave him a frightened look and went out he heard her go into mrs davidsons room he waited a minute to gather himself together and then began to shave and wash when he was dressed he sat down on the bed and waited for his wife at last she came she wants to see him she said theyve taken him to the mortuary wed better go down with her how did she take it i think shes stunned she didnt cry but shes trembling like a leaf wed better go at once when they knocked at her door mrs davidson came out she was very pale but dryeyed to the doctor she seemed unnaturally composed no word was exchanged and they set out in silence down the road when they arrived at the mortuary mrs davidson spoke let me go in and see him alone they stood aside a native opened a door for her and closed it behind her they sat down and waited one or two white men came and talked to them in undertones dr macphail told them again what he knew of the tragedy at last the door was quietly opened and mrs davidson came out silence fell upon them im ready to go back now she said her voice was hard and steady dr macphail could not understand the look in her eyes her pale face was very stern they walked back slowly never saying a word and at last they came round the bend on the other side of which stood their house mrs davidson gave a gasp and for a moment they stopped still an incredible sound assaulted their ears the gramophone which had been silent for so long was playing playing ragtime loud and harsh whats that cried mrs macphail with horror lets go on said mrs davidson they walked up the steps and entered the hall miss thompson was standing at her door chatting with a sailor a sudden change had taken place in her she was no longer the cowed drudge of the last days she was dressed in all her finery in her white dress with the high shiny boots over which her fat legs bulged in their cotton stockings her hair was elaborately arranged and she wore that enormous hat covered with gaudy flowers her face was painted her eyebrows were boldly black and her lips were scarlet she held herself erect she was the flaunting quean that they had known at first as they came in she broke into a loud jeering laugh and then when mrs davidson involuntarily stopped she collected the spittle in her mouth and spat mrs davidson cowered back and two red spots rose suddenly to her cheeks then covering her face with her hands she broke away and ran quickly up the stairs dr macphail was outraged he pushed past the woman into her room what the devil are you doing he cried stop that damned machine he went up to it and tore the record off she turned on him say doc you can that stuff with me what the hell are you doin in my room what do you mean he cried what dyou mean she gathered herself together no one could describe the scorn of her expression or the contemptuous hatred she put into her answer you men you filthy dirty pigs youre all the same all of you pigs pigs dr macphail gasped he understood viii envoi when your ship leaves honolulu they hang leis round your neck garlands of sweet smelling flowers the wharf is crowded and the band plays a melting hawaiian tune the people on board throw coloured streamers to those standing below and the side of the ship is gay with the thin lines of paper red and green and yellow and blue when the ship moves slowly away the streamers break softly and it is like the breaking of human ties men and women are joined together for a moment by a gaily coloured strip of paper red and blue and green and yellow and then life separates them and the paper is sundered so easily with a little sharp snap for an hour the fragments trail down the hull and then they blow away the flowers of your garlands fade and their scent is oppressive you throw them overboard the end
