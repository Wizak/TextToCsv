the old peabody pew august chapter i edgewood like all the other villages along the banks of the saco is full of sunny slopes and leafy hollows there are little rounded greenclad hillocks that might like their scriptural sisters skip with joy and there are grand rocky hills tufted with gaunt pine trees these leading the eye to the splendid heights of a neighbour state where snowcrowned peaks tower in the blue distance sweeping the horizon in a long line of majesty tory hill holds its own among the others for peaceful beauty and fair prospect and on its broad level summit sits the whitepainted orthodox meetinghouse this faces a grassy common where six roads meet as if the early settlers had determined that no one should lack salvation because of a difficulty in reaching its visible source the old church has had a dignified and fruitful past dating from that day in when young paul coffin received his call to preach at a stipend of fifty pounds sterling a year answering that never having heard of any uneasiness among the people about his doctrine or manner of life he declared himself pleased to settle as soon as might be judged convenient but that was a hundred and fifty years ago and much has happened since those simple strenuous old days the chastening hand of time has been laid somewhat heavily on the town as well as on the church some of her sons have marched to the wars and died on the field of honour some seeking better fortunes have gone westward others wearying of village life the rocky soil and rigours of farmwork have become entangled in the noise and competition the rush and strife of cities when the sexton rings the bell nowadays on a sunday morning it seems to have lost some of its oldtime militant strength something of its hope and courage but it still rings and although the davids and solomons the matthews marks and pauls of former congregations have left few descendants to perpetuate their labours it will go on ringing as long as there is a tabitha a dorcas a lois or a eunice left in the community this sentiment had been maintained for a quarter of a century but it was now especially strong as the old tory hill meetinghouse had been undergoing for several years more or less extensive repairs in point of fact the still stronger word improvements might be used with impunity though whenever the dorcas society being female and therefore possessed of notions regarding comfort and beauty suggested any serious changes the finance committees which were inevitably male in their composition generally disapproved of making any impious alterations in a tabernacle chapel temple or any other building used for purposes of worship the majority in these august bodies asserted that their ancestors had prayed and sung there for a century and a quarter and what was good enough for their ancestors was entirely suitable for them besides the community was becoming less and less prosperous and churchgoing was growing more and more lamentably uncommon so that even from a business standpoint any sums expended upon decoration by a poor and struggling parish would be worse than wasted in the particular year under discussion in this story the valiant and progressive mrs jeremiah burbank was the president of the dorcas society and she remarked privately and publicly that if her ancestors liked a smoky church they had a perfect right to the enjoyment of it but that she didnt intend to sit through meeting on winter sundays with her white ostrich feather turning grey and her eyes smarting and watering for the rest of her natural life whereupon this being in a business session she then and there proposed to her already hypnotized constituents ways of earning enough money to build a new chimney on the other side of the church an awestricken community witnessed this beneficent act of vandalism and finding that no thunderbolts of retribution descended from the skies greatly relished the change if one or two aged persons complained that they could not sleep as sweetly during sermontime in the now clear atmosphere of the church and that the parsons eye was keener than before why that was a mere detail and could not be avoided what was the loss of a little sleep compared with the discoloration of mrs jere burbanks white ostrich feather and the smarting of mrs jere burbanks eyes a new furnace followed the new chimney in due course and as a sense of comfort grew there was opportunity to notice the lack of beauty twice in sixty years had some welltodo summer parishioner painted the interior of the church at his own expense but although the roof had been many times reshingled it had always persisted in leaking so that the ceiling and walls were disfigured by unsightly spots and stains and streaks the question of shingling was tacitly felt to be outside the feminine domain but as there were five women to one man in the church membership the feminine domain was frequently obliged to extend its limits into the hitherto unknown matters of tarring and waterproofing were discussed in and out of season and the very schoolchildren imbibed knowledge concerning lapping overlapping and crosslapping and first and second quality of cedar shingles miss lobelia brewster who had a rooted distrust of anything done by mere man created strife by remarking that she could have stopped the leak in the belfry tower with her red flannel petticoat better than the milltown man with his newfangled rubber sheeting and that the last shingling could have been more thoroughly done by a female infant babe whereupon the person criticized retorted that he wished miss lobelia brewster had a few infant babes to put on the job hed like to see em try meantime several male members of the congregation who at one time or another had sat on the roof during the hottest of the dog days to see that shingling operations were conscientiously and skilfully performed were very pessimistic as to any satisfactory result ever being achieved the angle of the roof what they call the pitch they say that thats always been wrong announced the secretary of the dorcas in a business session is it that kind of pitch that the bible says you cant touch without being defiled if not i vote that we unshingle the roof and alter the pitch this proposal came from a sister named maria sharp who had valiantly offered the year before to move the smoky chimney with her own hands if the menfolks wouldnt but though the incendiary suggestion of altering the pitch was received with applause at the moment subsequent study of the situation proved that such a proceeding was entirely beyond the modest means of the society then there arose an ingenious and militant carpenter in a neighbouring village who asserted that he would shingle the meetinghouse roof for such and such a sum and agree to drink every drop of water that would leak in afterward this was felt by all parties to be a promise attended by extraordinary risks but it was accepted nevertheless miss lobelia brewster remarking that the rash carpenter being already married could not marry a dorcas anyway and even if he died he was not a resident of edgewood and therefore could be more easily spared and that it would be rather exciting just for a change to see a man drink himself to death with rainwater the expected tragedy never occurred however and the inspired shingler fulfilled his promise to the letter so that before many months the dorcas society proceeded with incredible exertion to earn more money and the interior of the church was neatly painted and made as fresh as a rose with no smoke no rain no snow nor melting ice to defile it the good old landmark that had been pointing its finger heavenward for over a century would now be clean and fragrant for years to come and the weary sisters leaned back in their respective rockingchairs and drew deep breaths of satisfaction these breaths continued to be drawn throughout an unusually arduous haying season until in fact a visitor from a neighbouring city was heard to remark that the tory hill meetinghouse would be one of the best preserved and pleasantest churches in the whole state of maine if only it were suitably carpeted this thought had secretly occurred to many a dorcas in her hours of piemaking preserving or cradlerocking but had been promptly extinguished as flagrantly extravagant and altogether impossible now that it had been openly mentioned the contagion of the idea spread and in a month every sort of honest machinery for the increase of funds had been set in motion harvest suppers pie sociables old folks concerts apron sales and as a last resort a subscription paper for the church floor measured hundreds of square yards and the carpet committee announce that a good ingrain could not be purchased even with the church discount for less than ninetyseven cents a yard the dorcases took out their pencils and when they multiplied the surface of the floor by the price of the carpet per yard each dorcas attaining a result entirely different from all the others there was a shriek of dismay especially from the secretary who had included in her mathematical operation certain figures in her possession representing the cubical contents of the church and the offending pitch of the roof thereby obtaining a product that would have dismayed a croesus time sped and efforts increased but the dorcases were at length obliged to clip the wings of their desire and content themselves with carpeting the pulpit and pulpit steps the choir and the two aisles leaving the floor in the pews until some future year how the women cut and contrived and matched that hardlybought red ingrain carpet in the short december afternoons that ensued after its purchase so that having failed to be ready for thanksgiving it could be finished for the christmas festivities they were sewing in the church and as the last stitches were being taken maria sharp suddenly ejaculated in her impulsive fashion wouldnt it have been just perfect if we could have had the pews repainted before we laid the new carpet it would indeed the president answered but it will take us all winter to pay for the present improvements without any thought of fresh paint if only we had a few more menfolks to help along or else none at all was lobelia brewsters suggestion its havin so few that keeps us all stirred up if there want any anywheres wed have women deacons and carpenters and painters and get along first rate for somehow the supply o women always holds out same as it does with caterpillars an flies an grasshoppers everybody laughed although maria sharp asserted that she for one was not willing to be called a caterpillar simply because there were too many women in the universe i never noticed before how shabby and scarred and dirty the pews are said the ministers wife as she looked at them reflectively ive been thinking all the afternoon of the story about the poor old woman and the lily and nancy wentworths clear voice broke into the discussion do you remember some one gave her a stalk of easter lilies and she set them in a glass pitcher on the kitchen table after looking at them for a few minutes she got up from her chair and washed the pitcher until the glass shone sitting down again she glanced at the little window it would never do she had forgotten how dusty and blurred it was and she took her cloth and burnished the panes then she scoured the table then the floor then blackened the stove before she sat down to her knitting and of course the lily had done it all just by showing in its whiteness how grimy everything else was the ministers wife who had been in edgewood only a few months looked admiringly at nancys bright face wondering that fiveandthirty years of life including ten of schoolteaching had done so little to mar its serenity the lily story is as true as the gospel she exclaimed and i can see how one thing has led you to another in making the church comfortable but my husband says that two coats of paint on the pews would cost a considerable sum how about cleaning them i dont believe theyve had a good hard washing since the flood the suggestion came from deacon millers wife to the president they cant even be scrubbed for less than fifteen or twenty dollars for i thought of that and asked mrs simpson yesterday and she said twenty cents a pew was the cheapest she could do it for weve done everything else said nancy wentworth with a twitch of her thread why dont we scrub the pews theres nothing in the orthodox creed to forbid is there speakin o creeds and here old mrs sargent paused in her work elder ransom from acreville stopped with us last night an he tells me they recite the euthanasian creed every few sundays in the episcopal church i didnt want him to know how ignorant i was but i looked up the word in the dictionary it means easy death and i cant see any sense in that though its a terrible long creed the elder says an if its any longer n ourn i should think anybody might easy die learnin it i think the word is athanasian ventured the ministers wife elder ransoms always plumb full o doctrine asserted miss brewster pursuing the subject for my part im glad he preferred acreville to our place he was so busy bein a minister he never got round to bein a human creeter when he used to come to sociables and picnics always lookin kind o like the potato blight i used to think how complete hed be if he had a foldin pulpit under his coat tails they make foldin beds nowadays an i spose they could make foldin pulpits if there was a call land sakes i hope there wont be exclaimed mrs sargent an the elder never said much of anything either though he was always preachin now your husband mis baxter always has plenty to say after you think hes all through theres water in his well when the others is all dry but how about the pews interrupted mrs burbank i think nancys idea is splendid and i want to see it carried out we might make it a picnic bring our luncheons and work all together let every woman in the congregation come and scrub her own pew some are too old others live at too great a distance and the ministers wife sighed a little indeed most of those who once owned the pews or sat in them seemed to be dead or gone away to live in busier places ive no patience with em gallivantin over the earth and here lobelia rose and shook the carpet threads from her lap i shouldnt want to live in a livelier place than edgewood seems though we wash and hang out mondays iron tuesdays cook wednesdays clean house and mend thursdays and fridays bake saturdays and go to meetin sundays i dont hardly see how they can do any more n that in chicago never mind if we have lost members said the indomitable mrs burbank the members we still have left must work all the harder well each clean our own pew then take a few of our neighbours and then hire mrs simpson to do the wainscoting and floor can we scrub friday and lay the carpet saturday my husband and deacon miller can help us at the end of the week all in favour manifest it by the usual sign contrary minded it is a vote there never were any contrary minded when mrs jere burbank was in the chair public sentiment in edgewood was swayed by the dorcas society but mrs burbank swayed the dorcases themselves as the wind sways the wheat chapter ii the old meeting house wore an animated aspect when the eventful friday came a cold brilliant sparkling december day with good sleighing and with energy in every breath that swept over the dazzling snowfields the sexton had built a fire in the furnace on the way to his morning work a fire so economically contrived that it would last exactly the four or five necessary hours and not a second more at eleven oclock all the pillars of the society had assembled having finished their own household work and laid out on their respective kitchen tables comfortable luncheons for the men of the family if they were fortunate enough to number any among their luxuries water was heated upon oilstoves set about here and there and there was a brave array of scrubbingbrushes cloths soap and even sand and soda for it had been decided and manifestedbytheusualsignandnocontrarymindedanditwasavote that the dirt was to come off whether the paint came with it or not each of the fifteen women present selected a block of seats preferably one in which her own was situated and all fell busily to work there is nobody here to clean the rightwing pews said nancy wentworth so i will take those for my share youre not making a very wise choice nancy and the ministers wife smiled as she spoke the infant class of the sundayschool sits there you know and i expect the paint has had extra wear and tear families dont seem to occupy those pews regularly nowadays i can remember when every seat in the whole church was filled wings an all mused mrs sargent wringing out her wascloth in a reminiscent mood the one in front o you nancy was always called the deef pew in the old times and all the folks that was hard o hearin used to congregate there the next pew hasnt been occupied since i came here said the ministers wife no answered mrs sargent glad of any opportunity to retail neighbourhood news squire beans folks have moved to portland to be with the married daughter somebody has to stay with her and her husband wont the squire aint a strong man and hes most too old to go to meetin now the youngest son has just died in new york so i hear what ailed him inquired maria sharp i guess he was completely wore out takin care of his health returned mrs sargent he had a splendid constitution from a boy but he was always afraid it wouldnt last him the seat back o squire beans is the old peabody pew aint that the peabody pew youre scrubbin nancy i believe so nancy answered never pausing in her labours its so long since anybody sat there its hard to remember it is the peabodys i know it because the aisle runs right up facin it i can see old deacon peabody settin in this end same as if twas yesterday he had died before jere and i came back here to live said mrs burbank the first i remember justin peabody sat in the end seat the sister that died next and in the corner against the wall mrs peabody with a crepe shawl and a palmleaf fan they were a handsome family you used to sit with them sometimes nancy esther was great friends with you yes she was nancy replied lifting the tattered cushion from its place and brushing it and i with her what is the use of scrubbing and carpeting when there are only twenty pewcushions and six hassocks in the whole church and most of them ragged how can i ever mend this i shouldnt trouble myself to darn other peoples cushions this unchristian sentiment came in mrs millers ringing tones from the rear of the church i dont know why argued maria sharp im going to mend my aunt achsas cushion and we havent spoken for years but hers is the next pew to mine and im going to have my part of the church look decent even if she is too stingy to do her share besides there arent any peabodys left to do their own darning and nancy was friends with esther yes its nothing more than right nancy replied with a note of relief in her voice considering esther though he dont belong to the scrubbin sex there is one peabody alive as you know if you stop to think maria for justins alive and livin out west somewheres at least hes as much alive as ever he was he was as good as dead when he was twentyone but his mother was always too softhearted to bury him there was considerable laughter over this sally of the outspoken mrs sargent whose keen wit was the delight of the neighbourhood i know hes alive and doing business in detroit for i got his address a week or ten days ago and wrote asking him if hed like to give a couple of dollars toward repairing the old church everybody looked at mrs burbank with interest hasnt he answered asked maria sharp nancy wentworth held her breath turned her face to the wall and silently wiped the paint of the wainscoting the blood that had rushed into her cheeks at mrs sargents jeering reference to justin peabody still lingered there for any one who ran to read but fortunately nobody ran they were too busy scrubbing not yet folks dont hurry about answering when you ask them for a contribution replied the president with a cynicism common to persons who collect funds for charitable purposes george wickham sent me twentyfive cents from denver when i wrote him a receipt i said thank you same as aunt polly did when the neighbours brought her a piece of beef ever so much obleeged but dont forget me when you come to kill a pig now mrs baxter you shant clean james bruces pew or what was his before he turned second advent ill do that myself for he used to be in my sundayschool class hes the backbone o that congregation now asserted mrs sargent and they say hes goin to marry mrs sam peters who sings in their choir as soon as his year is up they make a perfect fool of him in that church you cant make a fool of a man that nature aint begun with argued miss brewster jim bruce never was very strongminded but i declare it seems to me that when men lose their wives they lose their wits i was sure jim would marry hannah thompson that keeps house for him i suspected she was lookin out for a life job when she hired out with him hannah thompson may keep jims house but shell never keep jim thats certain affirmed the president and i cant see that mrs peters will better herself much i dont blame her for one came in no uncertain tones from the leftwing pews and the widow buzzell rose from her knees and approached the group by the pulpit if theres anything duller than cookin three meals a day for yourself and settin down and eatin em by yourself and then gettin up and clearin em away after yourself id like to know it i shouldnt want any goodlookin pleasantspoken man to offer himself to me without he expected to be snapped up thats all but if youve made out to get one husband in york county you can thank the lord and not expect any more favours i used to think tom was poor compny and complain i couldnt have any conversation with him but land i could talk at him and theres considerable comfort in that and i could pick up after him now every room in my house is clean and every closet and bureau drawer too i cant start drawin in another rug for ive got all the rugs i can step foot on i dried so many apples last year i shant need to cut up any this season my jelly and preserves aint out and there i am and there most of us are in this village without a man to take steps for and trot round after theres just three husbands among the fifteen women scrubbin here now and the rest of us is all old maids and widders no wonder the menfolks die or move away like justin peabody a place with such a mess o womenfolks aint healthy to live in whatever lobelia brewster may say chapter iii justin peabody had once faithfully struggled with the practical difficulties of life in edgewood or so he had thought in those old days of which nancy wentworth was thinking as she wiped the paint of the peabody pew work in the mills did not attract him he had no capital to invest in a stock of goods for storekeeping schoolteaching offered him only a pittance there remained then only the farm if he were to stay at home and keep his mother company justin dont seem to take no holt of things said the neighbours good heavens it seemed to him that there were no things to take hold of that was his first thought later he grew to think that the trouble all lay in himself and both thoughts bred weakness the farm had somehow supported the family in the old deacons time but justin seemed unable to coax a competence from the soil he could and did rise early and work late till the earth sow crops but he could not make the rain fall nor the sun shine at the times he needed them and the elements however much they might seem to favour his neighbours seldom smiled on his enterprises the crows liked justins corn better than any other in edgewood it had a richness peculiar to itself a quality that appealed to the most jaded palate so that it was really worth while to fly over a mile of intervening fields and pay it the delicate compliment of preference justin could explain the attitude of caterpillars worms grasshoppers and potatobugs toward him only by assuming that he attracted them as the magnet in the toy boxes attracts the miniature fishes land of liberty look at em congregate ejaculated jabe slocum when he was called in for consultation now if youd gone in for breedin insecks you could be as proud as cuffy an exhibit em at the county fair theyd give yer prizes for size an numbers an speed i guess why say theyre real crowded for room the plants aint give em enough leaves to roost on have you tried bug death it acts like a tonic on them said justin gloomily sho you dont say so now mine cant abide the sight nor smell of it what bout paris green they thrive on it its as good as an appetizer well said jabe slocum revolving the quid of tobacco in his mouth reflectively the bug that aint got no objection to pison is a bug thats got ways o thinkin an feelin an reasonin that i aint able to cope with praps its all a leadin o providence mebbe it shows youd ought to quit farmin crops an take to raisin live stock justin did just that as a matter of fact a year or two later but stock that has within itself the power of being live has also rare qualifications for being dead when occasion suits and it generally did suit justins stock it proved prone not only to all the general diseases that cattleflesh is heir to but was capable even of suicide at least it is true that two valuable jersey calves tied to stakes on the hillside had flung themselves violently down the bank and strangled themselves with their own ropes in a manner which seemed to show that they found no pleasure in existence at all events on the peabody farm these were some of the little tragedies that had sickened young justin peabody with life in edgewood and nancy wentworth even then realized some of them and sympathized without speaking in a girls poor helpless way mrs simpson had washed the floor in the right wing of the church and nancy had cleaned all the paint now she sat in the old peabody pew darning the forlorn faded cushion with grey carpetthread thread as grey as her own life the scrubbingparty had moved to its labours in a far corner of the church and two of the women were beginning preparations for the basket luncheons nancys needle was no busier than her memory long years ago she had often sat in the peabody pew sometimes at first as a girl of sixteen when asked by esther and then on coming home from school at eighteen finished she had been invited now and again by mrs peabody herself on those sundays when her own invalid mother had not attended service those were wonderful sundays sundays of quiet trembling peace and maiden joy justin sat beside her and she had been sure then but had long since grown to doubt the evidence of her senses that he too vibrated with pleasure at the nearness was there not a summer morning when his hand touched her white lace mitt as they held the hymnbook together and the lines of the rise my soul and stretch thy wings thy better portion trace became blurred on the page and melted into something indistinguishable for a full minute or two afterward were there not looks and looks and looks or had she some misleading trick of vision in those days justins dark handsome profile rose before her the level brows and fine lashes the wellcut nose and lovable mouth the peabody mouth and chin somewhat too sweet and pliant for strength perhaps then the eyes turned to hers in the old way just for a fleeting glance as they had so often done at prayermeeting or sociable or sunday service was it not a mans heart she had seen in them and oh if she could only be sure that her own womans heart had not looked out from hers drawn from its maiden shelter in spite of all her wish to keep it hidden then followed two dreary years of indecision and suspense when justins eyes met hers less freely when his looks were always gloomy and anxious when affairs at the peabody farm grew worse and worse when his mother followed her husband the old deacon and her daughter esther to the buryingground in the churchyard then the end of all things came the end of the world for nancy justins departure for the west in a very frenzy of discouragement over the narrowness and limitation and injustice of his lot over the rockiness and barrenness and unkindness of the new england soil over the general bitterness of fate and the bludgeonings of chance he was a failure born of a family of failures if the world owed him a living he had yet to find the method by which it could be earned all this he thought and uttered and much more of the same sort in these days of humbled pride self was paramount though it was a self he despised there was no time for love who was he for a girl to lean upon he who could not stand erect himself he bade a stiff goodbye to his neighbours and to nancy he vouchsafed little more a handshake with no thrill of love in it such as might have furnished her palm at least some memories to dwell upon a few stilted words of leavetaking a halting meaningless sentence or two about his botch of life then he walked away from the wentworth doorstep but half way down the garden path where the shrivelled hollyhocks stood like sentinels did a wave of something different sweep over him a wave of the boyish irresponsible past when his heart had wings and could fly without fear to its mate a wave of the past that was rushing through nancys mind wellnigh burying her in its bittersweet waters for he lifted his head and suddenly retracing his steps he came toward her and taking her hand again said forlornly youll see me back when my luck turns nancy nancy knew that the words might mean little or much according to the manner in which they were uttered but to her hurt pride and sore shamed womaninstinct they were a promise simply because there was a choking sound in justins voice and tears in justins eyes youll see me back when my luck turns nancy this was the phrase upon which she had lived for more than ten years nancy had once heard the old parson say ages ago that the whole purpose of life was the growth of the soul that we eat sleep clothe ourselves work love all to give the soul another day month year in which to develop she used to wonder if her soul could be growing in the monotonous round of her dull duties and her duller pleasures she did not confess it even to herself nevertheless she knew that she worked ate slept to live until justins luck turned her love had lain in her heart a bird without a song year after year her mother had dwelt by her side and never guessed her father too and both were dead the neighbours also lynxeyed and curious had never suspected if she had suffered no one in edgewood was any the wiser for the maiden heart is not commonly worn on the sleeve in new england if she had been openly pledged to justin peabody she could have waited twice ten years with a decent show of selfrespect for long engagements were viewed rather as a matter of course in that neighbourhood the endless months had gone on since that grey november day when justin had said goodbye it had been just before thanksgiving and she went to church with an aching and ungrateful heart the parson read from the eighth chapter of st matthew a most unexpected selection for that holiday if you cant find anything else to be thankful for he cried go home and be thankful you are not a leper nancy took the drastic counsel away from the church with her and it was many a year before she could manage to add to this slender store anything to increase her gratitude for mercies given though all the time she was outwardly busy cheerful and helpful justin had once come back to edgewood and it was the bitterest drop in her cup of bitterness that she was spending that winter in berwick where so the neighbours told him she was a great favourite in society and was receiving much attention from gentlemen so that she had never heard of his visit until the spring had come again parted friends did not keep up with one anothers affairs by means of epistolary communication in those days in edgewood it was not the custom spoken words were difficult enough to justin peabody and written words were quite impossible especially if they were to be used to define his halfconscious desires and his fluctuations of will or to recount his disappointments and discouragements and mistakes chapter iv it was saturday afternoon the twentyfourth of december and the weary sisters of the dorcas band rose from their bruised knees and removed their little stores of carpettacks from their mouths this was a feminine custom of long standing and as no village dressmaker had ever died of pins in the digestive organs so were no symptoms of carpettacks ever discovered in any dorcas living or dead men wondered at the habit and reviled it but stood confounded in the presence of its indubitable harmlessness the red ingrain carpet was indeed very warm beautiful and comforting to the eye and the sisters were suitably grateful to providence and devoutly thankful to themselves that they had been enabled to buy sew and lay so many yards of it but as they stood looking at their completed task it was cruelly true that there was much left to do the aisles had been painted dark brown on each side of the red strips leading from the doors to the pulpit but the rest of the church floor was a thing of shreds and patches each member of the carpet committee had paid as a matter of pride however ill she could afford it three dollars and sixtyseven cents for sufficient carpet to lay in her own pew but these brilliant spots of conscientious effort only made the stretches of bare unpainted floor more evident and that was not all traces of former spasmodic and individual efforts desecrated the present ideals the doctors pew had a pink and blue brussels on it the lawyers striped staircarpeting the browns from deerwander sported straw matting and were not abashed while the greens the whites the blacks and the greys displayed floor coverings as dissimilar as their names i never noticed it before exclaimed maria sharp but it aint christian that floor its heathenish and ungodly for mercys sake dont swear maria said mrs miller nervously weve done our best and lets hope that folks will look up and not down it isnt as if they were going to set in the chandelier theyll have something else to think about when nancy gets her hemlock branches and white carnations in the pulpit vases this morning my abner picked off two pinks from the plant ive been nursing in my diningroom for weeks trying to make it bloom for christmas i slapped his hands good and its been haunting me ever since to think i had to correct him the day before christmas come lobelia we must be hurrying one thing comforts me exclaimed the widow buzzell as she took her hammer and tacks preparatory to leaving and that is that the methodist meetinhouse aint got any carpet at all mrs buzzell mrs buzzell interrupted the ministers wife with a smile that took the sting from her speech it will be like punishing little abner miller if we think those thoughts on christmas eve we shall surely be haunted afterward and anyway interjected maria sharp who always saved the situation you just wait and see if the methodists dont say theyd rather have no carpet at all than have one that dont go all over the floor i know em and she put on her hood and blanketshawl as she gave one last fond look at the improvements im going home to get my supper and come back afterward to lay the carpet in my pew my beans and brown bread will be just right by now and perhaps it will rest me a little besides i must feed zekiel as nancy wentworth spoke she sat in a corner of her own modest rear seat looking a little pale and tired her waving dark hair had loosened and fallen over her cheeks and her eyes gleamed from under it wistfully nowadays nancys eyes never had the sparkle of gazing into the future but always the liquid softness that comes from looking backward the church will be real cold by then nancy objected mrs burbank goodnight mrs baxter oh no i shall be back by halfpast six and i shall not work long do you know what i believe ill do mrs burbank just through the holidays christmas and new years both coming on sunday this year therell be a great many out to church not counting the strangers thatll come to the special service tomorrow instead of putting down my own pew carpet thatll never be noticed here in the back ill lay it in the old peabody pew for the red aislestrip leads straight up to it the ministers always go up that side and it does look forlorn thats so and all the more because my pew thats exactly opposite in the left wing is new carpeted and cushioned replied the president i think its real generous of you nancy because the riverboro folks knowing that youre a member of the carpet committee will be sure to notice and think its queer you havent made an effort to carpet your own pew never mind smiled nancy wearily riverboro folks never go to bed on saturday nights without wondering what edgewood is thinking about them the ministers wife stood at her window watching nancy as she passed the parsonage how wasted how wasted she sighed going home to eat her lonely supper and feed zekiel i can bear it for the others but not for nancy now she has lighted her lamp now she has put fresh pine on the fire for new smoke comes from the chimney why should i sit down and serve my dear husband and nancy feed zekiel there was some truth in mrs baxters feeling mrs buzzell for instance had three sons maria sharp was absorbed in her lame father and her sundayschool work and lobelia brewster would not have considered matrimony a blessing even under the most favourable conditions but nancy was framed and planned for other things and zekiel was an insufficient channel for her soft womanly sympathy and her bright activity of mind and body zekiel had lost his tail in a mowingmachine zekiel had the asthma and the immersion of his nose in milk made him sneeze so he was wont to slip his paw in and out of the dish and lick it patiently for five minutes together nancy often watched him pityingly giving him kind and gentle words to sustain his fainting spirit but tonight she paid no heed to him although he sneezed violently to attract her attention she had put her supper on the lighted table by the kitchen window and was pouring out her cup of tea when a boy rapped at the door heres a paper and a letter miss wentworth he said its the second this week and they think over to the store that that berwick widower must be settin up and takin notice she had indeed received a letter the day before an unsigned communication consisting only of the words second epistle of john verse she had taken her bible to look out the reference and found it to be having many things to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full the envelope was postmarked new york and she smiled thinking that mrs emerson a charming lady who had spent the summer in edgewood and had sung with her in the village choir was coming back as she had promised to have a sleigh ride and see edgewood in its winter dress nancy had almost forgotten the first letter in the excitements of her busy day and now here was another from boston this time she opened the envelope and found again only a single sentence printed not written lest she should guess the hand she wondered second epistle of john verse and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another was it mrs emerson could it be any one else was it no it might have been years ago but not now not now and yet he was always so different from other people and once in church he had handed her the hymnbook with his finger pointing to a certain verse she always fancied that her secret fidelity of heart rose from the fact that justin peabody was different from the hour of their first acquaintance she was ever comparing him with his companions and always to his advantage so long as a woman finds all men very much alike as lobelia brewster did save that she allowed some to be worse she is in no danger but the moment in which she perceives and discriminates subtle differences marvelling that there can be two opinions about a mans superiority that moment the miracle has happened and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another no it could not be from justin she drank her tea played with her beans abstractedly and nibbled her slice of steaming brown bread not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee no not a new one twelve fifteen years old that commandment that we love one another who was speaking who had written these words the first letter sounded just like mrs emerson who had said she was a very poor correspondent but that she should just drop down on nancy one of these days but this second letter never came from mrs emerson well there would be an explanation some time a pleasant one one to smile over and tell zekiel and repeat to the neighbours but not an unexpected sacred beautiful explanation such a one as the heart of a woman could imagine if she were young enough and happy enough to hope she washed her cup and plate replaced the uneaten beans in the brown pot and put them away with the round loaf folded the cloth lobelia brewster said nancy always set out her meals as if she was entertainin company from portland closed the stove dampers carried the lighted lamp to a safe corner shelf and lifted zekiel to his cushion on the highbacked rocker doing all with the nice precision of long habit then she wrapped herself warmly and locking the lonely little house behind her set out to finish her work in the church chapter v at this precise moment justin peabody was eating his own beans and brown bread articles of diet of which his detroit landlady was lamentably ignorant at the new tavern not far from the meetinghouse it would not be fair to him to say that mrs burbanks letter had brought him back to edgewood but it had certainly accelerated his steps for the first six years after justin peabody left home he had drifted about from place to place saving every possible dollar of his uncertain earnings in the conscious hope that he could go back to new england and ask nancy wentworth to marry him the west was prosperous and progressive but how he yearned in idle moments for the grimmer and more sterile soil that had given him birth then came what seemed to him a brilliant chance for a lucky turn of his savings and he invested them in an enterprise which wonderfully as it promised failed within six months and left him penniless at that moment he definitely gave up all hope and for the next few years he put nancy as far as possible out of his mind in the full belief that he was acting an honourable part in refusing to drag her into his tangled and fruitless way of life if she ever did care for him and he could not be sure she was always so shy she must have outgrown the feeling long since and be living happily or at least contentedly in her own way he was glad in spite of himself when he heard that she had never married but at least he hadnt it on his conscience that he had kept her single on the seventeenth of december justin his business day over was walking toward the dreary house in which he ate and slept as he turned the corner he heard one woman say to another as they watched a man stumbling sorrowfully down the street going home will be the worst of all for him to find nobody there that was what going home had meant for him these ten years but he afterward felt it strange that this thought should have struck him so forcibly on that particular day entering the boardinghouse he found mrs burbanks letter with its edgewood postmark on the hall table and took it up to his room he kindled a little fire in the airtight stove watching the flame creep from shavings to kindlings from kindlings to small pine and from small pine to the round hardwood sticks then when the result seemed certain he closed the stove door and sat down to read the letter whereupon all manner of strange things happened in his head and heart and flesh and spirit as he sat there alone his hands in his pockets his feet braced against the legs of the stove it was a cold winter night and the snow and sleet beat against the windows he looked about the ugly room at the washstand with its square of oilcloth in front and its detestable bowl and pitcher at the rigours of his white iron bedstead with the valley in the middle of the lumpy mattress and the darns in the rumpled pillowcases at the dull photographs of the landladys hideous husband and children enshrined on the mantelshelf looked at the abomination of desolation surrounding him until his soul sickened and cried out like a childs for something more like home it was as if a spring thaw had melted his icebound heart and on the crest of a wave it was drifting out into the milder waters of some unknown sea he could have laid his head in the kind lap of a woman and cried comfort me give me companionship or i die the wind howled in the chimney and rattled the loose windowsashes the snow freezing as it fell dashed against the glass with hard cutting little blows at least that is the way in which the wind and snow flattered themselves they were making existence disagreeable to justin peabody when he read the letter but never were elements more mistaken it was a june sunday in the boardinghouse bedroom and for that matter it was not the boardinghouse bedroom at all it was the old orthodox church on tory hill in edgewood the windows were wide open and the smell of the purple clover and the humming of the bees were drifting into the sweet wide spaces within justin was sitting in the end of the peabody pew and nancy wentworth was beside him nancy cool and restful in her white dress darkhaired nancy under the shadow of her shirred muslin hat rise my soul and stretch thy wings thy better portion trace the melodeon gave the tune and nancy and he stood to sing taking the book between them his hand touched hers and as the music of the hymn rose and fell the future unrolled itself before his eyes a future in which nancy was his wedded wife and the happy years stretched on and on in front of them until there was a row of little heads in the old peabody pew and mother and father could look proudly along the line at the young things they were bringing into the house of the lord the recalling of that vision worked like magic in justins blood his soul rose and stretched its wings and traced its better portion vividly as he sprang to his feet and walked up and down the bedroom floor he would get a few days leave and go back to edgewood for christmas to join with all the old neighbours in the service at the meetinghouse and in pursuance of this resolve he shook his fist in the face of the landladys husband on the mantelpiece and dared him to prevent he had a salary of fifty dollars a month with some very slight prospect of an increase after january he did not see how two persons could eat and drink and lodge and dress on it in detroit but he proposed to give nancy wentworth the refusal of that magnificent future that brilliant and tempting offer he had exactly one hundred dollars in the bank and sixty or seventy of them would be spent in the journeys counting two happy blessed fares back from edgewood to detroit and if he paid only his own fare back he would throw the price of the other into the pond behind the wentworth house he would drop another ten dollars into the plate on christmas day toward the repairs on the church if he starved he would do that he was a failure everything his hand touched turned to naught he looked himself full in the face recognizing his weakness and in this supremest moment of recognition he was a stronger man than he had been an hour before his drooping shoulders had straightened the restless look had gone from his eyes his sombre face had something of repose in it the repose of a settled purpose he was a failure but perhaps if he took the risks and if nancy would take them but that was the trouble women were so unselfish they were always willing to take risks and one ought not to let them perhaps he might do better in trying to make a living for two than he had in working for himself alone he would go home tell nancy that he was an unlucky goodfornaught and ask her if she would try her hand at making him over chapter vi these were the reasons that had brought justin peabody to edgewood on the saturday afternoon before christmas and had taken him to the new tavern on tory hill near the meetinghouse nobody recognized him at the station or noticed him at the tavern and after his supper he put on his overcoat and started out for a walk aimlessly hoping that he might meet a friend or failing that intending to call on some of his old neighbours with the view of hearing the village news and securing some information which might help him to decide when he had better lay himself and his misfortunes at nancy wentworths feet they were pretty feet he remembered that fact well enough under the magical influence of familiar sights and sounds and odours he was restless miserable anxious homesick not for detroit but for some heretofore unimagined good yet like bunyans shepherd boy in the valley of humiliation he carried the herb called heartsease in his bosom for he was at last loving consciously how white the old church looked and how green the blinds it must have been painted very lately that meant that the parish was fairly prosperous there were new shutters in the belfry tower too he remembered the former open space and the rusty bell and he liked the change did the chimney use to be in that corner no but his father had always said it would have drawn better if it had been put there in the beginning new shingles within a year that was evident to a practised eye he wondered if anything had been done to the inside of the building but he must wait until the morrow to see for of course the doors would be locked no the one at the right side was ajar he opened it softly and stepped into the tiny square entry that he recalled so well the one through which the sundayschool children ran out to the steps from their catechism apparently enjoying the sunshine after a spell of orthodoxy the little entry where the village girls congregated while waiting for the last bell to ring they made a soft blur of pink and blue and buff a little flutter of curls and braids and fans and sunshades in his minds eye as he closed the outer door behind him and gently opened the inner one the church was flooded with moonlight and snowlight and there was one lamp burning at the back of the pulpit a candle too on the pulpit steps there was the tiptaptip of a tackhammer going on in a distant corner was somebody hanging christmas garlands the new red carpet attracted his notice and as he grew accustomed to the dim light it carried his eye along the aisle he had trod so many years of sundays to the old familiar pew the sound of the hammer ceased and a woman rose from her knees a stranger was doing for the family honour what he ought himself to have done the woman turned to shake her skirt and it was nancy wentworth he might have known it women were always faithful they always remembered old landmarks old days old friends old duties his father and mother and esther were all gone who but dear nancy would have made the old peabody pew right and tidy for the christmas festival bless her kind womanly heart she looked just the same to him as when he last saw her mercifully he seemed to have held in remembrance all these years not so much her youthful bloom as her general qualities of mind and heart her cheeriness her spirit her unflagging zeal her bright womanliness her grey dress was turned up in front over a crimson moreen petticoat she had on a cosy jacket a fur turban of some sort with a redbreast in it and her cheeks were flushed from exertion sweet records and promises as sweet had always met in nancys face and either he had forgotten how pretty she was or else she had absolutely grown prettier during his absence nancy would have chosen the supreme moment of meeting very differently but she might well have chosen worse she unpinned her skirt and brushed the threads off smoothed the pew cushions carefully and took a last stitch in the ragged hassock she then lifted the bible and the hymnbook from the rack and putting down a bit of flannel on the pulpit steps took a flatiron from an oilstove and opening the ancient books pressed out the wellthumbed leaves one by one with infinite care after replacing the volumes in their accustomed place she first extinguished the flame of her stove which she tucked out of sight and then blew out the lamp and the candle the church was still light enough for objects to be seen in a shadowy way like the objects in a dream and justin did not realize that he was a man in the flesh looking at a woman spying it might be upon her privacy he was one part of a dream and she another and he stood as if waiting and fearing to be awakened nancy having done all came out of the pew and standing in the aisle looked back at the scene of her labours with pride and content and as she looked some desire to stay a little longer in the dear old place must have come over her or some dread of going back to her lonely cottage for she sat down in justins corner of the pew with folded hands her eyes fixed dreamily on the pulpit and her ears hearing not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning justins grasp on the latch tightened as he prepared to close the door and leave the place but his instinct did not warn him quickly enough after all for obeying some uncontrollable impulse nancy suddenly fell on her knees in the pew and buried her face in the cushions the dream broke and in an instant justin was a man worse than that he was an eavesdropper ashamed of his unsuspected presence he felt himself standing with covered head and feet shod in the holy temple of a womans heart but his involuntary irreverence brought abundant grace with it the glimpse and the revelation wrought their miracles silently and irresistibly not by the slow processes of growth which nature demands for her enterprises but with the sudden swiftness of the spirit in an instant changes had taken place in justins soul which his socalled experiencing religion twentyfive years back had been powerless to effect he had indeed been baptized then but the recording angel could have borne witness that this second baptism fructified the first and became the real herald of the new birth and the new creature chapter vii justin peabody silently closed the inner door and stood in the entry with his head bent and his heart in a whirl until he should hear nancy rise to her feet he must take this heavensent chance of telling her all but how do it without alarming her a moment and her step sounded in the stillness of the empty church obeying the first impulse he passed through the outer door and standing on the step knocked once twice three times then opening it a little and speaking through the chink he called is miss nancy wentworth here im here in a moment came nancys answer and then with a little wondering tremor in her voice as if a hint of the truth had already dawned whats wanted youre wanted nancy wanted badly by justin peabody come back from the west the door opened wide and justin faced nancy standing halfway down the aisle her eyes brilliant her lips parted a week ago justins apparition confronting her in the empty meetinghouse after nightfall even had she been prepared for it as now by his voice would have terrified her beyond measure now it seemed almost natural and inevitable she had spent these last days in the church where both of them had been young and happy together the two letters had brought him vividly to mind and her labour in the old peabody pew had been one long excursion into the past in which he was the most prominent and the bestloved figure i said id come back to you when my luck turned nancy these were so precisely the words she expected him to say should she ever see him again face to face that for an additional moment they but heightened her sense of unreality well the luck hasnt turned after all but i couldnt wait any longer have you given a thought to me all these years nancy more than one justin for the very look upon his face the tenderness of his voice the attitude of his body outran his words and told her what he had come home to say told her that her years of waiting were over at last you ought to despise me for coming back again with only myself and my empty hands to offer you how easy it was to speak his heart out in this dim and quiet place how tonguetied he would have been sitting on the black haircloth sofa in the wentworth parlour and gazing at the open soapstone stove oh men are such fools cried nancy smiles and tears struggling together in her speech as she sat down suddenly in her own pew and put her hands over her face they are agreed justin humbly but ive never stopped loving you whenever ive had time for thinking or loving and i wasnt sure that you really cared anything about me and how could i have asked you when i hadnt a dollar in the world there are other things to give a woman besides dollars justin are there well you shall have them all every one of them nancy if you can make up your mind to do without the dollars for dollars seem to be just what i cant manage her hand was in his by this time and they were sitting side by side in the cushionless carpetless wentworth pew the door stood open the winter moon shone in upon them that it was beginning to grow cold in the church passed unnoticed the grasp of the womans hand seemed to give the man new hope and courage and justins warm confiding pleading pressure brought balm to nancy balm and healing for the wounds her pride had suffered joy too halfconscious still that her life need not be lived to the end in unfruitful solitude she had waited as some grey lake lies full and smooth awaiting the star below the twilight justin peabody might have been no other womans star but he was nancys just you sitting beside me here makes me feel as if id been asleep or dead all these years and just born over again said justin ive led a respectable hardworking honest life nancy he continued and i dont owe any man a cent the trouble is that no man owes me one ive got enough money to pay two fares back to detroit on monday although i was terribly afraid you wouldnt let me do it itll need a good deal of thinking and planning nancy for we shall be very poor nancy had been storing up fidelity and affection deep deep in the hive of her heart all these years and now the honey of her helpfulness stood ready to be gathered could i keep hens in detroit she asked i can always make them pay hens in three rooms nancy her face fell and no yard no yard a moments pause and then the smile came oh well ive had yards and hens for thirtyfive years doing without them will be a change i can take in sewing no you cant nancy i need your backbone and wits and pluck and ingenuity but if i cant ask you to sit with your hands folded for the rest of your life as id like to you shant use them for other people youre marrying me to make a man of me but im not marrying you to make you a drudge his voice rang clear and true in the silence and nancys heart vibrated at the sound oh justin justin she whispered theres something wrong somewhere but well find it out together you and i and make it right youre not like a failure you dont even look poor justin there isnt a man in edgewood to compare with you or i should be washing his dishes and darning his stockings this minute and i am not a pauper therell be the rent of my little house and a carload of my furniture so you can put the threeroom idea out of your mind and your firm will offer you a larger salary when you tell them you have a wife to take care of oh i see it all and it is as easy and bright and happy as can be justin put his arm around her and drew her close with such a throb of gratitude for her belief and trust that it moved him almost to tears there was a long pause then he said now i shall call for you tomorrow morning after the last bell has stopped ringing and we will walk up the aisle together and sit in the old peabody pew we shall be a ninedays wonder anyway but this will be equal to an announcement especially if you take my arm we dont either of us like to be stared at but this will show without a word what we think of each other and what weve promised to be to each other and its the only thing that will make me feel sure of you and settled in my mind after all these mistaken years have you got the courage nancy i shouldnt wonder i guess if ive had courage enough to wait for you ive got courage enough to walk up the aisle with you and marry you besides said nancy now it is too late for us to stay here any longer and you must see me only as far as my gate for perhaps you havent forgotten yet how interested the brewsters are in their neighbours they stood at the little wentworth gate for a moment hand close clasped in hand the night was clear the air was cold and sparkling but with nothing of bitterness in it the sky was steely blue and the evening star glowed and burned like a tiny sun nancy remembered the shepherds song she had taught the sundayschool children and repeated softly for i my sheep was watching beneath the silent skies when sudden far to eastward i saw a star arise then all the peaceful heavens with sweetest music rang and glory glory glory the happy angels sang so i this night am joyful though i can scarce tell why it seemeth me that glory hath met us very nigh and we though poor and humble have part in heavenly plan for born tonight the prince of peace shall rule the heart of man justins heart melted within him like wax to the womans vision and the womans touch oh nancy nancy he whispered if i had brought my bad luck to you long long ago would you have taken me then and have i lost years of such happiness as this there are some things it is not best for a man to be certain about said nancy with a wise smile and a last goodnight chapter viii ring out sweet bells oer woods and dells your lovely strains repeat while happy throngs with joyous songs each accent gladly greet christmas morning in the old tory hill meetinghouse was felt by all of the persons who were present in that particular year to be a most exciting and memorable occasion the old sexton quite outdid himself for although he had rung the bell for more than thirty years he had never felt greater pride or joy in his task was not his son john home for christmas and johns wife and a grandchild newly named nathaniel for himself were there not spareribs and turkeys and cranberries and mince pies on the pantry shelves and barrels of rosy baldwins in the cellar and bottles of mothers root beer just waiting to give a holiday pop the bell itself forgot its age and the suspicion of a crack that dulled its voice on a damp day and inspired by the bright frosty air the sextons inspiring pull and the christmas spirit gave out nothing but joyous tones dingdong dingdong it fired the ambitions of star scholars about to recite hymns and sing solos it thrilled little girls expecting dolls before night it excited beyond bearing dozens of little boys being buttoned into refractory overcoats dingdong dingdong mothers fingers trembled when they heard it and mothers voices cried if that is the second bell the children will never be ready in time where are the overshoes where are the mittens hurry jack hurry jennie dingdong dingdong wheres sallys muff wheres fathers fur cap is the sleigh at the door are the hot soapstones in have all of you your money for the contribution box dingdong dingdong it was a blithe bell a sweet true bell a holy bell and to justin pacing his tavern room as to nancy trembling in her maiden chamber it rang a christmas message awake glad heart arise and sing it is the birthday of thy king the congregation filled every seat in the old meetinghouse as maria sharp had prophesied there was one illnatured spinster from a rival village who declared that the church floor looked like josephs coat laid out smooth but in the general chorus of admiration approval and good will this envious speech though repeated from mouth to mouth left no sting another item of interest long recalled was the fact that on that august and unapproachable day the pulpit vases stood erect and empty though nancy wentworth had filled them every sunday since any one could remember this instance though felt at the time to be of mysterious significance if the cause were ever revealed paled into nothingness when after the ringing of the last bell nancy wentworth walked up the aisle on justin peabodys arm and they took their seats side by side in the old family pew and considable close too though there was plenty o room and no one that i ever heard of so much as suspicioned that they had ever kept company and do you spose she knew justin was expected back when she scrubbed his pew afriday and this explains the empty pulpit vases and i always said that nancy would make a real handsome couple if she ever got anybody to couple with during the unexpected and solemn procession of the two up the aisle the soprano of the village choir stopped short in the middle of the doxology and the three other voices carried it to the end without any treble also among those present there were some who could not remember afterward the precise petitions wafted upward in the opening prayer and could it be explained otherwise than by cheerfully acknowledging the bounty of an overruling providence that nancy wentworth should have had a new winter dress for the first time in five years a winter dress of dark brown cloth to match her beaver muff and victorine the existence of this toilette had been known and discussed in edgewood for a month past and it was thought to be nothing more than a proper token of respect from a member of the carpet committee to the general magnificence of the church on the occasion of its reopening after repairs indeed you could have identified every member of the dorcas society that sunday morning by the freshness of her apparel the brown dress then was generally expected but why the white cashmere waist with collar and cuffs of point lace devised only and suitable only for the ministers wedding where it first saw the light the white waist can only be explained as showing distinct hope whispered the ministers wife during the reading of the church notices to me it shows more than hope i am very sure that nancy would never take any wear out of that lace for hope it means certainty answered maria who was always strong in the prophetic line by sermon time justins identity had dawned upon most of the congregation a stranger to all but one or two at first his presence in the peabody pew brought his face and figure back little by little to the minds of the old parishioners when the contribution plate was passed the sexton always began at the rightwing pews as all the sextons before him had done for a hundred years every eye in the church was already turned upon justin and nancy and it was with almost a gasp that those in the vicinity saw a ten dollar bill fall in the plate the sexton reeled or if that is too intemperate a word for a pillar of the church the good man tottered but caught hold of the pew rail with one hand and putting the thumb of his other over the bill proceeded quickly to the next pew lest the stranger should think better of his gift or demand change as had occasionally been done in the olden time nancy never fluttered an eyelash but sat quietly by justins side with her bosom rising and falling under the beaver fur and her cold hands clasped tight in the little brown muff far from grudging this appreciable part of their slender resources she thrilled with pride to see justins offering fall in the plate justin was too absorbed in his own thoughts to notice anything but his munificent contribution had a most unexpected effect upon his reputation after all for on that day and on many another later one when his sudden marriage and departure with nancy wentworth were under discussion the neighbours said to one another justin must be making money fast out west he put ten dollars in the contribution plate asunday and paid the minister ten more next day for marryin him to nancy so the peabody luck has turned at last which as a matter of fact it had and all the time said the chairman of the carpet committee to the treasurer of the dorcas society all the time little as she realized it nancy was laying the carpet in her own pew now shes married to justin shell be the makin of him or i miss my guess you cant do a thing with men folks without theyre right alongside where you can keep your eye and hand on em justins handsome and good and stiddy all he need is some nice woman to put starch into him the edgewood peabodys never had a mite o stiffenin in emlimp as dishrags every blessed one nancy wentworth fairly rustles with starch justin hadnt been engaged to her but a few hours when they walked up the aisle together but did you notice the way he carried his head i declare i thought t would fall off behind i shouldnt wonder a mite but they prospered and come back every summer to set in the old peabody pew
