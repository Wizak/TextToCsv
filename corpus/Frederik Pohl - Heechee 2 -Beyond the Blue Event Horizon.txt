 wan it was not easy to live being young being so completely alone go to the gold wan steal what you want learn dont be afraid the dead men told him but how could he not be afraid the silly but worrisome old ones used the gold passages they might be found anywhere in them most likely at the ends of them where the gold skeins of symbols ran endlessly into the center of things that is exactly where the dead men kept coaxing him to go perhaps he had to go there but he could not help being afraid wan did not know what would happen if the old ones ever caught him the dead men probably knew but he could not make any sense out of their ramblings on the subject once long ago when wan was tinywhen his parents were still alive it was that long agohis father had been caught he had been gone for a long time and then had come back to their greenlit home he was shaking and twoyearold wan had seen that his father was afraid and had screamed and roared because that was so frightening to him nevertheless he had to go to the gold whether the grave old frogjawed ones were there or not because that was where the books were the dead men were well enough but they were tedious and touchy and often obsessed the best sources of knowledge were books and to get them wan had to go where they were the books were in the passages that gleamed gold there were other passages green and red and blue but there were no books there wan disliked the blue corridors because they were cold and dead but that was where the dead men were the green was used up he spent most of his time where the winking red cobwebs of light were spread against the walls and the hoppers still held food he was sure to be untroubled there but he was also alone the gold was still in use and therefore rewarding and therefore also perilous and now he was there cursing fretfully to himselfbut under his breathbecause he was stuck bloody damn dead men why did he listen to their blathering he huddled trembling in the insufficient shelter of a berry bush while two of the foolish old ones stood thoughtfully plucking berries from its opposite side and placing them precisely into their froggy mouths it was unusual really that they should be so idle among the reasons wan despised the old ones was that they were always busy always fixing and carrying and chattering as though driven yet here these two were idle as wan himself both of them had scraggly beards but one also had breasts wan recognized her as a female he had seen a dozen times before she was the one who was most diligent in pasting colored bits of somethingpaper plasticonto her sari or sometimes onto her sallow mottled skin he did not think they would see him but he was greatly relieved when after a time they turned together and moved away they did not speak wan had almost never heard any of the grave old frogjaws speak he did not understand them when they did wan spoke six languages wellhis fathers spanish mothers english the german the russian the cantonese and the finnish of one or another of the dead men but what the frogjaws spoke he did not comprehend at all as soon as they had retreated down the golden corridorquick run grab wan had three books and was gone safely back in a red corridor it might be that the old ones had seen him or perhaps not they did not react quickly that was why he had been able to avoid them so long a few days in the passages and then he was gone by the time they had become aware he was around he wasnt he was back in the ship away he carried the books back to the ship on top of a pannier of food packets the drive accumulators were nearly recharged he could leave whenever he liked but it was better to charge them all the way and he did not think there was any need to hurry he spent most of an hour filling plastic bags with water for the tedious journey what a pity there were no readers in the ship to make it less tedious and then wearying of the labor he decided to say goodbye to the dead men they might or might not respond or even care but he had no one else to talk to wan was fifteen years old tall stringy very dark by nature and darker still from the lights in the ship where he spent so much of his time he was strong and selfreliant he had to be there was always food in the hoppers and other goods for the taking when he dared once or twice a year when they remembered the dead men would catch him with their little mobile machine and take him to a cubicle in the blue passages for a boring day during which he was given a rather complete physical examination sometimes he had a tooth filled usually he received some longacting vitamin and mineral shots and once they had fitted him with glasses but he refused to wear them they also reminded him when he neglected it too long to study and learn both from them and from the storehouses of books he did not need much reminding he enjoyed learning apart from that he was wholly on his own if he wanted clothes he went into the gold and stole them from the old ones if he was bored he invented something to do a few days in the passages a few weeks on the ship a few more days in the other place then back to repeat the process time passed he had no one for company had not had since he was four and his parents disappeared and had almost forgotten what it was like to have a friend he did not mind his life seemed complete enough to him since he had no other life to compare it with sometimes he thought it would be nice to settle in one place or another but this was only dreaming it never reached the stage of intention for more than eleven years he had been shuttling back and forth like this the other place had things that civilization did not it had the dreaming room where he could lie fiat and close his eyes and seem not to feel alone but he could not live there in spite of plenty of food and no dangers because the single water accumulator produced only a trickle civilization had much that the outpost did not have the dead men and the books scary exploring and daring raids for clothes or trinkets something happening but he could not live there either because the frogjaws would surely catch him sooner or later so he commuted the main lobby door to the place of the dead men did not open when wan stepped on the treadle he almost bumped his nose surprised he stopped and then gingerly pushed against the door then harder it took all his strength to force it open wan had never had to open it by hand before though now and then it had hesitated and made disturbing noises that was an annoyance wan had experienced machines that broke down before it was why the green corridors were no longer very useful but that was only food and warmth and there was plenty of that in the red or even the gold it was worrisome that anything should go wrong around the dead men because if they broke down he had no others still all looked normal the room with the consoles was brightly fluoresced the temperature was comfortable and he could hear the faint drone and rare click of the dead men behind their panels as they thought their lonely demented thoughts and did whatever they did when he was not speaking to them he sat in his chair shifting his rump as always to accommodate to the illdesigned seat and pulled the headset down over his ears i am going to the outpost now he said there was no answer he repeated it in all of his languages but no one seemed to want to talk that was a disappointment sometimes two or three of them would be eager for company maybe even more then they could all have a nice long chat and it would be as though he were not really alone at all almost as though he were part of a family a word he knew from the books and from what the dead men told him but hardly remembered as a reality that was good almost as good as when he was in the dreaming place where for a while he could have the illusion of being part of a hundred families a million families hosts of people but that was more than he could handle for very long and so when he had to leave the outpost to return for water and for the more tangible company of the dead men he was never sorry but he always wanted to come back to the cramped couch and the velvety metal blanket that covered him in it and to the dreams it was waiting for him but he decided to give the dead men another chance even when they were not eager for talk sometimes they were interestable if addressed directly he thought for a moment and then dialed number fiftyseven a sad distant voice in his ear was mumbling to itself tried to tell him about the missing mass mass the only mass on his mind was twenty kilos of boobs and ass that floozy doris one look at her and oh boy forget about the mission forget about me frowning wan poised his finger to cancel fiftyseven was such a nuisance he liked to listen to her when she made sense because she sounded a little like the way he remembered his mother but she always seemed to go from astrophysics and space travel and other interesting subjects directly to her own troubles he spat at the point in the panels behind which he had elected to believe fiftyseven liveda trick he had learned from the old oneshoping she would say something interesting but she didnt seem to intend to number fiftysevenwhen she was coherent she liked to be called henriettawas babbling on about high redshifts and arnolds infidelities with doris whoever they were we could have been heroes she sobbed and a tenmilliondollar grant maybe more who knows what theyd pay for the drive but they kept on sneaking off in the lander and who are you im wan the boy said smiling encouragingly even though he did not think she could see him she seemed to be coming into one of her lucid times usually she didnt know he was speaking to her please keep on talking there was a long silence and then ngc she said sagittarius a west wan waited politely another long pause and then she said he didnt care about proper motions he made all his moves with doris half his age and the brain of a turnip she should never have been on the mission in the first place wan wobbled his head like a frogjawed old one you are very boring he said severely and switched her off he hesitated then dialed the professor number fourteen although eliot was still a harvard undergraduate his imagery was that of a fully mature man and a genius at that i should have been a pair of ragged claws the selfdeprecation of mass man carried to its symbolic limit how does he see himself not merely as a crustacean not even as a crustacean only the very abstraction of a crustacean claws and ragged at that in the next line we see wan spat again at the panel as he disconnected the whole face of the wall was stained with the marks of his displeasure he liked when doc recited poetry not so much when he talked about it with the craziest of the dead men like fourteen and fiftyseven you didnt have any choice about what happened they rarely responded and almost never in a way that seemed relevant and you either listened to what they happened to be saying or you turned them off it was almost time for him to go but he tried one more time the only one with a threedigit number his special friend tiny jim hello wan the voice was sad and sweet it tingled in his mind like the sudden frisson of fear that he felt near the old ones it is you wan isnt it that is a foolish question who else would it be one keeps on hoping wan there was a pause then tiny jim suddenly cackled have i told you the one about the priest the rabbi and the dervish who ran out of food on the planet made of pork i think you have tiny jim and anyway i dont want to hear any jokes now the invisible loudspeaker clicked and buzzed for a moment and then the dead man said same old thing wan you want to talk about sex again the boy kept his countenance impassive but that familiar tingle inside his lower abdomen responded we might as well tiny jim youre a raunchy stud for your age wan the dead man offered and then tell you about the time i almost got busted for a sex offense it was hot as hell i was going home on the late train to roselle park and this girl came in sat across the aisle from me put her feet up and began to fan herself with her skirt well what would you do i looked you know and she kept on doing it and i kept looking and finally around highlands she complained to the conductor and he threw me off the train do you know what the funny thing was wan was rapt no tiny jim he breathed the funny thing was id missed my regular train i had time to kill in the city so i went to a porn flick two hours of my god every combination you could think of the only way i couldve seen more was with a proctoscope so why was i slouching out over the aisle to peek at her little white panties but you know what was funnier than that no tiny jim she was right i was staring all right id just been watching acres of crotches and boobs but i couldnt take my eyes off hers that wasnt the funniest thing though do you want me to tell you the funniest thing of all yes please tiny jim i do why she got off the train with me and took me to her home boy and we just made out over and over all night long never did catch her name what do you say to that wan i say is that true tiny jim pause aw no you take all the fun out of things wan said severely i dont want a madeup story tiny jim i want to learn facts wan was angry and thought of turning the dead man off to punish him but was not sure whom he would be punishing i wish you would be nice tiny jim he coaxed well the bodiless mind clicked and whispered to itself for a moment sorting through its conversational gambits then it said do you want to know why mallard drakes rape their mates no i think you really do though wan its interesting you cant understand primate behavior unless you comprehend the whole spectrum of reproductive strategies even strange ones even the acanthocephalan worms they practice rape too and do you know what moniliformis dubius does they not only rape their females they even rape competing males with like plaster of paris so the poor other worm cant get it up i dont want to hear all this tiny jim but its funny wan that must be why they call him dubius the dead man was chuckling mechanically aheh aheh stop it tiny jim but wan was not just angry any more he was hooked it was his favorite subject as tiny jims willingness to talk about it at length and in variety was what made him wans favorite among the dead men wan unwrapped a food packet and munching said what i really want to hear is how to make out tiny jim please if the dead man had had a face it would have shown the strain of trying to keep from laughing but he said kindly kay sonny i know you keep hoping lets see did i tell you to watch their eyes yes tiny jim you said if their pupils dilate it means they are sexually aroused right and i mentioned the existence of the sexually dimorphic structures in the brain i dont think i know what that means exactly well i dont either but its anatomically so theyre different wan inside and out please tiny jim keep telling me about the differences the dead man did and wan listened absorbedly there was always time to go to the ship and tiny jim was unusually coherent all of the dead men had their own special subjects that they zeroed in to talk about as though each had been frozen with one big thought in his mind but even on the favored topics you could not always expect them to make sense wan pushed the mobile unit that they used to catch himwhen it was workingout of the way and sprawled on the floor chin in hands while the dead man chattered and reminisced and explained courtship and gifting and making your move it was fascinating even though he had heard it before he listened until the dead man slowed down hesitated and stopped then the boy said to confirm a theory teach me tiny jim i read a book in which a male and a female copulated he hit her on the head and copulated her while she was unconscious that appears to me an efficient way to love tiny jim but in other stories it takes much longer why is this that was not love sonny that was what i was telling you about rape rape is a bad idea for people even if it works for mallard ducks wan nodded and urged him on why tiny jim pause i will demonstrate it for you mathematically wan the dead man said at last attractive sex objects may be defined as female no more than five years younger than you are no more than fifteen years older these figures are normalized to your present age and are also only approximate attractive sex objects may further be characterized by visual olfactory tactile and aural qualities stimulating to you in descending weighted order of significance plotted against probability of access do you understand me so far not really pause well thats all right for now now pay attention on the basis of those four preliminary traits some females will attract you up to the point of contact you will not know about other traits which may repel harm or detumesce you of subjects will be menstruating will have gonorrhea syphilis will have excessive bodily hair skin blemishes or other physical deformities concealed by clothing finally will conduct themselves offensively during intercourse i i will emit an unpleasant odor will resist rape so extensively as to diminish your enjoyment these are subjective values quantified to match your known psychological profile cumulating these fractions the odds are better than six to one that you will not receive maximum pleasure from rape then i must not copulate a woman without wooing thats right boy not counting its against the law wan was thoughtfully silent for a moment then remembered to ask is all this true tiny jim cackle of glee got you that time kid every word wan pouted like a frogjaw that was not very exciting tiny jim in fact you have detumesced me what do you expect kid tiny jim said sullenly you told me not to make up any stories why are you being so unpleasant i am getting ready to leave i do not have much time you dont have anything else cackled tiny jim and you have nothing to say that i want to hear said wan cruelly he disconnected them all and angrily he went to the ship and squeezed the launch control it did not occur to him that he was being rude to the only friends he had in the universe it had never occurred to him that their feelings mattered on the way to the oort cloud on the twelve hundred and eightysecond day of our allexpensepaid joyride on the way to the oort cloud the big excitement was the mail vera tinkled joyously and we all came to collect it there were six letters for my horny little halfsisterinlaw from famous movie starswell theyre not all movie stars theyre just famous and goodlooking jocks that she writes to because shes only fourteen years old and needs some kind of male to dream about and that write back to her i think because their press agents tell them its going to be good publicity a letter from the old country for payter my fatherinlaw a long one in german they want him to come back to dortmund and run for mayor or blirgermeister or something assuming of course that he is still alive when he gets back which is only an assumption for any of the four of us but they dont give up two private letters to my wife lurvy i assume from exboyfriends and a letter to all of us from poor trish bovers widower or maybe husband depending on whether you considered trish alive or dead have you seen any trace of trishs ship hanson bover short and sweet because thats all he could afford i guess i told vera to send him the same reply as alwayssorry no i had plenty of time to take care of that correspondence because there was nothing for paul c hall who is me there is usually not much for me which is one of the reasons i play chess a lot payter tells me im lucky to be on the mission at all and i suppose i wouldnt be if he hadnt put his own money into it financing his whole family also his skills but weve all done that payter is a food chemist im a structural engineer my wife doremaits better not to call her that and we mostly call her lurvyis a pilot damn good one too lurvy is younger than i am but she was on gateway for six years never scored came back next to broke but she learned a lot not just about piloting sometimes i look at lurvys arms with the five out bangles one for each of her gateway missions and her hands hard and sure on the ship controls warm and warming when we touch i dont know much about what happened to her on gateway perhaps i shouldnt and the other one is her little jailbait halfsister janine ak janine sometimes she was fourteen years old and sometimes forty when she was fourteen she wrote her gushy letters to her movie stars and played with her toysa ragged stuffed armadillo a heechee prayer fan and a firepearl which her father had bought her to tempt her onto the trip when she was forty what she mostly wanted to play with was me and there we are in each others pockets for three and a half years trying not to need to commit murder we were not the only ones in space once in a great while we would get a message from our nearest neighbors the triton base or the exploring ship that had got itself lost but triton with neptune was well ahead of us in its orbitroundtrip message time three weeks and the explorer had no power to waste on us though they were now only fifty lighthours away it was not like a friendly natter over the garden hedge so what i did i played a lot of chess with our shipboard computer theres not an awful lot to do on the way to the oort except play games and besides it was a good way to stay noncombatant in the war between two women that continually raged in our little ship i can stand my fatherinlaw if i have to mostly he keeps to himself as much as he can in four hundred cubic meters i cant always stand his two crazy daughters even though i love them both all this would have been easier to take if we had had more roomi told myself thatbut there is no way to go for a coolingdown walk around the block when you are in a spaceship once in a while a quick eva to check the sidecargos yes and then i could look aroundthe sun still the brightest star in its constellation but only just sirius ahead of us was brighter and so was alpha centauri off below the ecliptic and to the side but that was only an hour at a time and then back inside the ship not a luxury ship a humanmade antique of a spaceship that was never planned for more than a sixmonth mission and that we had to stay cooped up in for three and a half years my god we must have been crazy to sign up what good is a couple million dollars when getting it drives you out of your head our shipboard brain was a lot easier to get along with when i played chess with her hunched over the console with the big headset over my ears i could shut out lurvy and janine the brains name was vera which was just my own conceit and had nothing to do with her i mean its gender or with her truthfulness either because i had instructed her she could joke with me sometimes when vera was downlinked with the big computers that were in orbit or back on earth she was very very smart but she couldnt carry on a conversation that way because of the day roundtrip communications time and so when she wasnt in link she was very very dumb pawn to kings rook four vera thank you long pause while she checked my parameters to make sure who she was talking to and what she was supposed to be doing paul bishop takes knight i could beat the ass off vera when we played chess unless she cheated how did she cheat well after i had won maybe two hundred games from her she won one and then i won about fifty and then she won one and another and for the next twenty games we were about even and then she began to clobber me every time until i figured out what she was doing she was transmitting position and plans to the big computers on earth and then when we recessed games as we sometimes did because payter or one of the women would drag me away from the set she would have time to get downlinkveras criticism of her plans and suggestions to amend her strategies the big machines would tell vera what they thought my strategies might be and how to counteract them and when downlinkvera guessed right shipboardvera had me i never bothered to make her stop i just didnt recess games any more and then after a while we were so far away that there just wasnt time for her to get help and i went back to beating her every game and the chess games were about the only games i won those three and a half years there was no way for me to win anything in the big one that kept going on between my wife lurvy and her horny fourteenyearold halfsister janine old payter was a long time between begats and lurvy tried to be a mother to janine who tried to be an enemy to lurvy and succeeded it wasnt all janines fault lurvy would take a few drinksthat was her way of relieving the boredomand then she would discover that janine had used her toothbrush or that janine had unwillingly done as she had been told and cleaned up the foodpreparation area before it began to stink but hadnt put the organics in the digester then they were off from time to time they would go through ritualized performances of woman talk punctuated by explosions i really love those blue pants on you janine do you want me to tack that seam all right so im getting fat is that what youre saying well its better than drinking myself stupid all the timeand then back to blowdrying each others hair and i would go back to playing chess with vera it was the only safe thing to do every time i tried to intervene i achieved instant success by uniting them against me fucking male chauvinist pig why dont you scrub the kitchen floor the funny thing was i did love them both in different ways of course though i had trouble getting that across to janine we were told what we were getting into when we signed up for the mission besides the regular longvoyage psychiatric briefing all four of us went through a dozen session hours on the problem during the preflight and what the shrink said boiled down to do the best you can it appeared that during the refamilying process i would have to learn to parent payter was too old even if he was the biological father lurvy was undomestic as you would expect from a former gateway pilot it was up to me the shrink was very clear about that it just didnt say how so there i was at fortyone umpty zillion kilometers from earth way past the orbit of pluto about fifteen degrees out of the plane of the ecliptic trying not to make love to my halfsisterinlaw trying to make peace with my wife trying to maintain the truce with my fatherinlaw those were the big things that i woke up with just staying alive for another day to get my mind off them i would try to think about the two million dollars apiece we would get for completing the mission when even that failed i would try to think about the longrange importance of our mission not just to us but to every human being alive that was real enough if it all worked out we would be keeping most of the human race from dying of starvation that was obviously important sometimes it even seemed important but it was the human race that had jammed us all into this smelly concentrationcamp for what looked like forever and there were times whenyou knowi kind of hoped they would starve day i was just waking up when i heard vera beeping and crackling to herself the way she does when theres an action message coming in i unzipped the restraining sheet and pushed myself out of our private but old payter was already hanging over the printer he swore creakily gott sel dammt we have a course changing i caught hold of a rail and pushed myself over to see but janine busily inspecting her cheekbones for pimples in the wall mirror got there ahead of me she ducked her head in front of payters read the message and slid herself away disdainfully payter worked his mouth for a minute and then said savagely this does not interest you janine shrugged minutely without looking at him lurvy was coming out of the private after me zipping up her skivvies leave her alone pa she said paul go put some clothes on it was better to do what she said besides which she was right the best way to stay out of trouble with janine was to behave like a puritan by the time i fished my shorts out of the tangle of sheets lurvy had already read the message reasonably enough she was our pilot she looked up grinning paul we have to make a correction in about eleven hours and maybe its the last one back away she ordered payter who was still hanging over the terminal and pulled herself down to work veras calculator keys she watched while the trajectories formed pressed for a solution and then crowed seventythree hours eight minutes to touchdown i myself could have done that her father complained dont be grouchy pa three days and were there why we ought to be able to see it in the scopes when we turn janine back to picking at her cheekbones commented over her shoulder we could have been seeing it for months if somebody hadnt busted the big scope janine lurvy was marvelous at holding her temper inwhen she was able to do it at alland this time she managed to stay in control she said in her voice of quiet reason wouldnt you say this was an occasion for rejoicing not for starting arguments of course you would janine i suggest we all have a drinkyou too i stepped in quickly belting my shortsi knew the rest of that script are you going to use the chemical rockets lurvy right then janine and i will have to go out and check the sidecargos why dont we have the drink when we come back lurvy smiled sunnily good idea dear but perhaps pa and i will have one short one nowthen well join you for another round later if you like suit up i ordered janine preventing her from saying whatever inflammatory remark was in her mind she obviously had decided to be placatory for the moment because she did as she was told without comment we checked each others seals let lurvy and payter doublecheck us crowded one by one into the exit and swung out into space on our tethers the first thing we both did was look toward homenot very satisfying the sun was only a bright star and i couldnt see the earth at all though janine usually claimed she could the second thing was to look toward the food factory but i couldnt see anything there one star looks a lot like another one especially down to the lower limits of brightness when there are fifty or sixty thousand of them in the sky janine worked quickly and efficiently tapping the bolts of the big ionthrusters strapped to the side of our ship while i inspected for tightness in the steel straps janine was really not a bad kid she was fourteen years old and sexually excitable true but it was not at all her fault that she had no satisfactory person to practice being a woman on except me and even less satisfactorily her father everything checked out as of course we bad been pretty sure it would she was waiting by the stub of the big telescopes mounting by the time i finished and a measure of her good humor was that she didnt even say anything about who let it crack loose and float away in the crazy time i let her go back in the ship first i took an extra couple of minutes to float out there not because i particularly enjoyed the view only because those minutes in space were about the only time i had had in three and a half years to be anything approaching alone we were still moving at better than three kilometers a second but of course you couldnt tell that with nothing around to compare it felt a lot as though we werent moving at all it had felt that way a lot for all of the three and a half years one of the stories we had all been hearing for all that time from old peter he pronounces it payterwas about his father the ss werewolf the werewolf couldnt have been more than sixteen when the big one ended his special job was transporting jet engines to a luftwaffe squadron that had just been fitted out with mes payter says his daddy went to his death apologizing for not getting the engines up to the squadron in time to cream the lanes and the bs and change the outcome of the war we all thought that was pretty funnyanyway the first time we heard it but that wasnt the real funny part the real funny part was how the old nazi freighted them with a team not horses oxen not even pulling a wagonit was a sledge the newest up to the minute state of the art jet turbinesand what it took to get them operational was a towheaded kid with a willow switch ankle deep in cowflop hanging there creeping through space on a trip that a heechee ship could have done in a dayif we had had one and could have made it do what we wanted it toi felt a kind of a sympathy with payters old man it wasnt that different with us all we were missing was the cowflop day the course change went very smoothly after we all struggled into our lifesupport systems and wedged ourselves into our acceleration seats neatly fitted to our air and vitalsigns packs considering the tiny deltav involved it was hardly worth the effort not to mention that there wouldnt be much use in lifesupport systems if anything went wrong enough for us to need them five thousand aus from home but we did it by the book because that was the way we had been doing it for three and a half years andafter we had turned and the chemical rockets had done their thing and stopped and let the ionthrusters take over again and after vera had fumbled and clucked and hesitantly announced that it looked all right as far as she could tell of course pending confirmation some weeks later from earthwe saw it lurvy was the first one out of her seat and at the visuals and she snapped it into focus in a matter of seconds we hung around staring at it the food factory it jiggled annoyingly in the speculum hard to keep in focus even an ion rocket contributes some vibration to a spaceship and we were still a long way off but it was there it gleamed faintly blue in the darkness punctuated by stars strangely shaped it was the size of an office building and more oblong than anything else but one end was rounded and one side seemed to have a long curved slice taken out of it do you think its been hit by something lurvy asked apprehensively ah not in the least snapped her father it is how it was constructed what do we know of heechee design how do you know that lurvy asked but her father didnt answer that didnt have to we all knew that he had no way to know was only speaking out of hope because if it was damaged we were in trouble our bonuses were good just for going out there but our hopes for real payoff the only kind of payoff that would pay for seven roundtrip years of misery rested on the food factory being operable or at least studyable and copyable paul lurvy said suddenly look at the side thats just turning awayarent those ships i squinted trying to make out what she saw there were half a dozen bulges on the long straight side of the artifact three or four smallish ones two quite large they looked like pictures i had seen of the gateway asteroid right enough as far as i could tell but youre the exprospector i said what do you think i think they are but my god did you see those two end ones they were huge ive been in ones and threes and ive seen plenty of fives but nothing like that theyd hold i dont know maybe fifty people if we had ships like that paul if we had ships like that if if snarled her father if we had such ships and if we could make them go where we wanted yes the world would be ours let us hope they still work let us hope any part of it works it will father caroled a sweet voice from behind us and we turned to see janine propped with one knee under the digester hose holding out a squeeze bottle of our best homemade genuine recycled grain neutral spirits id say this really calls for a celebration she smiled lurvy looked at her thoughtfully but her control was in good shape and she only said why thats a nice idea janine pass it around janine took a ladylike small swig and handed it to her father i thought you and lurvy might like a nightcap she said after clearing her throatshe had just graduated to drinking the hard stuff on her fourteenth birthday still did not like it insisted on it only because it was an adult prerogative good idea payter nodded i have been up now for what is it yes nearly twenty hours we will all need our rest when we touch down he added handing the bottle to my wife who squeezed two ounces into her wellpracticed throat and said im not really sleepy yet you know what id like to do id like to play trish bovers tape again oh god lurvy weve all seen it a zillion times i know janine you dont have to watch if you dont want to but i kept wondering if one of those ships was trishs andwell i just want to look at it again janines lips thinned but the genes were strong and her control was as good as her sisters when she wanted it to bethat was one of the things we were measured on before they signed us for the mission ill dial it up she said pushing herself over to veras keyboard payter shook his head and retired to his own private sliding the accordionpleated barrier into place to shut us out and the rest of us gathered around the console because it was tape we could get visual as well as sound and in about ten seconds it crackled on and we could see poor angry trish bover talking into the camera and saying the last words anybody would ever hear from her tragedy can only be tragic just so long and wed heard it all for three and a half years every once in a while wed play the tape and look at the scenes she had picked up with her handheld camera and look at them and look at them freezeframe and blowup not because we thought wed get any more information out of them than gateway corporations people already had although you never knew just because we wanted to reassure ourselves it was all worth it the real tragedy was that trish didnt know what she had found this is mission report ohseventyfour dee nineteen she began steadily enough her sad silly face was even trying to smile i seem to be in trouble i came out at a heechee artifact kind of thing and i docked and now i cant get away the lander rockets work but the main board wont and i dont want to stay here till i starve starve after the boffins went over trishs photos they identified what the artifact wasthe chonfood factory they had been looking for but whether it was worth it was still an open question and trish surely didnt think it was worth it what she thought was that she was going to die there and for nothing not even going to cash in her awards for the mission and then at the end what she finally did she tried to make it back in the lander she got into the lander and pointed it for the sun and turned on the motors and took a pill took a lot of pills all she had and then she turned the freezer up to max and got in and closed the door behind her defrost me when you find me she said and remember my award and maybe somebody would when they found her if they found her which would likely be in about ten thousand years by the time her faint radio message was heard by anybody on maybe its five hundredth automatic repetition it was too late to matter to trish she never answered vera finished playing the tape and quietly restowed it as the screen went dark if trish had been a real pilot instead of one of those gateway gogo prospectors jump in and push the button and let the ship do its thing said lurvy not for the first time she would have known better she would have used what little deltav she had in the lander to kill some angular momentum instead of wasting it by pointing straight in thank you expert rocket pilot i said not for the first time either so she couldve counted on being inside the asteroids a whole lot sooner right maybe in as little as six or seven thousand years lurvy shrugged im going to bed she said taking a last squeeze from the bottle you paul aw give me a break will you janine cut in i wanted paul to help me go over ignition procedures for the ionthrusters lurvys guard went up at once you sure thats what you want him to go over dont pout janine you know youve gone over it plenty already and anyway its pauls job and what if pauls out of action janine demanded how do we know we wont hit the crazy time just as were doing it well nobody could know that and as a matter of fact i had been forming the opinion that we would it came in cycles of about a hundred and thirty days give or take a dozen we were pushing it close i said actually im a little tired janine i promise well do it tomorrow or whenever one of the others was awake at the same timethe important thing was not to be alone with janine in a ship with the total cubage of a motel room youd be surprised how hard that is to arrange not hard practically impossible but i really wasnt tired and when lurvy was tucked alongside me and out of it her breathing too quiet to be called anything like a snore but diagnostic of sleep all the same i stretched against the sheets wide awake counting up our blessings i needed to do that at least once a day when i could find any to count this time i found a good one four thousand au plus is a long tripand thats as the crow flies or actually as the photon fires because of course there arent a lot of crows in nearinterstellar space call it half a trillion kilometers near enough and we were spiraling out which meant most of a revolution around the sun before we got there our track wasnt just lightdays it was more like and even poweron the whole way we werent coming up to anything like the speed of light three and a half years and all the way we were thinking jeez suppose someone figures out the heechee drive before we get there it wouldnt have helped us a bit it wouldve been a lot more than three and a half years before they got around to doing all the things they wanted to do when that happened and guess where on that list the job of coming after us would have been so the good thing i found to dwell on was that at least we werent going to find the trip was for nothing because we were almost there all that remained was to strap the big ionthrusters onto it see if it worked start the slow return trip shoving the thing back down toward the earth and somehow survive till we got there call it oh another four years i went back to cherishing the fact that we were almost there the idea of mining comets for food wasnt new it went back to krafft ehricke in the s anyway only what he suggested was that people colonize them it made sense bring along a little iron and trace elementsthe iron to build a place to live in the trace elements to turn chonchow into quiche lorraine or hamburgersand you can live indefinitely on the food around you because thats what comets are made of a little bit of dust a few rocks and a hell of a lot of frozen gases and what are the gases oxygen nitrogen hydrogen carbon dioxide water methane ammonia the same four elements over and over again chon carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and what does chon spell wrong what comets are made of is the same thing you are made of and what chon spells is food the oort cloud was made up of millions of megatonsized servings of chow back on earth there were ten or twelve billion hungry people looking toward it and licking their lips there was still a lot of argument about what comets were doing there out in the cloud it was still arguable about whether they even came in families opik a hundred years ago said more than half the comets ever sighted fit into welldefined groups so there and so did his followers ever since whipple said bullshit theres not a group you can identify that has more than three comets in it and so did his followers then oort came along to try to make sense of it his idea was that there was this great shell of comets all the hell around the solar system and every once in a while the sun would reach out and pluck one out and it would come loping in to perihelion then we would have halleys comet or the one that was supposed to have been the star of bethlehem or whatever then a bunch of the guys began kicking that around asking why exactly that should happen it turned out it couldntnot if you assume maxwellian distribution for the oort cloud in fact if you assume normal distribution you also have to assume that there isnt any oort cloud in the first place you cant get the observed nearly parabolic orbits out of an oort cloud so said r a lyttleton but then somebody else said well who says the distribution cant be nonmaxwellian and so it proved its all lumpy there are clusters of comets and great volumes of space with almost none and while no doubt the heechee had set their machine to graze in rich comet pastures that had been a lot of hundreds of thousands of years ago and it was now in a kind of cometary desert if it worked it had little left to work on i fell asleep wondering what chonfood would taste like it couldnt be a lot worse than what we had been eating for three and a half years which was mainly recycled us day janine almost got to me today i was playing chess with vera everybody asleep happy enough when her hands came around the big earpieces and covered my eyes cut it out janine i said when i turned around she was pouting i just wanted to use vera she said for what another hot love letter to one of your movie stars you treat me like a child she said for a wonder she was fully dressed her face shone her hair was damp and pulled down straight to the back of her neck she looked like your model seriousminded young teenager what i wanted she said was to go over thruster alignments with vera since you wont help me one of the reasons janine was along with us was that she was smartwe all were had to be to be accepted for the mission and one of the things she was smart at was getting at me all right i said youre right what can i say vera recess the game and give us the program for providing propulsion for the food factory certainly she said paul and the board disappeared and in its place she built up a holo of the food factory she had updated her specs from the telescopic views we had obtained and so it was shown complete with its dust cloud and the glob of dirty snowball adhering to one side cancel the cloud vera i ordered and the blur disappeared and the food factory showed up like an engineering drawing okay janine whats the first step we dock she said at once we hope the lander facsimile fits and we dock it if we cant dock we link up with braces to some point on the surface either way our ship becomes a rigid part of the structure so we can use our thrust for attitude control next we all dismount the numberone thruster and brace it to the aft section of the factorythere she pointed out the place on the holo we slave it to the board here and as soon as it is installed we activate guidance vera will give us coordinatesoops sorry paul she had been drifting out of orientation with me and vera and she caught my shoulder with her hand to pull herself back she kept her hand there then we repeat the process with the other five by the time we have all six going we have a deltav of two meters per second per second running off the pu generator then we start spreading the mirror foils no oh sure we inspect all the moorings to see that theyre holding under thrust first well i take that for granted then we start with solar power and when weve got it all spread we should be up to maybe two and a quarter meters at first janine the closer we get in the more power we get all right now lets go through the hardware youre bracing our ship to the heecheemetal hull how do you go about it and she told me and kept on telling me and by gosh she knew it all the only thing was her hand on my shoulder became a hand under my arm and it moved across my chest and began to roam and all the time she was giving me the specs for coldwelding and how to get collimation for the thrusters her face serious and concerned and her hand stroking my belly fourteen years old but she didnt look fourteen or feel fourteen or smell fourteenshed been into lurvys quarter of an ounce of remaining chanel what saved me was vera good thing everything considered because i was losing interest in saving myself the holo froze while janine was adding an extra strut to one of the thrusters and vera said action message coming in shall i read it out for you paul go ahead janine withdrew her hand slightly as the holo winked away and the screen produced the message weve been requested to ask you for a favor the next outbreak of the day syndrome is estimated to occur within the next two months hew thinks that a fullcoverage visual of all of you describing the food factory and emphasizing how well things are going and how important it is will significantly reduce tensions and consequent damage please follow the accompanying script request compliance soonest possible so that we may tape and schedule broadcast for maximum effect shall i give you the script vera asked go aheadhard copy i added very well paul the screen turned pale and empty and she began to squirt out typed sheets of paper i picked them up to read while i sent janine off to wake up her sister and father she didnt object she loved doing television for the folks back home it always meant fan letters from famous people for the brave young astronette the script was what you would expect i programmed vera to roll it for us line by line and we could have read it in ten minutes that was not to be janine insisted her sister had to do her hair and even lurvy decided she had to make up and payter wanted his beard trimmed by me so all in all counting four rehearsals we blew six hours not counting a months power on the tv broadcast we all gathered before the camera looking domestic and dedicated and explained what we were going to be doing to an audience that wouldnt be seeing it for a month by which time we would already be there but if it would do them any good it was worth it we had been through eight or nine attacks of the day fever since we took off from earth each time it had its own syndrome satyriasis or depression lethargy or lighthearted joy i had been outside when one of them hitthat was how the big telescope got brokenand it had been about an even bet whether i would ever make it back inside the ship i simply didnt care i was hallucinating loneliness and anger being chased by apelike creatures and wishing i were dead and back on earth with billions of people nearly all of them affected to one degree or another in one or another way each time it hit it was pure bell it had been building up for ten yearseight since it was first identified as a recurring scourge and no one knew what caused it but everybody wanted it stopped day iz docking day payter was at the controls wouldnt trust vera on a thing like that while lurvy was strapped in over his head to call off course corrections we came to relative rest just outside the thin cloud of particles and gas no more than a kilometer from the food factory itself from where janine and i were sitting in our lifesupport gear it was hard to see what was going on outside past payters head and lurvys gesticulating arms we could catch glimpses of the enormous old machine but only glimpses no more than a glimmer of bluelit metal and now and then a docking pit or the shape of one of the old ships hellfire im drifting away no you arent payter the goddam things got a little acceleration and maybe a star we didnt really need the lifesupport payter was nudging us gently as he would a jellyfish in a tank i wanted to ask where the acceleration came from or why but the two pilots were busy and besides i did not suppose they knew the answer thats got it now bring her in to that center docking pit middle of that row of three why that one why not because i say so and we edged in for a minute or two and came to relative rest again and we matched and locked the heechee capsule at the forward end mated neatly with the ancient pit lurvy reached down and killed the board and we all looked at each other we were there or to put it another way we were halfway halfway home day it was no surprise that the heechee had breathed an atmosphere we could survive in the surprise was that any of it was left in this place after all the tens or hundreds of thousands of years since anyone breathed any of it and that was not the only surprise the others came later and were scarier and worse it was not just the atmosphere that had survived the whole ship had survivedin working condition we knew it as soon as we were inside and the samplers had shown us we could take off our helmets the bluegleaming metal walls were warm to the touch and we could feel a faint steady vibration the temperature was around twelvecool but no worse than some earthside homes ive been in do you want to guess what the first words were spoken by human beings inside the food factory they came from payter and they were ten million dollars jesus maybe even a hundred and if he hadnt said it one or another of us would our bonus was going to be astronomical trishs report hadnt said whether the food factory was operational or notfor all we knew it could have been a riddled hulk empty of anything that made it worthwhile but here we had a complete and major heechee artifact in working condition there was simply nothing like it to judge against the tunnels on venus the old ships even gateway itself had been carefully emptied of nearly all their contents half a million years before this place was furnished warm livable thrumming soaked with weak microwave radiation it was alive it did not seem old at all we had little chance to explore the sooner we got the thing moving in toward earth the sooner we would cash in on its promise we allowed ourselves an hour to roam around in the breathable air poking into chambers filled with great gray and blue metal shapes slithering down corridors eating as we wandered telling each other over the pocket communicators what we found then work we suited up again and began the job of derigging the sidecargos and that was where we ran into the first trouble the food factory was not in free orbit it was accelerating some sort of thrust was driving it it was not great less than one percent of a g but the electric rocket assemblies weighed more than ten tons each even at one percent of perceived weight that meant over a hundred kilograms of weight not counting ten tons worth of inertia as we began to unship the first one it pulled itself free at one end and began to fall away payter was there to catch it but it was more than he could hold for long i pulled myself over and grabbed the sidecargo with one hand the brace it had been fastened to with the other and we managed to keep it in place until janine could secure a cable over it then we retired inside the ship to think things over we were already exhausted after threeplus years in confined quarters we were not used to hard work veras bioassay unit reported we were accumulating fatigue poisons we bickered and worried at each other for a while then payter and lurvy went to sleep while janine and i schemed out a rigging that would let us secure each sidecargo before it was released and swing it around the food factory on three long cables belayed by smaller guiding cables so that it would not smash into the hull at the far end of its travel and pound itself into scrap we had allowed ten hours to move a rocket into position it took three days for the first one by the time we had it secured we were stark staring wrecks our heartbeats pounding our muscles one solid ache we took a full sleep shift and a few hours of loafing around the interior of the food factory before we went back to securing the rocket so that it could be started payter was the most energetic of us he went prowling as far as he could go down half a dozen corridors all come to dead ends he reported when he came back looks like the part we can reach is only about a tenth of the objectless we cut holes through the walls not now i said not ever said lurvy strongly all we do is get this thing back anybody wants to start cutting it up it will be after weve collected our money she rubbed her biceps arms folded across her chest and added regretfully and we might as well get started on securing the rocket it took us another two days to do that but finally we had it in place the welding fluxes they had given us to secure steel to heechee metal actually worked as far as we could tell from static inspection it was solid we retired into the ship and commanded vera to give it a ten percent thrust at once we felt a tiny lurch it was working we all grinned at each other and i reached into my private holdall for the bottle of champagne i had been saving for this occasion another lurch click click click clickone after another our grins snapped off there should have been only one felt acceleration lurvy jumped to the cyber board vera report deltav the screen lighted up with a diagram of forces the food factory imaged in the middle force arrows showing in two directions one was our thruster doing its job of pushing against the hull the other was not additional thrust now affecting course lurvy vera reported vector result now same in direction and magnitude as previous deltav our rocket was pushing against the food factory but it wasnt doing much good the factory was pushing back day so we did what we obviously had to do we turned everything off and screamed for help we slept and ate and wandered around the factory for what seemed like forever wishing the day delay did not exist vera wasnt much help transmit full telemetry she said and stand by for further directives well we were doing that already after a day or two i pulled the champagne out anyway and we all drank up atg the carbonation had more muscle than gravity did and actually i had to hold my thumb over the bottle and my palm over each glass to squirt and catch the spraying champagne but after a fashion we toasted not so bad said payter when he had chugalugged his wine at least weve got a couple million each if we ever live to collect it snarled janine dont be such a downer janine we knew when we started out that the mission might bum out and so we had the ship was designed so that we could start back on our basic fuel then rerig the photonthrusters to get us homein another four years or so and then what lurvy ill be an eighteenyearold virgin and a failure oh god janine go explore for a while wont you im tired of the sight of you and so were all of us of each other we were more tired of each other and less tolerant than we had been all the way out in the cramped quarters of the ship now that we had more space to lose each other in as much as a quarterkilometer of it at farthest stretch we were more abrasive on each other than ever every twenty hours or so veras small dull brain would stumble through her contingency programs and come up with some new experiment test thrusts at one percent of power at thirty percent of power even at full power and we would get together long enough to suit up and carry them out but they were always the same no matter how hard we pushed against the food factory the artifact sensed it and pushed back at exactly the right magnitude and in exactly the right direction to keep its steady acceleration to whatever goal it had in mind the only useful thing vera came up with was a theory the factory had used up the comet it was working on and was moving on to a new one but that was only intellectually interesting it did not do a practical thing to help so we wandered around mostly alone carrying the cameras into every room and corridor we could reach what we saw they saw and what they saw was transmitted on the timesharing beam to earth and none of it offered much help we found where trish bover had entered the factory easily enoughpayter did that and called us all to look and we gathered silently to inspect the remnants of a longdecayed lunch the discarded pantyhose and the graffiti she had scratched on the walls trish bover was here and god help me maybe god will said lurvy after a while but dont see how anybody else can she must have been here longer than i thought payter said theres junk scattered all around in some of the rooms what kind of junk old spoiled food mostly down toward the other landing face you know where the lights are i did and janine and i went to see it was her idea to keep me company and not an idea i had been enthusiastic about at first but maybe the c temperature and the lack of anything like a bed tempered her interest or maybe she was too depressed and disappointed to be very interested in her ambition to lose her virginity we found the discarded food easily enough it didnt look like gateway rations to me it seemed to come in packets a couple of them were unopened three biggish ones the size of a slice of bread wrapped in bright red something or otherit felt like silk two smaller ones one green one the same red as the others but mottled with pink dots we opened one experimentally it stank of rotten fish and was obviously no longer edible but had been i left janine there to go back to find the others they opened the little green one it did not smell spoiled but was hard as rock payter sniffed it then licked it then broke off a crumb against the wall and chewed it thoughtfully no taste at all he reported then looked up at us looked startled then grinned you waiting for me to drop dead he inquired i dont think so you chew on it awhile it gets soft like stale crackers maybe lurvy frowned if it really was food she stopped and thought if it really was food and trish left it there why didnt she just stay here or why didnt she mention it she was scared silly i suggested sure she was but she did tape a report she didnt say a word about food the gateway techs were the ones who decided this was a food factory remember and all they had to go on was the wrecked one they found around phylliss world maybe she just forgot i dont think she forgot said lurvy slowly but she didnt say any more than that there wasnt anything more to be said but for the next day or two we did not do much solitary exploring day vera received the information about the food packages in silence after a while she displayed an instruction to submit the contents of the packages to chemical and bioassay we had already done that on our own and if she drew conclusions she did not say what they were for that matter neither did we on the occasions when we were all awake together what we mostly talked about was what we would do if base could not figure out a way for us to move the food factory vera had already suggested that we install the other five sidecargos turn them all on fullpower at once and see if the factory could outmuscle six thrusters veras suggestions were not orders and lurvy spoke for all of us when she said if we turn them on full and they dont work the next step is to turn them on to over rated capacity they could get damaged and we could get stuck what do we do if we hear from earth and they make it an order i asked payter cut in ahead of her we bargain he said nodding sagely they want us to take extra risks they give us extra pay are you going to do the bargaining pa you bet i am and listen suppose it dont work suppose we have to go back you know what we do then he nodded to us again we load up the ship with everything we can carry we find little machines that we can take out you know maybe we see if they work we stuff that ship with everything it can hold throw away everything we can spare leave most of the side cargos here and load on big machines outside you see we could come back with god i dont know another twenty thirty million dollars worth of artifacts like prayer fans janine cried clapping her hands there were piles of them in the room where payter had found the food there were other things there too a sort of metalmesh couch tulipshaped things that looked like candleholders on the walls but hundreds of prayer fans by my quick guess at a thousand dollars each there was half a million dollars worth of prayer fans in that room alone delivered to the curio markets in chicago and rome if we lived to deliver them not counting all the other things i could think of that i was inventorying in my mind i wasnt the only one prayer fans are the least of it lurvy said thoughtfully but thats not in our contract pa contract so what are they going to do with us shoot us cheat us after we give up eight years of our lives no theyll give us the bonuses the more we thought about it the better that sounded i went to sleep thinking about which of the gadgets and whatyoucallems id seen could be carried back and what among them seemed the most valuable and had my first pleasant dreams since we had tested the thruster and woke up with janines urgent whisper in my ear pop paul lurvy can you hear me i swam up to a sitting position and looked around she wasnt speaking in my ear it was my radio lurvy was awake beside me and payter came hurrying around a corner to join us their radios going too i said we hear you janine what shut up the whisper came hissing out with white sound as though her lips were pressed against the microphone dont answer me just listen theres someone here we stared at each other lurvy whispered where are you i said shut up im out at the far docking area you know where we found that food i was looking for something we could bring back with us like pop said only well i saw something on the floor like an apple only it wasntkind of reddish brown on the outside and green on the inside and it smelled like i dont know what it smelled like strawberries and it wasnt any hundred thousand years old either it was fresh and i heardwait a minute we did not dare answer just listened to her breathing for a moment when she spoke again her whisper sounded scared its coming this way its between me and you and im stuck ikeep thinking its a heechee and its going to be her voice stopped we heard her gasp then out loud dont you come any closer i had heard enough lets go i said jumping toward the corridor payter and lurvy were right behind me as we hurried in long swimming leaps down the bluewalled tunnel when we got near the docks we stopped looking around irresolutely before we could make a decision on which way to search janines voice came again it was neither whisper nor terrified cry hehe stopped when i told him she said unbelievingly and i dont think hes a heechee he looks like just an ordinary person to mewell kind of scruffy hes just standing there staring at me kind of sniffing the air janine i shouted into the radio were at the dockswhich way from here pause then strangely a kind of shocked giggle just keep coming straight she said shakily come on quick youyou wouldnt believe what hes doing now wan in love the trip to the outpost seemed longer than usual to wan because he was troubled in his mind he missed the companionship of the dead men he missed even more what he had never had a female the notion of wan in love was a fantasy for him but it was a fantasy he wanted to make real so many of the books helped it along romeo and juliet and anna karenina and the old romantic chinese classics what drove the fantasies out of his mind at last was the sight of the outpost as he drew near the board lighted up to signal the beginning of docking maneuvers the flow lines on the screen melted away and the shape of the outpost snapped into vision but it was not the same shape as always there was a new ship in one of the docking hatches and a strange jagged structure strapped to one side of the hull what could such things mean when the docking was complete wan poked his head through the hatch and stared around sniffing and listening after a time he concluded that no one was near he did not remove his books or other possessions from the ship he resolved to stay ready to flee at a moments notice but he decided to explore once before long ago some other person had been at the outpost and he believed it had been a female tiny jim had helped him identify the garment then perhaps he should ask tiny jim for advice now munching on a berryfruit he handed himself easily along the rails toward the dreaming room where the pleasure couch lay surrounded by the book machines and stopped had that been a sound a laugh or a cry from far away he threw the berryfruit away and stood for a moment all his senses tensely extended the sound was not repeated but there was somethinga smell very faint quite pleasant quite strange it was not unlike the smell in the garment he had found and carried around for many days until the last vestige of scent was gone from it and he put it back where it was found had that person come back wan began to shake a person it had been a dozen years since be had smelled or touched a person and then only his parents but it might not be a person it could be something else he launched himself toward the dock where that other person had been craftily avoiding the main passages hurling himself down narrower less direct ways where he did not think any stranger was likely to go wan knew every inch of the outpost at least as far within it as it was possible to travel without coming to the deadend locked walls that he did not know how to open it took him only a few minutes to reach the place where he had carefully rearranged the debris left by the outposts one visitor everything was there but not he saw as he had left it some things bad been picked up and dropped again wan knew he had not done that apart from the discipline he had always imposed upon himself of leaving the outpost exactly as he had found it so that no one could ever know he was there this time he had been especially careful to arrange the litter precisely as it had been left someone else was on the outpost and he was many minutes away from his ship cautiously but quickly he returned to the docks on the other side pausing at every intersection to look and smell and listen he reached his ship and hovered at the hatch indecisively run or explore but the smell was stronger now and irresistible step by step he ventured down one of the long deadend corridors ready to retreat instantly a voice whispering almost inaudible but it was there he peered around a doorway and his heart pounded a person huddled against a wall with a metal object at its lips staring at him in terror the person cried out at him dont you come any closer but he could not have if he had wanted to he was frozen it was not merely a person it was a female person the diagnostic signs were clear as tiny jim had explained them to him two swellings at the chest a swelling around the hips and a narrowing at the waist a smooth brow with no bulges over the eye socketsyes female and young and dressed in something that revealed bare legs and oh bare arms smooth hair tied behind the head in a long tail great eyes staring at him wan responded as he had learned to respond he fell gently to his knees opened his garment and touched his sex it had been several days since he had masturbated and with no such stimulus as this he was erect at once and shuddering with excitement he hardly noticed the noises behind him as three other persons came racing up it was not until he was finished that he stood up adjusted his clothing and smiled politely to them where they were ranged around the young female talking excitedly and almost hysterically among themselves hello he said i am wan when they did not respond he repeated the greeting in spanish and cantonese and would have gone on to his other languages except that the second female person stepped forward and said hello wan im dorema herterhall they call me lurvy were very glad to see you in all of wans fifteen years there had never been twelve hours as exciting as frightening and as heartstoppingly thrilling as these so many questions so much to say and to hear so shudderypleasant to touch these other persons and to smell their smells and feel their presence they knew so incredibly little and so astonishingly muchdid not know how to get food from the lockers had not used the dreaming couch had never seen an old one or talked with a dead man and yet they knew of spaceships and cities of walking under an open sky and of making love he could see that the younger female was willing to show him more of that but the older one did not wish her to how strange the older male did not seem to make love with anyone even stranger but it was all strange and he was expiring of the delights and terrors of so much strangeness after they had talked for a long time and he had shown them some of the tricks of the outpost and they had shown him some of the wonders of their ship after all these wonders the lurvy person had commanded that they all rest he had at once started toward the dreaming couch but she had invited him to stay near them and he could not say no though all through the sleep he woke from time to time trembling and sniffing and staring around in the dim blue light so much excitement was bad for him when they were all awake again he found himself still shaking his body aching as though he had not slept at all no matter the questions and the chatter began again at once and who are the dead men i dont know let us ask them perhapssometimes they call themselves prospectors from a place called gateway and this place they are in is it a heechee artifact heechee he thought he had heard the word long ago but he did not know what it meant do you mean the old ones what do the old ones look like and he could not say in words so they gave him a sketch pad again and he tried to draw the big waggling jaws the frowsty beards and as each sketch was finished they snatched it up and held it before the machine they called vera this machine is like a dead man he offered and they flew in with questions again do you mean the dead men are computers what is a computer and then the questions would go the other way for a while as they explained to him the meaning of computer and presidential elections and the day fever and all the while they were roaming the ship as he explained to them what he knew of it wan was becoming very tired he had had little experience of fatigue because in his timeless life when he was sleepy he slept and did not get up until he was rested he did not enjoy the feeling or the scratchiness in his throat or the headache but he was too excited to stop especially when they told him about the female person named trish bover she was here here in the outpost and she did not stay no wan she didnt know you would come she thought if she stayed she would die what a terrible pity although wan calculated he had only been ten years old when she came he could have been a companion for her and she for him he would have fed her and cared for her and taken her with him to see the old ones and the dead men and been very happy then where did she go he asked for some reason that question troubled them they looked at each other lurvy said after a moment she got in her ship wan she went back to earth no not yet it is a very long trip for the kind of ship she had longer than she would live the younger man paul the one who coupled with lurvy took over she is still traveling wan we dont know where exactly we are not even sure she is alive she froze herself then she is dead wellshe is probably not alive but if she is found maybe she can be revived shes in the freezing compartment of her ship at minusforty degrees her body will not decay for some time i think she thought at any rate she thought it was the best chance she had i could have given her a better one wan said dejectedly then he brightened there was the other female janine who was not frozen wishing to impress her he said that is a gosh number what is what kind of a number a gosh number janine tiny jim talks about them when you say minusforty you dont have to say whether it is in celsius or fahrenheit because they are the same he tittered at the joke they were looking at each other again wan could see that something was wrong but he was feeling stranger dizzier more fatigued at every second he thought perhaps they had not understood the joke so he said let us ask tiny jim he can be reached just down this passage where the dreaming couch is reached how demanded the old man payter wan did not answer he was not feeling well enough to trust what he said and besides it was easier to show them he turned abruptly away and hauled himself toward the dreaming chamber by the time they followed he had already keyed the book in and called for number one hundred twelve tiny jim he tried then over his shoulder sometimes he doesnt want to talk please be patient but he was lucky this time and the dead mans voice responded quite quickly wan is that you of course it is me tiny jim i want to hear about gosh numbers very well wan gosh numbers are numbers which represent more than one quantity so that when you perceive the coincidence you say gosh some gosh numbers are trivial some are perhaps of transcendental importance some religious persons count gosh numbers as a proof of the existence of god as to whether or not god exists i can give you only a broad outline of no tiny jim please stick to gosh numbers now yes wan i will now give you a list of a few of the simplest gosh numbers pointfive degrees minusforty degrees one thirtyseven two thousand and twentyfive ten to the th please write one paragraph on each of these identifying the characteristics which make them gosh numbers and cancel cancel wan squeaked his voice rising higher because it smarted so this is not a class oh well said the dead man gloomily all right pointfive degrees is the angular diameter of both the sun and the moon as seen from earth gosh how strange that they should be the same but also how useful because it is partly because of this coincidence that earth has eclipses minusforty degrees is the temperature which is the same in both fahrenheit and celsius scales gosh two thousand twentyfive is the sum of the cubes of the integers one cubed plus two cubed plus three cubed and so on up to nine cubed all added together it is also the square of their sum gosh ten to the thirtyninth is a measure of the weakness of the gravitational force as compared with the electromagnetic it is also the age of the universe expressed as a dimensionless number it is also the square root of the number of particles in the observable universe that is that part of the universe relative to earth in which hubbles constant is less than pointfive alsowell never mind but gosh gosh gosh gosh on these goshes pam dirac constructed his large numbers hypothesis from which he deduced that the force of gravity must be weakening as the age of the universe increased now there is a gosh for you you left out one thirtyseven the boy accused the dead man cackled good for you wan i wanted to see if you were listening one thirtyseven is eddingtons fine structure constant of course and turns up over and over in nuclear physics but it is more than that suppose you take the inverse that is one over one thirtyseven and express it as a decimal the first three digits are double ought seven james bonds identification as a killer there is the lethality of the universe for you the first eight digits are clarkes palindrome point oh seven two nine nine two seven oh there is its symmetry deadly and twofaced that is the fine structure constant or he mused perhaps i should say there is its inverse which would imply that the universe itself is the inverse of that namely kind and uneven help me wan i am not sure how to interpret this symbol oh cancel cancel said wan angrily cancel and out he was feeling irritable and shaky as well as more ill than he had ever been even when the dead men had given him shots he goes on like that he apologized to the others thats why i dont usually speak to him from here he doesnt look well said lurvy worriedly to her husband and then to wan do you feel all right he shook his head because he did not know how to answer paul said you ought to rest butwhat did you mean from here where is uh tiny jim oh he is in the main station said wan weakly sneezing you mean paul swallowed hard but you said it was fortyfive days away by ship that must be a very long way the old man payter cried radio are you talking to him by radio fasterthanlight radio wan shrugged paul had been right he needed to rest and there was the couch which had always been the exact proper place to make him feel good and rested tell me boy shouted the old man if you have a working fu radio the bonus i am very tired said wan hoarsely i must sleep he felt himself falling he evaded their clutching arms dove between them and plunged into the couch its comforting webbing closing around him robin broadhead inc essie and i were waterskiing on the tappan sea when my neck radio buzzed to tell me that a stranger had turned up on the food factory i ordered the boat to turn immediately and take us back to the long stretch of waterfront property owned by robin broadhead inc before i told essie what it was a boy robin she shouted over the noise of the hydrogen motor and the wind where in hell a boy comes to food factory thats what we have to find out i yelled back the boat skillfully snaked us in to shallow water and waited while we jumped out and ran up the grass when it recognized that we were gone it purred down the shoreline to put itself away wet as we were we ran directly to the brain room we had begun to get opticals already and the holo tank showed a skinny scraggly youth wearing a sort of divided kilt and a dirty tunic he did not seem threatening in any way but he sure as hell had no right to be there voice i ordered and the moving lips began to speakqueer shrill highpitched but good enough english to understand from the main station yes it is about seven sevendays weeks i mean i come here often for gods sake how i could not see the speaker but it was male and had no accent paul hall in a ship to be sure do you not have a ship the dead men speak only of traveling in ships i do not know any other way incredible said essie over my shoulder she backed away not taking her eyes off the tank and came back with a terrycloth robe to throw over my shoulders and one for herself what do you suppose is main station i wish to god i knew harriet the voices from the tank grew fainter and my secretarys voice said yes mr broadhead when did he get there about seventeen point four minutes ago mr broadhead plus transit time from the food factory of course he was discovered by janine herter she did not appear to have had a camera with her so we received only voice until one of the other members of the party arrived as soon as she stopped speaking the voice from the figure in the tank came up again harriet is a very good program one of essies best sorry if i behaved improperly the boy was saying pause then old peter herter never mind that by god are there other people on this main station the boy pursed his lips that he said philosophically would depend would it not on how one defines person in the sense of a living organism of our species no the closest is the dead men a womans voicedorema herterhall are you hungry do you need anything no why should i harriet whats that about behaving improperly i asked harriets voice came hesitantly he uh he brought himself to orgasm mr broadhead right in front of janine herter i couldnt help it i broke out laughing essie i said to my wife i think you made her a little too ladylike but that wasnt what i was laughing at it was the plain incongruity of the thing i had guessedanything anything but this a heechee a space pirate martiansgod knows what but not a horny teenaged boy there was a scrabble of steel claws from behind and something jumped on my shoulder down squiffy i snapped essie said just let him nuzzle neck for a minute hell go away he isnt dainty in his personal habits i snarled cant we get rid of him na na galubka she said soothingly patting the top of my head as she got up want full medical dont you squiffy comes along she kissed me and wandered out of the room leaving me to think about the thing that to my somewhat surprise was making all sorts of tiny but discomforting stirrings inside me to see a heechee well we hadntbut what if we did when the first venus explorers discovered the traces the heechee had left glowing bluelined empty tunnels spindleshaped caves it was a shock a few artifacts another shockwhat were they there were the scrolls of metal somebody named prayer fans there were the glowing little beads called fire pearls but they werent pearls and they werent burning then someone found the gateway asteroid and the biggest shock of all because on it were a couple of hundred working spaceships only you couldnt direct them you could get in and go and that was it and what you found when you got there was shock shock shock shock i knew i had had the shocks on my three silly missionsno two silly missions and then one terribly unsilly one it had made me rich and deprived me of somebody i loved and what is silly about either of those things and ever since then the heechee dead half a million years not even a written word left to tell what they were up to had permeated every part of our world it was all questions and not very many answers we didnt even know what they called themselves certainly not heechee because that was just a name the explorers made up for them we had no idea what these remote and godlike creatures called themselves but we didnt know what god called himself either jehovah jupiter baal allahthose were names people made up who knew by what name he was known to his buddies i was trying to let myself feel what i might have felt if the stranger in the food factory had actually been heechee when the toilet flushed essie came out and squiffy made a dash for the bowl there are indignities to having full medical coverage and a mobile bioassay unit is one of them you are wasting my program time essie scolded and i realized that harriet had been sitting patiently in the tank waiting to be told to get on with her information about the other claims on my attention the report from the food factory was all being taped and stored in any case so essie went to her own office to deal with her own priorities i told harriet to start the cook on lunch and then i let her do her secretarial duties you have an appointment to testify before the senate ways and means committee tomorrow morning mr broadhead i know ill be there youre due for your next checkup this weekend shall i confirm the appointment thats one of the penalties of full medical and besides essie insistsshes twenty years younger than i and reminds me of it all right lets get it over with you are being sued by one hanson bover and morton wants to talk to you about it your consolidated statement for the quarter came in and is on your desk fileexcept for the food mine holdings which will not be complete until tomorrow and there are a number of minor messagesmost of which i have already dealt withfor your review at your convenience thank you thats all for now the tank went transparent and i leaned back in my chair to think i didnt need to see the consolidated statementi already pretty well knew what it would say the real estate investments were performing nicely the little bit i had left in sea farming was moving toward a record profit year everything was solid except for the food mines the last day fever had cost us i couldnt blame the guys in cody they werent any more responsible than i was when the fever bit but they had somehow let the thermal drilling get out of control and five thousand acres of our shale were burning away underground it had taken three months to get the mine back in operation at all and we still didnt know what it was going to cost no wonder their quarterly statement was late but that was only an annoyance not a disaster i was too well diversified to be killed by any one sector going bad i wouldnt have been in the food mines except for mortons advice the extraction allowance made it a really good thing taxwise then morton figured out that i still needed a tax shelter so we started the broadhead institute for extrasolar research the institute owns all my stock but i vote it and i vote it for what i want to do i got us into the coownership with the gateway corporation that financed probes to four detected but unvisited heecheemetal sources in or near the solar system and one of them had been the food factory as soon as they made contact we spun off a separate exploitation company to deal with itand now it was looking really interesting harriet let me have the direct from the food factory again i said the holo sprang up the boy still talking excitedly in his shrill squeaky voice i tried to catch the thread of what he was sayingsomething about a dead man speaking to him about a gateway mission she had been on it was all perplexing so i had a better idea albert einstein please i said and the holo swirled to show the sweet old lined face peering at me yes robin said my science program reaching for his pipe and tobacco as he almost always does when we talk id like some bestguess estimates from you on the food factory and the boy that turned up there sure thing robin he said tamping the tobacco with his thumb the boys name is wan he appears to be between fourteen and nineteen years of age probably toward the young end of the spread and i would guess that he is fully genetically human where does he come from ah that is conjectural robin he speaks of a main station presumably another heechee artifact in some ways resembling gateway gateway two and the food factory itself but without any selfevident function there do not appear to be any other living humans there he speaks of dead men who appear to be some sort of computer program like myself although it is not clear whether they may not in fact be quite different in origin he also mentions living creatures he calls the old ones or the frogjaws he has little contact with them in fact avoids it and it is not clear where they come from i took a deep breath heechee i dont know robin i cannot even guess by occams razor one would conjecture that living nonhumans occupying a heechee artifact might well be heecheebut there is no direct evidence we have no idea what heechee look like you know i did know it was a sobering thought that we might soon find out anything else can you tell me whats happening with the tests to bring the factory back sure thing robin he said striking a match to the pipe but im afraid theres no good news the object appears to be courseprogrammed and under full control whatever we do to it it counteracts it had been a close decision whether to leave the food factory out in the oort cloud and somehow try to ship food back to earth or bring the thing itself in now it looked as though we had no choice is theredo you think its under heechee control there is no way to be sure as yet narrowly i would conjecture not it appears to be an automatic response however he said puffing on his pipe there is something encouraging may i show you some visuals from the factory please do i said but actually he hadnt waited albert is a courteous program but also a smart one he disappeared and i was looking at a scene of the boy wan showing peter herter how to open what seemed to be a hatch in the wall of a passage out of it he was pulling floppy soft packages of something in bright red wrappings our assumption as to the nature of the artifact seems to be validated robin those are edible and according to wan they are continually replenished he has been living on them for most of his life and as you see appears to be in excellent health basicallyi am afraid he is catching a cold just now i looked at the clock over his shoulderhe always keeps it at the right time for my sake thats all for now then keep me posted if anything that affects your conclusions turns up sure thing robin he said disappearing i started to get up talking of food reminded me that lunch should be about ready and i was not only hungry i had plans for an afterlunch break i tied the robe around meand then remembered the message about the lawsuit lawsuits are nothing special in any rich mans life but if morton wanted to talk to me i probably ought to listen he responded at once sitting at his desk leaning forward earnestly were being sued robin he said the food factory exploitation corp the gateway corp plus paul hall dorema herterhall and peter herter both in propria persona and as guardian for codefendant janine herter plus the foundation and you personally i seem to have a lot of company at least do i have to worry pause thoughtfully i think you might a little the suit is from hanson bover trishs husband or widower depending on how you look at it morton was shimmering a little its a defect in his program and essie keeps wanting to fix itbut it doesnt affect his legal ability and i kind of like it he has got himself declared conservator of trish bovers assets and on the basis of her first landing on the food factory he wants a full mission completed share of whatever comes out of it that wasnt too funny even if we couldnt move the damn thing with the new developments that bonus might be quite a lot how can he do that she signed the standard contract didnt she so all we have to do is produce the contract she didnt come back therefore she doesnt get a share thats the way to go if we wind up in court yes robin but there are one or two rather ambiguous precedents maybe not even ambiguousher lawyer thinks theyre good even if they are a little old the most important one was a guy who signed a fiftythousanddollar contract to do a tightrope walk over niagara falls no performance no pay he fell off halfway the courts held that he had given the performance so they had to pay up thats crazy morton thats the case law robin but i only said you might have to worry a little i think probably were all right im just not sure were all right we have to file an appearance within two days then well see how it goes all right shimmer away morton i said and got up because by now i was absolutely sure it was time for lunch in fact essie was just coming through the door and to my disappointment she was fully dressed essie is a beautiful woman and one of the joys of being married to her for five years is that every year she looks better to me than the year before she put her arm around my neck as we walked toward the dining porch and turned her head to look at me whats matter robin she asked nothings the matter dear s ya i said only i was planning to invite you to shower with me after lunch you are randy old goat old man she said severely what is wrong with showering after dark when we will then naturally and inevitably go to bed by dark i have to be in washington and tomorrow youre off to tucson for your conference and this weekend i have to go for my medical it doesnt matter though she sat down at the table you are also pitifully bad liar she observed eat quickly old man one cannot take too many showers after all i said do you know essie that you are a thoroughly sensual creature its one of your finest traits the quarterly statement on my food mines holdings was on my desk file in my washington suite before breakfast it was even worse than i had expected at least two million dollars had burned up under the wyoming hills and another fifty thousand or so more was smoldering away every day until they got the fire all out if they ever did it did not mean i was in trouble but it might mean that a certain amount of easy credit would no longer be easy and not only did i know it but by the time i got to the senate hearing room it appeared that all of washington knew it too i testified quickly along the same lines i had testified before and when i was through senator praggler recessed the hearing and took me out to brunch i cant figure you out robin he said didnt your fire change your mind about anything no why should it im talking about the long pull he shook his head heres somebody with a sizeable position in food mine stocksyoubegging for higher taxes on the mines doesnt make sense i explained it to him all over again taken as a whole the food mines could easily afford to allocate say ten percent of their gross to restoring the rockies after scooping out the shale but no company could afford to do it on its own if we did it wed just lose any competitive position wed be undersold by everybody else so if you put through the amendment tim i said well all be forced to do it food prices will go up yesbut not a lot my accountants say no more than eight or nine dollars a year per person and well have an almost unspoiled countryside again he laughed youre a weird one with all your dogooding and with your money not to mention those things he nodded at the out bangles i still wore on my arm three of them signifying three missions that had each scared the hell out of me when i earned them as a gateway prospector why dont you run for the senate dont want to tim besides if i ran from new york id be running against you or sheila and i dont want to do that i dont spend enough time in hawaii to make a dent and im not going to move back to wyoming he patted me on the shoulder just this once he said im going to use a little oldfashioned political muscle ill try to get your amendment through for you robin though god knows what your competitors are going to do to try to stop it after i left him i dawdled back to the hotel there was no particular reason to hurry back to new york with essie in tucson so i decided to spend the rest of the day in my hotel suite in washingtona bad decision as it turned out but i didnt know that then i was thinking about whether i minded being called a dogooder or not my old psychoanalyst had helped me along to a point where i didnt mind taking credit for things i thought deserved credit but most of what i did i did for me the revegetation amendment wouldnt cost me a dime wed make it up in raising prices as i had explained the money i put into space might pay off in dollar profitsprobably would i figuredbut anyway it was going there because space was where my money had come from and besides i had some unfinished business out there somewhere i sat by my window on the penthouse floor of the hotel fortyfive stories up looking toward the capitol and the washington monument and wondered if my unfinished business was still alive i hoped so even if she was hating me still thinking about my unfinished business made me think of essie by now arriving in tucson and that gave me a twinge of worry we were about due for another attack of the day fever i hadnt thought about that early enough i didnt like the idea of her being three thousand kilometers away in case it was a bad one and although i am not a jealous person even if it was a mild but lecherous and orgiastic one as they seemed to be becoming more and more frequently i really preferred that she be lecherous and orgiastic with me why not i called harriet and had her make me reservations on an afternoon flight to tucson i could conduct my business as well from there as anywhere else if not quite as comfortably and then i started conducting some of it albert first there was nothing significantly new he said except that the boy seemed to be developing a bad cold weve instructed the hertenhall party to administer standard antibiotics and symptomsuppressants he told me but they will not receive the message for some weeks of course serious he frowned puffing at his pipe wan has never been exposed to most viruses and bacteria he said so i cant make any definite statement but no i would hope not in any case the expedition has medical supplies and equipment capable of dealing with most pathologies do you know anything more about him a great deal but not anything that changes my previous estimates robin puff puff his mother was hispanic and his father americananglo and they were both gateway prospectors or so it would seem so apparently in some way were the personalities he refers to as the dead men although it is still unclear just what those are albert i said look up some old gateway missions at least ten years back see if you can find one that had an american and a hispanic woman on itand didnt come back sure thing bob some day i must tell him to change to a snappier vocabulary but actually he works very well as he is he said almost at once there is no such mission however there was a launch which contained a pregnant hispanic woman still unreported shall i display the specs sure thing albert i said but he is not programmed to pick up that sort of nuance the specs didnt tell much i hadnt known the woman she was before my time but she had taken a one out after surviving a mission in which her husband and the other three crew members had been killed in a five and had never been heard of again the mission was a simple gooutandseewhatyouget what she had got had been a baby in some strange place that doesnt account for wans father does it no robin but perhaps he was on another mission if we assume that the dead men are in some way related to unreturned missions there must have been several i said are you suggesting that the dead men are actual prospectors sure thing robin but how you mean their brains might have been preserved doubt it robin he said rekindling his pipe thoughtfully theres insufficient data but id say wholebrain storage is no more than a pointone probability then what are the other points perhaps a readout of the chemical storage of memorynot a high probability perhaps put it at pointthree which is still the highest probability weve got voluntary interface on the part of the subjectsfor instance if they talked all their memories onto tape somehowreally low pointzero zero one tops direct mental linkwhat you might call telepathy of some sortabout the same means unknown pointfive plus of course robin he added hurriedly you realize that all of these estimates are based on insufficient data and on inadequate hypotheses i suppose youd do better if you could talk to the dead men direct sure thing bob and i am about to request such a hookup through the herterhall shipboard computer but it needs careful programming beforehand it is not a very good computer robin he hesitated uh robin there is one other interesting thing whats that as you know several large ships were docked at the food factory when it was discovered it has been under frequent observation since and the number of ships remained the samenot counting the herterhall ship and the one in which wan arrived two days ago of course but it is not certain they are the same ships what it isnt certain robin he emphasized one heechee ship looks very much like another but careful scan of the approach photos seems to show a different orientation on the part of at least one of the large ones possibly all three as though the ships that were there had left and new ones had docked a cold feeling went up and down my spine albert i said finding it hard to get the words out do you know what that suggests to me sure thing robin he said solemnly it suggests that the food factory is still in operation that it is converting the cometary gases to chonfood and sending them somewhere i swallowed hard but albert was still talking also he said there is quite a lot of ionizing radiation in the environment i have to admit i dont know where it comes from is that dangerous to the herterhalls no robin i would say not no more than say piezovision broadcasts are to you it is not the risk it is that i am puzzled about the source cant you ask the herterhalls to check sure thing robin i already have but itll take fifty days to get the answer i dismissed him and leaned back in my chair to think about the heechee and their queer ways and then it hit my desk chairs are all built to maximum comfort and stability but this time i almost tipped it over in a split second i was in pain not just in pain i was dizzy disoriented even hallucinating my head felt as though it were about to burst and my lungs seared like flame i had never felt so sick in both mind and body and at the same time i found myself fantasizing incredible feats of sexual athletics i tried to get up and couldnt i flopped back in the chair absolutely helpless harriet i croaked get a doctor it took her a full three seconds to respond and then her image wavered worse than morton mr broadhead she said looking queerly worried i cannot account for it but the circuits are all busy i i i it was not just her voice repeating her head and body looked like a short loop of video tape over and over shaping the same beginning of a word and snapping back to begin it again i fell off the chair onto the floor and my last coherent thought was the fever it was back worse than i had ever felt it before worse perhaps than i could live through and so bad so painful so terrifyingly psychotically strange that i was not sure i wanted to janine the difference between the ages of ten and fourteen is immense after three and a half years in a photonpowered spaceship en route to the oort cloud janine was no longer the child who had left she had not stopped being a child she had just reached that early maturation plateau wherein the individual recognizes that it still has a great deal of growing to do janine was not in a hurry to become an adult she was simply working at getting the job done every day all the time with whatever tools came to hand when she left the others on the day when she met wan she was not particularly searching for anything she simply wanted to be alone not for any really private purpose not even because or not only because she was tired of her family what she wanted was something of her own an experience not shared an evaluation not helped by alwayspresent grownups she wanted the look and touch and smell of the strangeness of the food factory and she wanted it to be hers so she pushed herself at random along the passages sucking from time to time at a squeeze bottle of coffee or what seemed to be coffee to her it was a habit janine had learned from her father although if you had asked her she would have denied that she had learned any all of her senses thirsted for inputs the food factory was the most fabulously exciting delightfully scary thing that had ever happened to her more than the launch from earth when she was a mere child more than the stained shorts that had announced she had become a woman more than anything even the bare walls of the passages were exciting because they were heechee metal a zillion years old and still glowing with the gentle blue light their makers had built into them she patted herself gently from chamber to chamber only the balls of her feet ever touching the floor in this room were walls of rubbery shelves in that squatted a huge truncated sphere top and bottom sliced off mirror chrome in appearance queerly powdery to the touchwhat was it for some of the things she could guess at the thing that looked like a table certainly was a table some of the objects had been identified for them by vera accessing the information stores of heechee artifacts cataloged by the big data sources back on earth the cubicles with cobwebby green tracings on the walls were thought to have been for sleeping accommodations but who was to know if dumb vera was right no matter the objects themselves were thrilling so was the presence of space to move around in even to get lost in for until they reached the food factory janine had never ever not once in her life had the chance to get lost the idea made her itch with scary pleasure especially as the quite adult part of her fourteenyearold brain was always aware that no matter how lost she got the food factory simply was not large enough for her to stay lost so it was a safe thrill or seemed so until she found herself trapped by the farside docks as somethingheechee space monster crazed old castaway with a knifecame shambling out of the hidden passages toward her and then it was none of those things it was wan of course she didnt know his name dont you come any closer she whimpered heart in mouth radio in hand forearms hugged across her new breasts he didnt he stopped he stared at her eyes popping mouth open tongue almost hanging out he was tall skinny his face was triangular with a long beaked nose he was wearing what looked like a skirt and what looked like a tanktop both dirty he smelled male he was shaking as he sniffed the air and he was young surely he was not much older than janine herself and the only person less than triple her age she had seen in years and when he let himself drop gently to his knees and began to do what janine had never seen any other person do she moaned while she giggledamusement relief shock hysteria the shock was not at what he was doing the shock came from meeting a boy in her sleep janine had dreamed wildly but never of this for the next few days janine could not bear to let wan out of her sight she felt herself to be his mother his playmate his teacher his wife no wan sip it slowly its hot wan do you mean to say youve been all alone since you were three you have really beautiful eyes wan she didnt mind that he was not sophisticated enough to respond by telling her that she had beautiful eyes too because she could definitely tell that she fascinated him in all her parts the others could tell that too of course janine did not mind wan had plenty of sensessharp eyesbright obsessed adoration to share around he slept even less than she she appreciated that at first because it meant there was more of wan to share but then she could see that he was becoming exhausted even ill when he began to sweat and tremble in the room with the glittering silverblue cocoon she was the one who cried lurvy i think hes going to be sick when he lurched toward the couch she flew to his side fingers stretched to test his dry and burning forehead the closing cover of the cocoon almost trapped her arm gouging a long deep slash from wrist to knuckles on her hand paul she shouted drawing back weve got to and then the day madness hit them all worst of any time different from any time between one heartbeat and the next janine was sick janine had never been sick now and then a bruise a cramp a sniffle nothing more for most of her life she had been under full medical and sickness simply did not occur she did not comprehend what was happening to her her body raged with fever and pain she hallucinated monstrous strange figures in some of whom she recognized her caricatured family others were simply terrifying and strange she even saw herselfhugely bosomed and grossly hipped but herselfand in her belly rumbled a frenzy to thrust and thrust into all the seen and imagined cavities of that fantasy something that even in fantasy she did not have none of this was clear nothing was clear the agonies and the insanities came in waves between them for a second or two now and then she caught glimpses of reality the steely blue glow from the walls lurvy crouched and whimpering beside her her father vomiting in the passage the chrome and blue cocoon with wan writhing and babbling inside the mesh it was not reason or will that made her claw at the lid and on the hundredth or thousandth try to get it open but she did it at last and dragged him whimpering and shaking out the hallucinations stopped at once not quite as quickly the pain the nausea and the terror but they stopped they were all shuddering and reeling still all but the boy who was unconscious and breathing in a way that terrified janine great hoarse snoring gasps help lurvy she screamed hes dying her sister was already beside her thumb on the boys pulse shaking her head to clear it as she peered dizzily at his eyes dehydrated fever come on she cried struggling with wans arms help me get him back to the ship he needs saline antibiotics a febrifuge maybe some gamma globulin it took them nearly twenty minutes to tow wan to the ship and janine was in terror that he would die at every bounding slowmotion step lurvy raced ahead the last hundred meters and by the time paul and janine had struggled him through the airlock she had already unsealed the medic kit and was shouting orders put him down make him swallow this take a blood sample and check virus and antibody titers send a priority to base tell them we need medical instructionsif he lives long enough to get them paul helped them get wans clothes off and the boy wrapped in one of the payters blankets then he sent the message but he knew they all knew that the problem of whether wan lived or died would not be solved from earth not with a roundtrip time of seven weeks before they could get an answer payter was swearing over the bioassay mobile unit lurvy and janine were working on the boy paul without saying a word to anyone struggled into his eva suit and exited into space where he spent an exhausting hour and a half redirecting the transmitter dishesthe main one to the bright double star that was the planet neptune and its moon the other to the point in space occupied by the garfeld mission then clinging to the hull he radiocommanded vera to repeat the sos to each of them at max power they might be monitoring they might not when vera signaled that the messages were sent he reoriented the big dish to earth it took them three hours first to last and whether either of them would receive his message was doubtful it was no less doubtful that either would have much help to offer the garfeld ship was smaller and less well equipped than their own and the people at the triton base were shorttimers but if either did they could hope for a message of aidor at least sympathy a lot faster than from earth in an hour wans fever began to recede in twelve the twitchings and babblings diminished and he slept normally but he was still very sick mother and playmate teacher and atleastfantasy wife now janine became wans nurse as well after the first round of medication she would not even let lurvy give him his shots she went without sleep to sponge his brow when he soiled himself in his coma she cleaned him fastidiously she had no concentration left for anything else the amused or concerned looks and words from her family left her untouched until she brushed wans unkempt hair off his face and paul made a patronizing comment janine heard the jealousy in the tone and flared paul youre sickening wan needs me to take care of him and you do enjoy it dont you he snapped he was really angry of course that sparked more anger in janine but her father put in gently enough let the girl be a girl paul were you not yourself once young come let us examine this trdumeplatz again janine surprised herself by letting the peacemaker succeed it had been a marvelous chance of a furious spat but that was not where her interests lay she took time for a tight small grin about pauls jealousy because that was a new service stripe to sew on her sleeve and then back to wan as he mended he became even more interesting from time to time he woke and spoke to her when he was asleep she studied him face so dark body olive but from waist to thigh he bad the palest skin the color of bread dough taut over his sharp bones scant body hair none on his face except a soft almost invisible strand or twomore liplashes than mustache janine knew that lurvy and her father made a joke of her and that paul was actually jealous of the attentions he had avoided so long it made a nice change she had status for the first time in her life what she was doing was the most significant activity of the group the others came to her to sue for permission to question wan and when she thought he was tiring they accepted her command to stop besides wan fascinated her she mapped him against all her previous experience of men to his advantage even against her penpals wan was better looking than the iceskater smarter than the actors almost as tall as the basketball player and against all of them especially against the only two males she had been within tens of millions of kilometers of in years wan was so marvelously young and paul and her father not the backs of old peters hands bore irregular blotches of caramelcolored pigment which was gross but at least the old man kept himself neat even dainty in the continental wayeven clipped the hairs that grew inside his ears with tiny silver scissors because janine had caught him at it while paul in one of her skirmishes with lurvy janine had snarled thats what you go to bed with an ape with hairy ears id puke so she fed wan and read to him and drowsed over him while he slept she shampooed his hair and trimmed it to a soupbowl mop allowing lurvy to help her get it even and blowdried it smooth she washed his clothes and spurning lurvy for this patched them and even cut down some of pauls to fit him he accepted it all every bit and enjoyed it as much as she as he grew stronger he no longer needed her as much and she was less able to protect him from the questions of the others but they were protective too even old peter the computer vera burrowed into its medical programs and prepared a long list of tests to be performed on the boy assassin raged peter has it no understanding of a young man who has been so close to death that it wishes to finish it it was not entirely consideration peter had questions of his own and he had been asking them when janine would allow it sulking and fidgeting when she would not that bed of yours wan tell me again what you feel when you are in it as though you are somehow a part of millions of people and also they of you isnt that so but when janine accused him of interfering with wans recovery the old man desisted though never for long then wan was well enough for janine to allow herself a full nights sleep in her own private and when she woke her sister was at veras console wan was holding to the back of her chair grinning and frowning at the unfamiliar machine and lurvy was reading off to him his medical report your vital signs are normal your weight is picking up your antibody levels are in the normal rangei think youre going to be all right now wan so now cried her father at last we can talk about this fasterthanlight radio the machines the place he comes from the dreaming room janine hurled herself into the group leave him alone she snarled but wan shook his head let them ask what they like janine he said in his shrill breathy voice now yes now stormed her father now this minute paul come you here and tell this boy what we must know they had planned this janine realized the three of them but wan did not object and she could not pretend he was unfit for questioning any longer she marched over and sat beside him if she could not prevent this interrogation at least she would be there to protect him she gave formal permission coldly go ahead paul say what you want to say but dont tire him out paul looked at her ironically but spoke to wan for more than a dozen years he said every hundred and thirty days or so the whole earth has gone crazy it looks like its your fault the boy frowned but said nothing his public defender spoke for him why are you picking on him she demanded no one is picking janine but what we experienced was the fever it cant be a coincidence when wan gets into that contraption he broadcasts to the world paul shook his head dear lad do you have any idea of how much trouble youve caused ever since you began coming here your dreams have been shared by millions of people billions sometimes you were peaceful and your dreams were peaceful and that wasnt so bad sometimes you werent i dont want you to blame yourself he added kindly forestalling janine but thousands and thousands of people have died and the property damagewan you just cant imagine wan shrilled defensively i have never harmed anyone he was unable to take in just what he was accused of but there was no doubt in his mind that paul was accusing lurvy put her hand on his arm i wish it were so wan she said the important thing is you mustnt do that again no more dreaming in the couch no wan he looked to janine for guidance then shrugged but that is not all paul put in you have to help us tell us everything you know about the couch about the dead men about the fasterthanlight radio the food why should i wan demanded patiently paul coaxed because in that way you can make up for the fever i dont think you understand how important you are wan the knowledge in your head might mean saving people from starvation millions of lives wan wan frowned over that concept for a moment but millions was meaningless to him as applying to human beingshe had not yet adjusted to five you make me angry he scolded i dont mean to wan it is not what you mean to it is what you do you have just told me that the boy grumbled spitefully all right what do you want we want you to tell us everything you know paul said promptly oh not all at once but as you remember and we want you to go through this whole food factory with us and explain everything in itas far as you can i mean this place there is nothing here but the dreaming room and you wont let me use that it is all new to us wan it is nothing the water does not run there is no library the dead men are hard to talk to nothing grows at home i have everything and much of it is working so you can see for yourself you make it sound like heaven wan see for yourself if i cant dream there is no reason to stay here paul looked at the others perplexed could we do that of course my ship will take us therenot all of you no wan corrected himself but some we can leave the old man here there is no woman for him anyway so there is no pairing to destroy or even he added cunningly only janine and i can go then there will be more room in the ship we can bring you back machines books treasures forget that wan janine said wisely theyll never let us do that not so fast my girl her father said that is not for you to decide what the boy is saying is interesting if he can open the gates of heaven for us who are we to stand outside in the cold janine studied her father but his expression was bland you dont mean youd let wan and me go there alone that he said is not the question the question is how can we most rapidly complete this godbedamned mission and return to our reward there is no other well said lurvy after a moment we dont have to decide that right now heaven will wait for us for all our lives her father said that is true yes but expressed concretely some of us have less lives to wait than others every day new messages came in from earth infuriatingly these related only to a remote past before wan irrelevant to everything they were doing or planning now submit chemical analyses of this xray that measure these other things by now the slow packets of photons that transmitted the word of their reaching the food factory had arrived at downlinkvera on earth and perhaps replies were already on their way but they would not arrive for weeks the base at triton had a smarter computer than vera and paul and lurvy argued for transmitting all their data there for interpretation and advice old peter rejected the idea with fury those wanderers gypsies why should we give them what costs us so much to get but nobodys questioning us pa lurvy coaxed its all ours the contracts spell it all out no so they fed all that wan told them into shipboardvera and veras small slow intelligence painfully sorted the bits into patterns even into graphics the external appearance of the place wan had come fromit was probably not a very good likeness because it was apparent that wan had not had the curiosity to study it very closely the corridors the machines the heechee themselves and each time wan offered corrections ah no they both have beards males and females even when they are quite young and the breasts on the females are he held his hands just below his rib cage to show how low they swung and you do not give them the right smell holos dont smell at all wan said paul yes exactly but they do you see in rut they smell very much and vera mumbled and whined over the new data and shakily drew in the new revisions after hours of this what had been a game for wan turned into drudgery when he began saying yes it is perfect that is exactly how the dead mens room looks they all understood that he was merely agreeing with anything that would stop the boredom for a while and gave him a rest then janine would take him for a wander through the corridors sound and vision pickups strapped to her shoulder in case he said something of value or pointed out a treasure and they spoke of other things his knowledge was as astonishing as his ignorance both were unpredictable it was not only wan that needed study every hour lurvy or old peter would come up with a new idea for diverting the food factory from its programmed drive so that they could try to accomplish their original purpose none worked every day more messages came in from earth they were still not relevant they were not even very interesting janine let a score of letters from her penpals stay in veras memory without bothering to retrieve them since the messages she was getting from wan filled her needs sometimes the communications were odd for lurvy the announcement that her college had named her its woman of the year for old peter a formal petition from the city he had been born in he read it and burst into laughter dortmund still wishes me to run for burgermeister what nonsense why thats really nice lurvy said agreeably its quite a compliment it is quite nothing he corrected her severely burgermeister with what we have i could be elected president of the federal republic or even he fell silent and then said gloomily if to be sure i ever see the federal republic again he paused looking over their heads his lips worked silently for a moment and then he said perhaps we should go back now aw pop janine began and stopped because the old man turned on her the look of an alpha wolf on a cub there was a sudden tension among them until paul cleared his throat and said well thats certainly one of our options of course theres a legal question of contract peter shook his head i have thought of that they owe us so much already simply for stopping the fever if they pay us only one percent of the damage we save it is millions billions and if they wont pay he hesitated and then said no there is no question that they wont pay we simply must speak to them report that we have stopped the fever that we cannot move the food factory that we are coming home by the time a return message can arrive we will be weeks on our way and what about wan janine demanded he will come with us to he sure he will be among his own kind again and that is surely what is best for him dont you think we ought to let wan decide that and what happened to sending a bunch of us to investigate his heaven that was a dream her father said coldly reality is that we cannot do everything let someone else explore his heaven there is plenty for all and we will be back in our homes enjoying riches and fame it is not just a matter of the contract he went on almost pleadingly we are saviors there will be lecture tours and endorsements for the advertising we will be persons of great power no pop janine said listen to me youve all been talking about our duty to help the worldfeed people bring them new things to make their lives better well arent we going to do our duty he turned on her furiously little minx what do you know about duty without me you would be in some gutter in chicago waiting for the welfare check we must think of ourselves as well she would have replied but wans wideeyed frightened stare made her stop i hate this she announced wan and i are going to go for a walk to get away from the lot of you he is not really a bad person she told wan once they were beyond the sound of the others quarreling voices had followed them and wan who had little experience of disagreements was obviously upset wan did not reply directly he pointed to a bulge in the glowing blue wall this is a place for water he said but it is a dead one there are dozens of them but almost all dead out of duty janine inspected it pointing her shoulderheld camera at it as she slid the rounded cover back and forth there was a protuberance like a nose at the top of it and what must be a drain at the bottom it was almost large enough to get into but bone dry you said one of them still works but the water isnt drinkable yes janine would you like me to show it to you well i guess so she added really dont let them get to you they just get excited yes janine but he was not in a talkative mood she said when i was little he used to tell me stories mostly they were scary but sometimes not he told me about schwarze peter who as far as i can figure out was something like santa claus he said if i was a good little girl schwarze peter would bring me a doll at christmas but if i wasnt hed bring me a lump of coal or worse thats what i used to call him schwarze peter but he never gave me a lump of coal he was listening intently as they moved down the glowing corridor but he did not respond then my mother died she said and paul and lurvy got married and i went to live with them for a while but pop wasnt so bad really he came to see me as often as he couldi guess wan do you understand what im saying to you no he said whats santa claus oh wan so she explained santa claus to him and christmas and then had to explain winter and snow and giftgiving his face smoothed and he began to smile and curiously as wans mood improved janines grew worse trying to make wan understand the world she lived in made her confront the world ahead almost she thought it would be better to do what peter proposed pack it all in go back to their real lives all the alternatives were frightening where they were was frightening if she let herself feel itin some kind of an artifact that was doggedly plowing its way through space to some unknown destination what if it arrived what would they confront or if they went back with wan what would be there heechee heechee there was fear janine had lived all her young life with the heechee just outside itterrifying if real less real than mythical like schwarze peter or santa claus like god all myths and deities are tolerable enough to believe in but what if they become real she knew that her family were as fearful as she though she could not tell that from anything they saidthey were setting an example of courage to her she could only guess she guessed that paul and her sister were afraid but had made up their minds to gamble against that fear for the sake of what might come of it her own fear was of a very special kindless fear of what might happen than of how badly she might behave while it was happening to her what her father felt was obvious to everyone he was angry and afraid and what he was afraid of was dying before he cashed in on his courage and what did wan feel he seemed so uncomplicated as he showed her about his domain like one child guiding another through his toy chest janine knew better if she had learned anything in her fourteen years it was that nobody was uncomplicated wans complications were merely not the same as her own as she saw at once when he showed her the water fixture that worked he had not been able to drink the water but he had used it for a toilet janine brought up in the great conspiracy of the western world to pretend that excretion does not happen would never have brought wan to see this place of stains and smells but he was wholly unembarrassed she could not even make him embarrassed i had to go somewhere he said sullenly when she reproached him for not using the ships sanitary like everybody else yes but if you did it the right way vera would have known you were sick dont you see shes always analyzing our uh the bathroom stuff there ought to be some other way well there is there was the mobile bioassay unit which took tiny samples from each of themwhich had in fact been put to work on wan once the necessity was perceived but vera was not a very smart computer and had not thought to program her mobile unit to sample wan until told to do so a little late whats the matter he was acting uncomfortable when the dead men give me a medical check they stick things in me i dont like that its for your own good wan she said severely hey thats an idea lets go talk to the dead men and there was janines own complicatedness she didnt really want to talk to the dead men she just wanted to get away from the embarrassing place they were in but by the time they had propelled themselves to the place where the dead men were which was also the place where wans dreaming couch was janine had decided to want something else wan she said i want to try the couch he tilted his head back and narrowed his eyes appraising her over his long nose lurvy told me not to do that any more he stated i know she did how do i get in first you tell me i must do what you all say he complained then you all tell me to do different things it is very confusing she had already stepped into the cocoon and stretched out do i just pull the top down over me oh he said shrugging if youve made up your mindyes it snaps shut there where your hand is but when you want to come out you just push she reached for the webby top and pulled it toward her looking up at his petulant concerned face does ithurt hurt no what an idea well what does it feel like janine he said severely you are very childish why do you ask questions when you can see for yourself and he pushed down on the shimmery wire covering and the catch midway down the side rustled and locked it is best if you go to sleep he called down to her through the shining blue network of wire but im not sleepy she objected reasonably im not anything i dont feel a thing and then she did it was not what she had expected out of her own experience of the fever there was no obsessive interference with her own personality no point source of feelings there was only a warm and saturating glow she was surrounded she was an atom in a soup of sensation the other atoms had no shape or individuality they were not tangible or hardedged she could still see wan peering worriedly down at her through the wire when she opened her eyes and these othersoulswere not at all as real or as immediate but she could feel them as she had never felt another presence around her beside her within her they were warm they were comforting when wan at last wrenched open the metal wire and pulled at her arm she lay there staring at him she did not have the strength to rise or the desire he had to help her up and she leaned on his shoulder as they started back they were less than halfway back to the herterhall ship when the other members of the family interrupted them and they were furious stupid little brat paul raged you ever do anything like that again and ill paddle your pink little ass for you she wont her father said grimly i will see to that right now and as to you little miss i will see to you later they had all become so quarrelsome no one paddled janines bottom for trying out the dreaming couch no one punished her at all they all punished each other instead and did it all the time the truce that had held for three and a half years because each of them enforced it for himself the alternative being mutual murder dissolved paul and the old man did not speak for two days because peter had dismantled the couch without consultation lurvy and her father spat and shouted at each other because she had programmed too much salt in their meal and then again when it was his turn because he had programmed too little and as to lurvy and paulthey no longer slept together they hardly spoke they would surely not have stayed married if there had been a divorce court within au but if there had been a source of authority of any kind within au at least the disputes could have been resolved someone could have made their decisions should they return should they try to overpower the food factorys guidance should they go with wan to explore the other placeand if so who should go and who should remain behind they could not agree on grand plans they could not even agree on the decisions of every hour to take a machine apart and risk its destruction or to leave it alone and give up the hope of some wonderful discovery that could change everything they could not agree on who should talk to the dead men by radio or what to ask them wan showed them willingly enough how to try to tempt the dead men into conversation and they put veras sound system in linkage with the radio but vera could not handle much give and take and when the dead men did not understand her questions or did not want to participate or were simply too insane to be of any use vera was beaten all this was awful for janine but worst of all was wan himself the squabbling made him confused and indignant he stopped following her around and after one sleep when she sat up and looked around for him he was gone fortunately for janines pride everyone else was gone too paul and lurvy outside the ship to reorient the antennae her father asleep so that she had time to deal with her jealousy let him be a pig she thought it was stupid of him not to realize that she had many friends while he had only her but he would find out she was busy writing long letters to her neglected correspondents when she heard paul and her sister returning and when she told them that wan had been gone for at least an hour she was unprepared for their reaction pa lurvy cried rattling at the curtain of her fathers private wake up wans gone as the old man came blinking out janine said disagreeably now whats the matter with all of you you dont understand do you paul asked coldly what if hes taken the ship it was a possibility that had never occurred to janine and it was like a blow in the face he wouldnt would he not snarled her father and how do you know that little minx and if he does what of us he finished zipping his coverall and stood up glowering at them i have told you all he saidbut looking at lurvy and paul so that janine understood she was not a part of their alli have told you that we must find a definite solution if we are to go with him in his ship we must do it if not we cannot take the risk that he will take it into his foolish little mind to go back without warning that is assuredly certain and how do we do that lurvy demanded youre preposterous pa we cant guard the ship day and night and your sister cannot guard the boy yes the old man nodded so we must either immobilize the ship or immobilize the boy janine flew at him you monsters she choked youve been planning this all out when we werent around her sister caught and held her calm down janine she ordered yes its true weve talked about itwe had to but nothings settled certainly not that we will hurt wan then settle it janine flared i vote we go with wan if he hasnt gone already by himself paul put in he hasnt lurvy said practically if he has its too late for us to do anything about it outside of that im with janine we go what do you say paul he hesitated iguess so he conceded peter the old man said with dignity if you are all agreed then what does it matter how i vote there is only the question remaining who is to go and who is to stay i propose lurvy stopped him pa she said i know what you are going to say but it wont work we need to leave at least one person here to keep in contact with earth janines too young it cant be me because im the best pilot and this is a chance to learn something about piloting a heechee ship i dont want to go without paul and that leaves you they took vera apart component by component and redistributed her around the food factory fast memory inputs and displays went into the dreaming chamber slow memory lining the passageway outside transmission still in their old ship peter helped silent and taciturn the meaning of what they were doing was that further communications of interest would come from the exploring party via the radio system of the dead men peter was helping to write himself off and knew it there was plenty of food in the ship wan told them but paul would not be satisfied with the automatic replenishment of god knew what product of the food factory and he made them carry aboard rations of their own as much as they could stow whereupon wan insisted that they stock up with water and so they depleted the recycling stocks in the ship to fill his plastic bags and loaded them too wans ship had no beds none were needed wan pointed out because the acceleration cocoons were enough to protect them during maneuvers and to keep them from floating around while they slept in the rest of the voyagesuggestion vetoed by both lurvy and paul who dismantled the sleeping pouches from their private and reinstalled them in the ship personal possessions janine wanted her secret stash of perfume and books lurvy her personal locked bag paul his cards for solitaire it was long and hard work though they discovered they could ease it by sailing the plastic waterbags and the softer solider other stores along the corridors in a game of slowmotion catch but at last it was done peter sat sourly propped against a corridor wall watching the others mill about and tried to think of what had been forgotten to janine it seemed as though they were already treating him as though he were absent if not dead and she said pop dont take it so hard well all be back as soon as we can he nodded which comes to he said let me see fortynine days each way plus as long as you decide to stay in this place but then he pushed himself up and allowed lurvy and janine to kiss him almost cheerfully he said bon voyage are you sure you have forgotten nothing lurvy looked around considering i think notunless you think we should tell your friends we are coming wan the dead men he shrilled grinning they will not know they are not alive you know they have no sense of time then why do you like them so much janine demanded wan caught the note of jealousy and scowled at her they are my friends he said they cannot be taken seriously all the time and they often lie but they do not ever make me feel afraid of them lurvy caught her breath oh wan she said touching him i know we havent been as nice as we might weve all been under a great strain were really better people than we must seem to you old peter had had enough go you now he snarled prove this to him do not stand talking forever and then come back and prove it to me after the fever less than two hoursthe fever had never been so short before nor had it ever been as intense the most susceptible one percent of the population had simply been out of it for four hours and nearly everyone had been severely affected i was one of the lucky ones because after the fever i was only stuck in my room with nothing more than a bump on the head from falling over i wasnt trapped in a wrecked bus crashed out of a jetliner struck by a runaway car or bleeding to death on an operating table while surgeons and nurses writhed helplessly on the floor all i had was one hour fiftyone minutes and fortyfour seconds of delirious misery and that diluted because it was shared with eleven billion other people of course everybody in all those eleven billion was trying to get in touch with everybody else all at once and so communications were jammed for fair harriet formed herself in the tank to tell me that at least twentyfive calls were coming in for memy science program my legal program three or four accountancy programs from my holdings and quite a few real live people none of them she told me apologetically when i asked was essie the circuits to tucson were out entirely at the moment and i couldnt place a call from my end either none of the machines had been affected by the madness they never were the only time something went wrong with them was when some live person had injected himself into the circuit for maintenance or redesign but as statistically that was happening a million times a minute somewhere in the world with some machine or another it was not surprising that some things took a little while to get going again first order of business was business i had to pick up the pieces i gave harriet a hierarchy of priorities and she began feeding me reports quick bulletin from the food mines no significant damage real estate some minor incidents of fire and flooding nothing that mattered someone had left a barrier open in the fish factories and six hundred million fingerlings swam out to lose themselves in the open sea but i was only a minority stockholder in them anyway taken all in all i had come out of the fever smelling of roses i thought or anyway a lot better than a lot of others the fever had struck the indian subcontinent after midnight of a day that already had seen one of the worst hurricanes the bay of bengal had produced in fifty years the death toll was immense rescue efforts had simply stopped for two hours tens maybe even hundreds of millions of people had been simply unable to drag themselves to high ground and southern bangladesh was a swamp of corpses add in a refinery explosion in california a train wreck in wales and a few as yet uncatalogued disastersthe computers did not yet have an estimate of deaths but the news reports were calling it the worst ever by the time i had taken all the urgenturgent calls the elevators were running again i wasnt a captive any more looking out the window i could see the washington streets were normal enough my trip to tucson on the other hand was well bollixed since half the jets in the air had been on automatic pilot for two hours seriously depleting their fuel they had been landing where they could and the lines had equipment in all sorts of wrong places the schedules were scrambled harriet booked me the best she could but the first space she could confirm was not until noon the next day i couldnt even call essie because the circuits were still jammed that was only an annoyance not a problem if i really wanted to get through there were priorities at my disposalthe rich have their perks but the rich have their pleasures too and i decided it would be fun to surprise essie by dropping in on her and meanwhile i had time to spare and all this time my science program had been bursting with things to tell me that was the dessert after the spinach and liver i had put it off until i had a chance for a good long natter and that time had arrived harriet i said put him on and albert einstein took form in the tank leaning forward and twitching with excitement what is it al i asked something good sure thing robin weve found out where the fever comes fromits the food factory it was my own fault if i had let albert tell me what was on his mind at once i wouldnt have been just about the last person on earth to find out that i owned the place all the trouble came from that was the first thing that hit me and i was thinking about possible liability and sniffing for advantages all the time he was explaining the evidence to me first and conclusive of course was the onthespot pickup from the food factory itself but we should have known all along if i had only timed the onsets carefully albert berated himself we could have located the source years ago and there were plenty of other clues consistent with their photonic nature their what nature they are electromagnetic robin he explained he tamped tobacco into his pipe and reached for a match you realize of course that this is established by transmission timewe received whatever signal caused the madness at the same time as the transmission showing it happening wait a minute if the heechee have fasterthanlight radio why isnt this the same ah robin if we only knew that he twinkled lighting his pipe i can only conjecture puff puff that this particular effect is not compatible with their other mode of transmission but the reasons for that i cannot even speculate on at this time and of course he went on there are certain questions raised at once to which we do not as yet have any answers of course i said but i didnt ask him what they were i was on the track of something else albert display the ships and stations you drew information from in space sure thing robin the flyaway hair and the seamed cheerful face melted away and at once the holographic tank filled with a representation of circumsolar space nine planets a girdle of dust that was the asteroid belt and a powdery shell far out that was the oort cloud and about forty points of colored light the representation was in logarithmic scale to get it all in and the size of the planets and artifacts immensely enlarged alberts voice explained the four green ships are ours robin the eleven blue objects are heechee installations the round ones are only detected the starshaped ones have been visited and are mostly manned all the others are ships that belong to other commercial interests or to governments i studied the plot not very many of the sparks were anywhere near the green ship and blue star that marked the food factory albert if somebody had to get another ship out to the food factory which one could get there fastest he appeared in the lower corner of the projection frowning and sucking his pipe stem a golden point near saturns rings began to flash on and off theres a brazilian cruiser just departing tethys that could make it in eighteen months he said i have displayed only the ships that were involved in my radiolocation there are several others new lights winked on in a scatter around the tank that could do better provided they have adequate fuel and supplies but none in less than a year i sighed turn it off albert i said the thing is were into something i didnt expect whats that robin he asked filling the tank again and folding his hands over his belly in a comfortable way that cocoon i dont know how to handle it i dont even see the point of it whats it for albert have you got any conjectures sure thing robin he said nodding cheerfully my best conjectures are a pretty low order of probability but thats just because there are so many unknowns lets put it this way suppose you were a heecheesomething like an anthropologist sayinterested in keeping an eye on a developing civilization evolution takes a long time so you dont want to just sit there and watch what youd like to do is get a quick estimate maybe every thousand years or so sort of a spot check well given something like the cocoon you could just send somebody over to the food factory every once in a while maybe every thousand years or more climb in the couch get an instant feel for what was happening it would take only minutes he paused consideringly for a moment before going on thenbut this is a speculation on top of a conjecture i wouldnt even assign a probability rating to it at allthen if you found anything interesting you could explore further you could even do something else this is really far out robin you might even suggest things the cocoon transmits as well as receives thats what the fevers came from perhaps it can also transmit concepts we know that in human history many of the great inventions sprang up all over the world apparently independently maybe simultaneously are they heechee suggestions via the couch he sat there puffing his pipe and smiling at me while i thought about that all the thinking in the world didnt make it good clean fun thrilling maybe but nothing you could relax to the world had changed in fundamental ways since the first astronauts discovered heechee diggings on venus and the more we explored the bigger the changes got a lost kid playing with something he didnt understand had plunged the whole human race into recurring madness for more than a decade if we kept on playing with things we didnt understand what were the heechee going to give us for an encore to say nothing of the queasiness of alberts suggestion that these creatures had been spying on us for hundreds of thousands of yearsmaybe even throwing us a crumb now and then to see what we would make of it i told albert to bring me up to date on everything else he knew about what was going on in the food factory and while he was running through the physical facts i called up harriet she appeared in one corner of the tank looking questioning and took my order for dinner while albert kept right on with his show and tell he was continuously monitoring all the transmissions even as he was reporting on them and be showed me selected scenes of the boy the herterhall party the interiors of the artifact the damn thing was still determined to go its own way best course estimates suggested that it was moving toward a new cluster of comets several million miles awayat present rates it would get there in a few months then what i demanded albert shrugged apologetically presumably it will then stay there until it has mined them of all the chon ingredients robin then can we move it no evidence robin but its possible speaking of which i have a theory about the controls of the heechee ships when one of them reaches an operating artifactthe food factory gateway whateverits controls unlock and it can then be redirected at any rate i think that may be what happened to ms patricia boverand that too has certain obvious implications he twinkled i dont like to let a computer program think its smarter than i am you mean that there may be a lot of stranded gateway astronauts all over the galaxy because their controls unlocked and they didnt know how to get back sure thing robin he said approvingly that may account for what wan calls the dead men weve received some conversations with them by the way their responses are sometimes quite nonrational and of course were handicapped by not being able to interact but it does appear that they are or were human beings are you telling me they were alive sure thing robin or at least in the sense that enrico carusos voice on a tape was once the voice of a living neapolitan tenor whether they are alive now is a matter of definition you might ask the same question puff pull about me huh i thought for a minute why are they so crazy imperfect transcription i would say but that is not the important thing i waited until he drew on his pipe to get ready to tell me the important thing it seems rather sure robin that the transcription occurred by some sort of chemical readout of the actual brains of the prospectors you mean the heechee killed them and poured their brains into a bottle certainly not robin first i would hazard the opinion that the prospectors died naturally rather than being killed that would degrade the chemistry of brain storage and contribute to the degradation of the information and certainly not into a bottle into some sort of chemical analogs perhaps but the point is how did this happen to be i groaned do you want me to abolish your program al i could get all this quicker from straight visual synoptics sure thing you could robin but not he twinkled perhaps as entertainingly at any rate the question is how did the heechee happen to have equipment to read out a human brain think about it robin it seems very improbable that the chemistry of the heechee would be the same as the chemistry of a human being close yes we know that from general considerations eg what they breathed and ate fundamentally their chemistry was not unlike ours but peptides are quite complex molecules it seems most unlikely that a compound which represents eg the ability to play a stradivarius well or even toilettraining would be the same in their chemistry as in ours he started to relight his pipe then caught my eye and added hurriedly so i conclude robin that these machines were designed not for heechee brains he startled me for humans then but why how how did they know when please robin at your instructions your wife has programmed me to make large deductions from small data therefore i cannot defend all that i say but he added nodding sagely i have this opinion yes jesus i said he did not seem to want to add anything to that so i tucked it away and went on to the next worry what about the old ones are they human do you think he tapped his pipe out and reached for the tobacco pouch i would say not he said at last i didnt ask him what the alternative was i didnt want to hear it when albert had run himself dry for the moment i told harriet to put my legal program on i couldnt talk to him right away though because right then my dinner came up and the waiter was a human being he wanted to ask me how i had got through the fever so that he could tell me how he had and that took time but at last i sat down in front of the holo tank sliced into my chicken steak and said go ahead morton whats the bad news he said apologetically you know that bover suit what bover suit trish bovers husband or widower depending on how you look at it we filed the appearance only unfortunately the judge had a bad attack of the fever and well he is wrong in the law robin but he denied our request for time to set a hearing date and entered summary judgment against i stopped chewing can he do that i roared through my mouthful of prime rare chicken well yes or at least he did it but well get him on appeal only that makes it a little more complicated her lawyer got a chance to argue and he pointed out that trish did file a mission report so theres some question whether she actually completed the mission do you see meanwhile sometimes i think morton is too humanly programmed he does know how to draw out a discussion so meanwhile what morton well since the recent ah episode there seems to be another complication gateway corp wants to go slow until they figure out just where they are with this fever business so theyve accepted service of an injunction neither you nor food factory inc is supposed to proceed with exploitation of the factory i blew up shit mort you mean we cant use it after we bring it all the way in from orbit im afraid i mean more than that he apologized youre enjoined to stop moving it youre enjoined to refrain from interfering with its normal activities in any way pending a declarative judgment thats bovers action on the grounds that if you prevent it from producing food by moving to a new comet cluster youre endangering his interest now we can get that vacated im sure but by then gateway corp will have some sort of action to stop doing everything until they get a handle on the fever oh god i put down my fork i wasnt hungry any more the only good thing i said is thats an order they cant enforce because it will take so long to get a message to the herterhall party yes robin he nodded on the he disappeared zit he slid diagonally away out of the tank and harriet appeared she looked terrible i have good programs for my computer help but they dont always bring good news robin she cried theres a message from mesa general hospital in arizonaits your wife essie essie is she sick oh worse than that robin total somatic cessation she was killed in a car crash theyve got her on life support but theres no prognosis robin she isnt responding i didnt use my priorities i didnt want to take the time i went straight to the washington office of the gateway corp who went to the secretary of defense who squeezed space for me out of a hospital plane leaving boiling in twentyfive minutes and i made it the flight was three hours and i was in suspended animation all the way there were no comm facilities for passengers in the plane i didnt even want them i just wanted to get there when my mother died and left me it hurt but i was poor and confused and used to hurting when the love of my life or at any rate the woman who seemed to come to be the love of my life after she was safely gone also left mewithout quite dying because she was stuck in some awful astrophysical anomaly and far out of reach foreverthat also hurt but i was hurting all over anyway then i wasnt used to happiness hadnt formed the habit of it there is a carnot law to pain it is measured not by absolutes but the difference between source and ambience and my ambience had been too safe and too pleasurable for too long to equip me for this i was in shock mesa general was a lowrise dug into the desert outside tucson all you could see as we came up to it were the solar installations on the roof but under them were six subterranean floors of hospital rooms labs and operating theaters they were all full tucson is a commuting city and the madness had struck at drive time when i finally got a floor nurse to stop and answer a question what i heard was that essie was still on the heartlung but might be taken off at any moment it was a question of triage the machines might better be used for other patients whose chances were better than hers i am shamed to say how fast conceptions of fairness went out the window when it was my own wife who was on the machines i hunted out a doctors officehe wouldnt be using it for some timekicked out the insurance adjustor who had borrowed his desk and got on the wires i had two senators on the line at once before harriet broke in with a report from our medical program essies pulse had begun to respond they now thought her chances were good enough to justify giving her the additional chance of staying on the machines for a while of course full medical helped but the waiting room outside had all its benches full of people waiting for treatment and i could see from the neckbands that some of them were full medical too the hospital was simply swamped i could not get in to see her intensive care was no visitors and no visitors meant not even me there was a tucson city policeman at the door forcing himself to stay awake after a very long hard day and feeling mean i fiddled with the absent doctors desk set until i found a closedcircuit line that looked into intensive care and i just left it on i couldnt see how well essie was doing i couldnt even tell for sure which mummy she was but i kept looking at it harriet called in from time to time to pass on little news items she didnt bother with messages of sympathy and concern there were plenty of those but essie had written me a robinette broadhead program to deal with social timewasters and harriet gave callers an image and a worried smile and a thank you without bothering to cut me in to the circuit essie had been very good at that kind of programming past tense when i realized i was thinking of a pasttense essie is when i felt really bad after an hour a gray lady found me and gave me bouillon and crackers and a little later i spent fortyfive minutes in line for the public mens room and that was about all the diversion i had on the third floor of mesa general until at last a candystriper poked her head in the door and said senor broadead por favor the cop was still at the door of intensive care fanning himself with his sweaty stetson to stay awake but with the candystriper leading me firmly by the hand he did not interfere essie was under a positivepressure bubble there was a transparent patch just at her face so that i could see a tube coming out of her nostril and a wad of bandaging over the left side of her face her eyes were closed they had bundled her dirtygold hair into a net she was not conscious two minutes was all they allowed and that wasnt enough time for anything not enough even to figure out what all the lumpy bulky objects under the translucent part of her bubble were all about not enough at all for essie to sit up and talk to me or to change expression or even to have one in the hall outside her doctor gave me sixty seconds he was a short potbellied old black man wearing blueeyed contact lenses and he looked at a piece of paper to see who it was he was talking to oh yes mr blackhead he said your wife is receiving the best of care she is responding to treatment there is some chance she will be conscious for a short time toward evening i didnt bother to correct him about the name and picked the three top questions on the list will she be in pain what happened to her is there anything she needsi mean anything he sighed and rubbed his eyes evidently the contacts had been in too long pain we can take care of and shes already on full medical i understand you are an important man mr brackett but there is nothing for you to do tomorrow or the next day maybe therell be something shell need today no her whole left side was crushed when the bus folded in on her she was bent almost double and stayed that way for six or seven hours until somebody got to her i didnt know i had made a sound but the doctor heard something a little sympathy came through the contact lenses as he peered up at me that was actually to her advantage you know it probably saved her life being squeezed was as good as compression pads otherwise she would have bled to death he blinked down at the scrap of paper in his hand um shes going to need let me see a new hip joint splints to replace two ribs eight ten fourteenmaybe twenty square inches of new skin and theres considerable tissue loss to the left kidney i think well want a transplant if theres anything at all nothing at all mr blackeu he said folding up the paper nothing now go away please come back after six if you want to and you may be able to talk to her for a minute but right now we need the space youre taking up harriet had already arranged for the hotel to move essies things out of her room and into a penthouse suite and she had even ordered and had delivered toilet stuff and a couple of changes of clothing i holed up there i didnt want to go out i didnt enjoy seeing the cheerful tipplers in the lobby bar or the streets full of people who had got safely through the fever and wanted to tell each other what a close thing it had been for them i made myself eat then i made myself sleep i succeeded in that much but not in staying asleep very long i took a long hot whirly bath and played some music for background it was actually quite a nice hotel but when they went from stravinsky to carl orff that lusty horny catullus poetry made me think about the last time i had played it with my lusty horny and at the moment seriously brokenup wife turn it off i snapped and evervigilant harriet stopped it in midshriek do you want to receive messages robin she inquired froth the same audio speaker i dried myself carefully and then said in a minute i might as well dried brushed in clean clothes i sat down in front of the hotels comm system they werent quite nice enough to give their guests full holo but harriet looked familiar enough as she peered at me out of a flatplate display she reassured me about essie she was continuously monitoring and everything was going well enoughnot far enough of course but not badly essies own real fleshandblood doctor was in the picture and harriet gave me a taped message from her it translated to dont worry robin or more accurately dont worry quite as much as you think you ought to harriet had a batch of action messages for me to deal with i authorized another halfmillion dollars for firefighting in the food mines instructed morton to get a hearing time with the gateway corp for our man in brasilia told my broker what to sell to give me a little more liquidity as a hedge against unreported fever losses then i let the most interesting programs report in finishing with alberts latest synoptic from the food factory i did all this you understand with great clarity and efficiency i had accepted the fact that essies chances of survival were measurably improving all the time so i didnt need to spare any energy for grief and i had not entirely allowed myself to understand how many gobbets of flesh and bone had been gouged out of my loves lovely body and that saved me all sorts of expenditures for emotions i did not want to explore there was a time when i went through several long years of shrinkery in the course of which i found out a lot of places inside my head that i didnt much like having there thats okay once you take them out and look at themwell theyre pretty bad but at least theyre outside now not still inside and poisoning your system my old psychiatric program sigfrid von shrink said it was like moving your bowels he was right far as he wentone of the things i found unlikeable about sigfrid was that he was infuriatingly reliably right all too much of the time what he didnt say was that you never got finished moving your bowels i kept coming up with new excreta and you know no matter how much of it you encounter you never get to liking it i turned harriet off except for standby in case of something urgent and watched some piezovision comedies for a while i made myself a drink out of the suites adequate wet bar and then i made another i wasnt watching the pv and i wasnt enjoying the drink what i was doing was encountering another great glob of fecal matter coming out of my head my dearest beloved wife was lying all beaten and broken in intensive care and i was thinking about somebody else i turned off the tapdancers and called for albert einstein he popped onto the plate his white hair flying and his old pipe in his hand what can i do for you robin he beamed i want you to talk to me about black holes i said sure thing robin but weve been over this a goad many times you know fuck off albert just do it and i dont mean in mathematics i just want you to explain them as simply as you can one of these days i would have to get essie to rewrite alberts program a little less idiosyncratically sure thing robin he said cheerfully ignoring my temper he wrinkled his furry eyebrows ahha he said uhhuh well lets see is that a hard question for you i asked more surprised than sarcastic of course not robin i was just thinking how far back i should start well lets start with light you know that light is made up of particles called photons it has mass and it exerts pressure not that far back albert please all right but the way a black hole begins starts with a failure of light pressure take a big stara blue classo say ten times as massive as the sun burns up its nuclear fuel so fast that it only lives about a billion years what keeps it from collapsing is the radiation pressurecall it the light pressurefrom the nuclear reaction of hydrogen fusing into helium inside it but then it runs out of hydrogen pressure stops it collapses it does so very very fast robin maybe in only a matter of hours and a star that used to be millions of kilometers in diameter is all of a sudden only thirty kilometers have you got that part robin i think so get on with it well he said lighting his pipe and taking a couple of puffsi cant help wondering if he enjoys itthats one of the ways black holes get started the classical way you might call it keep that in mind and now go on to the next part escape velocity i know what escape velocity is sure thing robin he nodded an old gateway prospector like you well when you were on gateway suppose you threw a rock straight up from the surface it would probably come back because even an asteroid has some gravity but if you could throw it fast enoughmaybe forty or fifty kilometers an hourit wouldnt come back it would reach escape velocity and just fly away forever on the moon youd have to throw it a lot faster still say two or three kilometers a second on the earth faster than thatbetter than eleven kilometers a second now he said reaching forward to tap coals out of his pipe and light it again if you tap tap if you were on the surface of some object that has a very very high surface gravity the condition would be worse suppose the gravity were such that the escape velocity were up real high say around three hundred and ten thousand kilometers a second you couldnt throw a rock that fast even light doesnt quite go that fast so even light puff puff cant escape because its velocity is ten thousand kilometers a second too slow and as we know if light cant escape then nothing can escape thats einstein if i may be excused the vanity he actually winked at me over his pipe so thats a black hole its black because it cant radiate at all i said what about a heechee spaceship they go faster than light albert grinned ruefully got me there robin but we dont know how they go faster than light maybe a heechee can get out of a black hole who knows but we dont have any evidence of one of them ever doing it i thought that over for a moment yet i said well yes robin he agreed the problem of going faster than light and the problem of escaping from a black hole are essentially the same problem he paused a long pause then apologetically i guess thats about all we can profitably say on that subject right now i got up and refreshed my drink leaving him sitting there patiently puffing his pipe sometimes it was hard to remember that there was really nothing there nothing but a few interference patterns of collimated light backed up by some tons of metal and plastic albert i said tell me something you computers are supposed to be lightningfast why is it that you take so long to answer sometimes just dramatic effect well bob sometimes it is he said after a moment like that time but i am not sure you understand how difficult it is for me to chat if you want information about say black holes i have no trouble producing it for you six million bits a second if you like but to put it in terms you can understand above all to put it in the form of conversation involves more than accessing the storage i have to do wordsearches through literature and taped conversations i have to map analogies and metaphors against your own mindsets i have to meet such strictures as are imposed by your defined normatives for my behavior and by relevance to the tone of the particular chat taint easy robin youre smarter than you look albert i said he tapped his pipe out and looked up at me under his shaggy white mop would you mind bob if i said so are you i let him go saying youre a good old machine albert i stretched out on the jellybed couch half asleep with my drink in my hand at least he had taken my mind off essie for a while but there was a nagging question in my mind somewhere sometime i had said the same thing to some other program and i couldnt remember when harriet woke me up to say that there was an inperson call from our doctornot the program but the real live wilma liederman md who came to see us to make sure the machines were doing things right every once in a while robin she said i think essies out of danger thatsmarvelous i said wishing i had saved words like marvelous for when i really meant them because they didnt do justice to the way i felt our program had already accessed the mesa general circuits of course wilma knew as much about her condition as the little black man i had talked toand of course had pumped all of essies medical history back into the mesa general store wilma offered to fly out herself if we wanted her to i told her she was the doctor not me and she told me that she would get a columbia classmate of hers in tucson to look in on essie instead but dont go to see her tonight robin she said talk to her on the phone if you want toi prescribe itbut dont tire her out by tomorrowwell i think shell be stronger so i called essie and talked to her for three minutesshe was groggy but she knew what was happening and then i let myself go back to sleep and just as i was dropping off i remembered that albert had called me bob there was another program that i had been on friendly terms with a long time ago that sometimes called me robin and sometimes bob and even bobby i hadnt talked to that particular program in quite a while because i hadnt felt the need of it but maybe i was beginning to full medical iswell its full medical its everything if theres a way to keep you healthy and especially to keep you alive youve got it and there are lots of ways full medical runs to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year not too many people can afford itsomething under one tenth of one percent even in the developed countries but it buys a lot right after lunch the next day it bought me essie wilma said it was all right and so did everybody else the city of tucson had recovered enough for that sort of thing the city had got over the emergency aspects of the fever its structures were back to business as usual meaning that they once again had time to deliver what people paid for so at noon a private ambulance trucked in bed heartlung machine dialysis pack and peripherals at twelvethirty a team of nurses moved into the suite across the hail and at a quarter after two i rode up in the freight elevator with six cubic meters of hardware in the heart of which was the heart of me namely my wife among the other things full medical bought were a trickle of painkillers and moodmediators corticosteroids to speed healing and moderators to keep the corticosteroids from spoiling her cells four hundred kilograms of plumbing under the framework of the bed to monitor all of what essie did and to intervene to help her do it when she couldnt just transferring her from the travel machine to the one in the master bedroom took an hour and a half with wilmas classmate supervising a team of interns and orderlies they threw me out while that was going on and i drank a couple of cups of coffee down in the hotel lobby watching the teardropshaped elevators climb up and down the interior walls when i figured i was allowed back i met the doctor from the hospital in the hail he had managed to get a little sleep and he was wearing granny glasses instead of the contacts dont tire her out he said im getting tired of hearing that he grinned and invited himself to share a third cup of coffee with me he turned out to be quite a nice guy as well as the best short basketball center tempe had ever had when he was an arizona state undergraduate there is something i like about a man of a hundred and sixty centimeters who goes out for the basketball team and we parted friends that was the most reassuring thing of all he wouldnt have let that happen if he hadnt been pretty sure essie was going to make it i did not then appreciate how much making it she was going to have to do she was still under the positivepressure bubble and that spared me from seeing quite how used up she looked the dayduty nurse retreated to the sitting room after telling me not to get essie too tired and we talked for a while we didnt say anything really s ya is not your talkative type person she asked me what the news was from the food factory and when i had given her a thirtysecond synoptic on that she asked what the news was about the fever by the time i had given her four or five thousandword answers to her onesentence questions it began to dawn on me that talking was really quite a strain and that i shouldnt tire her out but she was talking and even talking coherently and did not seem worried and so i went back to my console and to work there was the usual raft of reports to get through and decisions to make when that was done i listened to alberts latest reports from the food factory for a while and then realized it was time for me to go to sleep i lay in bed for quite a while i wasnt restless i wasnt exhausted i was just letting the tensions drain out of me in the sitting room i could hear the night nurse moving around on the other side from essies room came the constant faint sigh and hum and gurgle of the machines that were keeping my wife alive the world had got well ahead of me i was not taking it all in i had not yet quite understood that fortyeight hours before essie had been dead kaput xed no longer alive if it hadnt been for full medical and a lot of luck i would along about now have been selecting the clothes to wear to her funeral and inside my head there was a small minority of cells of the brain that understood that fact and was thinking well you know maybe it just might have been tidier all around if she hadnt been brought back to life this had nothing to do with the fact that i loved essie loved her a lot wished her nothing but well had gone into shock when i heard she was hurt the minority party in my brain spoke only for itself every time the question came up a thundering majority voted for loving essie whenever polled however asked i have never been entirely sure what the word love means especially when applied to myself just before i fell asleep i thought for a moment of dialing albert up and asking him to explain it but i didnt albert was the wrong program to ask and i didnt want to start up with the right one the synoptics kept coming in and i watched the unfolding story of the food factory and i felt like an anachronism a couple of centuries ago the worldgirdlers of england and spain operated at a remove of a month or two from the action fronts no cable no satellites their orders went out on sailing ships and replies came back when they could i wished i could share their skills the fifty days of roundtrip time between us and the herterhalls seemed like forever here was i at ghent and there were they andy jackson pounding the pee out of the british at new orleans weeks after the war was over of course i had sent out instant orders on how they were to conduct themselves what questions they were to ask of the boy wan what attempts they were to make to divert the food factory from its course and five thousand astronomical units away they were doing what occurred to them to do and by the time my orders arrived all the questions would be moot as essie mended so did my spirits her heart pumped by itself her lungs kept her in air they took the positivepressure bubble off her and i could touch her and kiss her cheek and she was taking an interest in what went on had been all along when i said it was too bad shed missed her conference she grinned up at me au on tape dear robin have been playing it back when you were busy but you couldnt give your own paper you think why not i wrote robinette broadhead program for you did you not know i also wrote one for me conference moved in full holographics and s ya lavorovnabroadhead projection gave complete text to considerable approval even handled questions she boasted by borrowing your albert program in drag well shes an astonishing person as i have always known the trouble is that i expect her to be astonishing and when i talked to her doctor he brought me down he was on the hop between the suite and mesa general and i asked him if i could bring her home he hesitated peering up at me through the blue contacts yes probably he said but im not sure you understand how serious her injuries are mr broadhead all thats happening now is that shes building up some reserves of strength shes going to need them well i know that doe therell have to be another operation no not one mr broadhead i think your wife will spend most of the next couple of months in surgery and convalescence and i dont want you assuming that the results are a foregone conclusion he lectured theres a risk to every procedure and shes up against some hairy ones cherish her mr broadhead we reanimated her after one cardiac arrest i dont guarantee itll happen every time so i went in to see essie in somewhat chastened mood to get on with the cherishing the nurse was standing by her bed and both of them were watching essies tapes of the computer conference on her flatplate viewer since essies plate was slaved to the big fullholographic interactive one i had had moved into my room there was a little yellow attention light in the come meant for me harriet had something she wanted to tell me about it could wait when the light began to pulse and brighten and turn to red was when it got important and at the moment essie was at the top of my priorities you can leave us for a while alma essie said the nurse looked at me and shrugged whynot so i took the chair next to the bed and reached for essies hand its nice to be able to touch you again i said essie has a coarse deep chuckle i was glad to hear it touch more in a couple weeks she said meanwhile no rule against kissing so of course i kissed herhard enough so that something must have registered on her telltales because the day nurse popped her head in the door to see what was going on she didnt stop us though we stopped ourselves essie reached up with her right handthe left was still in its cast covering god knew whatand pushed her streaky darkblonde hair away from her eyes very nice she judged do you want to see what harriet has to say not particularly untrue she said you have been talking to dr ben i see and he has told you to be sweet to me but you always are robin only not everybody would notice she grinned at me and turned her head to the plate harriet she called robin is here i had not until that moment known that my secretary program would respond to my wifes commands as well as my own but i hadnt known she could borrow my science program either especially without my knowing about it when harriets cheerful and concerned face filled the screen i told her if its business ill take it laterunless it cant wait oh no nothing like that harriet said but alberts desperate to talk to you hes got some good stuff from the food factory ill take it in the other room i started but essie put her free hand on mine no here robin im interested too so i told harriet to go ahead and alberts voice came on but not alberts face take a look at this albert said and the screen filled with a sort of american gothic family portrait a man and a womannot reallya male and a female standing side by side they had faces and arms and legs and the female had breasts both had skungy beards and long hair pulled into braids and they were wearing wraparound garments like saris with dots of color brightening the drab cloth i caught my breath the pictures had taken me by surprise albert appeared in the lower corner of the plate these are not real robin he said they are simply compositions generated by the shipboard computer from wans description the boy says they are pretty accurate though i swallowed and glanced at essie i had to control my breathing before i could ask are theseare these what the heechee look like he frowned and chewed on his pipe stem the figures on the screen rotated solemnly as though they were doing a slow folkdance so that we could see all sides there are some anomalies robin for example there is the famous question of the heechee ass we have some heechee furniture eg the seats before the control panels in their ships from these it was deduced that the heechee bottom was not as the human bottom because there seems to be room for a large pendulant structure perhaps a divided body like a wasps hanging below the pelvis and between the legs there is nothing of this sort in the computergenerated image butoccams razor robin if i just give you time youll explain that i commented sure thing robin but its a law of logic that i think you know in the absence of evidence it is best to take the simplest theory we know of only two intelligent races in the history of the universe these people do not seem to belong to oursthe shape of the skull and particularly the jaw is different there is a triangular arcade more like an apes than a human beings and the teeth are quite anomalous therefore it is probable that they belong to the other is somewhat scary essie offered softly and it was especially to me since you might say that it was my responsibility i was the one who had ordered the herterhall bunch to go out and look around and if they found the heechee in the process i was not ready to think of what that might mean what about the dead men do you have anything on them sure thing robin he said nodding his dustmop head look at this the pictures winked away and text rolled up the screen mission report vessel voyage d crew a meacham d filgren h meacham mission was science experiment crew limited to allow instrumentation and computational equipment maximum lifesupport time estimated days vessel still unreported day presumed lost it was only a fifty thousand dollar bonusnot much but it was one of the earliest from gateway albert said over the text the one called h meacham appears to be the dead man wan calls henrietta she was a sort of abd astrophysicistyou know robin all but dissertation she blew that when she tried to defend it they said it was more psychology than physics so she went to gateway the pilots first name was doris which checks and the other person was henriettas husband arnold so youve identified one of them they were really real sure thing robinpoint nine nine sure anyway these dead men are sometimes nonrational he complained reappearing on the plate and of course we have had no opportunity for direct interrogation the shipboard computer is not really up to this kind of task but apart from the confirmation of names the mission seems appropriate it was an astrophysical investigation and henriettas conversation includes repeated references to astrophysical subjects once you subtract the sexual ones i mean he twinkled scratching his cheek with his pipestem for example sagittarius a westa radio source at the center of the galaxy ngc nag a giant elliptical galaxy part of a large cluster average radial velocity of globular clustersin our own galaxy that comes to about kilometers per second highredshift osos you dont have to list them all i said hastily do you know what they all mean i mean if you were talking about all those things what would you be talking about pausebut a short one he was not accessing all the literature on the subject he had already done that cosmology he said specifically i think i would be talking about the classic hoyleopikgamow controversy that is whether the universe is closed or open ended or cyclical whether it is in a steady state or began with a big bang he paused again but this time it was to let me think i did but not to much effect there doesnt seem to be much nourishment in that i said perhaps not rabin it does sort of tie in with your questions about black holes though well damn your calculating heart i thought but did not say he looked innocent as a lamb puffing away on his old pipe calm and serious thatll be all for now i ordered and kept my eyes on the blank screen long after he had disappeared in case essie was going to ask me about why i had been inquiring about black holes well she didnt she just lay back looking at the mirrors on the ceiling after a while she said dear robin know what i wish i was ready for it what essie wish i could scratch all i could manage to say was oh i felt deflatedno plugged up i was all ready to defend myselfwith all gentle care of course because of essies condition and i didnt have to i picked up her hand i was worried about you i offered yes so was i she said practically tell me robin is true that the fevers are from some sort of heechee mindray something like that i suppose albert says its electromagnetic but thats all i know i stroked the veins on the back of her hand and she moved restlessly but only from the neck up i am apprehensive about heechee robin she said thats very sensible even temperate me im scared shitless and as a matter of fact i was in fact i was trembling the little yellow light winked on at the corner of the screen somebody wants to talk to you robin they can wait im talking to the woman i love right now thank you robin if you are scared of heechee as i am how is it that you go right ahead well honey what choice do i have theres fifty days of dead time what we just heard is ancient history twentyfive days old if i told them to break off and go home right now it would be twentyfive days before they heard it surely yes but if you could stop would you i didnt answer i was feeling very strangea little frightened a lot unlike myself what if heechee dont like us robin she asked and what a good question that was i had been asking it of myself ever since the first day i considered getting into a gateway prospecting ship and setting out to explore for myself what if we meet the heechee and they dont like us what if they squash us like flies torture us enslave us experiment on us what if they simply ignore us with my eyes on the yellow dot which was beginning to pulse slowly i said mothering her well theres not much chance that they will actually do us any harm i do not need soothing robin she was distinctly edgy and so was i something must have been showing up on her monitors because the day nurse looked in again hovered indecisively in the doorway and went away i said essie the stakes are too big remember last year in calcutta we had gone to one of her seminars and had cut it short because we couldnt bear the sight of the abject city of two hundred million paupers her eyes were on me and she was frowning yes i know starvation there has always been starvation robin not like this not like what it will be before very long if something doesnt happen to prevent it the world is bursting at the seams albert says i hesitated i didnt actually want to tell her what albert said siberia was already out of food production its fragile land looking like the gobi because of overpressure the topsoil in the american midwest was down to scant inches and even the food mines were straining to keep up with demand what albert said was that we had maybe ten years the signal light had gone to red and was winking rapidly but i didnt want to interrupt myself essie i said if we can make the food factory work we can bring chonfood to all the starving people and that means no more starvation ever thats only the beginning if we can figure out how to build heechee ships for ourselves and make them go where we like then we can colonize new planets lots of them more than that with heechee technology we can take all the asteroids in the solar system and turn them into gateways build space habitats terraform planets we can make a paradise for a million times the population of the earth for the next million years i stopped because i realized i was babbling i felt sad and delirious worried andlustful and from the expression on essies face she was feeling something strange too those are very good reasons robin she began and that was as far as she got the signal light was bright ruby red and vibrating like a pulsar and then it winked away and albert einsteins worried face appeared on the screen i had never known him to appear without being invited before robin he cried there is another emanation of the fever i stood up shaking but it isnt time i objected stupidly it has happened robin and it is rather strange it peaked let me see just under one hundred seconds ago i believe yes he nodded seeming to listen to an inaudible voice it is dying away and as a matter of fact i was already feeling less strange no attack had ever been so short and no other had quite felt like that apparently somebody else was experimenting with the couch albert i said send a priority message to the food factory desist immediately repeat immediately from any further use of the couch for any purpose dismantle it if possible without irreversible damage you will forfeit all pay and bonuses if there is any further breach of this directive got it its already on its way robin he said and disappeared essie and i looked at each other for a moment but you did not tell them to abandon the expedition and come back she said at last i shrugged it doesnt change anything i said no she agreed and you have given me some really very good reasons robin but are they your reasons i didnt answer i knew what essie thought were my reasons for pushing on into the exploration of heechee space regardless of fevers or costs or risks she thought my reasons had a name and the name was gellekiara moynlin and i sometimes was not sure she was wrong heechee heaven wherever lurvy moved in the ship she was always conscious of the mottled gray pattern in the viewplate it showed nothing she could recognize but it was a nothing she had seen before for months on end while they were traveling faster than light on the way to heechee heaven they were alone the universe was empty around them except for that pebbly shifting gray they were the universe even on the long climb to the food factory it had not been this solitary at least there were stars even planets in tau space or whatever crazy kind of space heechee ships drove through or tunneled under or sidestepped around there was nothing last times lurvy had been in that much emptiness had been in her gateway missions and they were not sweet memories at all this ship was far the biggest she had ever seen gateways largest held five people this could have housed twenty or more it contained eight separate compartments three were cargo filled automatically with the output of the food factory while the ship was docked there two seemed to be staterooms but not for human beings if the bunks that rolled out from the walls were bunks indeed they were too tiny for human adults one of the rooms wan identified as his own which he invited janine to share when lurvy vetoed the notion he gave in sulkily and so they roomed in segregated style boys in one chamber girls in the other the largest room located in the mathematical center of the ship was shaped like a cylinder with tapered ends it had neither floor nor ceiling except that three seats were fixed to the surface facing the controls as the surface was curved the seats leaned toward each other they were simple enough of the design lurvy had lived with for months at a time two flat metal slabs joined together in a vee on gateway ships we stretched webbing across them lurvy offered what is webbing asked wan and when it was explained said what a good idea i will do that next trip i can steal some material from the old ones as in all heechee ships the controls themselves were nearly automatic there were a dozen knurled wheels in a row with colored lights for each wheel as the wheels were turned the lights changed color and intensity and developed bands of light and dark like spectrum lines they represented course settings not even wan could read them much less lurvy or the others but since lurvys time on gateway at great expense in prospectors lives the big brains had accumulated a considerable store of data some colors meant a good chance of something worthwhile some referred to the length of the trip the course director was set for somemany were filed away as nonos because every ship that had entered fasterthanlight space with those settings had stayed there or somewhere had at least never returned to gateway out of habit and orders lurvy photographed every fluctuation of control lights and viewscreen even when the screen showed nothing she could recognize as worth photographing an hour after the group left the food factory the star patterns began to shrink together to a winking point of brightness they had reached the speed of light and then even the point was gone the screen took on the appearance of gray mud that raindrops had spattered and stayed that way to wan of course the ship was only his familiar schoolbus used for commuting back and forth since he was old enough to squeeze the launch teat paul had never been in a real heechee ship before and was subdued for days neither had janine but one more marvel was nothing unusual in her fourteenyearold life for lurvy something else it was a bigger version of the ships in which she had earned her out banglesand precious little elseand therefore frightening she could not help it she could not convince herself that this trip at least was a regular shuttle run she had learned too much fear blundering into the unknown as a gateway pilot she pushed herself around its vastcomparatively vastspace and worried it was not only the muddy viewscreen that kept her attention there was the shiny golden lozenge bigger than a man that was thought to contain the ftl drive machinery and was known to explode totally if opened there was the crystal glassy spiral that got hot from time to time and lit up with tiny hot flecks of radiance at the beginning and end of each trip and at one other very important time it was that time that lurvy was watching for and when exactly twentyfour days five hours and fiftysix minutes after they left the food factory the golden coil flickered and began to light she could not help a great sigh of relief whats the matter wan shrilled suspiciously just that were halfway now she said noting the time in her log thats the turnaround point thats what you look for in a gateway ship if you reach the halfway point with only a quarter of your lifesupport gone you know you wont run out and starve on the way home wan pouted dont you trust me lurvy we will not starve it feels good to know for sure she grinned and then lost the grin because she was thinking about what was at the end of the trip so they rubbed along together the best way they could getting on each others nerves a thousand times apiece a day paul taught wan to play chess to keep his mind off janine wan patientlymore often impatientlyrehearsed again and again everything he could tell them about heechee heaven and its occupants they slept as much as they could in the restraining net next to paul wans teenaged juices bubbled and flowed he tossed and turned in the random tiny accelerations of the ship wishing he were alone so that he could do those things that appeared to be prohibited when one was not aloneor wishing he were not alone but with janine so that he could do those even better things tiny jim and henrietta had described to him he had asked henrietta any number of times what the female role was in this conjugation to this she always responded even when she would not talk about anything else but almost never in a way that was helpful to wan however her sentences began they almost always ended by returning tearfully to the subject of her terrible betrayals by her husband and that floozy doris he did not know even in just what physical ways the female departed from the male pictures and words did not do it toward the end of the trip curiosity overpowered acculturation and he begged janine or lurvy either one to let him see for himself even without touching why you filthy beast said janine diagnostically she was not angry she was smiling bide your time boy youll get your chances but lurvy was not amused and when wan had gone disconsolately away she and her sister had for them a long talk as long as janine would tolerate lurvy dear she said at last i know i know im only fifteenwell almostand wans not much older i know that i dont want to get pregnant four years away from a doctor and with all kinds of things coming up that we dont know how well deal withi know all that you think im just your snotty kid sister well i am but im your smart snotty kid sister when you say something worth listening to i listen so piss off dear lurvy smiling comfortably she pushed herself away after wan and then stopped and returned to kiss lurvy you and pop she said you both drive me straight up the wall but i love you both a lotand paul too it was not altogether wans fault lurvy knew they were all smelling extremely high among all their sweats and secretions were pheromones enough to make a monk horny much less an impressionable virgin kid and that was not at all wans fault in fact exactly the reverse if he had not insisted they would not have lugged so much water aboard if they had not they would be even filthier and sweatier than their rationed sponge baths left them they had when you came right down to it left the food factory far too impulsively payter had been right astonishingly lurvy realized that she actually missed the old man in the ship they were wholly cut off from communication of any kind what was he doing was he still well they had had to take the mobile bioassay unitthey had only one and four people needed it more than one but that was not really true either because away from the shipboard computer it was balled into a shiny motionless mass and would stay that way until they established radio contact with vera from heechee heavenand meanwhile what was happening to her father the curious thing was that lurvy loved the old man and thought that he loved her back he had given every sign of it but verbal ones it was his money and ambition that had put them all on the flight to the food factory in the first place buying them participants shares by scraping the bottom of the money if not of the ambition it had been his money that had paid for her going to gateway in the first place and when the gamble went sour he had not reproached her or not directly and not much after six weeks in wans ship lurvy began to feel adjusted to it she even felt fairly comfortable not counting the smells and irritations and worries at least as long as she didnt think too much about the trips that had earned her her five out bangles from gateway there was very little good to remember in any of them lurvys first trip had been a washout fourteen months of roundtrip travel to come out circling a planet that had been flamed clean in a nova eruption maybe something had been there once nothing was there when lurvy arrived stark solitary and already talking to herself in her oneperson ship that had cured her of single flights and the next was in a three no better none of them any better she became famous in gateway an object of curiositystrong contender for the record of most flights taken and fewest profits returned it was not an honor she liked but it was never as bad until the last flight of all that was disaster before they even reached their destination she had awakened out of an edgy restless sleep to horror the woman she had made her special friend was floating bloodily next to her the other woman also dead not far away and the two men who made up the rest of the fives crew engaged in screaming mutilating handtohand battle the rules of the gateway corporation provided that any payments resulting from a voyage were to be divided equally among the survivors her shipmate stratos kristianides had made up his mind to be the only survivor in actuality he didnt survive he lost the battle to her other shipmate and lover hector possanbee the winner with lurvy went on to findagainnothing smoldering red gas giant pitiful little binary classm companion star and no way of reaching the only detectable planet a huge methanecovered jupiter of a thing without dying in the attempt lurvy had come back to earth after that with her tail between her legs and no second chance in sight payter had given her that opportunity and she did not think there would be another the hundred and some thousand dollars it had cost him to pay her way to gateway had put a very big dent in the money he had accumulated over his sixty or seventy yearsshe didnt really know how many yearsof life she had failed him not just him and she accepted out of his kindness and forbearance to hate her the fact that he really did love his daughterand kind pointless paul and silly young janine too in some way payter loved them all and was getting very little out of it lurvy judged she rubbed her out bangles moodily they had been very expensive to obtain she was not easy in her mind about her father or about what lay ahead making love to paul helped pass the timewhen they could convince themselves that they didnt have to supervise the younger ones for a quarter of an hour or so it was not the same for lurvy as making love to hector the man who had survived the last gateway flight with her the man who had asked her to marry him the man who asked her to ship out with him again and to build a life together short broad always active always alert a dynamo in bed kind and patient when she was sick or irritable or scaredthere were a hundred reasons why she should have married hector and only one really why she did not when she was wrenched out of that terrible sleep she had found hector and stratos battling while she watched stratos died hector had explained to her that stratos had gone out of control to try to slay them all but she had been asleep when the slaughter started one of the men had obviously tried to murder his shipmates but she had never known for sure which one he proposed to her when things were bleakest and grimiest a day before they reached gateway on the sorry return trip we are really most delightfully good together dorema he said arms about her consolingly just us and no one else i think i could not have borne this with the others around next time we will be more fortunate so lets get married please she burrowed her chin into his hard warm cocoacolored shoulder ill have to think dear she said feeling the hand that had killed stratos kneading the back of her neck so lurvy was not unhappy when the trip was over and janine called her out of her private room all thrilled and excited the great glassy spiral was filling with hot specks of darting golden light the ship was lurching tentatively in one direction and another the mottled gray mud was gone from the viewscreen and there were stars more than stars there was an object that glowed blue in patches amid featureless gray it was lemonshaped and spun slowly and lurvy could form no idea of its size until she perceived that the surface of the object was not featureless there were tiny projections jutting out here and there and she recognized the tiniest of them as gatewaytype ships ones and threes and there a five the lemon had to be more than a kilometer long wan grinning with pride settled himself in the central pilot seat and grasped the lander control levers it was all lurvy could do to keep her hands off but wan had been performing this particular maneuver all his life with coarse competence he banged and slammed the ship into a downward spiral that matched the slow spin of the blueeyed gray lemon intersected one of the waiting pits docked locked and looked up for applause they were on heechee heaven the food factory had been the size of a skyscraper but this was a world perhaps like gateway it had once been an asteroid but if so it had been so tooled and sculpted that there was no trace of original structure it was cubic kilometers of mass it was a rotating mountain so much to explore so much to learn and so much to fear they skulked or strutted through the old halls and lurvy realized she was clinging to her husbands hand and paul was clinging back she forced herself to observe and comment the sides of the walls were veined with luminous tracing of scarlet the overhead was the familiar blue heecheemetal glow on the floorand it was really a floor they had weight here though not more than a tenth of earthnormal diamondshaped mounds contained what looked like soil and grew plants berryfruit said wan proudly over his shoulder shrugging toward a waisthigh bush with fuzzed objects hanging among its emerald leaves we can stop and eat some if you like not right now said lurvy a dozen paces farther along the corridor was another planted lozenge this one with slategreen tendrils and soft squashed cauliflowershaped buds whats that he paused and looked at her it was clear he thought it was a silly question they are not good to eat he shrilled scornfully try the berryfruit they are quite tasty so the party paused where two of the redlined corridors came together and one of them changed to blue they peeled browngreen furry skins from the berryfruit and nibbled at the juicy insidesfirst tentatively then with pleasurewhile wan explained the geography of heechee heaven these were the red sections and they were the best to be in there was food here and good places to sleep and the ship was here and here the old ones never came but didnt they sometimes wander out of their usual places to pick the berryfruit yes of course they did but never here it had never happened over there the blue his voice sank in volume as well as pitch the old ones came there quite often or to some parts of the blue but it was all dead if it were not that the dead mens room was in the blue he would never go there and lurvy peering down the corridor he pointed to felt a chill of incredible age it had the look of a stonehenge or gizeh or angkor wat even the ceilings were dimmer and the plantings there were sparse and puny the green he went on was all very well but it was not working properly the water jets did not function the plantings died and the gold his pleasure faded when he talked about the gold that was where the old ones lived if it were not for needing books and sometimes clothes he would never go to the gold though the dead men were always urging him to he did not want to see the old ones paul cleared his throat to say but i think we have to do that wan why the boy shrilled they are not interesting lurvy put her hand on his arm whats the matter wan she asked kindly observing his expression what wan felt always showed on his face he had never had the need to develop the skills of dissembling he looks scared paul commented he is not scared wan retorted you do not understand this place it is not interesting to go to the gold wan dear lurvy said the thing is its worth taking chances to find out more about the heechee i dont know if i can explain what it means to us but the least part of it is that we would get money for it a lot of money he doesnt know what money is paul interrupted impatiently wan pay attention we are going to do this tell us how the four of us can safely explore the gold corridors the four of us can not one person can i can he boasted he was angry now and showed it paul wans feelings about him were mixed but most of the mixture were unfavorable speaking to wan paul shaped his words so carefullyso contemptuously as though he did not think wan were smart enough to understand when wan and janine were together paul was always near if paul was a sample of human males wan was not proud to be one i have gone to the gold many times he boasted for books or for berryfruit or just to watch the silly things they do they are so funny but they are not entirely stupid you know i can go there safely one person can perhaps two people can but if we all go they will surely see us and then lurvy asked wan shrugged defensively he didnt really know the answer to that only that it had frightened his father they are not interesting he repeated contradicting himself janine licked her fingers and tossed the empty berryfruit skins to the base of the bush you people she sighed are unreal wan where do these old ones come to the edge of the gold always sometimes into the blue or the green well if they like these berryfruits and if you know a place where they come to pick them why dont we just leave a camera there we can see them they cant see us wan shrilled triumphantly of course you see lurvy it is not necessary to go there janine is right only he hesitated janine what is a camera as they went lurvy had to nerve herself to pass every intersection could not help staring down each corridor but they heard nothing and saw nothing that moved it was as quiet as the food factory when they first set foot in it and just as queer queerer the traceries of light on every wall the patches of growing thingsabove all the terrifying thought that there were heechee alive somewhere near when they had dropped off a camera by a berryfruit bush in a space where green blue and gold came together wan bustled them away directly to the room where the dead men lived that was first priority to get to the radio that would once again put them in touch with the rest of the world even if the rest of the world was only old payter fidgeting resentfully around the food factory if they could not do that much lurvy reasoned they had no business being here at all and they should return to the ship and head for home it was no good exploring if they could not report what they found so wan courage returning in direct proportion to his increasing distance from the old ones marched them through a stretch of green up several levels in blue to a wide blue door let us see if it is working right he said importantly and stepped on a ridge of metal before the door the door hesitated sighed and then creakily opened for them and satisfied wan led them inside this place at least seemed human if strange it even smelled human no doubt because wan had spent so much time there over his short life lurvy took one of the minicameras from paul and settled it on her shoulder the little machine hissed tape past its lens recording an octagonal chamber with three of the forked heechee seats two of them broken and a stained wall bearing the heechee version of instrumentationridges of colored lights there was a tiny sound of clicks and hums barely perceptible behind the wall wan waved at it in there he said is where the dead men live if live is the right word for what they do he tittered lurvy pointed the camera at the seats and the knurled knobs before them then at a domed clawed object under the smeared wall it stood chest high and it was mounted on soft squashed cylinders to roll on whats that wan it is what the dead men catch me with sometimes he muttered they dont use it very often it is very old when it breaks it takes forever to mend itself paul eyed the machine warily and moved away from it turn on your friends wan he ordered of course it is not very difficult wan boasted watch me carefully and you will see how to do it he sat himself with careless ease on the one unbroken seat and frowned at the controls i will bring you tiny jim he decided and thumbed the controls before him the lights on the stained wall flickered and flowed and wan said wake up tiny jim there is someone here for you to meet silence wan scowled glanced over his shoulder at the others and then ordered tiny jim speak to me at once he pursed his lips and spat a gobbet at the wall lurvy recognized the source of the stains but said nothing a weary voice over their heads said hello wan that is better wan shrilled grinning at the others now tiny jim tell my friends something interesting or i will spit on you again i wish you would be more respectful sighed the voice but very well let me see on the ninth planet of the star saiph there is an old civilization their rulers are a class of shithandlers who exercise power by removing the excrement only from the homes of those citizens who are honest industrious clever and unfailing in the payment of their taxes on their principal holiday which they call the feast of st gautama the youngest maiden in each family bathes herself in sunflower oil takes a hazelnut between her teeth and ritually tiny jim wan interrupted is this a true story pause metaphorically it is tiny jim said sullenly you are very foolish wan reproved the dead man and i am shamed before my friends pay attention here are dorema herterhall who you will call lurvy and her sister janine herter and paul say hello to them long pause are there other living human beings here the voice asked doubtfully i have just told you there are another long pause then goodbye wan the voice said sadly and would not speak again no matter how loudly wan commanded or how furiously he spat at the wall christ grumbled paul is he always like that no not always wan shrilled but sometimes he is worse shall i try one of the others for you are they any better well no wan admitted tiny jim is the best paul closed his eyes in despair and opened them again to glare at lurvy how simply bloody wonderful he said do you know what im beginning to think im beginning to think your father was right we should have stayed on the food factory lurvy took a deep breath well we didnt she pointed out were here lets give it fortyeight hours and then and then well make up our minds long before the fortyeight hours were up they had made up their minds to stay at least for a while there was simply too much in heechee heaven to abandon it the big factor in the decision was reaching payter on the ftl radio no one had thought to ask wan if his ability to call heechee heaven from the food factory implied that he could call in the other direction it turned out he could not he had never had a reason to try because there had never been anyone there to answer the phone lurvy drafted janine to help her carry food and a few essentials out of the ship fighting depression and worry all the way and returned to find paul proud and wan jubilant they had made contact how is he lurvy demanded at once oh you mean your father hes all right paul said he sounded grouchy come to think of itcabin fever i suppose there were about a million messages he patched them through as a burst transmission and ive got them on tapebut itll take us a week to play them all he rummaged through the stuff janine and lurvy had brought until he found the tools he had demanded he was patching together a digitalized picture transmitter to make use of the voiceonly ftl circuits we can only transmit single frames he said eyes on the picturetape machine but if were going to be here for very long maybe i can work out a bursttransmission system from here meanwhile weve got voice andoh yeah the old man said to kiss you for him then i guess were going to stay for a while said janine then i guess wed better bring more stuff out of the ship her sister agreed wan where should we sleep so while paul worked on the communications wan and the two women hustled the necessities of life to a cluster of chambers in the redwalled corridors wan was proud to show them off there were wall bunks larger than the ones the ship had offeredlarge enough actually for even paul to sleep in if he didnt mind bending his knees there was a place for toilet facilities not quite of human design or not of very recent human design the facilities were simply lustrous metal slits in the floor like the squattoilets of eastern europe there was even a place to bathe it was something between a wading pool and a tub with something between a shower head and a small waterfall coming out of the wall behind it when you got inside tepid water poured out after that they all began to smell much better wan in particular bathed ostentatiously often sometimes beginning to undress to bathe again before the last drops of unsopped water had dried on the back of his neck from the bath before tiny jim had told him that bathing was a custom among polite people besides he had perceived that janine did it regularly lurvy watched them both remembered how much trouble it had been to get janine to bathe on the long flight up from earth and did not comment as pilot therefore captain lurvy constituted herself head of the expedition she assigned paul to establish and maintain communication with her father on the food factory with wans help in dealing with the dead men she assigned janine with her own help and wans to housekeeping tasks like washing their clothes in the tepid tub she assigned wan with anyone who could be spared to roam the safe parts of heechee heaven photographing and recording for transmission to payter and earth usually wans compaanion was janine when someone else could be spared the two young people were chaperoned but that was seldom janine did not seem to mind either way she had not finished with the preliminary thrill of wans companionship and was in no hurry to move to a further stageexcept when they touched or when she caught him staring at her or when she saw the knotted bulge in his ragged kilt even then her fantasies and reveries were almost as good as that next stage at least for now she played with the dead men and munched on berryfruit brownskinned and greenfleshed and did her chores and waited to grow up a little more there were not many objections to lurvys rule since she had taken care to assign tasks that the draftees were willing to do anyhow which left for herself such drudgery as going through the backedup cormuands and persuasions from payter and faroff earth the communication was a long way from satisfactory lurvy had not appreciated shipboardvera until she had to get along without her she could not command priority messages first or have the computer sort them out by theme there was no computer she could use except the overtaxed one in her own head the messages came in higgledypiggledy and when she replied or transmitted reports for downlink relay to earth she had no confidence at all that they were getting where they were supposed to go the dead men seemed to be basically readonly memories interactive but limited and their circuits had been further scrambled in the makeshift attempt to use them for communication to the food factory a task for which they had never been designed wan blustered and bluffed in his pose as expert and then miserably confessed that they were not doing what they were supposed to do any more sometimes he would dial tiny jim and get henrietta and sometimes a formerenglish lit professor named willard and once he got a voice he had never heard before shaking and whispering on the near side of inaudibility muttering on the far side of madness go to the gold whimpered henrietta fretful as ever and without pause tiny jims thick tenor would override theyll kill you they dont like castaways that was frightening especially as wan assured them that tiny jim had always been the most sensible of the dead men it puzzled lurvy that she was not more terrified than she was but there had been so many alarms and terrors that she had become used to them her circuits were scrambled too and the messages in one fiveminute burst of clear transmission paul had recorded fourteen hours of them commands from downlink report all control settings shuttle ship attempt secure tissue samples heechee old ones freeze and store berryfruit leaves fruits stems exercise extreme caution half a dozen separate communications from her father he was lonesome he didnt feel well he was not receiving proper medical attention because they had taken the mobile bioassay unit away he was being barraged by peremptory orders from earth information messages from earth their first reports had been received analyzed and interpreted for them and now there were suggestions for followup programs beyond counting they should interrogate henrietta about her references to cosmological phenomenashipboardvera was making a hash of it and downlinkvera could not communicate in real time and old payter did not know enough astrophysics to ask the right questions so it was up to them they should interrogate all the dead men on their memories of gateway and their missionsassuming they remembered anything they should attempt to find out how living prospectors became stored computer programs they should they should do everything all at once and almost none of it was possible tissue samples of the heechee forsooth when an occasional message was clear and personal and undemanding lurvy treasured it and some of those were surprises besides the fan letters from janines penpals and the continuing plea for any information they might come across from trish bovers relict there was one for lurvy personally from robinette broadhead dorema i know youre being swamped your whole mission was important and hazardous to begin with and now it turns out about a million times more so all i expect from you is that you do the best you can i dont have the authority to override gateway corp orders i cant change your assigned objectives but i want you to know im on your side find out all you can try not to get into a spot you cant retreat from and ill do everything i can to see that you get rewarded as fully and lavishly as you can hope for i mean it lurvy i give you my word it was a strange message and oddly touching it was also a surprise to lurvy that broadhead even knew her nickname they had not exactly been intimates when she and her family were interviewing for the food factory assignment they had met broadhead several times but the relationship had been of suppliant and monarch and there was not much close interpersonal friendship involved nor had she particularly liked him he was candid and amiable enoughhighrolling multimillionaire with an easygoing manner but sharply on top of every dollar he spent and every development in every project he was involved in she did not like being a client to a capricious titan of finance and to be fair she had come to their meetings with a faint prejudice she had heard about robinette broadhead long before he played any part in her own life in lurvys own time on the gateway asteroid and in its ships she had once gone out in a threeperson ship with an elderly woman who had once been shipmate with gellekiara moynlim from the woman lurvy had heard the story of broadheads last mission the one that made him a multimillionaire there was something questionable about it nine people had died on that mission broadhead was the only survivor and one of the casualties had been kiara moynlin with whom broadhead had been in love maybe it was lurvys own experience with a mission in which most of the crew had died that colored her feelings but they were there the curious thing about the broadhead mission was that maybe died was not the right word for the casualties this kiara and the rest had been trapped in a black hole and perhaps they were still there and perhaps still aliveprisoners of sloweddown time maybe no more than a few hours older after all the years so what was the hidden agenda in broadheads message to lurvy was he urging them on to try to find a way to penetrate gellekiara moynlins prison did he know himself lurvy could not tell but for the first time she thought of their employer as a human being the thought was touching it did not make lurvy feel less afraid but perhaps a little less alone when she brought her latest batch of tapes to paul in the dead mens room to record at high speed and transmit when he could she tarried to put her arms around him and cling which surprised him very much when janine returned to the dead mens room from an exploration with wan something told her to move quietly she looked in without being heard and saw her sister and brotherinlaw sitting comfortably against a wall half listening to the maniac chatter of the dead men half chatting desultorily with each other she turned put her finger to her lips and led wan away i think they want to be alone she explained anyway im tired lets take a break wan shrugged they found a convenient spot at an intersection of corridors a few dozen meters away and he settled himself pensively beside the girl are they conjugating he asked cripes wan youve only got the one thing on your mind all the time but she was not annoyed and let him move close to her until one hand approached her breast knock it off she said mildly he withdrew his hand you are being very disturbed janine he said pouting oh get off my back but when he moved millimeters away she let herself move a little closer again she was quite content to have him want her and quite serene in believing that when anything happened as anything sooner or later surely would it would be when she wanted it to happen nearly two months with wan had made her like him and even trust him and the rest could wait she enjoyed his presence even when he was grouchy you are not competing properly he complained competing at what for the lords sake you should talk to tiny jim he said severely he will teach you better strategies in the reproduction race he has fully explained the male role to me so that i am sure i can compete successfully of course yours is different basically your best choice would be to allow me to copulate with you yes youve said that you know what wan you talk too much he was silent for a moment perplexed he could not defend himself against that charge he did not even know why it was a charge in most of his life the only mode of interaction he had had was talk he rehearsed all of tiny jims teachings in his mind and then his expression cleared i see you want to kiss first he said no i dont want to kiss first and get your knee off my bladder he released her unwillingly janine he explained close contact is essential to love this is true of the lower orders as well as of us dogs sniff primates groom reptiles coil around each other even rose shoots nestle close to the mature plant tiny jim says although he does not believe that is a sexual manifestation but you will lose the reproductive race if you are not careful janine she giggled to what old dead henrietta but he was scowling and she took pity on him she sat up and announced kindly enough youve got some really wrong ideas do you know that the last thing i want even if we ever do get around to your goddam conjugation is to get caught in a place like this caught pregnant she explained winning the goddam reproductive race knocked up oh wan she said nuzzling the top of his head you just dont know where its all at i bet you and i are going to conjugate the hell out of each other some time or other and maybe well even get married or something and well just win that old reproductive race a whole bunch but right now youre just a snottynosed kid and so am i you dont want to reproduce you just want to make love well that is true yes but tiny jim will you shut up about tiny jim she stood up and regarded him for a moment and said affectionately tell you what im going back to the dead mens room why dont you go read a book for a while to cool off you are silly he scolded i have no book here or reader oh for the lords sake then go somewhere and whack off until you feel better wan looked up at her then down at his freshly laundered kilt no bulge was visible but there was a pale spreading spot of damp he grinned i guess i dont need to any more he said by the time they got back paul and lurvy were no longer cozily nestling each other but janine could detect that they were more at peace than usual what lurvy could detect about wan and janine was less tangible she looked at them thoughtfully considered asking what they had been up to decided against it paul was in any event more interested in what they had just discovered he said hey kids listen to this he dialed henriettas number waited until her weepy voice said a tentative hello and then asked who are you the voice strengthened i am a computer analog it said firmly when i was alive i was mrs arnold meacham of mission orbit seventyfour day nineteen i have a bachelor of science and masters from tulane and the phd from the university of pennsylvania and my special discipline is astrophysics after twentytwo days we docked at an artifact and were subsequently captured by its occupants at the time of my death i was thirtyeight years old two years younger than the voice hesitated than doris filgren our pilot who it hesitated again whowho my husband seemed towho had an affair with who the voice was sobbing now and paul turned it off well it doesnt last he said but there it is poor dumb old vera has sorted out some kind of a connection with reality for her and not just for her do you want to know your mothers name wan the boy was staring at him popeyed my mothers name he shrilled or anybody elses tiny jim for instance he was actually an airbody pilot from venus who got to gateway and then here his name is james cornwell willard was an english teacher he embezzled money from the students fund to pay his way to gatewaydidnt get much out of it of course his first flight brought him here the downlink computers wrote an interrogation program for vera and shes been working at it all along andwhats the matter wan the boy licked his lips my mothers name he repeated oh sorry paul apologized reminded to be kind it had not occurred to him that wans emotions would be involved her name was elfega zamorra but she doesnt seem to be one of the dead men wan i dont know why and your fatherwell thats a funny thing your real father was dead before she came here the man you talk about must have been somebody else but i dont know who any idea why that is wan shrugged i mean why your mother or i guess youd call him your stepfather doesnt seem to be stored wan spread his hands lurvy moved closer to him the poor kid responding to his distress she put her arm around him and said i guess this is a shock to you wan im sure well find out a lot more she gestured at the mares nest of recorders encoders and processors that littered the once bare room everything we find out gets transmitted back to earth she said he looked up at her politely but not entirely comprehendingly as she tired to explain the vast complex of informationhandling machinery on earth and how it systematically analyzed compared collated and interpreted every scrap from heechee heaven and the food factorynot to mention every other bit of data wherever derived until janine intervened oh leave him alone he understands enough she said wisely just let him live with it for a while she rummaged through the case of rations for one of the slategreen packages and then said casually by the way why is that thing beeping at us paul listened then sprang to his clutter of gadgets the monitor slaved to their portable cameras was emitting a faint queep queep queep he spun it around so they could all see swearing to himself it was the camera they had left by the berryfruit bush set patiently to record the unchanging scene and to sound an alarm whenever it detected movement it had there was a face scowling out at them lurvy felt a thrill of terror heechee she breathed but if so the face showed no evidence of concealing a mind that could colonize a galaxy it seemed to be down on all fours peering worriedly at the camera and behind it were four or five others like it the face had no chin the brow slanted down from a fuzzy scalp there was more hair on the face than on the head if the skull had had an occipital ridge it would have looked like a gorilla taken all in all it was not far from the shipboard computers reconstruction of wans description but on a cruder more animal design yet they were not animals as the face moved to one side lurvy saw that the others clustered around the berryfruit bush wore what no animal had ever spontaneously worn they were clothed there were even evidences of fashion in what they wore patches of color sewn to their tunics what looked like tattoos on exposed skin even a string of sharpedged beads around the neck of one of the males i suppose lurvy said shakily that even the heechee might degenerate in time and theyve had lots of time the view in the camera spun dizzily damn him paul snapped hes not so degenerate he doesnt notice the camera hes picked the damn thing up wan do you suppose they know were here the boy shrugged disinterestedly of course they do they always have you know they simply do not care lurvys heart caught what do you mean wan how do you know they wont come after us the view in the camera steadied the old one who had picked it up was handing it to another wan glanced at it and said i have told you they almost never come into this part of the blue or ever into the red and there is no reason to go into the green nothing works there not even the food chutes or the readers almost always they stay in the gold unless they have eaten all the berryfruit there and want more there was a mewling cry from the sound system of the monitor and the view whirled again it stopped momentarily on one of the female old ones sucking a finger then she reached out balefully for the camera it spun and then went blank paul what did they do lurvy demanded broke it i suppose he said failing to get the picture back after manipulating the controls question is what do we do havent we got enough here shouldnt we think about going back and think about it lurvy did they all did but however carefully they questioned wan the boy stubbornly insisted there was nothing to fear the old ones had never troubled him in the corridors walled with red skeins of light he had never seen them in the greenthough to be sure he seldom went there himself rarely in the blue and yes of course they knew there were people herethe dead men assured him the old ones had machines that listened and sometimes watched everywhere when they were not broken of course they simply did not care very much if we dont go into the gold they will not trouble us he said positively except of course if they come out wan paul snarled i cant tell you how confident you make me feel but it developed that that was only the boys way of saying that the odds were very good i go to the gold for excitement often he boasted also for books i have never been caught you know and what if the heechee come here for excitement or books paul demanded books what would they do with books for berryfruit maybe sometimes they go with the machinestiny jim says they are for repairing things that break but not always and the machines do not work very well or very often besides you can hear them far away they all sat silent for a moment looking at each other then lurvy said heres what i think lets give ourselves one week here i dont think thats stretching our luck too much we have what is it paulfive cameras left well plant them around slave them to the monitor here and leave them if we take care maybe we can conceal them so the heechee wont find them well explore all the red corridors because theyre safe and as many of the blue and green as we can collect samples take picturesi want to get a look at those repair machines and when weve done as much of that as we can wellwell see how much time we have and then well make a decision about going into the gold but no more than one week from now paul repeated he was not insisting he was only making sure he understood no more lurvy agreed and janine and wan nodded but fortyeight hours later they were in the gold all the same they had decided to replace the broken camera and so all four of them together they retraced their steps to the threeway intersection where the berryfruit bush rose bare of ripe fruit wan was first hand in hand with janine and she detached herself to swoop down on the wreck of the camera they really bashed it she marveled you didnt tell us they were so strong wan look is that blood paul snatched it from her hand turning it over frowning at the crust of black along one edge it looks like they were trying to get it open he said i dont think i could do that with my bare hands he must have slipped and cut himself oh yes shrilled wan absently they are quite strong his attention was not on the camera he was peering down the long gold corridor sniffing the air listening more for distant sounds than to the others youre making me nervous lurvy said do you hear anything he shrugged irritably you smell them before you hear them but no i do not smell anything they are not very near and i am not afraid i come here often to get books or to watch the funny things they do i bet said janine taking the old camera from paul while he hunted a place to conceal the new one there were not many places heechee decor was stark wan bristled i have gone down that corridor as far as you can see he boasted even the place where the books is is far downdo you see some of them are in the corridor lurvy looked but was not sure what wan meant a few dozen meters away was a heap of glittering trash but no books paul peeling tape from a sticky bracket to mount it as high as he could on the wall said the way you carry on about those books of yours ive seen them you know moby dick and the adventures of don quixote what would the heechee be doing with them wan shrilled with dignity you are stupid paul those are only what the dead men gave me they are not the real books those are the real books janine looked at him curiously then moved a few step down the corridor theyre not books she called over her shoulder of course they are i have told you they are no they arent come and look lurvy opened her mouth to call her back hesitated then followed the corridor was empty and wan did not seem more than usually agitated when she was halfway to the glittering scatter she recognized what she was looking at and quickly joined janine to pick one up wan she said ive seen these before theyre heechee prayer fans there are hundreds of them on earth no no he was getting angry why do you say that i lie im not saying you lie wan she unrolled the thing in her hands it was like a tapering scroll of plastic it opened easily in her hand but as soon as she released it it closed again it was the commonest artifact of heechee culture found by the scores in the abandoned tunnels on venus brought back by gateway prospectors from every successful mission no one had ever found what the heechee did with them and whether the name that they had been given was appropriate only the heechee knew theyre called prayer fans wan no no he shrilled crossly taking it away from her and marching into the chamber you do not pray with them you read them like this he started to put the scroll into one of the tulipshaped fixtures on the wall glanced at it threw it down that is not a good one he said rummaging in the heaps of fans on the floor wait yes this is not good either but it is at least something one can recognize he slipped it into the tulip there was a quick tiny flutter of electronic whispers and then the tulip and scroll disappeared a lemonshaped cloud of color enveloped them and shaped itself to display a sewn book opened at a page of vertical lines of ideographs a tinny voicea human voicebegan to declaim something in a staccato highly tonal language lurvy could not understand the words but two years on gateway had made her cosmopolitan she gasped ii think thats japanese and those look like haiku wan what are the heechee doing with books in japanese he said in a superior tone these are not really the old ones lurvy they are only copies of other books the good ones are all like that tiny jim says that all the tapes and books of the dead men all the dead men even the ones that are no longer here are stored in these i read them all the time my god said lurvy and how many times have i had one of those in my hands and not known what it was for paul shook his head wonderingly he reached into the glowing image and pulled the fan out of its tulip it came away easily the picture vanished and voice stopped in midsyllable and he turned the scroll over in his hands that beats me he said every scientist in the world has had a go at these things how come nobody ever figured out what they were wan shrugged he was no longer angry he was enjoying the triumph of showing these people how much more than they he knew perhaps they are stupid too he shrilled then charitably or perhaps they merely have only the ones that no one can understandexcept perhaps the old ones if they ever bothered to read them have you got one of those handy wan lurvy asked he shrugged petulantly i never bother with those he explained still if you do not believe me he rummaged around in the heaps his expression making it clear that they were wasting time with things he had already explored and found without interest yes i think this is one of the worthless ones when he slipped it into the tulip the hologram that sprang up was brightand baffling it was as hard to read as the play of colors on the controls of a heechee spacecraft harder strange oscillating lines that twined around each other leaped apart in a spray of color and then drew together again if it was written language it was as remote from any western alphabet as cuneiform more so all earthly languages had characteristics in common if only that they were almost all represented by symbols on a plane surface this seemed meant to be perceived in three dimensions and with it came a sort of interrupted mosquitowhine of sound like telemetry which by mistake was being received on a pocket radio all in all it was unnerving i did not think you would enjoy it wan observed spitefully turn it off wan lurvy said and then energetically we want to take as many of these things as we can paul take off your shirt load up as many as you can and take them back to the dead mens room and take that old camera too give it to the bioassay unit and see if it can make anything out of the heechee blood and what are you going to do paul asked but he had already slipped off his blouse and was filling it with the glittery books well be right along go ahead paul wan can you tell which are whichi mean which are the ones you dont bother with of course i can lurvy they are very much older sometimes a little chippedyou can see all right you two take off your top clothes tooas much as you need to make a carryingbag out of go ahead well be modest some other time she said slipping out of her coverall she stood in bra and panties tying knots in the arms and legs of the garment she could fit at least fifty or sixty of the fans in that she calculatedwith wans tunic and janines dress they could carry at least half of the objects away and that would be enough she would not be greedy there were plenty more on the food factory anywayalthough probably they were the ones wan had brought there and thus only the ones he had found he could understand are there readers on the food factory wan of course he said why else would i bring books there he was sorting irritably through the fans muttering to himself as he tossed the oldest useless ones to janine and lurvy i am cold he complained we all are i wish youd worn a bra janine she said frowning at her sister janine said indignantly i wasnt planning to take my clothes off wans right im cold too its only for a little while hurry it up wan you too janine lets see how fast we can pick out the heechee ones they had her coverall nearly full and wan scowling and dignified in his kilt was beginning to stuff the fans into his it would be possible lurvy calculated to wrap a few dozen more in the kilt after all he had a breechcloth under it but they were really doing very well paul had already taken at least thirty or forty her coverall seemed able to hold nearly seventyfive and in any event they could always come back another time for the rest if they chose lurvy did not think she would choose to do that enough was enough whatever else they might do in heechee heaven they had already acquired one priceless fact the prayer fans were books knowing that that was so was half the battle with that certainty before them scientists would surely be able to unlock the secret of reading them if they could not do it from scratch there were the readers on the food factory if worst came to worst they could read every fan before one of veras remotes encode sound and image and transmit the whole thing to earth perhaps they could wrench a reading machine loose and bring it back with them and back they would go lurvy was suddenly sure if they could not find a way to move the food factory they would abandon it no one could fault them they had done enough if there was a need for more other parties could follow them but meanwhile meanwhile they would have brought back richer gifts than any other human beings since the discovery of the gateway asteroid itself they would be rewarded accordingly there was no question of thatshe even had robinette broadheads word for the first time since they had left the moon on the searing chemical flame of their takeoff rockets lurvy let herself think of herself not as someone who was striving for a prize but as someone who had won and how happy her father would be thats enough she said helping janine grip the spilling sack of prayer fans lets take them right to the ship janine hugged the clumsy bundle to her small breasts and picked up a few more with a free hand you sound as if were going home she said maybe so lurvy grinned of course well have to have a conference and decide wan whats the matter he was at the door his shirtful of fans under an arm and he looked stricken we waited too long he whispered peering down the corridor there are old ones by the berryfruit oh no but it was true lurvy peered cautiously out into the corridor and there they were staring up at the camera paul had fixed to the wall one reached up and effortlessly pulled it loose while she watched wan is there another way home yes through the gold but his nose was working i think there are some there too i can smell them and yes i can hear them and that was true too lurvy could hear a faint sound of mellow chirrupy grunts from where the corridor bent we dont have a choice she said there are only two of them back the way we came well take them by surprise and just push our way through come on still carrying the tapes she hustled the others ahead of her the heechee might be strong but wan had said they were slow with any luck at all they had no luck at all as they reached the opening she saw that there were more than two half a dozen more standing around and looking toward them in the entrances to the other corridors paul she shouted at the camera were caught get in the ship and if we dont get away and she could say no more because they were upon her and yes they were strong they were hustled up through half a dozen levels their captors one to each arm stolidly chirping at each other ignoring their struggles and their words wan did not speak he let them pull him as they would all the way up to a great open spindleshaped volume where another dozen old ones waited and a huge bluelit machine sat silent behind them did the heechee believe in sacrifice or perform experiments on captives would they wind up as dead men themselves rambling and obsessed ready for the next batch of visitors lurvy looked upon all of these as interesting questions and had no answers for any of them she was not yet afraid her feelings had not caught up with the facts it was too recently that she had allowed herself to feel triumph the realization of defeat would have to wait the old ones chirruped to each other gesticulating toward the prisoners the corridors the great silent machine like a battle tank without guns like a nightmare lurvy could not understand any of it even though the situation was clear enough after minutes of jabber they were pushed into a cubicle and found in itastonishinglyquite familiar objects behind the closed door lurvy shuffled through themclothing a chess set long desiccated rations in the toe of one shoe was a thick roll of brazilian currency more than a quarter of a million dollars of it she guessed they had not been the first captives here but in none of the rubble was anything like a weapon she turned to wan who was pale and shaking what will happen she demanded he waggled his head like an old one it was the only answer he could give my father he began and had to swallow before he could go on they captured my father once and yes truly they let him go again but i do not think that is a rule since my father told me i must never let myself be caught janine said at least paul got away maybemaybe he can bring help but she stopped there and did not expect an answer any hopeful answer would have been fantasy defined by the four years it would take another vessel like theirs to reach the food factory if help came it would not be soon she began to sort through the old clothing at least we can get something on she said come on wan get yourself dressed lurvy followed her example and then stopped at a strange sound from her sister it was almost a laugh whats so funny she snapped janine pulled a sweater over her head before she answered it was too big but it was warm i was just thinking about the orders we got she said to get heechee tissue samples you know well the way it worked outthey got ours instead all of them schwarze peter when the shipboard computers mail bell rang payter woke quickly and completely it was an advantage of age that one slept shallowly and woke at once there were not many advantages he got up rinsed his mouth urinated into the sanitary washed his hands and took two food packets with him to the terminal display the mail now he ordered munching on something that tasted like sour rye bread but was meant to be a sweet roll when he saw what the mail was his good mood passed most of it was interminable mission orders six letters for janine one each for paul and dorema and for himself only a petition addressed to schwarze peter and signed by eight hundred and thirty schoolchildren of dortmund begging him to return and become their burgermeister dumb head he scolded the computer why do you wake me for this trash vera did not answer because he did not give her time to identify him and rummage through her slow magnetic bubbles to locate his name long before then he was complaining also this food is not fit for pigs attend to it at once poor vera erased the attempt to interpret his first question and patiently attended to the second the recycling system is below optimal mass levels she said mr herter in addition my processing routines have been subject to overload for some time many programs have been deferred do not defer the food question any more he snarled or you will kill me and theres an end to it he gloomily commanded display of the mission orders while he forced himself to chew the remainder of his breakfast the orders rolled for ten solid minutes what marvelous ideas they had for him back on earth and if only there were a hundred of him perhaps they could do one onehundredth of the tasks proposed he allowed the end of it to run unwatched while he carefully shaved his pink old face and brushed his sparse hair and why was the recycling system depleted so that it could not function properly because his daughters and their consorts had removed themselves and thus their useful byproducts as well as all the water wan had stolen from the system stolen yes there was no other word for it also they had taken the mobile bioassay unit so that there was only the sampler in the sanitary to monitor his health and what could that tell of fever or arrhythmic heart if he should have either also they had taken all but one of the cameras so that he must carry that one with him wherever he went also they had taken they had taken themselves and schwarze peter for the first time in his life was wholly alone he was not only alone he was powerless to change it family came back they would do so in their own good time and not before until then he was a reserve unit a pillbox soldier a standby program he was given excessive tasks to do but the real center of action was somewhere else in his long life payter had taught himself to be patient but he had never taught himself to enjoy it it was maddening to be forced to wait to wait fifty days for an answer from earth to his perfectly reasonable proposals and questions to wait almost as long for his family and that hooligan boy to get to where they were going and report to him waiting was not so bad if one had enough of a life left to wait in but how much realistically had he suppose he had a stroke suppose he developed a cancer suppose any part of the complicated interactions that kept his heart beating and his blood flowing and his bowels moving and his brain thinking broke down in any place what then and some day they surely would because payter was old he had lied about his age so many times that he was no longer sure of what it was not even his children knew the stories he told about his grandfathers youth were really about his own age in itself did not matter full medical could deal with anything repair or replace as long as it was not the brain itself that was damagedand payters brain was in the best of shape because had it not schemed and contrived to get him here but here there was no full medical and age began to matter a great deal he was no longer a boy but once he had been and even then he had known that somehow some day he would possess exactly what he owned now the key to hearts desire burgermeister of dortmund that was nothing skinny young peter shortest and youngest in his unit of the hitler youth but their leader all the same had promised himself he would have much more he had even known that it would turn out to be something like this some grand futuristic pattern would emerge and he alone would be able to find the handle to wield it like a weapon like an axe like a scythe to punish or reap or remake the world well here it was and what was he doing with it he was waiting it had not been like that in the boyhood stories by juve and gail and dominik and the frenchman verne the people in them did not waste themselves so spinelessly but what after all was one to do so while he waited for that question to answer itself he kept up his daily rounds he ate four light meals a day every other one of chonfood methodically dictating to vera his impressions of taste and consistency he ordered vera to design a new mobile bioassay out of what odds and ends of sensor instrumentation could be spared and worked at building it as she found time to complete parts of the design he worked out ten minutes each morning with the weights half an hour every afternoon with bending and stretching he methodically walked every pathway in the food factory with his handheld camera pointed into every cranny he composed long letters of complaint to his masters on earth cagily arguing the merits of aborting the mission and returning to earth as soon as he could summon the family back and actually transmitted one or two of them he wrote fierce and peremptory directives to his lawyer in stuttgart in code arguing his position demanding a revision to the contract and most of all he schemed and about the traumeplatz most of all it was seldom out of his thoughts this dreaming place with its startling potential when he was depressed and fretful he thought how rightly it would serve earth if he were to repair it and call wan back to give them their fevers once again when he was charged with force and determination he went to look at it lid hanging from an ornamental projection on one wall the joints and fasteners always with him in his coverall pouch how easy it would be to bring in a cutting torch and lop it free cram the ship full of that and the communications system for the dead men and whatever other goods and treasures he could find and then cast loose in the rocket for earth start the long slow downward spiral that would bring himwhat would it bring him god in heaven what would it not fame power prosperity all the things that were his dueyes and his rightful property too if he only got back in time to enjoy them it made him ill to think about it all the time the clock was ticking ticking every minute he was one minute closer to the end of his life every second spent waiting was a second stolen from the happy time of greatness and luxury that he had earned he forced himself to eat sitting on the edge of his private and looking longingly at the ships controls the food has not improved vera he called accusingly the confounded thing did not answer vera you must do something about the food it still did not answer not for several seconds and then only one moment please mr herter it was enough to make one sick in fact he did feel somewhat sick he realized he gazed with hostility at the dish he had been doggedly forcing down supposed to be a sort of schnitzel or as close to it as veras limited recombinant capacities would allow but tasting of whisky or sauerkraut or both at once he set it on the floor i do not feel well he announced pause then one moment please mr hester poor stupid vera had just so much capacity she was processing a burst of messages from earth endeavoring to carry on a conversation with the dead men by means of the fasterthanlight radio encoding and transmitting all of her own telemetryall at once she simply did not have time for his queasiness but his accelerating unease would not be denied a sudden rush of saliva under the tongue a quick shuddering of the diaphragm he barely made it to the sanitary giving back there all he had taken for the last time he swore he did not want to live so long as to see those godbedamned organic compounds reworked for one more passage through his gut when he was sure he had stopped vomiting he marched over to the console and pushed the override buttons all functions in standby except this he ordered monitor my bioassay at once very well she said at once mr hester silence for a moment while the unit in the sanitary made what it could of what peter had just deposited you are suffering from food poisoning she reported mr hester so this i already know what is to be done about it pause while her tiny brain revolved the problem if you could add water to the system the fermentation and recycling would be under better control she said mr hester at least one hundred liters there has been considerable loss due to evaporation in the much larger volume of space now available as well as the stocks withdrawn for the remainder of your party my recommendation is that you replenish the system with available water as soon as possible but that is not fit to drink for pigs even the solutes present problems she acknowledged therefore i recommend that at least half of any added water be distilled first the system should be able to cope with the remainder of the solutes mr hester god in heaven am i to build a still out of nothing and become a watercarrier too and what of the bioassay mobile unit so that this will not happen again vera sorted through the questions for a moment yes i think that would be appropriate she agreed if you wish i will provide construction plans also mr hester you may wish to consider relying more heavily on chonfood for your diet since you do not appear to have severe adverse reactions to it apart of course from the fact that it tastes like dogbiscuit he sneered very well complete the construction plans at once hard copy making use of available materials do you understand yes mr hester the computer was silent for a time inventorying redundant parts and materials devising linkages that would do the job it was a formidable task for veras limited intelligence peter drew a cup of water and rinsed out his mouth then grimly unwrapped one of the least unattractive chon tablets and nibbled off a tentative corner while he waited to see if he would throw up again he faced the possibility that he might in fact die here and alone he did not even have the option he had thought was his of casting everything adrift and returning to earth by himselfnot at least unless he first added water as ordered and did his best to insure that nothing else would go wrong and yet it was every day so increasingly tempting to be sure that would mean casting his daughters and his soninlaw adrift but would they ever return suppose they did not suppose that rude boy turned the wrong switch or ran out of fuel or anything suppose in short they died must he then wither on the vine until he also was dead and what benefit would that be to humanity if he perished here and the whole thing to do over again with a new crew and himself schwarze peter done out of reward done out of fame and power done out of life itself oran idea struck himwas there another option this bedamned food factory itself so set on continuing its course what if he could find the controls that directed it so what if he could learn to change those directions so that it could bring him back to earth not in three years and more but at once in days to be sure that would doom his family would it not but perhaps not perhaps they would return if they returned at all to the food factory itself wherever it might be even in close orbit around earth and how marvelously that would solve everyones problems at once he threw the remainder of the packet into the sanitary to add to the store of organics du bist verruckt peter he snarled to himself the flaw in that dream could not be ignored he had sought with all his might and the controls to the food factory were not to be found the fryingbacon sound of the hardcopy printer rescued him from his thoughts he pulled the sheets out of the machine and frowned over them for a moment so much work twenty hours at least and not merely time but so much of it was hard physical labor he would have to go out into space to reclaim piping from the struts that were meant to hold the auxiliary transmitters in place cut them loose bring them inside and only then begin to weld them together and form them into a spiral simply for the condensation section of the still he saw that he was beginning to shake he barely made it to the sanitary in time vera he croaked i must have medication for this at once mr hester yes in the medical kit you will find tablets marked dumbhead the medical kit is gone to cuckooland oh yes mr hester one moment yes i have programmed appropriate pharmaceuticals for you it will take about twenty minutes for them to be prepared in twenty minutes i could be dead be snarled but there was no help for it and so he sat and stewed for twenty minutes the pressures mounting illness hunger loneliness overwork resentment fear anger that was what in the end they all fused into anger many vectors one vector sum by the time veras dispensary popped out his pills it had submerged all the others he swallowed them greedily and retired to his private to see what would happen actually they did appear to work he lay back while the fires in his belly damped themselves and fell imperceptibly asleep when he woke he felt at least physically better he washed himself brushed his teeth brushed his thinning yellow hair and only then noticed the christmas tree of attentiondemanding lights around veras console on the screen in bright red letters were the words gently request permission to resume normal modes he chuckled to himself he had forgotten to cancel the override when he ordered the computer to get back to business there was an instant explosion of bells and signal lights a cascade of hard copy out of the printer and a voice his elder daughters voice out of veras taped storage hello pop sorry we couldnt reach you to tell you we arrived safely were going to explore now talk to you later because peter hester loved his family the joy of their safe arrival flooded his heart and sustained himfor hours for almost two days but joy does not flourish in an existence of irritations and worries he spoke to lurvytwice for no more than thirty seconds each time vera simply could not handle more vera was harder pressed than peter himself stripped and rearranged as she was handling twoway traffic between heechee heaven and the earth deferring top priority action commands when even higher priorities demanded attention the one voice link with the heechee place could not handle the volume it was given to carry and mere chitchat between father and daughter could not be allowed that was not unjust peter conceded such marvels they were finding what was unjust was that he himself was out of it what was unjust was that among the urgent and meaningful traffic vera found time to pass on to him a hodgepodge of commands meant for himself none reasonable some impossible to carry out redeploy the thrusters inventory chonfood submit by return message complete analysis a cm by cm by cm packets in red and lavender wrappers do not submit unnecessary analyses submit metallurgical analysis dreaming couch do not attempt physical study dreaming couch query dead men re heechee drive query dead men re control panels query dead men how easy that was to command how hard to carry out when they maundered and scolded and rambled and complained when he could hear them at all and when most often he was forbidden to take time on the ftl voice circuit anyway some of the orders from earth contradicted others and most of them came out of order with obsolete priority designations and some did not come at all poor veras storage circuits were soon approaching overload and she tried to rid herself of unnecessary data by hardprinting it for him to somehow attend to but that made problems of its own because the recycling system that fed the printer rolls was the same one that fed him and the organics were already depleted so peter had to open and dump chonfood into the sanitary and then get busy on the still even if vera had had time for him he had not much time for vera struggle into eva equipment cycle himself out on the hull of the food factory cut away tubing and bind it together sweat it back to the ship always fighting the infuriating dogged thrust of the food factory itself as it plunged toward somewhere or other he could spare time only for an occasional glance at the pictures coming back from heechee heaven vera displayed them as they came in one frame at a time but then each one was whisked away to make storage space for the next one and if peter was not there to see they would go unseen even so good heavens the dead men so featureless to look at the corridors of heechee heaven the old onespeters heart almost stopped as he looked at the great broad face of an old one on the screen but he had time only for a look and then the still was done and he must go on with the next task build himself a yoke for his shoulders seam together plastic sheeting to make buckets squat impatiently by the one functioningbarely functioningwater source holding the flexible disk around the spout and catching the foulsmelling dribble in the bags tote the water back half into the still the other half into the recycling tanks sleep when he could eat when he could force himself attend to his own personal priority messages when they trickled through and when he was too exhausted for anything physical another message from dortmund three hundred municipal workers this timestupid vera for letting such trash through a coded communication from his lawyer meaning half an hour to translate it and then all it said was am attempting secure more favorable terms can promise nothing meanwhile advise full compliance all directives what a pig peter swearing sat before the console slammed down the override key and dictated his reply full compliance with all stupid directives will kill me and then what and he sent it in the clear let broadhead and the gateway corp make what they would of it and perhaps the message was no lie in all his stress and bustle peter had no time for aches and pains he ate the chonfood and when new regular rations began to come out of the recycler them too even when they tasted foulsometimes turpentine sometimes moldhe was not sick this was not ideal peter knew that he was operating on stress and adrenaline and sometime there would be a price to pay but he could see no way to avoid paying it when due and when at last he had the food processor working reasonably well once more and had managed to catch up with what appeared the most peremptory of his own orders he sat before veras console halfdozing and then saw the greatest marvel of all he scowled uncomprehendingly what was that idiot boy doing with a prayer fan why in the next frame was he poking it into those foolish things that looked like flowerholders and then the next frame began to build on the screen and peter gave a great shout suddenly a picture had appeared some sort of bookjapanese or chinese by the look of it he was out of the ship and halfway to the traumeplatz before his conscious mind quite articulated what some part of him had understood at once the prayer fans they contained information he did not stop to wonder why the information had been in a terrestrial language or at least what looked like one he had grasped the essential fact he was determined to see for himself panting he thrust himself into the room and scrabbled feverishly among the fans how was it done why in the name of god had he not waited to see more to be sure of what he was doing but there were the candleholders or flowerpots or whatever he had thought they were he jammed the first prayer fan to hand into the nearest one nothing happened he tried six of them narrow end first wide end first every way he could think of before it occurred to him that perhaps not all of the reading machines were still working and the second one he tried pulled the fan out of his hand and immediately sprang into light he was looking at six dancers in black masks and bodystockings and he was hearing a song he had not heard for many years it was a taped pv show no not even that it was older than that years older not much more recent than the first years of the discovery of the gateway asteroid his second wife was still alive and janine not born yet when that song was new it had been simple old television before the heechee piezoelectric circuits had been incorporated into communications systems for human beings it had perhaps been part of the library of some gateway prospector no doubt one of the dead men and somehow it had been transcribed to a prayer fan what a cheat but then he realized that there were thousands of prayer fans on earth in the tunnels of venus still on gateway itself wherever the heechee had been they had left them whatever the source of this one most of the others must have been left by the heechee themselves and that alonedear god that alone was worth more even than the food factory for it was the key to all of the heechees knowledge what a bonus there would be exulting peter tried another fan and another and another how disgusting if this was what wan had got his notions of love from some lascivious gateway prospector carrying pornography with him to pass the time no wonder his behavior was so foul but he could not remain angry long for he had too much to be glad about he snatched it out of the reader and then in the quiet heard the distant tiny sound of veras urgentattention bell it had a frightening sound even before he got back to the ship even before he demanded the message and heard his soninlaws voice rasped with fear urgent override priority for peter hester and immediate relay to earth lurvy janine and wan have been captured by the heechee and i think they are coming after me the advantage of his new situation and the only one was that now that there were no more messages coming from heechee heaven vera was better able to cope with her overload patiently peter teased out of her all the pictures that had been transmitted before pauls message had been taped and saw the knot of heechee at the end of the corridor the blurred struggle half a dozen quick glimpses of the ceiling of the corridor something that might have been the back of wans headthen nothing or nothing that meant anything peter could not know that the camera had been jammed into the blouse of one of the old ones but he could see that there was nothing to be seen obscure shadowy shapes perhaps a hint of texture peters mind was clear but it was also empty he did not allow himself to feel how empty his life had at once become he carefully programmed vera to go back over the voice messages and select the significant ones and listened to what all of them had said there was no hope in any of it not even when at last a new picture suddenly began to build on the screen then another then another for half a dozen frames there was nothing that made sense perhaps a fist over the lens maybe a shot of a bare floor then in one corner of the last frame something that looked likewhat like a sturmkampfwagen from his earliest boyhood but then it was gone and the camera had once again been put where it showed nothing at all and stayed that way through fifty frames what it noticeably did not show was any sign of either of his daughters or of wan and as to paul the old man did not have a clue after his last frantic message he was gone in some unwanted corner of his mind he found the realization that now he might be probably was the sole survivor of the mission and so whatever bonus might come to all was now his alone he held the thought where he could look at it but it meant nothing he was now hopelessly alone more alone than ever as alone as trish bover frozen into her eternal ragged orbit that would go nowhere perhaps he could get back to earth to claim his reward perhaps he could keep from dying but how was he to keep from going insane it took peter a long time to fall asleep he was not afraid of sleeping what he dreaded was waking up afterward and when it came it was as bad as he had feared in the first moment it was a day like any other day and it was only after a peaceable moment of stretching and yawning that he remembered what had happened peter hester he said to himself out loud you are alone in this very damned place and you will die here still alone he noted that he was talking to himself already through the habits of all those years he washed himself cleaned his mouth brushed his hair and then took time to snip off the loose ends around his ears and at the nape of his neck it did not matter what he did in any case having left his private he opened two packets of chonfood and ate them methodically before asking vera if there were any messages from heechee heaven no she said mr hester but there are a number of downlink action relays later he said they did not matter they would tell him to do things he had already done perhaps or they would tell him to do things he had no intention of doing perhaps to force himself outside to rerig the thrusters to try again but the food factory would of course counter every thrust with an equal and opposite thrust of its own and continue its slow acceleration toward god he knew what for god he knew why in any event nothing that came from earth for the next fifty days would be relevant to the new realities and in less than fifty days in less than fifty days what you talk as though you had a choice of options peter hester he scolded himself well perhaps he had he thought if only he could perceive what they were meanwhile the best thing for him to do was to do what he had always done to keep himself fastidiously neat to do such tasks as were reasonable for him to do to maintain his well established habits he had learned through all those decades of life that the best time for him to move his bowels was some fortyfive minutes after eating breakfast it was now about that time it was appropriate to do that while he was squatting on the sanitary he felt a tiny almost imperceptible lurch once more and scowled it was an annoyance to have things happen when he did not know their cause and it was an interruption in what he was doing with his customary efficiency of course one could not claim much personal credit for the functioning of sphincters that had been bought and transplanted from some hapless donor or for a stomach inserted intact from another nevertheless it pleased peter that he functioned so well you are morbidly interested in your bowel movements he told himself but silently also silentlyit did not seem so bad to talk to oneself as long as it was not aloudhe defended himself it was not unjustified he thought it was only because the example of the bioassay unit in the toilet was always before him for three and a half years it had been monitoring every waste product of their bodies of course so it must how else to keep tabs on their health and if it was proper for a machine to weigh and evaluate ones excrement why not for the excrements author he said aloud grinning du bist verruckt peter hester he nodded in agreement with himself as he cleaned himself and fastened his coverall because he had summed it all up yes he was crazy by the standards of ordinary men but what ordinary man had ever been in the present position of peter hester so when one had said that he was crazy after all one had said nothing that was relevant what did the standards of ordinary men signify as to schwarze peter it was only against extraordinary men that he could be judgedand what a motley crew they were drug addicts and drunkards adulterers and traitors tycho brahe had a guttapercha nose and no one thought him the less the reichsfuhrer ate no meat great frederick himself spent many hours that could have been devoted to the management of an empire in composing music for tinkletanide chamber groups he strolled across to the computer and called vera what was that little thump a few minutes ago the computer paused to match the description against her telemetry i cannot be sure mr hester but the moment of inertia is consistent with either the launching or docking of one of the cargo ships that have been observed he stood for a moment gripping the edge of the console seat fool he shouted why was i not told that that was possible im sorry mr hester she apologized the analysis suggesting this possibility has been read out for you as hard copy perhaps you overlooked it fool he said again but this time he was not sure who he was talking to the ships of course it had been implicit all along that the production of the food factory had to go somewhere and it had also been implicit that the ships had to return empty to be reloaded for what where that did not matter what mattered was the perception that perhaps they would not always come empty and following on that the perception that one ship at least known to come to the food factory was now in heechee heaven if it should come back who or what might be in it peter rubbed his arm which had begun to ache pains or none he could perhaps do something about that he had some weeks before that ship could possibly return he couldwhat yes he could barricade that corridor he could somehow move machines storesanything that had massto block it so that when it did return if it did whoever was in it would be stopped or at least delayed and the time to begin that was now he delayed no further but set off to find materials for a barricade it was not hard to move even quite massive objects in the low thrust of the food factory but it was tiring and his arms continued to ache and in a little while as he was shoving a blue metal object like a short fat canoe down toward the dock he became aware of a strange sensation that seemed to come from the roots of his teeth almost like the beginning of a toothache and saliva began to flow from under his tongue peter stopped and breathed deeply forcing himself to relax it did no good he had known it would do no good in a few moments the pain in the chest began first tentative as though someone were pressing against him with a sled runner along his breastbone then painful a hard bruising thrust as though the runner were on top of him and a hundredkilo man standing on it he was too far from vera to get medicine he would have to wait it out if it was false angina he would live if it was cardiac arrest he would not he sat patient and still waiting to see which it would be while anger built up and built up inside him how unfair it was how unfair it all was five thousand astronomical units away serenely and untroubled the people of the world went about their business neither knowing nor caring that the person who could bring them so muchwho already hadmight be dying alone and in pain could they be grateful could they show respect appreciation even common decency perhaps he would give them a chance if they responded with these things yes he would bring them such gifts as they had never known but if they were wicked and disobedient then schwarze peter would bring them such terrible gifts that all the world would shudder and quake with fear in either case they would never forget him if only he survived what was happening to him now brasilia the main thing was essie i sat by her bed every time she came out of surgeryfourteen times in six weeksand every time her voice was a little weaker and she looked a little more gaunt everybody was after me all the time the suit against me in brasilia was going badly reports poured in from the food factory the fire in the food mines still would not go out but essie was up front harriet had her orders wherever i was asleep or awake if essie asked for me she was put through at once oh yes mrs broadhead robin will be with you right away no you wont be disturbing him he just woke up from a nap or hes just between appointments or hes just coming up the lawn from the tappan sea or anything that would not deter essie from speaking to me right away and then i would go into the darkened room all suntanned and grinning and relaxed and tell her how well she was looking they had taken my billiard room and moved a whole operating theater into it and cleared the books out of the library next door to make it a bedroom for her she was pretty comfortable there or said she was and actually she didnt look bad at all they had done the splints and the bone grafts and plugged in two or three kilos of spare parts and tissues they had even put the skin back or i guess transplanted new skin from somebody else her face looked fine except for a light bandage on one side and she brushed her streaky blonde hair down over that so stud she would greet me how you hanging just fine just fine a little horny i would say nuzzling her neck with my nose and you just fine so we reassured each other and we werent lying you know she was getting better every day the doctors told me that and i was gettingi dont know what i was getting but i was all atremble with eagerness for every morning operating on five hours sleep a night never tired never felt better in my life but still she kept getting skinnier every time the doctors told me what i must do and i told harriet and harriet reprogrammed the cook so we stopped having salads and bare broiled steaks no coffee and juice breakfasts but tvoroznyikyi creamcheese pancakes and mugs of steaming cocoa caucasian lamb pilaff for lunch roast grouse in sourcream sauce for dinner youre spoiling me dear robin she accused and i said only fattening you up i cant stand skinny women yes very well but there is such a thing as being too ethnic is there nothing fattening that is not russian wait for dessert i grinned strawberry shortcake and whipped with double devonshire cream as a matter of psychology the nurse had persuaded me to start with small portions on large plates essie doggedly ate them all the way through and as we gradually increased the size of the portions she gradually ate more each day she didnt stop losing weight but she slowed it down a lot and by the end of six weeks the doctors opined that her condition cautiously might be regarded as stable nearly when i told her the good news she was actually standing up tethered to the plumbing under her bed but able to walk about the room about time she said reaching out to kiss me now you have been spending too much time at home its a pleasure i said it is a kindness she said soberly is very dear to me that you have always been here robin but now that i am almost well you must have affairs to attend to not really i get along fine with the comm facilities in the brain room of course it would be nice for the two of us to go somewhere i dont think youve ever seen brasilia maybe in a few weeks no not in few weeks not with me if you have need to go please do it robin i hesitated well morton thinks it might be useful she nodded briskly and called harriet mr broadhead will be leaving for brasilia tomorrow morning make reservations et cetera certainly mrs broadhead harriet said from the console at the head of essies bed her image sputtered into blackness as quickly as it had appeared and essie put her arms around me i will see that you have complete communications in brasilia she promised and harriet will be instructed to keep you posted on my condition at all times square count robin if i need you you will know at once i said into her ear well she said into my shoulder is no well is settled and robin i love you very much albert tells me that every radio message i send is actually a long skinny string of photons like a spear thrown into space a thirtysecond burst communication is a column nine million kilometers long each photon zipping along at the speed of light in perfect step all the way but even that long fast skinny spear takes forever to go au the fever that had wounded my wife had taken twentyfive days to get here the orders to stop fooling with the couch had gone only a fraction of the way before they passed the second fever the one the girl janine had laid on us lightly to be sure our message congratulating the herterhalls on arriving at the food factory out somewhere past plutos orbit had passed the one to tell us that most of them had gone skylarking off to heechee heaven by now they were there and our message telling them what to do about it was long since at the food factory for relayfor once two events had occurred at times close enough to have some meaning for each other but by the time we knew what meaning they had had the event would again be twentyfive days in the past what an annoyance i wanted many things on the food factory but what i wanted most of all at that moment was that fasterthanlight radio astonishing that such a thing should be but when i charged albert with being caught flatfooted by it he had smiled that gentle humble smile and poked his pipestem at his ear and said sure thing robin if you mean the sort of surprise that one feels when an unlikely contingency turns out to be real but it was always a contingency remember the heechee ships were able to navigate without error to moving targets that suggests the possibility of communication at nearly instantaneous speeds over astronomical distancesergo a fasterthanlight radio then why didnt you tell me about it i demanded he scratched one sneakered foot against the other sockless ankle it was only a possibility robin estimated no more than point oh five a sufficient condition but not a necessary one we simply didnt have enough evidence until now i could have been chatting with albert on the way down to brasilia but i was traveling commercialthe company aircraft arent fast enough for those distancesand i like having albert where i can see him when we talk so i spent my time voiceonly with company business and morton and of course with harriet who was under orders to check in once an hour except when i was asleep with a quick status report on essie even hypersonic a tenthousandkilometer flight takes a while and i had time for a lot of business morton wanted as much of it as he could get mostly to try to talk me out of meeting with bover you have to take him seriously robin be whined through the plug in my ear bovers represented by anjelos carpenter and gutmann and theyre highpowered people with really good legal programs better than you hesitation welli hope not robin tell me something morton if bover didnt have much of a case to begin with why are these highpowered people bothering with him although i couldnt see him i knew that morton would be assuming his defensive look partly apologetic partly youlaymenwouldntunderstand its not all that weak robin and it hasnt gone well for us so far and its takking on some larger dimension than we originally estimated and i assume that they thought their connections would patch up the weak spotsi also assume that theyre in for a sonofabitching big contingency fee youd be better advised to patch up some of our own weak spots than take a chance with bover robin your pal senator praggler is on this months oversight committee go see him first ill go see him but not first i told morton and cut him off as we circled in for a landing i could see the big gateway authority tower overshadowing the silly flat saucer over the house of representatives and off up the lake the bright reflections of tin roofs in the free town i had cut it pretty close my date with trish bovers widower was in less than an hour and i didnt really want to keep him waiting i didnt have to i was already sitting at a table in the courtyard dining room of the brasilia palace hotel when he came in skinny tall balding he sat down nervously as if he were in a desperate hurry or desperately eager to be somewhere else but when i offered him lunch he took ten minutes to study the menu and wound up ordering all of it fresh hearts of palm salad little freshwater shrimp from the lake all the way down to that wonderful raw pineapple flown up from rio this is my favorite hotel in brasilia i informed him genially hostfully as he poured dressing on the hearts of palm old but good i suppose youve seen all the sights ive lived here for eight years mr broadhead oh i see i hadnt known where the hell the son of a bitch lived he was just a name and a nuisance so much for travelog i tried common interests i got a flash synoptic from the food factory on the way down here the herterhall party is doing well finding out some marvelous things did you know that weve identified four of the dead men as actual gateway prospectors i saw something about that on the pv yes mr broadhead its quite exciting more than that bover it can change this whole world aroundand make us all filthy rich too he nodded his mouth full of salad he kept on keeping his mouth full too i wasnt doing much good trying to draw him out all right i said why dont we get down to business i want you to drop that injunction he chewed and swallowed with the next forkful of shrimp poised at his mouth he said i know you do mr broadhead and refilled the mouth i took a long slow sip of my wine and seltzer and said with complete control of my voice and manner mr bover i dont think you understand what the issues are i dont mean to put you down i just cant believe you have all the facts were both going to lose if you keep that injunction in force i went over the whole case with him with care exactly as morton had spelled it out to me gateway corps intervention eminent domain the problem of complying with a court order when your compliance doesnt get to the people it affects until a month and a half after theyve gone and done whatever they were going to do the opportunity for a negotiated settlement what im trying to say i said is that this is really big too big for us to be divided they wont fuck around with us bover theyll just go ahead and expropriate us he didnt stop chewing just listened and then when he had nothing more to chew he took a sip from his demitasse and said we really dont have anything to discuss mr broadhead of course we do not unless we both think so he pointed out and i dont youre a little mistaken in some of the things you say i dont have an injunction any more i have a judgment which i can get reversed in a hot yes maybe you can but not in a hot anything the law will take its course and it will take time i wont make any deal trish paid for whatever comes out of this since she isnt around to protect her rights i guess i have to but its going to cost both of us thats as may be as my lawyer says he advised me against this meeting then why did you come he looked at the remains of his lunch then out at the fountains in the courtyard three returned gateway prospectors were sitting on the edge of a reflecting pool with a slightly drunk varig stewardess singing and tossing crumbs of french pastry to the goldfish they had struck it rich it makes a nice change for me mr broadhead he said out of the window of my suite high up in the new palace tower i could see the crownofthorns of the cathedral glinting in the sun it was better than looking at my legal program on the fullservice monitor because he was eating me out you may have prejudiced our whole case robin i dont think you understand how big this is getting thats what i told bover no really robin not just robin broadhead inc not even just the gateway corporation governments getting into it and not just the signatories to the gateway convention either this may wind up a un matter oh come on morton can they do that of course they can robin eminent domain your friend bover isnt helping things any either hes petitioning for a conservator to take over your personal and corporate holdings in this matter in order to administer the exploration properly the son of a bitch he must have known that was happening while we were eating the lunch i bought him whats this word proper what have i done that was improper short list robin he ticked off his fingers one you exceeded your authority by giving the hesterhall party more freedom of action than was contemplated which two led to their expedition to heechee heaven with all of its potential consequences and thus three brought about a situation of grave national peril strike that grave human peril thats crap morton thats the way he put it in the petition he nodded and yes we may persuade somebody its crap sooner or later but right now its up to the gateway corp to act or not which means i better see the senator i got rid of morton and called harriet to ask about my appointment i can give you the senators secretarial program now she smiled and faded to show a rather sketchy animation of a handsome young black girl it was quite poor simulation nothing like the programs essie writes for me but then praggler was only a united states senator good afternoon she greeted me the senator asks me to say that hes in rio de janeiro on committee business this evening but will be happy to see you whenever convenient tomorrow morning shall we say ten oclock lets say nine i told her somewhat relieved i had been a little worried about pragglers failure to get back to me right away but now i perceived he had a good reason the fleshpots of ipanema harriet when she came back i asked hows mrs broadhead no change robin she smiled shes awake and available now if youd like to speak to her bet your sweet little electronic tooshy i do i told her she nodded and drifted away harriet is a really good program she doesnt always understand the words but she can make a yesno decision from the tone of my voice and so when essie appeared i said s ya lavorovna you do nice work to be sure dear robin she agreed preening herself she stood up and turned slowly around as do our doctors you will observe it took a moment for it to hit me there were no lifesupport tubes she wore fleshform casts on her left side but she was free of the machines my god woman what happened perhaps healing has happened she said serenely although it is only an experiment the doctors have just left and i am to try this for six hours then they will examine me again you look bloody marvelous we chatted fillin talk for a few minutes she told me about the doctors i told her about brasilia while i studied her as carefully as i could in a pv tank she kept getting up and stretching delighting in her freedom until she worried me are you sure youre supposed to do all that i have been told that i must not think of water skiing or dancing for a while but perhaps not everything that is fun is prohibited essie you lewd lady is that a lustful look i see in your eye are you feeling well enough for that quite well yes well not well she amplified but perhaps as though you and i had enjoyed a hard nights drinking a day or two ago a little fragile but i do not think i would be harmed by a gentle lover ill be back tomorrow morning you will not be back tomorrow morning she said firmly you will be back when you are entirely through with your business in brasilia and not one moment before or else my boy you will not find any willing partner for your debauched intentions here i said goodbye in a rosy glow which lasted all of twentyfive minutes until i got around to doublechecking with the doctor it took a little while because she was just getting back to columbia medical when i called im sorry to be rushed mr broadhead she apologized shrugging out of her gray tweed suitcoat ive got to show students how to suture nerve tissue in about ten minutes you usually call me robin dr liederman i said cooling off quickly yes i dorobin dont get worried i dont have bad news while she was talking she was continuing to strip down as far as brassiere level before putting on a turtleneck and an operatingroom gown wilma liederman is a goodlooking woman of a certain age but i was not there to ogle her charms but you dont have good news either not yet youve talked to essie so you know were trying her out without the machines we have to know how far she can go on her own and we wont know that for twentyfour hours at least i hope we wont essie said six six hours to readouts twentyfour to full workup unless she shows bad signs before that and has to go back on the machines right away she was talking to me over her shoulder scrubbing up at her little washstand holding her dripping hands in the air she came back closer to the comm set i dont want you worrying robin she said all this is routine shes got about a hundred transplants in her and we have to find out if theyve taken hold i wouldnt let her go this far if i didnt think the chances were at least reasonable robin reasonable doesnt sound real good to me wilma better than reasonable but dont push me and dont worry either youre getting regular bulletins and you can call my program any time you want moreme too if you have to you want odds two to one everythings going to work a hundred to one that if something fails its something we can fix now ive got to transplant a complete lower genital for a young lady who wants to be sure she still has fun afterwards i think i ought to get back there i said for what theres nothing you can do but get in the way robin i promise i wont let her die before you get back in the background the pa system was chiming gently theyre playing my song robin talk to you later there are times when i sit at the center of the world and when i know that i can reach out to any of the programs my good wife has written for me and pull back any fact absorb any explanation or command any event there are also times when i sit with a full console and a head full of burning questions and learn nothing because i do not know what to ask and there are times when i am so full of learning and being and doing that the moments zip past and the days are packed and other times when i am floating in slack water beside a current and the world is sliding speedily by there was plenty to do i didnt feel like doing it albert was bursting with news from heechee heaven and the food factory i let him purge himself but the synoptics plopped into my mind without raising a question or even a ripple when he was through reporting about architectural deductions and interpretations of maunderings of the dead men i turned him off it was intensely interesting but for some reason i was not interested by it i ordered harriet to let my simulacrum deal with everything routine and tell everyone who was not urgent to call me another time i stretched out on the threemeter watercouch looking out over the weird brasilia skyline and wished that it were that couch in the food factory connected to someone i loved wouldnt that be great to be able to reach out to someone far away as wan had reached out to the whole earth and feel with them what they were feeling let them feel the inside of you what a wonderful thing for lovers and to that thought i reacted by calling up morton on my console and telling him to look into the possibility of patenting that application of the couch it was not a very romantic response to a pretty romantic thought the difficulty was that i was not quite sure which someone i wished i were connected to my dear wife so loved so needful right now or someone a lot farther away and much harder to reach so i stagnated through the long brazilian afternoon with a soak in the pool and a lounge in the setting sun and a lavish dinner in my suite with a bottle of wine and then i called albert back to ask him what i really wanted to know albert where exactly is kiara now he paused tamping tobacco into his pipe and frowning gellekiara moynlin he said at last is in a black hole yes and what does that mean he said apologetically thats hard to say i mean its hard to put in simple terms and also hard to say because i really dont know not enough data do your best sure thing robin i would say that she is in the section of the exploration craft which remained in orbit just under the event horizon of the singularity you encounteredwhich he waved carelessly and a blackboard appeared behind him is of course just at the schwarzschild radius he stood up jamming the unlit pipe into the hip pocket of his baggy cotton slacks picked up a piece of chalk and wrote gm c at that boundary light cant go any farther it is what you might think of as a standing wavefront where light has gone as far as it can go you cant see into the black hole past it nothing can come up from behind it the symbols of course stand for gravity and massand i dont have to tell an old fasterthanlight person like you what c is do i from the instrumentation you brought back it would appear that this particular hole was maybe sixty kilometers in diameter which would give it a mass of maybe ten times the sun am i telling you more than you want to know a little bit albert i said shifting uncomfortably on the watercouch i wasnt really sure just what i was asking for perhaps what you want to know is whether she is dead bobby he said oh no i dont think so theres a lot of radiation around and god knows what shear forces but she hasnt had much time to be dead yet depends on her angular velocity she might not yet even know youre gone time dilation you see that is a consequence of i understand about time dilation i interrupted and i did because i was feeling almost as though i were living through some of it is there any way we can find that out a black hole has no hair bobby he quoted solemnly thats what we call the carterwernerrobinsonhawking law and what it means is that the only information you get out of a black hole is mass charge and angular momentum nothing else unless you get inside it the way she did well yes robby he admitted sitting down and attending to his pipe long pause puff puff then robin yes albert he looked abashed or as abashed as a holographic construct can i havent been entirely fair with you he said there is some information that comes out of black holes but that gets us into quantum mechanics and it doesnt do you any good either not for your purposes i didnt really like having a computer program tell me what my purposes were especially since i wasnt all that sure myself tell me about it i ordered wellwe dont really know a lot goes back to stephen hawkings first principles he pointed out that in a sense a black hole can be said to have a temperaturewhich implies some kind of radiation some kinds of particles do escape but not from the kinds of black holes that interest you robby what kind do they escape from well mostly from the tiny ones the ones with the mass of say mount everest submicroscopic ones no bigger than a nuclear particle they get real hot a hundred billion kelvin and up the smaller they get the faster the quantum tunneling goes on the hotter they getso they keep on getting smaller and hotter until they just blow up big ones no it goes the other way the bigger they are the more infall they get to replenish their mass and the harder it is for a particle to tunnel out one like kiaras has a temperature probably down around a hundred millionth of a kelvin which is really cold robin and getting colder all the time so you dont get out of one of those not any way i know about no robin does that answer your questions for now i said dismissing him and it did all but one why was it that when he was talking to me about kiara he called me robby essie wrote good programs but it seemed to me that they were beginning to overlap i used to have a program that addressed me by childhood names from time to time but it was a psychiatric program i reminded myself to speak to essie about straightening out her programming because i certainly did not feel i had any need for the services of sigfrid von shrink now senator pragglers temporary office wasnt in the gateway tower but on the th floor of the legislators office building a courtesy from the brazilian congress to a colleague and a flattering one because it was only two stories below the top in spite of the fact that i got up with the dawn i got there a couple minutes late i had spent the time wandering around the early morning city ducking under the overhead roadways coming out in the parking lot strolling i was still in a sort of temporary stasis of time but praggler shook me out of it all chargedup and beaming its wonderful news robin he cried pulling me into his office and ordering coffee jesus how stupid weve all been for a moment i thought he meant that bover had dropped his suit that only showed how stupid i was still being what he was talking about was a late flash from the food factory relay the longsought heechee books had turned out to be the prayer fans that we had all seen for decades i thought youd have known all about it he apologized when he had finished filling me in ive been out walking i said it was pretty disconcerting for him to be telling me about something as big as that on my own project but i recover fast seems to me senator i said thats a big plus for vacating that injunction he grinned you know i could have guessed it would strike you that way anything would mind telling me how you figure that well it looks clear to me whats the biggest purpose of the expedition knowledge about the heechee and now we find out that theres a lot of it lying around just waiting for us to pick it up he frowned we dont know how to decode the damn things we will now that we know what they are well figure out a way to make them work weve got the revelation all we need is the engineering we ought to i stopped myself in the middle of a sentence i was going to say that it was a good idea to start buying up every prayer fan on the market but that was too good an idea to give even a friend i switched to we ought to get results pretty fast the point is the herterhall expedition isnt our only iron in the fire any more so any argument about national interests loses a lot of weight he accepted a cup of coffee from his secretary the reallive one that didnt look a bit like his program and then shrugged its an argument ill tell it to the committee i was hoping youd do more than that senator if you mean you want the whole thing dropped robin i dont have that authority im only here to oversee the committee for one month i can go home and raise hell in the senate and maybe i will but thats the limit of it and whats the committee going to do will they uphold bovers claim he hesitated i think its worse than that i think the sentiments to expropriate you all then its a gateway corporation matter which means it sticks there until the signatories to the treaty unstick it of course in the long run youll all get reimbursed i slammed the cup back into its saucer fuck the reimbursement do you think im in this for the money praggler is a pretty close friend i know he likes me and i even think he trusts me but there wasnt any friendly look on his face when he said sometimes i wonder just why you are in it robin he looked at me for a moment without expression i knew he knew about me and kiara and i also knew hed been a guest at essies table at tappan im sorry about your wifes illness he said at last i hope shes all better real soon i stopped in his outer office to make a quick coded call to harriet to tell her to get my people started buying every prayer fan they could get their hands on she had about a million messages but i would only take oneand all that said was that essie had passed a quiet night and would be seeing the doctors in about an hour i didnt have time for the rest because i had somewhere to go it is not easy to get a taxi in front of the brazilian congress the doormen have their orders and they know who rates priority i had to climb up on the roadway and flag one down then when i gave the driver the address he made me repeat it twice and then show it to him written down it wasnt my bad portuguese he didnt really want to go to free town so we drove out past the old cathedral under the immense gateway tower along the congested boulevard and out into the open planalto two kilometers of it that was the green space the cordon sanitaire the brazilians defended around their capital city but just beyond it was the shantytown as soon as we entered it i rolled the window up i grew up in the wyoming food mines and i am used to twentyfourhour stink but this was a different stink not just the stench of oil this was openair toilets and rotting garbagetwo million people without running water in their homes the shanties had sprung up in the first place to give construction workers a place to live while they built the beautiful dream city they were supposed to disappear when the city was finished shantytowns never disappear they only become institutionalized the taxidriver pushed his cab through nearly a kilometer of narrow alleys muttering to himself never faster than a crawl goats and people moved slowly out of our way little kids jabbered at me as they ran along beside us i made him take me to the exact place and get out and ask where senhor hanson bover lived but before he found out i saw bover himself sitting on cinderblock steps attached to a rusty old mobile home as soon as i paid him the driver backed around and left a lot faster than we had come and by then he was swearing out loud bover did not stand up as i came toward him he was chewing on some kind of sweet roll and didnt stop doing that either he just watched me by the standards of the barrio he lived in a mansion those old trailers had two or three rooms inside and he even had a little patch of something or other green growing alongside the step the top of his head was bare and sunburned and he was wearing dirty denim cutoffs and a teeshirt printed with something in portuguese that i didnt understand but looked dirty too he swallowed and said i would offer you lunch broadhead but im just finishing eating it i dont want lunch i want to make a deal ill give you fifty per cent of my interest in the expedition plus a million dollars cash if you drop your suit he stroked the top of his head gingerly it struck me strange that he got burned so fast because i hadnt noticed sunburn the day beforebut then i realized i hadnt noticed baldness either he had been wearing a toupee all dressed up for his mingling with class society no difference i didnt like the mans manners and i didnt like the growing cluster of audience around us either can we talk this over inside i asked he didnt answer he just pushed the last bite of the roll into his mouth and chewed it while he looked at me that was enough of that i squeezed past him and climbed the steps into the house the first thing that hit me was the stinkworse than outside oh a hundred times worse three walls of the room were taken up with stacks of cages and breeding rabbits in every cage what i smelled was rabbit shit kilos of it and not just from rabbits there was a baby with a soiled diaper being nursed in the arms of a skinny young woman no a girl she looked fifteen at the most she stared up worriedly at me but didnt stop nursing so this was the dedicated worshipper at his wifes shrine i couldnt help it i laughed out loud coming inside had not been such a good idea bover followed me in pulling the door shut and the stink intensified he was not impassive now he was angry i see you dont approve of my living arrangements he said i shrugged i didnt come here to talk about your sex life no nor do you have any right to you wouldnt understand i tried to keep the conversation where i wanted it to be bover i said i made you an offer which is better than youll ever get in a court and a lot more than you had any reason to hope for please accept it so i can go ahead with what im doing he didnt answer me directly that time either just said something to the girl in portuguese she got up silently wrapped a cloth around the babys bottom and went out on the steps closing the door again behind her bover said as though he hadnt heard me trish has been gone for more than eight years mr broadhead i still love her but ive only got one life to live and i know what the odds are against ever sharing any of it with trish again if we can figure out how to run the heechee ships properly we might be able to go out and find trish i said i didnt pursue that all it was doing was making him look at me with active hostility as though he thought i were trying to con him i said a million dollars bover you can be out of this place tonight forever with your lady and your baby and your rabbits too full medical for all of them a future for the kid i told you you wouldnt understand broadhead i checked myself and only said then make me understand tell me what i dont know he picked a soiled baby dress and a couple of pins off the chair the girl had been sitting on for a moment i thought he had relapsed into hospitality but he sat there himself and said broadhead ive lived for eight years on welfare brazilian welfare if we hadnt raised rabbits we wouldnt have had meat if we didnt sell the skins i wouldnt have bus fare to meet you for lunch or to go to my lawyers office a million dollars wont pay me for that or for trish i was still trying to keep my temper but the stink was getting to me and so was his attitude i switched strategies do you have any sympathy for your neighbors bover do you want to see them helped we can end this kind of poverty forever bover with heechee technology plenty of food for everybody decent places to live he said patiently you know as well as i do that the first things that come from heechee technologyany technology dont go to people in the barrio they go to make rich people like you richer oh maybe sooner or later it might all happen but when in time to make any difference to my neighbors yes if i can make it happen faster i will he nodded judgmatically you say you will do that i know i will if i get control why should i trust you because i give you my word you stupid shit why do you think im cutting corners he leaned back and looked up at me as to that he said why yes i think i know why youre in such a hurry it doesnt have much to do with my neighbors or me my lawyers have researched you quite carefully broadhead and i know all about your girl on gateway i couldnt help it i exploded if you know that much i yelled then you know i want to get her out of where i put her and ill tell you this bover im not going to let you and your jailbait whore keep me from trying his face was suddenly as red as the top of his head and what does your wife think about what youre doing he asked nastily why dont you ask her yourself if she lives long enough for you to hassle her fuck you bover im going how do i get a taxi he only grinned at me meanly i brushed past the woman on the stoop and left without looking back by the time i got back to the hotel i knew what he was grinning about it had been explained to me by two hours of waiting for a bus in a square next to an open latrine i wont even say what riding that bus was like ive traveled in worse ways but not since i left gateway there were knots of people in the hotel lobby and they looked at me strangely as i walked across the floor of course they all knew who i was everybody knew about the herterhalls and my picture had been on the pv along with theirs i had no doubt that i looked peculiar sweated and still furious my console was a fireworks display of attention signals when i slammed myself into my suite the first thing i had to do was go to the bathroom but over my shoulder through the open door i called harriet hold all messages for a minute and give me morton one way i dont want a response i just want to give an order mortons little face appeared in the corner of the display looking antsy but ready morton i just came from bover i said everything i could think of to him and it did no good so i want you to get me private detectives i want to search his record like its never been searched before the son of a bitch must have done something wrong i want to blackmail him if its a tenyearold parking ticket i want to extradite him for it get busy on that he nodded silently but didnt go away meaning that he was doing what i had said but wanted to say something himself if only i would let him over him was the larger waiting face of harriet counting out the minutes silence i had imposed on her i came back into the room and said all right harriet lets have it top priority first one at a time yes robin but she hesitated making swift evaluations their are two immediate ones robin first albert einstein wishes to discuss with you the capture of the herterhall party apparently by the heechee captured why the hell didnt you i stopped obviously she couldnt have told me because i was out of communication entirely for most of the afternoon she didnt wait for me to figure that out but went on however i think you would prefer to receive dr liedermans report first robin ive been putting through a call and shes ready to talk to you now live that stopped me do it i said but i knew it couldnt be anything good to make wilma liederman report live and in person whats the matter i asked as soon as she appeared she was wearing an evening dress with an orchid on her shoulder first time i had seen her like that since she came to our wedding dont panic robin she said but essies had a slight setback shes on the lifesupport machines again what its not as bad as it sounds shes awake and coherent feeling no pain her condition is stable we can keep her like that forever get to the but but shes rejecting the kidney and the tissues around it arent regenerating she needs a whole new batch of transplants she had uremic failure about two hours ago and now shes on fulltime dialysis thats not the worst part shes had so many bits and pieces stuck in her from so many sources that her autoimmune system is all screwed up were going to have to scrounge to get a tissue match and even so were going to have to dope her with antiimmunes for a long time shit thats right out of the dark ages she nodded usually we can get a fourfour match but not for essie not this time shes a rareblood to begin with you know shes russian and her types are uncommon in this part of the world so get some from leningrad for christs sake so i was about to say ive checked tissue banks all over the world we can come close real close but in her present state theres still some risk i looked at her carefully trying to figure out her tone of having to do it over you mean she shook her head gently you mean ofof dying i dont believe you what the hell is full medical for robinshe already has died of this you know we had to reanimate her theres a limit to the shock she can survive then the hell with the operation you said shes stable the way she is wilma looked at the hands clasped in her lap for a moment then up at me shes the patient robin not you whats that supposed to mean its her decision she has already decided she doesnt want to be tied down to a lifesupport system forever were going to go in again tomorrow morning i sat there staring at the tank long after wilma liedermari had disappeared and my patient secretarial program had formed silently waiting for orders uh harriet i said at last i want a flight back tonight yes robin she said ive already booked you theres no direct flight tonight but theres one that you can transfer at caracas gets you in to new york about five am the surgery is not scheduled until eight thank you she went back to silent waiting mortons silly face was still there in the tank too tiny and reproachful down in the lower righthand corner he did not speak but every once in a while he cleared his throat or swallowed to let me know he was waiting morton i said didnt i tell you to get lost i cant do that robin not while i have an unresolved dilemma you gave orders about mr bover damn right i did if i cant handle him that way maybe ill just get him killed you dont have to bother morton said quickly theres a message from his lawyers for you he has decided to accept your offer i goggled at him wideeyed and openmouthed i dont understand it either robin and neither do his lawyers he said quickly they are quite upset but there is a personal message for you if it explains anything whats that quote maybe he does understand after all close quote in a somewhat confusing life and one that is rapidly becoming a long one ive had a lot of confusing days but that one was special i ran a hot tub and soaked in it for half an hour trying to make my mind empty the effort didnt bring calm i had three hours before the caracas plane left i didnt know what to do with it it was not that there wasnt plenty for me to do harriet kept trying to get my attentionmorton to firm up the contract with bover albert to discuss the bioanalysis of the heechee droppings somebody had collected everybody to talk to me about everything i didnt want to do any of them i was stuck in my dilated time watching the world flash past but it didnt flash it crept i didnt know what to do about it it was nice that bover thought i understood so well i wondered what he would take to explain what i understood to me after a while i managed to work up enough energy to let harriet put through some of the decisionneeded calls for me and i made what decisions seemed necessary and a while after that toying with a bowl of crackers and milk i listened to a news summary it was full of talk about the herterhall capture all of which i could get better from albert than from the pv newscasters and at that point i remembered that albert had wanted to talk to me and for a moment i felt better it gave me a point and purpose in living i had someone to yell at halfwit i snapped at him as he materialized magnetic tapes are a century old how come you cant read them he looked at me calmly under his bushy white brows youre referring to the socalled prayer fans arent you robin of course we did try that many times we even suspected that there might be a synergy and so we tried several kinds of magnetic fields at once steady and oscillating oscillating at different rates of speed we even tried simultaneous microwave radiation though as it turned out the wrong kind i was still bemused but not so much so that i didnt pick up on the implication you mean theres a right kind sure thing robin he grinned once we got a good trace from the herterhall instrumentation we just duplicated it the same microwave radiation thats ambient in the food factory a flux of a few microwatts of elliptically polarized milliona microwave and then we get the signal bloody marvelous albert and what is it you got uh well he said reaching for his pipe actually not a lot yet its hologramstored and timedependent so what we get is a kind of choppy cloud of symbols and of course we cant read any of the symbols its heechee language you know but now its just straight cryptography so to speak all we need is a rosetta stone how long he shrugged and spread his hands and twinkled i thought for a moment well stay with it another thing i want you to read into my lawyer program the whole thing the microwave frequencies schematics everything there ought to be a patent in there somewhere and i want it sure thing robin uh would you like to hear about the dead men what about the dead men well he said not all of them are human there are some pretty strange little minds in those storage circuits robin i think they might be what you call the old ones the back of my neck prickled heechee no no robin almost human but not they dont use language well especially what seem to be the earliest of them and i bet you cant even guess the computertime bill youre going to get for analysis and mapping to make any sense of them at all my god essiell be thrilled when i stopped for a moment i had forgotten about essie well i said thatsinteresting what else is there to tell but really i didnt care i had used up my own last jolt of adrenaline and there wasnt any more i let him tell me the rest of his budget of conversation but most of it rolled right off me three members of the herterhall party were known to be captured the heechee had brought them to a spindleshaped place where some old machinery was lying about the cameras were continuing to return frames of nothing very exciting the dead men had gone haywire were making no sense at all paul halls whereabouts were unknown perhaps he was still at liberty perhaps he was still alive the haywire link between the dead mens radio and the food factory was still functioning but it was not clear how long it would lasteven if it had anything to tell us the organic chemistry of the heechee was quite surprising in that it was less unlike human biochemistry than one might guess i let him talk until he ran down not prompting him to continue then turned back to the commercial pv it bad two rapidfire comedians delivering bellylaugh lines to each other unfortunately it was in portuguese it didnt matter i still had an hour to kill and i let it run if nothing else i could admire the pretty carioca fruit salad in her hair whose scanty costume the comedians were tweaking off as they passed her back and forth giggling harriets attention signal lighted up bright red before i could make up my mind to respond the picture slid off the commercial pv channel and a mans voice said something stern in portuguese i couldnt understand a word of it but i understood the picture that showed almost at once it was the food factory taken out of stock a shot from the herterhalls as they were approaching it to dock and in the short sentence the announcer had spoken were two words that could have been peter herter could have been were the picture didnt change but a voice began and it was old herters voice angry and firm this message it said is to be broadcast over all networks at once it is a twohour warning in two hours i am going to cause a oneminute attack of the fever by entering the couch and projecting the necessary uh projections i tell you all to take precautions if you do not it is your responsibility not mine it paused for a moment then resumed remember you have two hours from a count which i will give you no more shortly after that i will speak again to tell you the reason for this and what i demand as my proper right if you do not wish this to happen many times two hours beginning now and the voice stopped the announcer came back on babbling in portuguese looking scared it didnt matter that i couldnt understand what he was saying i had understood what peter herter had said very well he had repaired the dreaming couch and was going to use it not out of ignorance like wan not as a quick experiment like the girl janine he was going to use it as a weapon he had a gun pointed at the heads of the entire human race and my first thought was so much for the deal with bover gateway corp was sure to take over now and i couldnt blame them the oldest one the oldest one bestirred himself slowly one organ at a time first came the piezophonic external receptors call them ears they were always on in the sense that sounds always reached them their tiny rag crystals were squeezed by vibrations in the air and when the patterns of sound corresponded to the name the children of the oldest one called him by they passed a gate and went on to activate what corresponded to his peripheral nervous system at that point the oldest one was not yet awake but knew he was being wakened his true ears the inner ones that analyzed and interpreted sound came to life his cognitive circuits sampled the signals the oldest one heard the voices of his children and understood what they were saying but only in an offhand and inattentive way like a drowsy human aware of the buzzing of a fly he had not yet opened his eyes some decisionmaking took place at that stage if the interruption seemed worthwhile the oldest one woke further circuits if not not a human sleeper may awaken enough to swat a fly when the oldest one was awakened for trivial reasons he had ways to swat his children they did not wake him lightly but if he decided to wake further either to act or to punish the interruption to his sleep the oldest one then activated his major external optics and with them a whole congeries of informationprocessing systems and shortterm memories he was then fully awake like a man looking up at the ceiling after a nap the oldest ones internal clocks told him that this nap had been rather short less than ten years unless there was a good reason for this awakening someone would have to be swatted by then the oldest one was fully aware of his surroundings all of them his internal telemetry was receiving status reports from all of its remote sensors all through the ten million ton mass in which he and his children lived a hundred inputs recirculated through his shortterm memory the words that had wakened him the image of the three captives his children had just brought him a breakdown in repair facilities in the a sections the fact that there was unusual activity among the stored intelligences temperatures inventories moments of thrust his longterm storage though dormant was accessible at need the wisest of his children was standing before him with beads of sweat trickling through the sparse hairs on his cheeks and lip the oldest one perceived that this was a new leader shorter and younger than the one he remembered from ten years before but he wore the necklace of reading scrolls that symbolized the office as he waited for judgment the oldest one turned his major external lenses on him as a signal to speak we have captured intruders and brought them to you the leader said and added trembling have we done well the oldest one turned his attention to observe the captives one was not an intruder but the pup he had allowed to be born fifteen years before now nearly grown the other two however were strangers and both female that presented an option worth pondering when the other intruders had presented themselves he had failed to take advantage of the chance to establish new breeding stock until it was too late for any of the available specimens and then they had stopped coming that was a chance the oldest one had missed and one which on the basis of past terrifying experience he should not have failed to take the oldest one was aware that for some thousands of years his judgments had not been always right his opinions no longer confident he was slowing down he was subject to error the oldest one did not know what personal penalty he would have to pay for error and did not want to find out he began to make decisions he reached into his longterm memory for precedents and prospects and found that he had a satisfying number of alternatives he activated mobility and handling effectors his great metal body rose on its supports and moved past the leader toward the chamber where the intruders were being kept he heard the gasp from his children as he moved all were startled a few of the younger ones who had never seen him move as adults were terrified you have done well he judged and there was a long sigh of relief the oldest one could not enter the chamber because of his size but with long softmetal feelers he reached inside and touched the captives it did not interest him that they screamed and struggled his interest at that moment was only in their physical state that was very satisfactory two of them including the male were quite young and therefore good for many years of use in whatever fashion he might decide to use them all seemed in good health as far as communicating with them went there was the nuisance that their yells and imprecations were in one of those unpleasant languages their predecessors had used the oldest one did not understand one word that was not a real problem because he could always talk to them through the intervention of the stored intelligences of their predecessors even his own children over the centuries tended to evolve their language so that he could not have talked to them either if he had not stored one or two of them every dozen generations as translatorsas nothing but translators because the oldest ones children regrettably did not seem to be much use for anything else so such problems could be solved meanwhile the facts were favorable fact the specimens were in good condition fact they were clearly intelligent toolusing even technological fact they were his to employ as he saw fit feed them keep them secure wait for further instructions he commanded the children clustered behind him he then turned down his external receptors so that he could consider just how to employ these intruders in the furtherance of the imperatives that were the central core of his very long life as a personality stored in a machine the oldest ones normal life expectancy was very greatperhaps as much as several thousand yearsbut not great enough to carry out his plans he had extended it by diluting it in standby mode he hardly aged at all so he spent most of his time powereddown motionless he was not resting at such times not even dreaming he was merely abiding while his children lived their lives and carried out his will and the astrophysical events outside crept sluggishly forward from time to time he woke at the urging of his internal clocks to check and correct and revise at other times his children woke him they were instructed to do so at need and very often the need arose time was when the oldest one was a fleshandblood creature as much an animal as his present children or the captives they had brought him that time had been very short indeed less than a nap from the moment when he was expelled from his mothers sweated and straining loins to the terrible time at its end lying helpless as strange needles poured sleep into his veins and the whirling knives waited to trepan his skull he could remember that time quite clearly when he chose he could remember anything in that short life or in the long long pseudolife that followed provided only that he could remember where to look for it in his stored memories and that he could not always remember there was too much stored the oldest one had no clear conception of how many memories he had available to him or of how much time had passed one way or another or even of where things were this place where he and his children dwelt was here that certain other place that figured so largely in his thoughts was there everything else in the universe was merely everywhere else and he did not trouble to locate points as they related to one another where did the intruders come from from somewhere or other it did not matter exactly where where was the food source that the boy visited some other somewhere where had his people come from in the long ages before he himself had been born it didnt matter the central here had existed for a long long timelonger than one could comprehend even for the oldest one himself here had sailed through space since it was built and outfitted and launched here had seen many births and deaths nearly five million of themthough at no one time did it hold more than a few hundred living things and seldom more than a few score here had seen constant slow changes through all that time the newborns were larger softer fatter and more helpless as time went on the adults were taller slower less hairy here had often seen rapid changes as well at such times the children were well advised to wake the oldest one sometimes the changes were political for here had held a thousand different social systems one at a time there were spans of a generation or two or even of centuries when the existing culture was sensate and hedonistic or puritanically stark when one individual became a despot or a divinity or when none rose above any other at all there was never a democratic republic like those earth had triedhere was not big enough for representative governmentand only once a racially stratified society there had been many ideologies here and a various collection of moralities but only one religionat least in the last many millennia there was only room for one when its living god rested among the children all the days of their lives and awoke to smite or favor when it chose for many eons here held no true people at all only a collection of puzzled semisentients confronted with challenges that had been engineered to make them wise the process worked only slowly it took a hundred thousand years before the first of them comprehended even the concept of writing nearly half a million more before one was found to be wise enough to be trusted with real work to do that honor had gone to the oldest one himself it had not been welcome no other had earned it since and that too was a failing the oldest one knew somehow he had failed what had he done wrong surely he had done his best he had always particularly in the first few centuries of his machinebodied afterlife been diligent and careful in supervising every act of the children when they did wrong he punished when they did well he praised always he cared for their needs but perhaps that was where he had gone wrong there had been a time long and long ago when he had awakened with a terrible pain in the metal carapace he dwelt within it was not the pain of flesh but the sensors report of unacceptable physical damage but it was quite as alarming his children were gathered around in terror all shouting at once as they displayed to him the hackeddead corpse of a young female she was insane they cried quaking she tried to destroy you the oldest ones quick check of systems revealed that the damage was trivial it had been an explosive of some sort and all it had cost him was a few effectors and some destruction of control nets nothing that could not be repaired he asked to know why she had done this their answers came only slowly for they were terrified but they came she wanted us to destroy you she said you were damaging us and that we could not grow without you we beg forgiveness we know we did wrong by not killing her sooner you did wrong the oldest one said justly but that was not the reason if any such person appears among you again you are to awaken me at once he may be restrained if it is necessary but he may not be killed and thenwas it a few centuries later it seemed only the wink of an eye and then there had been the time when they had not awakened him soon enough for a dozen generations they had failed to observe the laws and the reproductive budgets had not been met and the total census of his living children was down to four individuals before they dared risk his displeasure by waking him well they felt it that had nearly been the end of all plans because only one of the four was a female and she near the end of childbearing he had used a dozen years of his life then waking fretfully every few months disciplining teachingworrying with the help of biological lore stored deep in his oldest memories he had insured that the two babies the female managed to bear were also female with stored sperm from the terrified males he kept the gene pool as diverse as he could but it was a near thing and some things had been forever lost no other wouldbe assassin had ever risen against him if only one would no other like himself had ever appeared the oldest one recognized that he had no real hope there would ever be another from his children if it could happen it would have there had been time ten thousand generations of his children had been born and died since then over a span of a quarter of a million years when the oldest one moved again all his children jumped too they knew he would act they did not know what the actions would be the repair mechanisms in the a corridors are to be replaced he said three artificers see to it there was a stilled murmur of relief from the seventyodd adultspunishment always came first and if his first orders were not punishment then there would be none this time the three artificers the leader pointed to were less relieved because that meant some days of very hard work in manhandling new machines to the green corridors and bringing back the old for repair but it was their excuse to get away from the awful presence of the oldest one they seized it immediately the male intruder and the older female are to be penned together he said if they were to breed they had best get on with it and better to start with the older female do any of you survive who have had experience with the rapporter three of the children were pushed reluctantly forward one of you will educate the younger female he instructed do any survive who have had experience in preparing intruders for storage i prepared the last two the leader said also there are persons who assisted me still alive see that the skills are maintained the oldest one ordered if one of you should die he is to be prepared by the others and new persons must be taught that was a convenience if the skills had been lostand the lives of these creatures were so brief that many skills did get lost while he was powered downit would have been necessary to set some of them to practicing brain surgery on others to be ready in case he decided that these intruders too should go into storage continuing down his priority list he gave additional instructions dead or spindly plantings should be replaced all permitted areas of here should be visited at least once a month and as the number of infants and young was only eleven at least five babies should be born each year for the next ten years the oldest one then powered down his external receptors resumed his place at the central communications terminals and plugged himself in to his longterm memories all about the central spindle his children were hastening to do his bidding as the leader parceled out assignments half a dozen left to dig up berryfruit bushes and airvines to replace the defective plants others went to deal with the captives and attend to housekeeping chores several young couples were sent to their quarters to breed if they had had other plans they were now deferred at this particular awakening the oldest one was not dissatisfied with his children and whether they were dissatisfied with him did not occur to him to wonder his concerns were elsewhere with his externals reduced to the standby trickle of his resting mode the oldest one was not resting he was assimilating these new factors into his reference store there was change change was danger change was also opportunity if approached right change might be used to advance his purposes and could not be allowed to interfere with them he had dealt with the immediate and the tactical now his attention went to the strategic and the ultimate he reached into his longterm memory some memories represented events very far away in space and in time and were frightening even to the oldest one some were quite near and not frightening at all for example those stored intruder intelligences the boy called the dead men there was nothing in them to be frightening but oh how irritating they could be when the intruders first blundered here shattered castaways in their tiny ships the oldest one had had a moment of terror they were unexplained who were they were they the lords he was trying to serve come to reproach his presumption he quickly learned they were not were they then some other breed of servants to the lords from whom he could learn new modes of service they were not that either they were wanderers they had come here by chance in ancient abandoned ships they did not truly know how to use when their ships course directors neutralized themselves as they were meant to do on arriving here they were terrified they were not as it turned out even very interesting he had used up many days of life with them as they appeared first one then another lone adventurer then a group of three in all there had been nearly twenty of them in nine ships not counting the child who had been born here and none of them worth the concern they had caused him the first few he had had his children sacrifice at once in order to put their stored intelligence into the machine form that he could best deal with the others he had given orders to preserve even to allow to roam free when it appeared they might be more interesting in an independent life in the unused areas of here he had given them everything he perceived they might need he had even given some of them immortality as he himself had been made immortalas fewer than one in a hundred thousand of his children ever were it was a waste alive and capricious or stored for eternity they were more trouble than they were worth they brought diseases to his children and some of them had died they caught diseases from the children and some of the intruders died too and they did not store well properly programmed into his longterm memories by the machinedirected techniques that had been used on him thousands of centuries ago and taught to his children ever since they performed badly their time sense was deficient their response to interrogatories was erratic large sections of their memories were gone some of them could not be read at all the fault was not in the techniques they were defective to begin with when the oldest one himself had been made immortal after the death of his flesh he awoke as his exact self all the knowledge and skills he had ever had were duplicated in the machine store so with his children when at random intervals he chose one to store so even with his flesh ancestors so far back that even his own immense age dwindled in comparison so with those other stored memories that he did not like even to consult not so with the intruders there was something wrong with their chemistry they recorded imperfectly and retrieved haphazardly and there were times when he thought to erase them all he had banished the little storage spheres and their readout systems to the remote periphery of here and his children never went near them he had decided to preserve them at the last only out of thrift a time might come when he would need them perhaps that time was now with a sense of reluctant distaste as a man might reach into a sewer to retrieve a dropped gem the oldest one opened the pathways that linked him to the stored intruder minds and recoiled three of the children hurrying janine around the curvature of the spindle from her pen to the rapporter saw the oldest ones effectors quiver and external lenses flash open they stumbled and stopped waiting fearfully for what would come next nothing came next the effectors relaxed again the lenses powered down to standby after a moment the children collected themselves and dragged janine to the waiting metallic couch but inside the oldest ones metal shell he had received his greatest shock in many awakenings someone had been interfering with his stored memories it was not merely that they were mad they had always been mad worse they were in some ways more sane now or at least more lucid as though something had been trying to reprogram them there were inputs he had never given them they contained memories he had never shared these were not storage that had come to the surface from their past lives they were new they spoke of organized knowledge on a scale that dwarfed even his own spaceships and machines living intelligences by the tens of billions machine intelligences that were slow and even almost stupid by his standards but possessed incredible stores to draw on it was no wonder that he had reacted physically as a man shocked out of a reverie might start and twitch somehow his stored intruders had made contact with the culture they had come from it was easy for the oldest one to learn how that contact had been made from here to the food facility by means of the longunused communications net interpreted and processed on the food facility by a pathetically crude machine transmitted the long lightdays to the planets that circled that nearest star by means of the creeping electromagnetic impulses of lightspeed radio contemptible until one considered how much information had been transmitted each way the oldest one was like a hydraulic engineer transfixed at the base of a hydroelectric dam watching a thin needle of water spurt hundreds of meters into the air out of an almost invisible pinhole the quantity was trivial but that so much poured through so tiny an opening bespoke the pressure of a vast body behind the dam and the leak went both ways the oldest one acknowledged that he had been careless in interrogating the stored intruders to find out what they knew he had let them know much about himself about here about the technology that guided it about his consecration and about the lords his life was meant to serve at least the leak had been tiny and the transmissions confused by the imperfections of the stored intelligences themselves there was no part of that storage inaccessible to the oldest one he opened them up for study and traced every bit he did not speak to them he allowed their minds to flow into his own the dead men could not resist him any more than a prepared frog on a dissecting table could resist a surgeons scalpel when he was done he withdrew to ponder were his plans in jeopardy he activated his internal scanning systems and a threedimensional tank of the galaxy sprang up in his mind it had no real existence there was no vantage point from which any person could have seen it he himself did not see it he simply knew it was there it was a sort of trompeloeil an optical illusion except that it was not optical on it very far away an object appeared haloed in light it had been many centuries since the oldest one had allowed himself to observe that object it was time to look at it again the oldest one reached down into and activated long undisturbed memory stores it was not an easy experience it was almost the equivalent of a session on the analysts couch for a human for he was uncovering thoughts memories guilts worries and uncertainties that his conscious mindthe reasoning and problemsolving circuits had long since decided to lay away those memories were not gone they had not become impotent they still held shame and fear for him was he doing the right thing did he dare act on his own responsibility the old circular arguments raced through his mind as they had done two hundred thousand years before and were no closer to resolution it was not possible for the oldest one to fugue into hysteria or depression his circuits did not allow it it was however possible for him to be terrified after a prolonged time he emerged from his introspection he was still afraid but he was committed he had to act the children scattered in terror as the oldest one woke once more his forward effectors quivered straightened and pointed at a young female caught in midpassage nearby any other would have done as well come with me he ordered she sobbed but followed her mate took a step after her as they hurried toward a goldlit corridor but he had not been told to go with them and so he stopped and looked sadly after ten minutes earlier they had been mating in pleasure and obedience now he was not sure he would ever see her again the oldest ones cruising pace was not a great deal faster than a rapid walk but the little difference kept the weeping female trotting and panting to keep up he glided on past machines that had not been used even in his memorieswall aligners landers huge as houses a queer little sixscrewed thing like a helicopter that had once though even the oldest one did not remember so far back been used to stock heechee heaven with its angels the gold skeins changed to radiant silver the silver to purest white a passage that none of the children had ever entered stood waiting open for them the heavy door fanned wide as the oldest one approached by the time they reached a place where the female had never been had not known existed where the skeins in the wall ran in a riot of a dozen colors and strange patterns flickered in panels all around a great dim chamber she was out of breath no rest go there the oldest one commanded adjust those wheels watch mine do as i do at opposite sides of the chamber too widely spaced for any one individual to operate them were controls set on the floor at each was a sort of angled bench very uncomfortable for the young female to sit on in front of each bench a sort of hummock of ridged wheels ten of them in a row with rainbow lights glinting faintly between them the oldest one ignored the bench and touched an effector to the nearest wheel turning it slowly the lights shivered and rippled green brightened to yellow to pale orange with a triple row of ochre lines in the middle of it match my pattern the young female tried to obey the wheel was terribly hard to turn as though it had not been moved for a terribly long time the colors merged and swirled and it took forever for her to achieve the pattern of the controls before the oldest one he did not hurry or reprove her he merely waited he knew she was doing her best by the time all ten wheels were showing the pattern he had chosen tears were gone and sweat was stinging her eyes and trickling through her sparse beard the colors were not a perfect match between the doubled redundant safed controls the rosette of screens that should have displayed their course coordinates was blank this was not surprising the surprise might have been that after eight hundred thousand years the controls worked at all but they did work the oldest one touched something under his own bank of controls and quickly wonderfully the lights developed a life of their own they blurred and strengthened again and now as the automatic finetuners took over the two patterns became identical the rosette of screens sprang into life with a pattern of glowing dots and lines the young female peered fearfully at the screens she did not know that what she saw was a field of stars she had never seen a star or heard of one she felt what happened next so did everyone else here the intruders in their pens the near hundred children all over the construct the young female and the oldest one himself all felt it felt suddenly queasy as the eternal gravity died and was replaced by tweaks of pseudoacceleration punctuating weightlessness after more than threequarters of a million years of rolling slowly around earths very distant sun the artifact pulled itself into a new orbit and surged away s ya lavorovna at precisely fivefifteen am a gentle green glow appeared in the bedside monitor of ya lavorosrnabroadhead it was not bright enough to disturb deep slumber but she had been less than half asleep very well she called i am already awake you do not have to continue this program but give me a moment da gospozha her secretary acknowledged but the green glow remained if s ya did not show further signs of alertness the secretary would buzz gently in another minute regardless of what she told it to do that was what she had told it to do when she wrote the program in this case there was no need essie woke up quite clear in her mind there was surgery again this morning and robin would not be here because old peter herter had given warning before he invaded the worlds minds there had been time to prepare there had been almost no damage not real damage but what made that possible was a frantic flurry of postponing and rearranging and in the course of it robins flights had been inextricably confused pity worse than that even fear but it was not as though he had not tried essie accepted that consolation from herself it was good to know that he had tried am i allowed to eat she called no gospozha broadhead nothing at all not even a drink of water her secretary responded at once do you wish your messages perhaps what messages if they were of interest at all she would take them she decided anything to keep her mind off the surgery and the indignities of catheters and tubes that bound her to this bed there is a voiceonly from your husband gospozha but if you wish i believe i can reach him direct i have a location if he is still there do so experimentally essie rose to sit on the edge of the bed while she was waiting for the connection to be completed or more likely for her husband to be found in some transit lounge and called to the comm she carefully kept the dozen tubes unkinked as she rose to her feet apart from feeling weak she did not feel bad fearful thirsty even shaky but there was no pain perhaps it would all have seemed more serious if it had hurt more and perhaps that would have been good these months of demeaning annoyance were only an irritation there was enough of anna karenina in essie to long to suffer how trivializing the world had come to be her life was on the line and all she felt was discomfort in her private parts gospozha broadhead yes the visual program appeared looking apologetic your husband cannot be reached at present he is en route from mexico city to dallas and has just taken off all the aircrafts communications are at present required for navigation mexico city dallas the poor man he would be circumnavigating the earth to get to her then at least give me the recorded message she ordered da gospozha face and greenish glow shrank away and out of the soundcircuits her husbands voice addressed her honey im having a little trouble making connections i got a charter to merida supposed to make connections to miami but i missed the flight now im hoping to make a connection to dallas and anyway im on my way pause he sounded fretful which was no surprise and essie could almost see him casting around for something cheerful to say but it was all rambling something about the great news about prayer fans something about the heechee who werent heechee andand just a babble poor creature he was trying to be bright for her she listened to the sound of his heart rather than to his words until he paused again and then said oh hell essie i wish i were there i will be fast as i can in the meantime take care of yourself if youve got any spare time before you uh before wilma gets going ive told albert to tape all the essential stuff for you hes a good old program long pause i love you he said and was gone s ya lay back on her gently humming bed wondering what to do with the next hour of her life she missed her husband quite a lot especially in view of the fact that in some ways she considered him quite a silly man good old program how foolish of him to anthropomorphize computer programs his albert einstein program was she had no other word for it cute and it had been his idea to make the bioassay unit look like a pet and give it a name squiffy it was like giving a name to a cleaning machine or a shotgun foolish unless it were done by someone one cared for in which case it was instead endearing but machines were machines at the graduate institute at akademogorsk young s ya lavorovna had learned very completely that machine intelligence was not personal you built them up from adding machines to numbercrunchers you packed them full of data you constructed for them a store of appropriate responses to stimuli and provided them with a hierarchical scale of appropriateness and that was all there was to it now and then to be sure you were surprised by what came out of a program you had written of course you were that was the nature of the exercise none of that implied the existence of free will on the part of the machine or of personal identity all the same it was rather touching to watch him crack jokes with his programs he was a touching man he touched her in places where she was most open and vulnerable because in some ways he was very like that only other man in her life who had ever really mattered to her her father when semya yagrodna was a small girl her father had been the central person in the worldtall skinny old man who played the ukulele and the mandolin and taught biology at the gymnasium he was delighted to have a bright and inquiring child it might have pleased him even more if her talents had seemed to go toward the life sciences rather than to physics and engineering but he cherished her as she was he taught her about the world when he could no longer teach her mathematics because she had surpassed him you must be aware of what you will have to deal with he explained to her even here even now even when i was a young boy in stalins time and the womens movements were promoting girls to lead machinegun squads and run tractors this is always the same semya it is a fact of history that mathematics is for the young and that girls excel equally with boys until the age of fifteen perhaps or at most twenty and then just when the boys are turning into lobachewskis and fermats the girls stop why for childbearing for marriage for heaven knows what we will not let it happen to you small dove study read learn comprehend every day for as many hours as you must and i will assist you in all the ways i can and he did and from the ages of eight to eighteen young semya yagrodna lavorovna came home from school every day deposited one book bag in their apartment and picked up another and trotted away to the old yellow building off the nevsky prospekt where her tutor lived she had never dropped out of mathematics and for this she had her father to thank she had never learned to dance eitheror to try a thousand sorts of scent and makeup or to datenot until she was away at akademogorsk and for that also she had her father to thank where the world tried to force her into a female role he defended her like a tiger but at home to be sure there was a need to cook and sew and to polish the rosewood chairs and none of those things were done by him her father in physical appearance had not looked in the least like robin broadhead but in other ways so like robin had asked her to marry him when they had known each other less than a year it had taken her a full year beyond that to decide to say yes she talked to everyone she knew about it her roommate the dean of her department her former love who had married the girl next door stay away from this one s ya they all advised her on the face of it the advice was sound for who was he a feckless millionaire still mourning a woman he had loved and shatteringly lost guiltridden just out of years of intensive psychoanalysiswhat a perfect description of the completely hopeless marriage risk but on the other hand nevertheless nevertheless he touched her they had gone to new orleans for mardi gras in stinging cold weather sitting most of the days inside the cafe du monde never even seeing the parade the rest of the time they stayed in their hotel out of the sleet and the crowds and made love emerging only for fried sweet dough with clouds of powdered sugar and sweet milky chicorylaced coffee in the mornings robin bestirred himself to be gallant shall we go for a cruise on the river today visit an art gallery dance at a night club but she could see that he did not want to do any of these things this man twice her age who wanted to marry he sitting with his hands cupped around his coffee as though merely getting warm were formidable enough a task to contemplate for one day and she made her decision she said i think instead we might get married after all and so they had not that day but as soon as they could s ya never regretted it it was not a thing to regret after the first few weeks she had not even worried about how it would turn out he was not a jealous man or a mean one if he was often absorbed in his work well so was she there was only this question of the woman gellekiara moyrilin the lost love she might well be dead was as good as dead in any case because she was hopelessly out of human reach forever it was well known that this was so from the fundamental laws of physics but there were times essie was sure when her husband did not believe it to be so and then she wondered if there was any possibility of a choice between them how would robin choose and what if the laws of physics after all turned out to permit an exception now and then there was the matter of the heechee ships and how could one apply known physical law to them as with every other thinking person in the world the questions raised by the heechee had intrigued s ya for a long time the gateway asteroid had been discovered while she was still a schoolgirl the headlines announcing new findings had come every few weeks all through her college years some of her classmates had taken the plunge and specialized in the theory of heechee control systems two were on gateway now at least three had shipped out and never returned the heechee ships were not uncontrollable they could in fact be controlled precisely the superficial mechanics of the process were known each ship possessed five maindrive verfliers and five auxiliaries they located coordinates in space and once set the ship went there again how it then returned unerringly to its place of origin or usually did if it did not run out of fuel or encounter a mischancea triumph of cybernetics that s ya knew no human agency could reproduce the difficulty was that until this very second no human being knew quite how to read the controls but what about the next second or the one after that with information pouring in from the food factory and heechee heaven with dead men talking with at least one semicompetent human pilot the boy wanwith all this and especially with the flood of new knowledge that might be unlocked from the prayer fans how long before some of the mysteries were solved perhaps not very long at all s ya wished she could be a part of it all as her classmates had become as her husband had become she wished even more that she did not suspect what part he most wanted to play but the suspicion remained if robin could make a heechee ship fly him to any destination he chose in all the universe she thought she knew what that destination would be semya yagrodna lavorovnabroadhead called to her secretary how much time do i have the program appeared and said it is now five twentytwo dr liederman is expected at six fortyfive you will then be prepared for the procedure which will occur at eight oclock you have a little more than an hour and a quarter perhaps you would like to rest s ya chuckled it always amused her when her own programs offered her advice she did not however feel any need to respond to it have menus been prepared for today and tomorrow she asked nyet gospozha that was both a relief and a disappointment at least robin had not prescribed more fattening foods for todayor perhaps his prescription had been overruled because of the operation select something she ordered the program was quite capable of preparing menus it was only because of robin himself that either of them ever gave a thought to such routine chores but robin was robin and there were times when cooking was a hobby for him cutting onions paperthin for a salad and standing to stir a stew for hours sometimes what he produced was awful sometimes not essie was not critical because she was not very interested in what she ate and also because she was grateful that she felt no need to concern herself with such matters in this respect at least robin surpassed her father no wait she added struck with a thought when robin comes home he will be hungry serve him a snackthose crullers and the new orleans coffee as at the cafe du monde da gospozha how devious you are thought essie smiling to herself one hour and twelve minutes left it would do no harm to rest on the other hand she was not sleepy she could she thought interrogate her medical program again but she had no real wish to hear about the procedures she faced an additional time such large pieces to take from someone elses body for the sake of her own the kidney yes one might well sell that and still have something left as a student essie had known comrades who had done that might even have done it herself if she had been just a shade poorer than she actually was but although she knew very little more of anatomy than her father had taught her at his knee she knew enough to be sure that the person or persons who had given her all those other tissues would not have enough left to go on living with it was a queasy feeling almost as queasy as that other feeling that came with knowing that even with full medical from this particular invasion of her person by wilma liedermans knives she might not return still an hour and eleven minutes essie sat up once more whether she was to live or not she was as dutiful a wife as she had been a daughter and if robin wished her to concern herself with prayer fans and heechee she would she addressed the computer terminal i wish the albert einstein program sixty billion gigabits when essie broadhead said i wish the albert einstein program she set a large number of events in motion very few of these events were visible to the unaided senses they did not take place in the macroscopic physical world but in a universe composed largely of charges and pathways operating on the scale of the electron the individual units were tiny the total was not being made up of some sixty billion gigabits of information at akademogorsk young s yas professors had schooled her in the then current computer logics of ion optics and magnetic bubbles she had learned to trick her computers into doing many marvelous things they could find milliondigit prime numbers or calculate the tides on a mudflat for a thousand years they could take a childs scribble of house and daddy and refine it into an engineers rendering of an architectural plan and a tailors dummy of a man they could rotate the house add a sunporch sheath it in stucco or cover it with ivy they could shave off a beard add a wig costume the man for yachting or golfing for boardroom or bar these were marvelous programs for nineteenyearold semya she found them thrilling but she had grown since then by comparison with the programs she was now writing for her secretary for albert einstein and for her many clients those early ones were slow and stumbling caricatures they did not have the advantage of circuits borrowed from heechee technology or of a circulating memory store of x b bits of course even albert did not use all sixty billion gigabits all the time for one thing they were not all shared even the shared stores were occupied by tens of thousands of programs as subtle and complicated as albert and by tens of millions of duller ones the program called albert einstein slipped through and among the thousands and the millions without interference traffic signals warned him away from occupied circuits guideposts led him to subroutines and libraries needed to fulfill his functions his path was never a straight line it was a tree of branching decision points a lightningstroke of zigzag turns and reverses it was not truly a path either albert never moved he was never in a specific place to move from it is at least arguable whether albert was anything at all he had no continuous existence when robin broadhead was through with him and turned him off he ceased to be and his subroutines picked up other tasks when he was turned on again he recreated himself from whatever circuits were idle according to the program s ya had written he was no more real than an equation and no less so than god i wish s ya lavorovnabroadhead had said before her voice was halfway through the first vowel the soundactivated gate in the monitors receiver summoned up her secretarial program the secretary did not appear she read the first trace of the name that followed the albert einstein matched it against her command store made a probabilistic assessment of the rest and issued an instruction that was not all the secretary did before that she had recognized the voice of s ya and confirmed that it was that of an authorized personthe person who had written her in fact she checked her store for undelivered messages found several and weighed their urgency she made a quick sweep of essies telemetry readings to estimate her physical condition retrieved the memory of her proximate surgery balanced them against the messages and the present instruction and decided the messages need not be delivered and in fact could be handled by essies surrogate all that took very little time and involved only a minor fraction of the secretarys full program she did not need to remember for instance what she was supposed to look like or how her voice was supposed to sound so she did not bother the secretarys instruction woke albert einstein he did not at first know that he was albert einstein as he read his program he discovered several things about himself first that he was an interactive informationretrieval program whereupon he searched for and found addresses for the principal categories of information he was supposed to supply second that he was heuristic and normative which obliged him to look for the rules in the form of go and nogo gates that determined his decisionmaking third that he was the property of robin aka robinette rob robby bob or bobbystetley broadhead and would be required to interact with him on a basis of knowing him this impelled the albert program to access the robin broadhead files and rehearse their contentsby far the most timeconsuming part of his task so far when all this was done he discovered his name and the details of his appearance he made a series of arbitrary choices of costumepullover sweater or stained gray sweatshirt slippers or frayed tennis shoes with a toe poking out socks or noneand appeared in the tank of the monitor in the guise of the real albert einstein pipe in hand mild eyes humorously inquiring before the last echo of the command had died program he had had plenty of time it had taken essie nearly fourtenths of a second to speak his name as she had spoken in english he greeted her in the same language good quick check of local time morning fast assessment of essies mood and condition mrs broadhead if she had been dressed for the office he would have called her lavorovna essie studied him appraisingly for several seconds an infinity of time for albert he did not waste it he was a sharedtime program and the parts of his capacity that were not in active use at any particular picosecond busied themselves at other tasks whatever task was going while he waited parts of him were excused to help other programs make a weather forecast for a sportfishing vessel leaving long island sound teach the conjugation of french verbs to a little girl animate a sexual doll for a wealthy and quirky old recluse and tally gold prices received from the peking exchange there were almost always other tasks on line when there were not there were the waiting batchprocess files of less urgent problemsnuclear particle path analysis the refinement of asteroid orbits the balancing of a million checkbooksthat any of the sixty billion gigabits might turn a hand to in an idle moment albert was not the same as robins other programsthe lawyer the doctor the secretary the psychoanalyst or any of the surrogates who functioned for robin broadhead when robin was busy or disinclined albert shared many memories with them they freely accessed each others files each had a specific universe of action tasked for specific needs but they could not carry out their tasks without awareness of each other apart from that they were each the personal property of robin broadhead slaved to his will so sophisticated was albert that he could read contextual clues and deduce imperatives he was not limited in his responses by what robin said to him he was able to read deeper questions from the totality of everything robin had ever said to any of his programs albert could not betray a confidence of robins or fail to recognize what was confidential generally there were exceptions the person who had written alberts program in the first place could easily write an overriding command and had robin instructed you to prepare summaries for me essie told her creation give them to me now she watched critically and also admiringly as the program she bad written nodded scratched its ear with its pipestem and began to speak albert was quite a good program she thought with pride for a collection of electronic impulses living in rag storesweakly crystalline dichalcogenides with the structure of a wet dishragalbert was a rather attractive person she adjusted her tubes and piping and leaned back against pillows to listen to what albert had to say it was all most exceedingly interesting even to her even at this time when inwhat was itin less than one hour ten minutes she would be sponged and stripped and shaved and basted for further invasions of her inner person as all she demanded of the albert program at this time was edited memories of conversations that had already occurred she knew that he had dismissed large parts of himself to other work but what was left she observed critically was quite solid the transition from the interactive albert waiting for her question to the remembered albert talking to her husband was done smoothly and without jumpsif one did not look for such minor imperfections as that the pipe was suddenly alight and the socks abruptly pulled up over the ankles satisfied essie paid attention to the content of what was going on it was not just one conversation she perceived there were at least three robin must have been spending a lot of time talking to his science program in brasilia and while one part of her mind was listening to the exciting news from heechee heaven another part was smiling at herself how amusing that she should be pleased at this evidence that he had not used his hotel suite for other purposes he could not have been blamed if he had chosen a living companion instead even a female one under the circumstances with a main lover in no condition to be very responsive she would certainly have felt free to do the same but she admitted to herself that she was pleased and then made herself attend to the truly fascinating things that were being said so much happening so much to absorb first the heechee the heechee in heechee heaven were not heechee or at least those old ones were not it was proved by the bioassay of the dna albert was earnestly assuring her husband punctuating his arguments with pipe thrusts the bioassay had produced not an answer but a puzzle a basic chemistry that was neither human nor yet inhuman enough to come from creatures evolved around some other star also said albert puffing there is the question of the heechee seat it does not fit a human being but neither does it fit the old ones so for whom was it designed alas robin we do not know a quick flicker the socks now gone the pipe out and being filled and albert was talking about prayer fans he had not albert apologized unriddled the fans the literature was vast but he had searched it all there was no imaginable application of energy and no instrumentation that had not been applied to them yet they had stayed mute one can speculate albert said striking a match to his pipe that all of the fans left for us by the heechee are garbled perhaps to tantalize us i do not believe this rafliniert st der herr hietschie aber boshaft st er nicht in spite of everything essie laughed out loud der herr hietschie indeed had she written this sense of comedy into her program she thought of interrupting him to command that he display this section of his instructions but already that replay had ended and a slightly less rumpled albert was talking about astrophysics here essie almost closed her ears for she quickly had enough of curious cosmologies was the universe openended or closed she did not strongly care was some large quantity of mass missing in the sense that not enough could be observed to account for known gravitational effects very well then let it stay missing essie felt no need to go looking for it someones fantasy of storms of indetectible pious and someone elsesomeone named kiubesnotion that mass might be created from nothing interested her very little but when the conversation switched to black holes she paid close attention she was not really concerned with the subject she was concerned with robins concern for it and that she told herself justly as albert rambled on was petty of her robin had kept no mean secrets he had told her at once of the love of his life the woman named gelleklara moynlin whom he had abandoned in a black holehad told her actually far more than she wanted to know she said stop instantly the threedimensional figure in the tank abandoned the word it had been speaking in midsyllable it gazed politely at her awaiting orders albert she said carefully why did you tell me robin was studying question of black holes the figure coughed why mrs broadhead albert said i have been playing a recording prepared especially for you not this time why did you volunteer this information other time alberts expression cleared and he said humbly that directive did not come from my program gospozha i thought not you have been interacting with the psychoanalytic program yes gospozha as you programmed me to do and what was the purpose of this intervention from the sigfrid von shrink program i cannot say for surebut he added hastily perhaps i can offer a guess perhaps it is that the sigfrid estimates your husband should be more open with you that program is not charged with care of my mental health no gospozha not with yours but with your husbands gospozha if you wish more information let me suggest that you consult that program not me i can do more than that she blazed and so she could she could speak three wordsdaite gorod polymatand albert harriet sigfrid von shrink every one of robins programs would be subsumed into the powerful program of her own polymath the one she had used to write them in the first place the overriding program that contained every instruction they owned and then let them try cunning evasions on her then let them see if they could maintain the confidentiality of their memories then god essie said aloud am actually planning to teach lesson to my own programs gospozha she caught her breath it was almost a laugh nearly a sob no she said cancel above i find no fault with your programming albert nor with shrinks if shrink program judges robin should release internal tensions i cannot overrule and will not pry further she corrected herself fairly the curious thing about essie lavorovnabroadhead was that fairness meant something to her even in dealing with her constructs a program like albert einstein was large complex subtle and powerful not even s ya lavorovna could write such a program alone for that she needed polymath a program like albert einstein learned and grew and redefined its tasks as it went along not even its author could say why it gave one bit of information and not another one could only observe that it was working and judge it by how it carried out its orders it was unfair to the program to blame it and essie could not be so unfair but as she moved restlessly among her pillows it came to her that the world was not entirely fair to her not fair at all it was not fair that all these fairytale wonders should be pouring in upon the worldnot now it was not fair that these perils and perplexities should manifest themselves not now not while she might not live to see how they came out could peter herter be dealt with would the others of his party be saved could the lessons of the prayer fans and the explorers make it possible to do all the things robin promised feed the world make all men well and happy allow the human race to explore the universe all these questions and before this days sun had set she might be dead and never to know the answers it was not fair any of it and least fair was that if she died of this operation she would never know truly which way robin would have chosen if somehow his lost love could be found again she became aware that time was passing albert sat patiently in the tank moving only occasionally to suck his pipe or scratch under the hem of his floppy sweaterto remind her that is that he was still in standby mode essies thrifty cyberneticians soul was indignantly ordering her to use the program or turn it offwhat a shocking waste of machine time but she hesitated there were questions still to ask at the door the nurse was looking in good morning mrs broadhead she said when she saw that essie was wide awake is it time essie asked her voice suddenly unsteady oh not for a few minutes yet you can go on with your machine if you want to essie shook her head is no point she said and dismissed the program it was a decision lightly taken it did not occur to her that some of the unasked questions might be consequential and when albert einstein was dismissed he did not allow himself to disintegrate at once the whole of anything is never told said henry james albert knew henry james only as an address the information behind which he had never had occasion to seek but he understood the meaning of that law he could never tell the whole of anything even to his master he would fail in his programming if he tried but what parts of the whole to select at its lowest structural level alberts program was gated to pass items of a certain measured importance and reject others simple enough but the program was redundant some items came to it through several gates sometimes as many as hundreds of gates and when some of the gates said go and others said no go what was a program to do there were algorithms to test importance but at some levels of complexity the algorithms taxed even the resources of sixty billion gigabitsor of a universe full of bits meyer and stockmeyer had proved long ago that regardless of computer power problems existed which could not be solved in the life of the universe alberts problems were not quite that immense but he could not find an algorithm to decide for him for instance whether he should bring up the puzzling implications of machs principle as applied to heechee history worse he was a proprietary program it would have been interesting to pass on his conjectures on the subject to a pure science research program but that his basic programming did not permit so albert held himself together for nearly a millisecond reconsidering his options should he next time robin summoned him volunteer his misgivings about the potentially terrifying truth that lay behind heechee heaven he reached no conclusion in all that long one thousandth of a second and his parts were needed elsewhere so albert allowed himself to come apart this part he poured into slow memory that part into ongoing problems as needed until all of albert einstein had soaked into the x bits like water into sand until not even a stain was left some of his routines joined with others in a simulated war game in which key west was invaded from grand cayman some turned up to assist the trafficcontroller program at dallasfort worth as robin broadheads plane entered its landing pattern much much later some of him helped to monitor essies vital functions as dr wilma liederman began to cut one little bit hours after helped to solve the mystery of the prayer fans and the simplest crudest tiniest part of all stayed on to supervise the program that prepared cajun coffee and beignets for robin when he arrived and to see that the house was clean for him sixty billion gigabits can do much they even do windows at the halfway point to love someone is a grace to marry someone is a contract the part of me that loved essie was loving her wholeheartedly sank in pain and terror when she relapsed surged in fearful joy when she showed signs of recovering i had plenty of occasion for both essie died twice in surgery before i could get home and again twelve days later when they had to go in again that last time they made her clinically dead on purpose stopped heart and breath kept only the brain alive and every time they reanimated her i was frightened to think she would live because if she lived it meant she might die one more time and i could not stand it but slowly painfully she began to gain weight and wilma told me the tide had turned as when the spiral begins to glow in a heechee ship at the halfway point and you know youre going to live through the trip i spent all that time weeks and weeks of it hanging around the house so that when essie could see me i would be there and all that time the part of me that had contracted to be married to her was resenting the bond and wishing i were free how do you account for that that was a good occasion for guilt and guilt is a feeling that comes readily to meas my old psychoanalytic program used to tell me all the time and when i went in to see essie looking like a mummy of herself the joy and worry filled my heart and the guilt and resentment clogged my tongue i would have given my life to make her well but that did not seem a practical strategy or at least i could not see any way to make that deal and the other guilty and hostile part of me wanted to be free to dwell on lost kiara and whether somehow i might find her again but she mended essie did she mended fast the sunken bags of flesh under her eyes filled to be only bruises the tubes came out of her nostrils she ate like a pig before my very eyes she was filling out the bust beginning to swell the hips regaining their power to startle my compliments to the doctor i told wilma liederman when i caught her on her way in to see her patient she said sourly yes shes doing fine i dont like the way you said that i told her whats the matter she relented nothing really robin all her tests are fine shes in such a hurry though thats good isnt it up to a point it is and now she added i have to get in to see my patient who will be up and about any day now and maybe back to normal in a week or two what good news that was and how reluctantly i received it i went through all those weeks with something hanging over me sometimes it seemed like doom like old peter herter blackmailing the world and nothing the world could do to resist it or like the heechee stirring into anger as we invaded their complex and private worlds sometimes it seemed like golden gifts of opportunity new technologies new hopes new wonders to explore and exploit you would think that i would distinguish between hopes and worries right wrong both scared the hell out of me as good old sigfrid used to tell me i have a great talent not only for guilt but also for worry and when you came right down to it i had some fairly real things to worry about not just essie when you reach a certain age you have it seems to me a right to expect some parts of your life to stay stable like what for instance like money for instance i was used to a lot of it and now here was my lawyer program telling me that i had to watch my pennies but i promised hanson bover a million cash i said and im going to pay it sell some stock ive sold stock robin he wasnt angry he wasnt programmed to be able to be really angry but he could be wretched and he was so sell some more whats the best to get rid of none of it is best robin the food minesre down because of the fire the fish farms still havent recovered from losing the fingerlings a month or two from now a month or two from now isnt when i want the money sell and when i signed him off and called bover up to find out where to send his million he actually seemed surprised in view of gateway corps action he said i thought youd call our arrangement off a deal is a deal i said we can let the legalities hang they dont mean much while gateway has preempted me he was suspicious immediately what is it that i do that makes people suspicious of me when i am going miles out of my way to be fair why do you want to hold off on the legalities he demanded rubbing the top of his head agitatedlywas it sunburned again i dont want to i said it just doesnt make any difference as soon as you lift your injunction gateway will drop theirs on me alongside bovers scowling face my secretary programs appeared she looked like a cartoon of the good angel whispering into bovers ear but actually what she was saying was for me sixty seconds until mr herters reminder she said i had forgotten that old peter had given us another of his two hour notices i said to bover its time to button up for peter herters next jab and hung upi didnt really care if he remembered i only wanted to terminate the conversation not much buttoning up was involved it was thoughtfulno it was orderlyof old peter to warn us each time and then to perform so punctually but it mattered more to airline pilots and automobuss than to stayathomes like me there was essie however i looked in to make sure she was not actually being perfused or catheterized or fed she wasnt she was asleepquite normally asleep with her darkgold hair spilling all around her and gently snoring and on the way back to my comfortable console chair i felt peter in my mind i had become quite a connoisseur of invasions of the mind it wasnt any special skill the whole human race had over a dozen years ever since the fool kid wan began his trips to the food factory his were the worst because they lasted so long and because he shared his dreams with us dreams have power dreams are a kind of released insanity by contrast the one light touch wed had from janine herter was nothing and peter herters precise twominute doses no worse than a traffic light you stop a minute and wait impatiently until it is over and then you go on your way all i ever felt from peter was the way he feltsometimes the gutgriping of age sometimes hunger or thirst once the fading angry sexual lust of an old man all by himself as i sat down i remember telling myself that this time was nothing at all more than anything else it was like having a little dizzy spell too much crouching in one position when you stand up you have to pause a moment until it goes away but it didnt go away i felt the blurriness of seeing things with two sets of eyes at once and the inarticulate anger and unhappiness of the old manno words just a sort of tone as though someone were whispering what i could not quite hear it kept on not going away the blurriness increased i began to feel detached and almost delirious that second vision that is never sharp and clear began to show things i had never seen before not real things fantasy things women with beaks like birds of prey great glittering metal monsters rolling across the inside of my eyelids fantasies dreams the twominute measured dose of reminder had gone off track the son of a bitch had fallen asleep in the cocoon thank god for the insomnia of old men it didnt last eight hours not much more than one but they were sixtyodd unpleasant minutes when i felt the unwanted dreams slide tracelessly out of my mind and was sure they were gone i ran to essies room she was wide awake leaning back against the pillows am all right robin she said at once was an interesting dream nice change from my own ill kill the old bastard i said essie shook her head grinning up at me not practical she said well maybe it wasnt but as soon as i had satisfied myself that essie was all right i called for albert einstein i want advice is there anything that can be done to stop peter herter he scratched his nose you mean by direct action i assume no robin not by any means available now i dont want to be told that there must be something sure thing robin he said slowly but i think youre asking the wrong program indirect measures might work as i understand it you have some legal questions unresolved if you could resolve them you might be able to meet herters demands and stop him that way ive tried that its the other way around damn it if i could get herter to stop then maybe i could get gateway corp to give me back control meanwhile hes screwing up everybodys mind and i want it stopped isnt there some kind of interference we could broadcast albert sucked his pipe i dont think so rob he said at last i dont have a great deal to go on that startled me you dont remember what it feels like robin he said patiently i dont feel anything it is important for you to remember that i am only a computer program and not the right program really to discuss the exact nature of the signals from mr herteryour psychoanalytic program might be more helpful analytically i know what happenedi have all the measurements of the radiation involved experientially nothing machine intelligence is not affected every human being experienced something i know because there are reports to say so there is evidence that the largerbrained mammalsprimates dolphins elephantswere also disturbed and maybe other mammals were too although the evidence is sketchy but i have not experienced it directly as to broadcasting an interfering pattern yes perhaps that could be done but what would be the effect robin bear in mind that the interfering signal would come from a nearby point not one twentyfive lightdays away if mr herter can cause some disorientation what would a random signal do at close range it would be bad i guess sure thing robin probably worse than you guess but i could not say without experimentation the subjects would have to be human beings and such experiments i cannot undertake over my shoulder essies voice said proudly yes you exactly cannot as who would know better than i she had come up behind me without a sound barefoot in the thick rug she wore a necktoankle robe and her hair was done up in a turban essie what the hell are you doing out of bed i demanded my bed has become excessively tedious she said kneading my ear in her fingers especially occupied alone do you have plans for this evening robin because if invited i would like to share yours but i said and essie i said and what i wanted to say was either you shouldnt be doing this yet or not in front of the computer she didnt give me a chance to decide which she leaned down to press her cheek against mine perhaps so that i might feel how round and full it had once again become robin she said sunnily i am far more well than you believe you may ask the doctor if you wish she will tell you how very rapidly i have healed she turned her head to kiss me quickly and added i have some affairs of my own for the next few hours please continue chatting with your program until then i am sure albert has many interesting things to tell you isnt that so albert sure thing mrs broadhead the program agreed puffing cheerfully on his pipe so then its settled she patted my cheek and turned away and i have to say that as she walked back to her room she did not in the least look unwell the robe was not tight but it was shaped to her body and the shape of her body was really fine i could not believe that the wadding of bandage all along her left side was gone but there was no sign of it behind me my science program coughed i turned back and he was puffing on his pipe his eyes twinkling your wife is looking very well robin he said nodding judiciously sometimes albert i said i dont know just how anthropomorphic you are well what very interesting things do you want to tell me about whatever you want to hear robin shall i continue on the subject of peter herter there are some other possibilities such as the abort mode that is setting aside for the moment the legal complications it would be possible to command the shipboard computer known as vera to explode the fuel tanks on the orbital craft hell it would wed destroy the greatest treasure weve ever found sure thing robin and its even worse than that the chance of an external explosion damaging the installation mr herter is using is quite small it might only anger him or strand him there to do as he chooses as long as he lives forget it dont you have anything good to tell me about as a matter of fact robin he grinned i do weve found our rosetta stone he shrank away to a dwindling spray of colored flecks and disappeared as a luminous spindleshaped mass of lavender color replaced him in the tank he said that is the image of the beginning of a book its blank i havent started it yet he explained the shape was taller than i and about half as thick as it was tall it began to shift before my eyes the color thinned out until i could see through it clearly and then one two three dots began to appear inside it points of bright red light that spun themselves out in a spiral there was a sad chittering sound like telemetry or like the amplified chirps of marmosets then the picture froze the sound stopped alberts voice said i have stopped it at this point robin it is probable that sound is language but we have not yet been able to isolate semantic units from it however the text is clear there are one hundred thirtyseven of those points of light now watch while i run a few more seconds of the book the spiral of tiny stars doubled itself another coil of dots lifted itself from the original and floated to the top of the spindle where it hung silently the chitter of language began again and the original spiral expanded itself while each of the dots began to trace a spiral of its own when it was finished there was one large spiral composed of smaller spirals each composed of dots then the whole red pattern turned orange and it froze do you want to try to interpret that robin alberts voice asked well i cant count that high but it looks like times right sure thing robin squared making dots in all now watch short green lines slashed the spiral into ten segments one of the segments lifted itself off dropped to the bottom of the spindle and turned red again thats not exactly a tenth of the number robin said albert by counting you find that there are now dots at the bottom ill proceed once again the central figure changed color this time to yellow notice the top figure i looked closely and saw that the first dot had turned orange the third yellow then the central figure rotated itself on the vertical axis and spun out a threed column of spirals and albert said we now have a total of cubed dots in the central figure from here on he said kindly it gets a little tedious to watch ill run it through quickly and he did patterns of dots flying around and isolating themselves colors changing through yellow to avocado avocado to green green to aqua aqua to blue and on through the spectrum nearly twice now do you see what we have three numbers robin in the center down at the bottom to the eighteenth power which is roughly the same as to the thirtyeighth at the top or in order three dimensionless numbers the fine structure constant the ratio of the proton to the electron and the number of particles in the universe robin you have just had a short course in particle theory from a heechee teacher i said my god albert reappeared on the screen beaming exactly robin he said but albert does that mean you can read all the prayer fans his face fell only the simple ones he said regretfully this was actually the easiest but from now on its quite straightforward we play every fan and tape it we look for correspondences we make semantic assumptions and test them in as many contexts as we can findwell do it robin but it may take some time i dont want to take time i snarled sure thing robin but first every fan must be located and read and taped and coded for machine comparison and then i dont want to hear i said just do itwhats the matter his expression had changed its a question of funding robin he said apologetically theres a great deal of machine time involved here do it as far as you can go ill have morton sell some more stock what else have you got something nice robin he grinned shrinking in size until he was just a little face in the corner of the tank colors flowed in the center of the display and fused into a set of heechee controls displaying a pattern of color on five of the ten panels the others were blank know what that is robin thats a composite of all the known gateway flights that wound up at heechee heaven all the patterns you see are identical in all seven known missions the others vary but its a pretty good conjecture that they are not directly involved in coursesetting what are you saying albert i demanded he had caught me by surprise i found that i was beginning to shake do you mean if we set ship controls for that pattern we could get to heechee heaven point nine five yes robin he nodded and i have identified three ships two on gateway and one on the moon that will accept that setting i put on a sweater and walked down to the water i didnt want to hear any more the trickle pipes had been busy i kicked my shoes off to feel the damp pilowy grass and watched some boys windtrolling for perch near the nyack shore and i thought this is what i bought by risking my life on gateway what i paid for with kiaras and do i want to risk all this and my life again but it wasnt really a question of want to if one of those ships would go to heechee heaven and i could buy or steal a passage on it i would go then sanity saved me and i realized i couldnt after all not at my age and not the way gateway corp was feeling about me and most of all not in time the gateway asteroid orbits at rightangles to the ecliptic just about getting there from earth is a tedious long job by hohmann curves twenty months or more under forced acceleration more than six six months from now those ships would have been there and back if they were coming back of course the realization was almost as much of a relief as it was a sick hungry sense of loss sigfrid von shrink never told me how to get rid of ambivalence he did tell me how to deal with them the recipe is mostly just to let them happen sooner or later they burn themselves out at least they dont have to be paralyzing so while i was letting this ambivalence smolder itself into ash i was also strolling along the water enjoying the pleasant underthebubble air and gazing proudly at the house i lived in and the wing where my very dear and for some time wholly platonic wife was i hoped getting herself good and rested whatever she was doing she wasnt doing it alone twice a taxicart had brought someone over from the tube stop both of them had been women and now another taxicart pulled up and let out a man who gazed around quite unsurely while the taxi rolled itself around the circle and hurried off to its next call i somehow doubted that he was for essie but i could think of no reason why he would be for me or at least why he could not be dealt with by harriet so it was a surprise when the riflespeaker under the eaves swiveled around to point at me and harriets voice said robin theres a mr haagenbusch here i think you ought to see him that was very unlike harriet but she was usually right so i strolled up the lawn rinsed my bare feet at the french windows and invited the man into my study he was a pretty old specimen pinkskin bald with a dapper white pair of sideburns and a carefully american accentnot the kind people born in the united states usually have thank you very much for seeing me mr broadhead he said and handed me a card that read herr doktor advokat wm i haagenbusch im pete herters lawyer he said i flew this morning from frankfort because i want to make a deal how very quaint of you i thought imagine coming in person to conduct business but if harriet wanted me to see this old flake she had probably talked it over with my legal program so what i said was what kind of a deal he was waiting for me to tell him to sit down i did i suspected he was also waiting for me to order coffee or cognac for two as well but i didnt particularly want to do that he took off black kid gloves looked at his pearly nails and said my client has asked for paid into a special account plus immunity from prosecution of any kind i received this message by code yesterday i laughed out loud christ haagenbusch why are you telling me i havent got that kind of money no you dont he agreed outside of your investment in the herterhall syndicate and some fishfarm stock you dont have anything but a couple of places to live and some personal effects i think you could raise six or seven million not counting the herterhall investment god knows what that might be worth right now everything considered i sat back and looked at him you know i got rid of my tourist stuff so you checked me out only you forgot the food mines no i dont think so mr broadhead my understanding is that that stock was sold this afternoon it was not altogether pleasant to find out that he knew more about my financial position than i did so morton had had to sell that out too i didnt have time to think about what that implied just then because haagenbusch stroked his sideburns and went on the situation is this mr broadhead i have advised my client that a contract obtained under duress is not enforceable he therefore no longer has any hope of attaining his purposes through an agreement with the gateway corporation or even with your syndicate so i have received new instructions to secure immediate payment of the sum i have mentioned to deposit it in untraceable bank accounts in his name and to turn it over to him when and if he returns gateway wont like being blackmailed i said still they may not have any choice indeed they do not he agreed what is wrong with mr herters plan is that it wont work i am sure they will pay over the money i am also sure that my communications will be tapped and my offices bugged and that the justice departments of every nation involved in the gateway treaty will be preparing indictments for mr herter when he returns i do not want to be named in those indictments as an accomplice mr broadhead i know what will happen theyll find the money and take it back theyll void mr herters previous contract on grounds of his own noncompliance and theyll put himhim at leastin jail youre in a tough situation mr haagenbusch i said he chuckled dryly his eyes were not amused he stroked his sideburns for a moment and burst out you dont know every day long orders in code demand this guarantee that i hold you personally responsible for this other and then i send off a reply that takes twentyfive days to get there by which time he has sent me fifty days of new orders and his thoughts are somewhere far beyond and he upbraids me and threatens me he is not a well man and he certainly is not a young one i do not truly think that he will live to collect any of this blackmail but he might why dont you quit i would if i could but if i quit then what then he has no one on his side at all then what would he do mr broadhead also he shrugged he is a very old friend mr broadhead he was at school with my father no i cant quit also i cant do what he asks but perhaps you can not by handing over a quarter of a billion dollars no because you have never had that kind of money but you can make him an equal partner with that i think he wouldno i think he might accept that but ive already i stopped if haagenbusch did not know i had already given half my holdings to bover i wasnt going to tell him why wouldnt i void the contract too i asked he shrugged you might but i think you would not you are a symbol to him mr broadhead and i believe he would trust you you see i think i know what it is he wants from all this it is to live the way you do for all that remains of his life he stood up i do not expect you to agree to this at once he said i have perhaps twentyfour hours before i must reply to mr herter please think about this and i will speak to you in one day i shook his hand and had harriet order him a taxicart and stood with him in the driveway until it rolled up and bore him briskly away into the early night when i came back into my own room essie was standing by the window looking out at the lights on the tappan sea it was suddenly clear to me who her visitors had been this day at least one had been her hairdresser that tawny niagara of hair hung true and even to her waist once more and when she turned to smile at me it was the same essie who had left for arizona all those long weeks before you were so very long with that little man she remarked you must be hungry she watched me standing there for a moment and laughed i suppose that the questions in my mind were written on my face because she answered them one dinner is ready now something light which we can eat at any time two it is laid out in our room whenever you care to join me there and three yes robin i have wilmas assurance that all of this is quite all right am much more well than you think robin dear you surely look about as well as a person can get i said and must have been smiling because her pale perfect eyebrows came down in a frown are you amused at spectacle of horny wife she demanded oh no no it is not that at all i said putting my arms around her i was just wondering a moment ago why it was that anybody would want to live the way i do now i know well we made love tentatively and slowly and then when i found out she wasnt going to break we did it again rougher and rowdier then we ate most of the food that was waiting for us on the sideboard and lounged around and hugged each other until we made love again after that we just sort of drowsed for a while spooned together until essie commented to the back of my neck pretty impressive performance for old goat robin not too bad for seventeenyearold even i stretched and yawned where i lay rubbing my back against her belly and breasts you sure got well in a hurry i commented she didnt answer just nuzzled my neck with her nose there is a sort of radar that cannot be seen or heard that tells me true i lay there for a moment then disengaged myself and sat up dearest essie i said what arent you telling me she lay within my arm face against my ribs about what she asked innocently come on essie when she didnt answer i said do i have to get wilma out of bed to tell me she yawned and sat up it was a false yawn when she looked at me her eyes were wide awake wilma is most conservative she said shrugging there are some medicines to promote healing corticosteroids and such which she did not wish to give me with them there is some slight risk of consequences many years from nowbut by then no doubt full medical will be able to cope i am sure so i insisted it made her angry consequence you mean leukemia yes perhaps but most likely not certainly not soon i got out of the bed and sat naked on the edge so that i could see her better essie why she slipped her thumbs under her long hair and pushed it back away horn her face to return my stare because i was in a hurry she said because you are after all entitled to a well wife because it is uncomfortable to pee through a catheter not to say unesthetic because was my decision to make and i made it she threw the covers off her and lay back study me robin she invited not even scars and inside under skin am fully functional can eat digest excrete make love conceive your child if we should wish not next spring or maybe next year now and it was all true i could see it for myself her long pale body was unmarkedno not entirely down her left side was an irregular paler patch of new skin but you had to look to see it and there was nothing else at all to show that a few weeks earlier she had been gouged and mutilated and in fact dead i was getting cold i stood up to find essies robe for her and put my own on there was still some coffee on the sideboard and still hot for me too essie said as i poured shouldnt you be resting when i am tired she said practically you will know because i will roll over and go to sleep has been very long time since you and i were like this robin am enjoying it she accepted a cup from me and looked at me over the rim as she sipped it but you are not she observed yes i am and i was but honesty made me add i puzzle myself sometimes essie why is it that when you show me love it comes out in my head feeling like guilt she put down her cup and lay back do you wish to tell me about it dear robin i just have then i added i suppose if anybody i should call up old sigfrid von shrink and tell him he is always available she said hum if i start with him god knows when id ever finish anyway hes not the program i want to talk to theres so much going on essie and its all happening without me i feel left out yes she said am aware this is how you feel is something you wish to do so will not feel left out any more wellmaybe i said about peter herter for instance ive been fooling around with a kind of an idea that id like to talk over with albert einstein she nodded very well why not she sat up on the edge of the bed hand me my slippers please let us do this now now but its late you shouldnt be robin she said kindly i too have talked with sigfrid von shrink is good program even if not written by me says you are good man robin well adjusted generous and to all of this i also can testify not to add excellent lover and much fun to be with come into study she took my hand as we walked into the big room looking over the tappan sea and sat before my console in the comfortable loveseat however she went on sigfrid says you have great talent for inventing reasons not to do things so i will help you get off dime daite gorod polymat she was not talking to me but to the console which sprang at once into light display both albert and sigfrid programs she ordered access both files in interactive mode now robin let us pursue questions you have raised after all i am quite interested too this wife of so many years this s ya lavorovna i married she surprises me most when i least expect it she sat quite comfortably beside me holding my hand while i talked quite openly about doing the things that i had most wanted not to want it was not just a matter of going to heechee heaven and the food factory and stopping old peter herter from messing up the world it was where i might go after that but at first it did not look as though i were going anywhere albert i said you told me that you had worked out a course setting for heechee heaven from gateway records can you do that for the food factory too the two of them were sitting side by side in the pv tank albert puffing on his pipe sigfrid hands clasped and silent attentively listening he would not speak until i spoke to him and i was not doing that fraid not albert said apologetically we have only one known setting for the food factory trish bovers and thats not enough to be sure maybe pointsix probable that it would get a ship there but then what robin it couldnt come back or at least trish bovers didnt he settled himself comfortably and went on there are of course certain alternatives he glanced at sigfrid von shrink beside him one might so manipulate herters mind by suggestion that he would change his plans would that work i was still talking to albert einstein he shrugged and sigfrid stirred but did not speak oh do not be such a baby essie scolded answer sigfrid gospozha lavorovna he said glancing at me i think not i believe my colleague has raised this possibility only so that i might dismiss it i have studied the records of peter herters transmissions the symbolism is quite obvious the angelic women with the raptor beakswhat is a hooked nose gospozha think of payters childhood and what he heard of the cleansing of the world of the evil jews there is also the violence the punitive emotions he is quite ill has in fact already suffered one coronary attack and is no longer rational he has in fact regressed to quite a childish state neither suggestion nor appeals to reason will work gospozha the only possibility would be perhaps longterm analysis he would not likely agree the shipboard computer could not well handle it and in any case there is not time i cannot help you gospozha not with any real chance of success long and long ago i spent a couple of hundred mostly very unpleasant hours listening to sigfrids reasonable maddening voice and i had not wanted ever to hear it again but you know it wasnt all that bad beside me essie stirred polymath she called have fresh coffee prepared to me she said i think will be here for some time i dont know for what i objected i seem to be stymied and if you are she said comfortably we need not drink the coffee but can go back to bed meanwhile am quite enjoying this robin well why not i was strangely no more sleepy than essie appeared to be in fact i was both alert and relaxed and my mind had never been clearer albert i said is there any progress on reading the heechee books not much robin he apologized there are other mathematical volumes such as the one you saw but as yet no language yes robin i snapped my fingers the vagrant thought that had been in the back of my mind had come to the fore gosh numbers i said those numbers the book showed us theyre the same as the ones the dead men call gosh numbers sure thing robin he nodded they are basic dimensionless constants of the universe or at least of this universe however there is the question of machs principle which suggests not now albert where do you suppose the dead men got them he paused frowning tapping out his pipe he glanced at sigfrid before he said i would conjecture that the dead men interfaced with the heechee machine intelligence no doubt there was some transmission both ways my very thought what else do you conjecture the dead men might know that is very difficult to say they are very incompletely stored you know communication was extremely difficult at best and has now been interrupted entirely i sat up straight and what if we got back in communication what if somebody went to heechee heaven to talk to them he coughed trying not to be patronizing he said robin several members of the herterhall party plus the boy wan have failed to get clear answers from them on these questions even our machine intelligence has succeeded only poorly though he said politely enough that is primarily because of the necessity to interface with the shipboard computer vera they are poorly stored robin they are obsessive irrational and often incoherent behind me essie was standing with the tray of coffee and cupsi had hardly heard the bell from the kitchen to say it was ready ask him robin she commanded i did not pretend to misunderstand hell i said all right sigfrid thats your line of work how do we trick them into talking to us sigfrid smiled and unlaced his hands it is good to speak to you again robin he said i would like to compliment you on your very considerable progress since we spoke last get on with it of course robin there is one possibility the storage of the female prospector henrietta seems rather complete except for her one obsession that is with the unfaithfulness of her husband i think that if a machine program were written from what we know of her husbands personality and interfaced with her make a fake husband for her essentially yes robin he nodded it wouldnt have to be exact because the dead men in general are so poorly stored any responses that were inappropriate might be overlooked of course the program would be quite stow it sigfrid can you write a program like that yes with help from your wife yes and then how do we get it in contact with henrietta he looked sidewise at albert i believe my colleague can help there sure thing sigfrid albert said cheerily scratching one foot with the toe of the other one write the program with ancillaries two read it into a pmal flip processor with a gigabit fastaccess memory and necessary slave units three put it in a five and fire it off to heechee heaven then interface it with henrietta and start the interrogation id give that oh maybe a pointnine probability of working i frowned why ship all that machinery around patiently he said its c robin the speed of light lacking an ftl radio we have to ship the machine to where the job is the herterhall computer has an ftl radio too dumb robin too slow and i havent told you the worst part all that hardware is pretty big you know it would just about fill a five which means it arrives naked and undefended at heechee heaven and we dont know who is going to meet it at the dock essie was sitting beside me again looking beautiful and concerned holding a cup of coffee i took it automatically and swallowed a gulp you said just about i pointed out does that mean a pilot could go along fraid not robin theres only room for about another hundred and fifty kilos i only weigh half that i felt essie tense beside me we were getting right down to it now i felt more clearheaded and sure of myself than in weeks the paralysis of inaction was loosening every minute i was aware of what i was saying and very conscious of what it meant to essieand unwilling to stop thats true robin albert conceded but do you want to get there dead theres food water air your roundtrip standard allowance with all provision for regeneration comes to more than three hundred kilos and there simply is not cut it out albert i said you know as well as i do that were not talking about a round trip were talking about what was it twentytwo days that was flight time for henrietta thats all i need enough for twentytwo days then ill be on heechee heaven and it wont matter sigfrid was looking very interested but silent albert was looking concerned he admitted well thats true robin but its quite a risk theres no margin for error at all i shook my head i was way ahead of himway ahead at any rate of where he was willing to go by himself you said theres a five on the moon that will accept that destination is there a whatdoyoucallit pmal there too no robin he said but added sadly however there is one at kourou ready for shipment to venus thank you albert i said half a snarl because it was like pulling teeth to get it out of him and then i sat back and contemplated what had just been said i was not the only one who had been listening intently beside me essie set down her coffee cup polymath she commanded access and display morton program in interactive mode go ahead robin do what you must do there was the sound of a door opening from the tank and morton walked in shaking hands with sigfrid and albert as he glanced over his shoulder at me he was accessing information as he stepped and i could tell by his expression that he didnt like what he was finding out i didnt care i said morton theres a pmal information processor at the launch base in guiana buy it for me he turned and confronted me robin he said stubbornly i dont think you realize how rapidly youre eating into capital this program is costing you over a thousand dollars a minute alone ill have to sell stock sell it not only that if youre planning to ship yourself and that computer to heechee heaven dont dont even think of it first place bovers injunction still prevents it second place if you should manage to get around that youd be liable to a contempt citation and damages that i didnt ask you about that morton suppose i got bover to lift his injunction could they stop me then yes but he added softening although they could there is some chance they would not at least not in time nevertheless as your legal advisor i have to say you dont have to say anything buy the computer albert and sigfrid program it the way we discussed you three get out of the tank i want harriet harriet get me a flight kourou to the moon same ship as the computer mortons buying for me soon as you can and while youre doing that see if you can locate hanson bover for me i want to talk to him when she nodded and winked away i turned to look at essie her eyes were damp but she was smiling you know something i said sigfrid never called me rob or bobby once she put her arms around me and hugged me close maybe he thinks you are not to be treated like an infant now she said and neither am i robin do you think i wanted to get well only so we could make love quickly no it was also so you would not be held prisoner here by a wife you thought it wicked to leave and so that i would be well able to deal with it she added when you left anyway we landed at cayenne in pitch dark and pouring rain bover was waiting for me as i cleared customs half asleep in a foam armchair by the baggage terminal i thanked him several times for meeting me but he shrugged it off we have only two hours he said let us get on with it harriet had chartered a chopper for us we took off over the palms just as the sun was coming up from the atlantic by the time we reached kourou it was full daylight and the lunar module was erect beside its support tower it was tiny compared to the giants that climb up from kennedy or california but the centre spatial guyanais gets onesixth better performance out of its rockets being almost on the equator so they dont have to be as big the computer was already loaded and stowed and bover and i got aboard at once slam shove retching taste of the breakfast i shouldnt have eaten on the airplane rising in my throat and then we were under way it takes three days for the lunar flight i spent as much of it as i could sleeping the rest talking to bover it was the longest time i had spent out of reach of my comm facilities in at least a dozen years and i thought it would hang heavy on my hands it went like lightning i woke up when the acceleration warnings went off and watched the brassy moon rise up toward us and then there we were considering how far i had been it was surprising that i had never been on the moon before i didnt know what to expect it all took me by surprise the dancy prancy feeling of weighing no more than an inflated rubber doll the sound of the reedy tenor that came out of my mouth in the twentypercent helium atmosphere they werent breathing heechee mixture any more not on the moon heechee digging machines went like a bomb in the lunar rock and with all the sunlight anybody could want to drive them it cost nothing to keep them going the only problem was filling them with air which was why they supplemented with heliumcheaper and easier to get than n the heechee lunar spindle is near the shuttle baseor to put it the right way around the shuttle base was located where it is near fra mauro because that was where the heechee had dug most a million years before it was all underground even the docking ports concealed under the lee of a ridge a couple of american astronauts named shepard and mitchell had spent a weekend roaming around within two hundred kilometers of it once and never noticed it was there now a community of more than a thousand people lived in the spindle and the digs and the new tunnels were branching off in all directions and the lunar surface was a rash of microwave dishes and solar collectors and plumbing hi you i said to the first ablebodied man who seemed to have nothing to do whats your name he loped leisurely toward me chewing on an unlighted cigar whats it to you he asked theres cargo coming off the shuttle i want it loaded onto the five thats in the dock now youll need half a dozen helpers and probably cargohandling equipment and its a rush job urn he said you got authority for this ill show it to you when i pay you off i said and the pays a thousand dollars a man with a ten thousand dollar bonus to you personally if you do it within three hours urn lets see the cargo it was just coming off the rocket he looked it over carefully scratched for a while thought for a while he wasnt entirely without conversation a couple of words at a time it developed that his name was a t walthers jr and that he had been born in the tunnels on venus by his bangle i could tell that he had tried his luck on gateway and by the fact that he was doing odd jobs on the moon i could tell that his luck hadnt been good well mine hadnt been either the first couple of times and then it changed in which direction is hard to say can do it broadhead he said at last but we dont have three hours that joker herter is due to perform again in about ninety minutes well have to wrap this up before that all the better i said now which way is the gateway corp office north end of the spindle he said they close in about half an hour all the better i thought again but didnt say it dragging bover after me i prancydanced back along the tunnel to the big spindleshaped cavern that was headquarters for the area and argued our way into the launch directors room youll want an open circuit to earth for id i told her im robin broadhead and heres my thumbprint this is hanson boverif youll oblige bover he pressed his thumb on the plate next to mine now say your bit i invited him i allen bover he said by rote hereby withdraw my injunction against robin broadhead the gateway corp et al thank you i said now director while youre verifying that heres a signed copy of what bover has just said for your records plus a mission plan under my contract with gateway corp which your machines can retrieve for you i have the right to make use of gateway facilities in connection with the herterhall expedition i am going to do so for which purpose i need the five at present parked in your landing docks you will see by the mission plan that i intend to go to heechee heaven and from there to the food factory where i will prevent peter herter from inflicting any more damage to the earth also rescuing the herterhall party and returning valuable gateway information for processing and use and id like to leave within the next hour i finished strongly well for a minute there it looked like it was going to work the launch director looked at the thumbprints on the register plate picked up the spool of mission plan and weighed it in her hand and then stared at me in silence for a moment her mouth open i could hear the whine of whatever volatile gas they were using in the heat engines carnotcycling from under the fresnel lenses to the shaded artichokeshaped reflectors just above us i didnt hear anything else at all then she sighed and said senator praggler have you been getting all that and from the air behind her desk came pragglers growl you bet your ass i have sally tell broadhead it wont work he cant have the ship it was the three days in transit that had done me in automatically the passport identities of all passengers were radioed ahead and the officials had known i was coming before the shuttle left french guiana it was just chance that it was praggler who was there to meet me even if he hadnt been they had plenty of time to get orders from the headquarters in brasilia i thought for a while that because it was praggler i could talk him out of it i couldnt i yelled at him for thirty minutes and begged for thirty more no good theres nothing wrong with your mission plan he admitted whats wrong is you youre not entitled to use gateway facilities because gateway corp preempted you yesterday while you were in orbit even if it hadnt robin i wouldnt let you go youre too personally involved not to mention too old for this kind of thing im an experienced gateway pilot youre an experienced pain in the ass robin and maybe a little bit crazy too what do you think one man could do on heechee heaven no well use your plan well even pay you royalties on itif it works but well do it the right way from gateway itself with at least three ships going two of them full of young healthy well armed daredevils senator i pleaded let me go if you ship this computer to gateway itll take monthsyears not if we send it right up there in the five he said six days then it can take right off again in convoy but not with you however he said reasonably well certainly pay you for the computer and for the program leave it at that robin let somebody else take the risks im speaking as your friend well he was my friend and we both knew it but maybe not as much of a friend as he had been after i told him what he could do with his friendship finally bover pulled me away the last i saw of the senator he was sitting on the edge of the desk staring after me face still purple with rage eyes looking as though they were getting ready to weep thats tough luck mr broadhead said bover sympathetically i took a breath to straighten him out too and stopped myself just in time there was no point in it ill get you a ticket back to kourou i said he smiled showing perfectly chiseled chicletshe had been spending some of that money on himself you have made me a rich man mr broadhead i can pay for my own ticket also ive never been here before and will not likely come again so i think ill stay a while suit yourself and you mr broadhead what are your plans i dont have any nor could i think of any i had run out of programming i cannot tell you how empty that feels i had nerved myself up for another heechee mysteryship ridewell not as much a mystery as when i was prospecting out of gateway but still a pretty scary prospect i had taken a step with essie that i had feared taking for a long time and all for nothing i stared wistfully down the long empty tunnel toward the docks i might shoot my way through i said mr broadhead thatsthats oh dont worry im not going to mostly because all the guns i know anything about are already loaded onto that five and i doubt theyll let me in to get one he peered into my face well he said doubtfully perhaps you too might enjoy just spending a few days and then his expression changed i hardly saw it i was feeling what he felt and that was enough to demand all my attention old peter was in the couch again worse than ever it was not just his dreams and fantasies that i was experiencingthat everyone alive was feeling it was pain despair madness there was a terrible sense of pressure around the temples a flaming ache from arms and chest my throat was dry then raw with sour clots as i vomited nothing like that had ever come from the food factory before but then no one had ever died in the couch before it did not stop in a minute or in ten my lungs heaved in great starving gasps so did bovers so did everyone elses wherever they were in range of his transmission the pain kept on and every time it seemed to reach a plateau there was an explosion of new pain and all the time there was the terror the rage the awful misery of a man who knew he was dying and hated it but i knew what it was i knew what it was and i knew what i could dowhat at least my body could do if i could only hold my mind together enough to make it i forced myself to take a step and then another i made myself trot down that wide weary corridor when bover was writhing on the ground behind me and the guards were staggering completely helpless ahead i blundered past them and doubt they even saw me into the narrow hatch of the lander tumbling all bruised and shaken forcing myself to dog it closed over my head and there i was in the disastrously familiar tiny cubbyhole surrounded by shapes of molded tan plastic walthers had done his part of the job at least i had no way of paying him for it but if he had put his hand in the port as i was closing it i would have given him a million at some point old peter herter died his death did not end the misery it only began to slow it down i could not have guessed what it would be like to be in the mind of a man who has died while he feels his heart stop and his bowels loosen and the certainty of death stab into his brain it goes on much longer than i would have believed possible it was going on all the time i cut the lander loose and sent it up on its little hydrogen jets to where the heechee drive could work i jammed and heaved the courseguidance wheels about until they showed that welllearned pattern albert had taught me and then i squeezed the launch teat and i was on my way the ship began its lurchy queasy acceleration the star patterns i could see barely see by craning past a memorystorage unit began to drift together no one could stop me now i could not even stop myself by all the data albert had been able to collect the trip would be twentytwo days exactly not very longnot unless you are squeezed into a ship that is already filled to capacity there was room for memore or less i could stretch out i could stand up i could even lie down if the vagrant motion of the ship let me know where down was and if i did not mind being folded over between pieces of metal what i could not do for those twentytwo days was move more than half a meter in any directionnot to eat not to sleep not to bathe or excrete not for anything there was plenty of time on my hands for the purpose of remembering how terrifying heechee flight was and to feel all of it there was plenty of time too to learn albert had been careful to record for me all the data i had not had the wit to ask him for and those tapes were available for me to play they were not very interesting or sophisticated in delivery the pmal was all memory plenty of brain not much display there was no threedimensional tank only a stereo flatplate goggle system when my eyes would bear watching it or a screen the size of the palm of my hand when they would not at first i did not use it i just lay there sleeping as much as i could partly i was recovering from the trauma of peters death so terrifyingly like my own partly i was experimenting with the inside of my headallowing myself to feel fear encouraging myself to feel guilt there are kinds of guilt that i know i cherish the contemplation of obligations unmet and commitments undone i had plenty of those to think about beginning with peter and ending or rather not ending with kiara in her frozen black holenot ending because i could always think of others that amusement staled before long to my surprise i found that the guilt was not very overpowering after all once i let myself feel it and that took care of the first day then i turned to the tapes i let the semialbert the rigid halfanimated caricature of the program i knew and loved lecture me on machs principle and gosh numbers and more curious forms of astrophysical speculation than i had ever dreamed of i didnt really listen but i let the voice roll over me and that was the second day then from the same source i poured into myself all that was stored about the dead men i had heard almost all of it before i heard it all again i had nothing better to do and that was the third day then there were miscellaneous lectures on heechee heaven and the provenance of the old ones and possible strategies for dealing with henrietta and possible risks to be guarded against from the old ones and that was the third day and the fourth and the fifth i began to wonder how i would fill twentytwo of them so i went back and did those tapes all over again and that was the sixth day and the eighth and the tenth and on the eleventh on the eleventh i cut off the computer entirely grinning to myself with anticipated pleasure it was halfway day i hung there in my restraining straps waiting for the satisfaction of the one event this cramped and cussed trip could produce for me the twinkling eruption of golden sparks of light in the crystal spiral that would signify turnover time i didnt know exactly when it would happen probably not in the first hour of the day probably not either in the second or third and it didnt not in those hours nor in the fourth or fifth or the ones after that it did not happen at all on the eleventh day or on the twelfth or on the thirteenth or on the fourteenth and when at last i punched in the data to check out the arithmetic i did not care to do in my head the computer told me what i did not want to know it was too late even if the halfway point occurred any time noweven in the next minutethere would not be water food and air enough to carry me through to the end there are economies one can make i made them i moistened my lips instead of drinking slept all i could breathed as shallowly as i knew how and turnover at last did occuron day nineteen eight days late when i played the figures into the computer they came back cold and clear the halfway point had come too late nineteen days from now the ship might well arrive at heechee heaven but not with a living pilot aboard by then i would have been dead for at least six the long night of the dreams as she began to be able to speak to the old ones they began to seem more like individuals to her they were not really old either or at least the three that most often guarded her and fed her and led her to her sessions in the long night of the dreams were not they learned to call her janine or at least something close enough their own names were complicated but each name had a short formtar or tor or hooayand they responded to them at need or just for play they were as playful as puppies and as solicitous when she came out of the bright blue cocoon racked and sweating from another life and another deathfrom another lesson in this course that the oldest one had prescribed for herone of them was always there to coo and murmur and stroke but it was not enough there was no consolation enough to make up for what happened in the dreams over and over every day was the same a few hours of uneasy and unrestful sleep a chance to eat maybe a game of tag or touchtickle with hooay or tor perhaps a chance to wander about the heaven always guarded then tar or hooay or one of the others would tug her gently back to the cocoon and put her inside and then for hours sometimes for what seemed like the entire span of a life janine would be someone else and such strange someones male female young old mad crippledthey were all different none of them were quite human most were not human at all especially the earliest oldest someones the lives she dreamed that were the closest in time were the nearest to her own at least they were the lives of creatures not unlike tor or tar or hooay they were not usually frightening though all of them ended in death in them she lived random and chaotic snatches of their stored memories of the short and chancy or dull and driven lives they had known as she came to understand the language of her captors she found out that the lives she lived were those which had been specially selected to be stored so each had some special lesson all of the dreams were learning experiences for her of course and of course she learned she learned how to speak to the living ones to understand their overshadowed existences to comprehend their obsessed need to obey they were slaves or pets when they did what the oldest one told them they were obedient and therefore good when rarely they did not they were punished between times she saw wan sometimes and sometimes her sister they were kept apart from her as a matter of policy at first she did not understand why then she did and laughed inside herself at the joke too secret to share with even jokey tor lurvy and wan were learning too and taking it no better than she by the end of the first six dreams she could speak to the old ones her lips and throat would not quite form their chirping murmuring vowels but she could make herself understood more urgently she could follow their orders that saved trouble when she was meant to return to her private cell they did not need to push her and when she was supposed to bathe they did not have to strip her of her clothes by the tenth lesson they were almost friendly by the fifteenth she knew all they ever would about heechee heaven including the fact that the old ones were not and never had been heechee not even the oldest one and who was the oldest one her lessons had not taught her that tar and hooay explained as best they could that the oldest one was god that was not a satisfying answer he was a god too much like his worshipers to have built heechee heaven or any part of it including his own body no the heaven was heecheebuilt for what purpose only the heechee knew and the oldest one was not a heechee through all this the great machine was immobile again motionless almost dead conserving its dwindling remnant of life when janine crossed the central spindle she saw it there still as a statue occasionally there was a sluggish flicker of pale color around its external sensors as though it were on the verge of awakening perhaps following them through halfclosed eyes when that happened hooay and tar would quicken their step there was no touchtickle or joking then mostly it was absolutely still she passed wan in its very shadow one day she going to the cocoon he coming away and hooay dared to let them talk for a moment it looks scary janine said i could destroy it for you if you like wan boasted glancing nervously over his shoulder at the machine but he had said it in english and had the wisdom not to translate it for their guards but even the tone of his voice made hooay uneasy and he hustled janine away janine was becoming almost fond of her captors as one might be of a great gentle malemute that could talk it took her a long time to think of a young female like tar as either young or female they all had the same scraggly facial hair and the heavy supraorbital lobes characteristic of the mature male primate but they began to become individuals rather than specimens of the class jailer the heavier and darker of the two males was called tor but that was only one syllable out of a long and subtle name from which janine could only understand the word dark it did not refer to his coloring if anything he was fairer than his fellows it had something to do with an adventure of his childhood in a part of the heaven so strange and so seldom visited that there was little light from even the eternal heecheemetal walls tor trimmed his beard so that it jutted down from his jaw in two inverted horns tor made the most jokes and tried to share them with his prisoner tor was the one who jested with janine saying that if her male wan was as infertile as he seemed to be while penned with lurvy he would ask the oldest one for permission to impregnate her himself janine cherishing her secret joke about their infertility was not frightened she was not repelled either because tor was a kindly sort of satyr and she believed she could recognize the jest all the same she began to think of herself as no longer a snotty kid each long dream aged her in them she experienced the sexual intercourse she had never known in lifesometimes as a woman sometimes notand often pain and always at the end death the records could not be made from a living person hooay explained in a nonplayful moment and his manner was not playful at all as he described the way in which the brain was opened and fed into the machine that made the records she grew a little older while he was telling her as the dreams went on they became stranger and more remote you are going to very old times tor told her this one now he was leading her toward the cocoon is the very oldest and therefore the last perhaps she paused beside the gleaming couch is this another joke tor or a riddle no he tugged soberly at the forks of his beard with both hands you will not like this one danine thanks he grinned to crinkle the corners of his sad soft eyes but it is the last i can give you perhapsperhaps the oldest one will then give you a dream out of his own it is said that he has sometimes done that but i do not know when not in any persons memory janine swallowed it sounds scary she said he said kindly it frightened me very much when i had it danine but remember that it is only a dream for you and he closed the cocoon over her and janine fought for a moment against the sleep and failed as always and was someone else once there was a creature it was female but it was not an it if descartes is to be believed because it was aware of its own existence and therefore it was a she she had no name but she was marked among her fellows by a great scar from ear to nose where the hoof of a dying preybeast had nearly killed her her eye on that side had healed with the lid pulled out of shape and so she might be called squint squint had a home it was not elaborate it was no more than a trampledout nest in a clump of something like papyrus partly sheltered by a hummock of earth but squint and her relatives returned to those nests every day and in this they were unlike any of the other living things that resembled them in one other respect they were quite unlike anything else they grew up with and that was that they used objects that were not parts of their bodies to do work for them squint was not beautiful she stood not much over a meter tall she had no eyebrowsthe hair on her scalp merged with them and only her nose and cheekbones were bareand she had no chin to speak of her hands had fingers but they were usually clenched so that the backs of them were scarred and callused and the fingers did not separate wellnot much better than the fingers of her feet which were almost as good at grasping things and better at gouging out the vulnerable parts of a creature unfortunate enough to find her arms wrapped around its neck as it tried to run away squint was pregnant although she did not know that this was so squint was full grown and fully fertile by her fifth rainy season in the thirteen years she had been alive she had been pregnant nine or ten times and had never known it until she was forced to note that she could no longer run quite as fast that the bulge in her belly made it more difficult to rake the guts out of a preyanimal and that her dugs began to swell again with milk of the fifty members of her community at least four were her children more than a dozen of the males were or might have been the childrens fathers squint was aware of the former relationship but not of the latter at least one of the young males she knew to be a child of hers might well have been the father of anothera notion which would not have disturbed squint even if she had been capable of entertaining it the thing she did with the males when the flesh beneath her skinny buttocks swelled and reddened was not in her mind related to childbirth it was not related to pleasure either it was an itch that she suffered to be scratched whenever it happened squint had no way of defining pleasure except perhaps as the absence of pain even in those terms she knew little of it throughout her life when the heechee lander bellowed and flamed above the clouds squint and all her community ran to hide none of them saw it come to earth if a trawl scoops a starfish from the bottom of a sea a spade lifts it from the bucket of ooze and dumps it in a tank a biologist pins it down and dissects out its nervous systemdoes the starfish know what is happening to it squint had more selfawareness than a starfish but she had little more background of experience to inform her nothing that happened to her from the moment she saw a bright light shining in her eyes made sense she did not feel the point of the anesthetic lance that put her to sleep she did not know she was carried into the lander and dumped into a pen of twelve of her fellows she did not feel the crushing acceleration when she took off or the weightlessness for the long time they floated in transit she did not know anything at all until she was allowed to waken again and did not understand what she then experienced nothing was familiar water the water squint drank did not any longer come from the muddy brink of the river it came in a shiny hard trough when she bent to lap it up nothing lurked beneath its surface to lunge at her sun and sky there was no sun there were no clouds and there was no rain there were hard bluegleaming walls and a bluegleaming roof overhead food there was no live thing to catch and dismember there were flat tough tasteless clods of chewy matter they filled her stomach and they were always available no matter how much she and her fellows ate there was always more sights and sounds and smellsthese were terrifying there was a stink she had never smelled before sharp in her nose and scary it was the smell of something alive but she never saw the creature that owned it there was an absence of normal smells almost as bad no smell of deer no smell of antelope no smell of cat no smell even of their own dung or not very much because they had no rushes to tramp into a home and the places where they huddled together to sleep were sluiced clean every time they left them her baby was born there while the rest of the tribe complained at her grunts because they wanted to sleep when she woke to lift it to her to relieve the hot pressure in her teats it was gone she never saw it again squints newborn was the first to disappear immediately after birth it was not the last for fifteen years the little australopithecine family continued to eat and copulate and bear and grow old its numbers dwindling because the infants were taken away as soon as born one of the females would squat and strain and whimper and give birth then they would all go to sleep and awaken with the little one gone from time to time an adult would die or come close enough to it to lie curled and moaning so that they knew it would not rise again then too they would all go to sleep and that adult or that adults body would be gone when they woke there were thirty of them then twenty then tenthen only one squint was the last a very very old female at twentynine she knew she was old she did not know she was dying only that there was a terrible crushing pain in her belly that made her gasp and sob she did not know when she was dead she only knew that that particular pain stopped and then she was conscious of another sort of pain not really pain strangeness numbness she saw but she saw queerly flatly queerly flickeringly in a queerly distorted range of colors she was not used to her new vision and did not recognize what she saw she tried to move her eyes and they did not move she tried to move head or arms or legs and could not because she did not have any she remained in that condition for some considerable time squint was not a preparation in the sense that the live but exposed nervous system of a biologists brittle star is a preparation she was an experiment she was not a very great success the attempt to preserve her identity in machine storage did not fail for the reasons that had terminated the earlier trials with the other members of her tribe poor match of chemistry to receptors incomplete transfer of information wrong coding one by one the heechee experimenters had met all of those problems and solved them her experiment failed or succeeded only in part for a different reason there was not enough of an identity in the being that could be recognized as squint to preserve she was not a biography not even a journal she was something like a census datum punctuated by pain and illustrated with fear but that was not the only experiment the heechee had in progress in another section of the immense machine that orbited earths sun from half a lightyear out the stolen babies were beginning to thrive they were leading lives quite different from squintslives marked by automatic care heuristic tests and programmed challenges the heechee recognized that although these australopithecines were a long way from intelligent they contained the seeds of wiser descendants they decided to hurry the process along not much development occurred in the fifteen years between the removal of the colony from its prehistoric african home and squints death the heechee were not discouraged in fifteen years they did not expect much they had much longerrange plans than that as their plans also called for them all of them to be somewhere else long before any true intelligence could look out of the eyes of one of squints descendants they built accordingly they so constructed and programmed the artifact that it would last indefinitely they arranged for it to be supplied with chonfood from a convenient processor of cometary material which they had already set operating to serve other of their installations and which was potentially equally longlived they constructed machines to sample the skills of the descendants of the newborns from time to time and to repeat as often as necessary the attempt to file their identities in machine storage for later review if any of them ever came back to see how the experiment had gone they would have estimated this as very improbable in view of their other plans still their plans encompassed very many alternatives all going simultaneously because the object of their plans was of great concern to them none of them might ever come back but perhaps someone would since squint could not communicate or act in any useful way the heechee experimenters thriftily wiped the effective sections of her storage and kept her on the shelves only as a sort of library book for consultation by later individuals of whatever kind they might be they left certain clues and data for use by whatever generations might be able to understand them they tidied up behind them as they always did then they went away and allowed the rest of that particular experiment among all their experiments to run for eight hundred thousand years danine hooay was moaning danine are you dead she looked up at his face unable at first to focus so that he looked like a blurred broadfaced moon with a double comets tail wagging below help me up hooay she sobbed take me back of them all this had been the worst she felt raped violated expanded changed her world would never be the same again janine did not know the word australopithecine but she knew that the life she had just shared had been an animals worse than an animals because somewhere in squint had been the spark of the invention of thinking and thus the unwanted capacity to fear janine was exhausted and she felt older than the oldest one at justturned fifteen she was not a child any more that account had been overdrawn there was no more childhood left for her at the slopewalled chamber that was her personal pen she stopped hooay said apprehensively danine whats wrong there is a joke to tell you she said you do not look like joking he said it is a funny joke though listen the oldest one has penned wan with my sister to breed them but my sister cannot breed she has had an operation so that she can never again bear a child that is not a good joke he protested no one would do a thing like that she did it hooay she added quickly do not be frightened you will not be punished only now bring the boy to me her soft eyes were brimming with tears how can i not be frightened perhaps i should awaken the oldest one to tell him then the tears spilled over he was terrified she comforted him and coaxed him until other old ones came and he spilled his terrible joke to them janine lay down on her pad closing her ears to their excited woeful chatter she did not sleep but she was lying with her eyes closed when she heard wan and tor come to the door when the boy was pushed inside she stood up to meet him wan she said i want you to put your aims around me he looked at her grumpily no one had told him what this was about and wan too had had his hour in the couch with squint he looked terrible he had never really had a chance to recover from the flu had not rested had not accustomed himself to the great changes in his life since he had met the herterhalls there were circles under his eyes and cracks at the corners of his mouth his feet were dirty and so were his frayed clothes are you afraid you will fall down he shrilled i am not afraid of falling and i want you to talk to me properly dont squeak he looked startled but his voice settled into the lower register she had tried to teach him then why oh wan she shook her head impatiently and stepped forward into his personal space it had not been necessary for her to tell him what to do his arms went around her automatically both at the same height as though she were a barrel to lift the palms pressing against her shoulderblades she pressed her lips against his hard dry and closed then pulled away do you remember what this is wan of course it is kissing but we are doing it wrong wan wait do it again while i do this she protruded the tip of her tongue between almost closed lips and ran it back and forth across his closed ones i think she said moving her head away that that is a better way dont you it makes me feelit makes me feeli feel a little bit as though i were going to throw up alarmed he tried to step back but she followed him closely not really throw up just real funny he stayed tensely near her face held away but his expression was troubled carefully keeping the pitch of his voice down he said tiny jim says people do this before copulating or one person does it sometimes to see if the other person is in heat in heat wan that stinks say in love i think that in love is different he said stubbornly but anyway to kiss is related to copulating tiny jim says she put her hands on his shoulders tiny jim isnt here no but paul doesnt want us to paul isnt here she said stroking his slim neck with the tips of her fingers to see what that felt like lurvy isnt here either anyway none of what they think matters the way it felt she decided was quite strange it wasnt really as though she were going to throw up but as though some sort of liquid readjustment were going on inside her belly a sensation like nothing she had ever known before it was not at all unpleasant let me take your clothes off wan and then you can take off mine after they had practiced kissing again she said i think we should not be standing up now and some time later when they were lying down she opened her eyes to stare into his wideopen ones as he raised himself for better leverage he hesitated if i do that he said perhaps you will get pregnant if you dont do that she said i think i will die when janine woke up hours later wan was already awake and dressed sitting at the side of the room leaning against the goldskeined wall janines heart went out to him he looked like himself fifty years later the youthful face seemed to have lines graven by decades of trouble and pain i love you wan she said he stirred and shrilled oh yes then he caught himself and dropped his voice to a grumble oh yes janine and i love you but i do not know what they will do probably they wont hurt you wan scornfully me it is you i worry about janine this is where i have lived all my life and sooner or later this would have happened but youi am worried about you he added gloomily they are very noisy out there too something is happening i dont think they will hurt usany more i mean janine corrected herself thinking about the dreaming couch the distant chirping cries were coming closer she dressed quickly and looked around as tors voice hailed hooay outside the door there was nothing to show what had happened not even a drop of blood but when tor opened the door fussed and worried he stopped to squint at them suspiciously then sniffed the air perhaps i will not have to breed you danine after all he said kind but frightened but danine oowan there is a terrible thing tar has fallen asleep and the old female has run away wan and janine were dragged to the spindle filled with nearly all of the old ones they were milling around in panic three of them lay sprawled and snoring where they had been dumpedtar and two others of lurvys guards failures in their missions found sound asleep and brought back in fear and disgrace for the judgment of the oldest one who lay motionless but alert on his pedestal cascades of color rippling around his perimeter to the fleshandblood creatures the oldest one showed nothing of his thoughts he was metal he was formidable he could be neither understood nor challenged neither wan nor janine nor any of his near hundred quaking children could perceive the fear and anger that raced through his circulating memories fear that his plans were in jeopardy rage that his children had failed to carry out their orders the three that had failed would have to be punished to set an example the hundredodd others would also have to be punishedsomewhat more lightly so that the race would not become extinctfor failing to keep the three to their duty as for the intrudersthere was no punishment grave enough for them perhaps they should be abolished like any other challenging organism that threatened to damage its host perhaps worse than that perhaps nothing within his powers was quite severe enough but what was still in his power he forced himself to stand janine saw the ripple of lights flicker and freeze into a pattern as the oldest one rose to his extended height and spoke the female is to be recaptured and preserved he said this is to be done at once he stood there wobbling uneasily the effectors for his limbs were performing erratically he allowed himself to kneel once more while he pondered his options the exertion of going to the control room to set coursethe turmoil in his mind that had led him to do ithalf a million years of existence all had taken their toll he needed time to resttime that is for his autonomic systems to retrace and repair what damage they could and perhaps time no longer would be enough do not wake me again till this is done he said and the lights resumed their random flicker and slowly dwindled to darkness janine circled in wans armhis body half toward the oldest one half sheltering her trembling with fearknew without being told that preserved meant killed she was frightened too but she was also puzzled the old ones who lay snoring through their trial and judgment had not fallen asleep by chance janine recognized the results of a sleepgun janine knew also that none of her party had had one for that reason janine was not entirely surprised when an hour later and back in their pen they heard a stifled grunt from outside she was not surprised to see her sister run in waving a gun and calling to them not surprised that behind lurvy a tattered paul stepped over the sleeping form of tor she was not even surprised or not very much surprised to see that with them was another armed man she almost recognized she was not sure she had met him only when she was a child but he looked like the person she had seen on the relayed pv broadcasts from earth and in jolly messages that came from him on anniversaries and holidays robin broadhead older than the oldest one not at his worstnot even when he was feeling older than the oldest one himself and as dead as dead payterhad paul looked as bad as the pitiful creature waving a gun at him from the hatch of his own ship under the skungy monthold beard the mans face looked like a mummys he stank youd better take a bath paul snapped and put that silly gun away the mummy slumped against the hatch of the ship youre paul hall it said squinting at him for gods sake do you have anything to eat paul stared past him isnt there plenty still left in there he pushed into the ship and found that of course there were stacks of chonfood packets exactly as they had been left the mummy had been into the water bags had ripped at least three of them open the floor of the ship was puddled and muddied paul offered a ration keep your voice down he ordered and by the way who are you im robin broadhead what do you do with this bite into it snapped paul exasperatedless because of the man himself or even because of the way he smelled than because he was still shaking he had been terrified that it would be an old one he had come across so unexpectedly butrobin broadhead what was he doing here but he could not put the question just then broadhead was almost literally starving he turned the flat pillow of food over in his hands frowning and shaking and then bit into a corner of it as soon as he found it could be chewed he wolfed it down crumbs spilling from his mouth he stared up at paul while he jammed his mouth full faster than his teeth could deal with it take it easy paul said alarmed but he was too late the unfamiliar food after so long a deprivation did what could have been expected of it broadhead choked gagged and vomited it up damn you paul snarled theyll smell you all the way to the spindle broadhead leaned back gasping sorry he mumbled i thought i was going to die i pretty near did can you give me some water paul did a couple of sips at a time and then allowed the man just a corner of one of the brown and yellow packets the blandest there was slowly he ordered ill give you more later but he was beginning to realize how good it was to have another human being there afterwhat was itit must have been two months at least of his solitary skulking and hiding and plotting i dont know what youre doing here he said at last but im glad to see you broadhead licked the last crumbs off his lips and managed to grin why thats simple he said eyes avidly on the rest of the food in pauls hands i came here to rescue you broadhead had been dehydrated and almost asphyxiated but not really starved he kept down the crumbs paul let him have and demanded more kept that down too and was even able to help paul clean up the mess he had made paul found him clean clothes from wans sparse store in the shipthe garments were too long and too slim by far but the waistband of the kilt did not really need to close all the wayand led him to the largest of the water troughs to get himself clean it wasnt daintiness it was fear the old ones did not hear any better than human beings nor see even quite as well but their noses were astonishingly acute after two weeks of the narrowest of escapes in his first terrified blundering around heechee heaven after wan and lurvy had been captured paul had learned to bathe three times a day and much more he took post at a juncture of three corridors mounting guard while broadhead got the worst of his thirty days in a heechee ship off his skin rescue them in the first place it wasnt true broadheads intentions were more subtle and complicated than that in the second place broadheads plans were not the same as those paul had been maturing for two months he had some notion of tricking information out of the dead men and only the haziest notion of what to do with the information when he got it and he expected paul to help him carry two or three metric tons of machinery around heechee heaven never mind the risk never mind that paul might have ideas of his own the trouble with being rescued was that the rescuers expected to be in charge of the operation and expected paul to be grateful well he admitted to himself turning slowly to keep each corridor in viewthough the old ones were less diligent in patrolling than they had been at firsthe would have been grateful enough if broadhead had showed up at first in those days of panic when he ran and hid and did not dare either stay or leave or again a couple of weeks later when he had begun to work out a plan had dared to go to the dead mens room and make contact with the food factoryand learned that peter herter was dead the shipboard computer was no use to him too stupid and too overburdened even to relay his messages to earth the dead men were maddeningly were maddening he was entirely on his own and slowly his nerve came back and he began to plan even to act when he found that he could dare coming quite near the old ones provided he bathed enough to leave no odor trace he began his plan spying scheming studying recordingthat was one of the hardest parts it is very difficult to keep records of how your enemy behaves what paths are frequented and on what occasions none of them are likely to be about when you have nothing to write with or a watch or even the change of day and night unheard of in the steady blue glow from the heecheemetal walls it had finally occurred to him to use the habits of the old ones themselves as his chronometer of their behavior when he saw a party of them going back toward the spindle where the oldest one lay motionless they were getting ready to sleep when he saw a party moving away it meant the beginning of a new day they all slept at once or almost all out of some imperative he could not imagine and so there were times when he dared come nearer and nearer to the place where wan janine and lurvy were kept had even seen them once or twice daring to hide behind a berryfruit bush as the old ones were beginning to stir peering between the branches and then racing breathlessly away he knew he had it all worked out there were no more than a hundred or so of the old ones and they traveled usually in parties of only two or three remained the question of how to deal with even a party of two or three paul hall leaner and angrier than he had ever been in his life thought he knew how to do that in his first panicked days of flight and hiding after the others had been captured he had blundered far and far into the green and red corridors of heechee heaven in some of them even the lights were fading and sparse in some of them the air had a sour and unhealthful tang and when he slept there he awoke with his head pounding and thick in all of them there were objects machines gadgets things some of them still purring or ticking quietly to themselves some flickering with a ceaseless rainbow of lights he could not stay in those places because there was no food or water and he could not find what he most sought there were no real weapons perhaps the heechee had not needed them but there was one machine that had a gate of metal strips at one side and when he wrenched them away it did not blow up or electrocute him as he had half thought it would and he had a spear and half a dozen times he encountered what looked like smaller more complicated versions of the heechee tunnelers and some of them still worked when the heechee built they built forever it took paul three frightened thirsty baffling days of experiment to make any of them function stopping to creep back to the gold corridors or the ship for food and water always sure that the thundering noise of the machine would draw the old ones down on him before he was ready but it did not he learned to squeeze the nipple that hung down from the steering yoke to make the ready lights spring into life to shove the ponderous knurled wheel forward or back to make it advance or retreat to tread on the oval floorplate that caused the blueviolet glow to lance out before the machine softening even the heechee metal it touched that was the noisy part paul feared greatly that he would destroy something that would wreck heechee heaven itself if he did not bring down a search party when he came to move the machine to the place he had picked out it was almost quiet oozing forward on its rollogons and he stopped to consider he knew where the old ones went and when he had a spear that could kill a single old one maybe could let him defeat even two or three if he came on them by surprise he possessed a machine that could annihilate any number of old ones if he could only get them to mass in front of it it all added up to a strategy that might even work it was chancyoh god it was chancy it depended on at least half a dozen trials by combat even though the old ones did not seem to seek him armed who was to say that they might not learn and what arms might they have it meant killing some of them one by one so expertly and carefully that he did not attract the attention of the whole tribe until he was ready for itand then attracting them all at once or so large a majority of them that he could handle the rest with his spear and above all it meant that the oldest one the great machine paul had only glimpsed once or twice at long range and about whose powers he knew nothing must not intervene and how likely was that he had no sure answers he did have hopes the oldest one was too large to move easily through any of the corridors but the goldskeined ones nor did it seem to move frequently at all and perhaps he could somehow trick it too before the devouring haze of the tunneling machinewhich could not in this place really be a tunneling machine but seemed to work in about the same way at every step the odds were against him true but at every step there was at least a slim chance for success and it was not the risk that stopped him at the last the paul hall who stole about and schemed in the tunnels of heechee heaven half crazed with anger and fear and worry for his wife and the others was not entirely crazy he was the same paul hall whose gentleness and patience had made dorema herter marry him who had accepted her saucy sometimes bratty little sister and abrasive father as part of the bargain he wanted very much to save them and bring them to freedom even at risk there was always a way out of the risk for him if only to crawl aboard wans ship and return to the food factory and thusslowly alone and mournful but safeultimately to earth and wealth but apart from risk what was the cost the cost was wiping out perhaps an entire population of living and intelligent creatures they had taken his wife from him but they had not really harmed her and try as he would paul could not convince himself he had the right to exterminate them and now here was this rescuer this nearly dead castaway named robin broadhead who listened sketchily to pauls plan and smiled loftily and said politely enough youre still working for me hall well do it my way the hell we will broadhead stayed polite enough and even reasonableit was amazing what a bath and a little food had done for him the key he said is to find out what were up against help me lug this informationprocessing stuff to where the dead men are and well take care of that thats the first thing the first thing is rescuing my wife but why hall shes all right where she isyou said so yourself im not talking about forever one day maybe we find out what we can from the dead men we tape it all pump them dry if we can then we take the tapes and stick them in my ship and then no yes no and keep your goddamned voice down they squared off like kids in a schoolyard both flushed and furious their eyes locked until robin broadhead grimaced and shook his head and said oh hell paul are you thinking what im thinking paul hall let himself relax after a second he said actually im thinking the two of us would do better to figure out what is the best thing to do instead of arguing about who makes the decision broadhead grinned that was what i was thinking all right you know what my trouble is im so surprised to be still alive that i dont know how to adjust to it it only took them six hours to haul and set up the pmal processor where they wanted it but it was six hours of hard work they were both near the frayed end of exhaustion and it would have made sense to sleep but they were itching with impatience both of them once they had the main power source connected to the program banks alberts prerecorded voice instructed them step by step on how to do the restthe processor itself sprawled across the corridor the voice terminals inside the dead mens chamber next to the radio link robin looked at paul paul shrugged to robin robin started the program from just outside the door they could hear the flat wheedling voice from the terminal henrietta henrietta dear can you answer me pause no answer the program albert had written with sigfrid von shrinks help tried again henrietta its tom please speak to me it would have been faster to punch out henriettas code to attract her attention but harder to square with the pretense that her longlost husband had reached her from some faroff outpost by radio the voice tried again and once more paul scowled and whispered it isnt working give it a chance robin said but not confidently they stood there nervously while the dead computer voice pleaded and then at last a hesitant voice whispered tom tomasino is that you paul hall was a normal human being squashed a little out of shape perhaps from four years of imprisonment and a hundred days of flight and fright normal enough though to share the normal prurience but what he heard was more than he wanted to hear he grinned in embarrassment at robin broadhead who shrugged uneasily back the hurt tenderness and spiteful jealousy of other people is humiliating to hear and can only be eased by laughter the divorce detective passes around his bootleg tape of a wired bed for comic relief on a slow day at the office but this was not comic henrietta any henrietta even the machine revenant called henrietta was not funny in her moment of heartsdesire when she was being gulled and betrayed the program that wooed her was skillfully done it apologized and begged and it even sobbed in rustly tapehissing sobs when henriettas own flat tape voice broke with sobs of spent sadness and hopeless joy and then as it had been programmed to do it settled in for the kill would you dear henrietta could you is it possible for you to tell me how to operate a heechee ship pause hesitation then the voice of the dead woman said whyyes tomasino another pause it lengthened itself until the programmed deceiver moved in to fill the gap because if you could dear i think i might be able to join you im in a sort of a ship it has a control room if i knew how to work it it was incredible to paul that even a poorly stored machine intelligence could succumb to such transparent blandishments succumb henrietta did it was repellent to him to take part in the fraud but take part he did and once started henrietta could not be stopped the secret of controlling the heechee ships of course dear tomasino and the dead woman warned her fake lover to stand by for burst transmission and hurled out a whistling crackle of machine talk of which paul could not understand a sound and in which he could not find a word but robin broadhead listening to the private statusreport voice of the computer on his headset grinned and nodded and held up thumb and forefinger in a circle of success paul signed silence and pulled him down the corridor if youve got it he whispered lets get out of here oh ive got it chortled robin shes got it all she was in open circuit with whatever kind of machine runs this thing it picked her brains and she picked its and shes telling the whole thing great now lets find lurvy broadhead looked at him not angry but pleading just a few more minutes who knows what else she got no yesand then they looked at each other and shook their heads compromise said robin broadhead fifteen minutes all right and then we go rescue your wife they edged back along the corridor with smiles of rueful satisfaction on their faces but the satisfaction drained the voices were not embarrassingly intimate now they were worse they were almost quarreling there was somehow a snap and a snarl in the flat metallic voice that said youre being a pig tom the program was cloyingly reasonable but henrietta dear im only trying to find out what you try to find out grated the voice depends on what your capacities to learn are im trying to tell you something more important i tried to tell you before i tried to tell you all the while we were coming out here but no you didnt want to hear all you wanted was to get off in the lander with that fat bitch the program knew when to be placatory im sorry henrietta dear if you want me to learn some astrophysics i will damn right you will pause its terribly important tom pause and then we go back to the big bang are you listening tom of course i am dear said the program in its humblest and most endearing way all right it goes back to how the universe got started and we know that pretty wellwith one little hazy transition point thats a little obscure call it point x are you going to tell me what point x is dear shut up tom listen before point x essentially the whole universe was packed into a tiny glob no more than a matter of kilometers through superdense super hot so squeezed it had no structure then it exploded it began to expandup to point x and that part is pretty clear do you follow me so far tom yes dear thats basically simple cosmology isnt it pause just pay attention henriettas voice said at last then after point x it continued to expand as it expanded little bits of matter began to condense out of it first came nuclear particles hadrons and pious electrons and protons neutrons and quarks then real matter real hydrogen atoms then even helium atoms the exploding volume of gas began to slow turbulence broke it into immense clouds gravity pulled the clouds into clumps as they shrank the heat of contraction set nuclear reactions going they glowed the first stars were born the rest she finished is what we can see going on now the program picked up its cue i see that henrietta yes how long are we talking about now ah good question she said in a voice not at all complimentary from the beginning of the big bang to point x three seconds from point x to right now about eighteen billion years and there we have it the program was not written to deal with sarcasm but even in the flat metal voice sarcasm hung it did its best thank you dear it said and now will you tell me what is special about point x i would tell you in a thick minute my darling tomasino she said sunnily except that you are not my darling tomasino that asshead would not have understood one word of what i just said and i dont like being lied to and no matter what the program tried not even when robin broadhead dropped the pretense and spoke to her direct henrietta would say no more hell with it said broadhead at last weve got enough to worry about in the next couple of hours we dont have to go back eighteen billion years for it he hit a pressure release on the side of the processor and caught what came out the thick soft ragflop tape that had caught everything henrietta had said he waved it aloft thats what i came for he said grinning and now paul lets take care of your little problemand then go home and spend our millions in the deep restless sleep of the oldest one there were no dreams but there were irritations the irritations came faster and faster more and more urgent from the time the first gateway prospectors had terrifyingly come until he had written the last of them off only the wink of an eyenot more than a few years really and until the strangers and the boy were caught hardly a heartbeat and until he was awakened again to be told the female had escaped no time at allnone hardly even time for him to decouple sensors and effectors and settle down and now there was still no peace the children were panicked and quarrelsome it was not their noise alone that disturbed him noise could not awaken the oldest one only physical attack or being addressed directly what was most irritating about this racket was that it was not quite addressed to him but not quite not either it was a debatean argument a few frightened voices demanding he be told something at once a few even more frightened ones pleading against it and that was incorrect for half a million years the oldest one had trained his children in manners if he was needed he was to be addressed he was not to be awakened for trivial causes and certainly not by accident especially now especially when each effort of waking was more of a drain on his ancient fabric and the time was in sight when he might not wake at all the fretful rumpus did not stop the oldest one called on his external sensors and gazed upon his children why were so few of them there why were nearly half of them sprawled on the floor evidently asleep painfully he activated his communications system and spoke what is happening when quailing they tried to answer and the oldest one understood what they were saying the bands of color on his shell raced and blurred the female not recaptured the younger female and the boy gone too twenty more of the children found hopelessly asleep and scores of others gone to search the artifact not reporting back something was terribly wrong even at the very end of its useful life the oldest one was a superb machine there were resources seldom used powers not tapped for hundreds of thousands of years he rose on his rollogons to tower over the quaking children and reached down into his deepest and leastused memories for guidance and knowledge on his foreplate between the external vision receptors two polished blue knobs began a faint drone and atop his carapace a shallow dish glowed with faint violet light it had been thousands of years since the oldest one had used any of his more punitive effectors but as information from the great stores of memories gathered he began to believe that it was time to use them again he reached into the stored personalities even and henrietta was open to him he knew what she had said and what the new interlopers had asked he understood the meaning of the hand weapons robin broadhead had been waving around in the deepest of all memories the ones that went back even before his own fleshandblood life there was the lance that made his own ancestors go to sleep and this was clearly much the same here was trouble on a scale he had never known before of a kind he could not readily cope with if he could get at them but he could not his great bulk could not travel through the artifacts passages except the goldskeined ones the weapons that were ready to destroy would have no targets the children yes perhaps perhaps they could hunt out and overcome the others certainly it was worth the effort to order them to do so the few survivors and he did but in the rational mechanical mind of the oldest one the capacity for computation was unimpaired he could read the odds well they were not good the question was was his great plan endangered the answer was yes but there at least there was something he could do the heart of the plan was the place where the artifact was controlled it was the nerve center of the entire construct it was where he had dared to set in motion the final stages of his plan before he had finished framing the decision he was acting it out the great metal bulk shifted and turned and then rolled out across the spindle into the widemouthed tunnel that led to the controls once there he was secure let them come if they chose the weaponry was ready its great drain on his dwindling powers was making him slow and unsteady to move but there was power enough he could blockade himself and let the fleshandblood things settle things however they might and then he stopped ahead of him one of the wallaligning machines was out of place it sat squarely in the center of the corridor and behind it if he had been just a trifle less drained the fraction of a second faster but he was not the glow from the wall aligner washed over him he was blind he was deaf he felt the external protuberances burn off his shell felt the great soft cylinders he rolled on melt and stick the oldest one did not know how to feel pain he did know how to feel anguish of the soul he had failed the fleshandblood things had control of his artifacts and his plans were at an end forever the richest person there is my name is robin broadhead and i am the richest person there is in the whole solar system the only one who comes close is old bover and he would come a lot closer if he hadnt thrown half of his money into slum clearance and urban rehabilitation and a lot of what was left into an inchbyinch scan of transplutonian space looking for the ship with what was left of his wife trish the surviving herterhalls are also filthy with money thats a good thing especially for wan and janine who have a complicated relationship to sort out in a complicatedly unwelcoming world my wife essie is in the best of health i love her when i die that is when even full medical cant patch me up any more i have a little plan about how to deal with someone else i love and that satisfies me almost everything satisfies me the only exception is my science advisor albert who keeps trying to explain machs principle to me when we took over heechee heaven we got it all the way to control heechee ships the way to build heechee ships including the theory that makes it possible to go faster than light no it doesnt involve hyperspace or the fourth dimension it is very simple acceleration multiplies mass so says einsteinthe real one not albert but if the rest mass is zero it does not matter how many times you multiply it it remains zero albert says that mass can be created and proves it by basic logical principles it exists therefore it can be created therefore it can be eliminated since what can be made to be can also be made to stop being that is the heechee secret and with alberts help to set up the experiment and mortons help to coerce the gateway corp into making ships available we tried it out it didnt cost me a cent one of the advantages of great wealth is that you dont have to spend it all you have to do is get other people to spend it for you and thats what law programs are for so we sent two fives out at once from gateway one was on lander power only and it contained two people and a cylinder of solid aluminum with strain detectors attached the other held a full crew ready for an actual mission the instrument ship had a live camera pickup with an image split three ways one on the gravity meter one on the second ship one on a cesiumatom digital clock to my eyes the experiment didnt show a thing the second ship began to disappear and the gravity meter recorded its disappearance big deal but albert was elated its mass began to disappear before it did robin my god anyone could have tried that experiment any time in the last dozen years theres going to be at least a tenmilliondollar science bonus for this put it in petty cash i said and stretched and rolled over to kiss essie because we happened to be in bed at the time is very interesting dear robin she said drowsily and kissed me back albert grinned and averted his eyes partly because essie has been tinkering with his program and partly because he knew as well as i did that what she said was politely untrue astrophysics did not much interest my essie what interested her was the chance to play with working heechee machine intelligences and that interested her very much eighteen hours a day much until she had tracked down all the major systems in what was left of the oldest one and the dead men and the dead nonmen whose memories went back to an african savannah the better part of a million years ago not that she cared a lot about what was in the memories but how it was there was her very business at which she was very good reshuffling my albert program was the least of what essie got out of heechee heaven what we all got was a very great deal indeed the grand charts of the galaxy showing everywhere the heechee had been the grand charts of black holes showing where they are now even where kiara is as one tiny fringe benefit i even got the answer to one question that on a purely subjective level had been interesting me very much why was i still alive the ship that carried me to heechee heaven had flipped over into deceleration mode after nineteen days by all the laws of parity and common sense that meant it would not arrive for another nineteen by which time i should have been surely dead but in fact it docked in five and i wasnt dead at all or not quite but why albert gave me the answer every flight ever successfully completed in a heechee ship had been between two bodies that relatively were more or less at resta few tens or at most a few hundreds of kilometers a second difference in their relative velocities no more not enough to make a difference but my flight had been pursuing an object itself in very rapid motion it had been almost all acceleration the slowdown had taken only a tiny fraction of the speedup and so i lived and all that was very satisfying and yet and yet there is always a price there always has been every big jump forward has carried a hidden cost all through history man invented agriculture that meant someone had to plant de cotton and someone had to hoe de corn and dats how slavery was born man invented the automobile and got a dividend of pollution and highway death man got curious about the way the sun shines and out of his curiosity came the hbomb man found the heechee artifacts and tracked down some of their secrets and what did we get for one thing we got payter almost killing a world with a power no one had ever had before him for another we got some brandnew questions the answers to which i have not yet quite nerved myself up to face questions that albert wants to try to answer about machs principle and that henrietta raised with her talk about point x and the missing mass and a very big question in my own mind when the oldest one broke heechee heaven out of its orbit and sent it flying through space toward the core of the galaxy what exactly was he heading toward the scariest i guess and also the most satisfying i know moment of my life was when we had burned the feelers off the oldest one and armed with henriettas instructions sat down before the control board of heechee heaven it took two to make it move lurvy herterhall and i were the two most experienced pilots presentif you didnt count wan who was off with janine rounding up the waking old ones to tell them there had been a change in government lurvy took the righthand seat and i took the left and there we went it took more than a month to get back to orbiting the moon which was the point i had picked out it wasnt a wasted month there was plenty to do on heechee heaven but it went pretty slowly because i was in a very big hurry to get home it took all the nerve i had to squeeze that teat but you know it wasnt all that hard once we understood that the main bank of controls carried the codes for all the preset objectivesthere are more than fifteen thousand of them all over the galaxy and some outsideit was just a matter of knowing which code was which then all of us really delighted with ourselves we decided to show off we got a squawk from the radioastronomers on the far side because our circumlunar orbit was getting in the way of their dishes every time we came around so we moved you do that with the secondary boards the ones no one has ever dared to touch in midflight and that dont seem to do much on the original launch main boards preprogrammed objectives secondary boards any point you want provided you can spell out its galactic coordinates but the joker is that you cant use the secondary boards until youve nulled the primaries by setting them all down to zerothat translates to a clear deep red color on eachand if any prospector ever happened to do that on his own he lost his programming to get back to gateway how simple everything is once you know and so we put that big sonofabitching artifact half a million metric tons of it in close earth orbit and invited company the company i wanted most was my wife what i wanted next was my science program albert einsteinthats not really a reflection on essie you know because she wrote him it was a tossup whether i went down to her or she came up to me but not in her mind she wanted to get her hands on the machine intelligences in heechee heaven i would judge at least as much as i wanted to get mine on her in a minute earth orbit the transmission time isnt bad anyway as soon as we were in range the machine albert had programmed for me was talking to him pumping everything it had learned into him and by the time i was ready to talk to him he was ready to talk back of course it wasnt the same albert in full threedimensional color in the tank at home was a lot more fun to chat with than blackandwhite albert on a flat plate in heechee heaven but until some new equipment came up from earth that was all i had and anyway it was the same albert good to see you again robin he said benevolently poking the stem of his pipe toward me i guess you know you have about a million messages waiting for you theyll wait anyway i had already had about a million or it seemed that way what they mostly said was that everybody was annoyed but in the long run delighted and i was once again very rich what i want to hear first i said is what you want to tell me sure thing robin he tapped out his pipe regarding me well he said technology first we know the general theory of the heechee drive and were getting a handle on the fasterthanlight radio as to the informationhandling circuits in the dead men and so onas i am sure you know he twinkled cospozha lavorovnabroadhead is on her way to join you i think we may confidently expect considerable progress there very quickly in a few days a volunteer crew will go to the food factory we are pretty sure it too can be controlled and if so it will be brought into some nearby orbit for study and i think i can promise duplication i dont suppose you want to hear about minor technology in detail just now not really i said or not right at this minute then he said nodding as he filled the pipe again let me get to some theoretical considerations first there is the question of black holes we have unequivocally located the one your friend gelleklara moynlin is in i believe it would be possible to send a ship there with reasonable assurance that it would arrive without serious damage return however is another question there appears to be nothing in the heechee stores that gives us a cookbook recipe for getting anything out of a black hole theory yes but if one should desire to convert the theory into practice that will require r d a lot of it i would hesitate to promise results in less than say a matter of years more likely decades i know he said leaning forward earnestly that this is a matter of personal importance to you robin it also may be a matter of grave importance to all of us by which i mean not only the human race but machine intelligences as well i had never seen him look so serious you see he said the destination of the artifact heechee heaven has also been unequivocally identified may i show you a picture that was rhetoric of course i didnt reply and he didnt wait he shrank down into a corner of the flatplate screen while the main picture appeared it was a wash of white shaped like a very amateurishly drawn turkish crescent it was not symmetrical the crescent was off to one side and the rest of the picture was black except for an irregular sprinkle of light that completed the horns of the crescent and protracted them into a hazy ellipse it is too bad you cannot see this in color robin said albert squinting up from his corner of the screen it is blue rather than white shall i tell you what you are seeing it is orbiting matter around some very large object the matter to your left which is coming toward us travels fast enough to emit light the matter to the right which is going away travels more slowly relative to us what we are seeing is matter turning into radiation as it is drawn into an extremely large black hole which is located at the center of our galaxy i thought the speed of light was not relative i snapped he expanded to fill the screen again it is not robin but the orbit velocity of the matter which produces it is that picture is from the gateway file and until just recently it was not located in space but now it is clear that it is at indeed that in a sense it forms the galactic core he paused while he lit his pipe looking at me steadily well thats not quite true there was the splitsecond lag and even alberts circuits couldnt do anything about it if i moved his gaze lingered where i had been for just long enough to be disconcerting i didnt rush him and when he had finished puffing the pipe alight he said robin i am often unsure of what information to volunteer to you if you ask me a question thats different about any subject you suggest i will tell you as much of what i know as you will listen to i will also tell you what may be so if you ask for a hypothesis and i will volunteer hypotheses when according to the constraints written into my program that seems appropriate gospozha lavorovnabroadhead has written quite complex normative instructions for this sort of decisionmaking but to simplify they come down to an equation let v represent the value of a hypothesis let p represent its probability of being true if i can complete the sum of vp so that it equals at least one then i should and do volunteer the hypothesis but oh robin how hard it is to assign the correct numerical values to p and v in the specific case now at issue i cannot be in any way sure of any value i can give its probability but its importance is very high to all intents it might as well be regarded as infinite by then he had me sweating what i know for sure about alberts programming is that the longer he takes to tell me something the less he thinks i am going to like hearing it albert i said get the hell on with it sure thing robin he said nodding but unwilling to be rushed but let me first say that this conjecture satisfies not only known astrophysics although on a rather complex level but also some other questions eg where heechee heaven was going when you turned it around and why the heechee themselves disappeared before i can give you the conjecture i must review four main points as follows one the quantities tiny jim referred to as gosh numbers these are numerical quantities mostly of the sort called dimensionless because they are the same in any units you measure the mass ratio between the electron and the proton the dirac number to express the difference between electromagnetic and gravitational force the eddington finestructure constant and so forth we know these numbers to great precision what we do not know is why they are what they are why shouldnt the finestructure constant be say instead of plus if we understood astrophysicsif we had a complete theorywe should be able to deduce these numbers from the theory we do have a good theory but we cant deduce the gosh numbers from it why is it possible he asked gravely that these numbers are in some way accidental he paused puffing on his pipe and then held up two fingers two machs principle this also turns out to be a question but perhaps a somewhat easier one my late predecessor he said twinkling a littlei think to reassure me that this was indeed easier to handlemy late predecessor gave us the theory of relativity which is commonly understood to mean that everything is relative to something else excepting only the velocity of light when you are at home on tappan sea robin you weigh about eightyfive kilograms that is to say that is a measure of how much you and the planet earth attract each other it is your weight in a sense relative to the earth we also have a quality called mass the best measure of mass is the force necessary to accelerate an object say you from a state of rest we usually consider mass and weight to be about the same and on the surface of the earth they are but mass is supposed to be an intrinsic quality of matter while weight is always relative to something else but he twinkled again lets do a gedankeexperiment robin lets suppose that youre the only thing in the universe theres no other matter what would you weigh nothing what would your mass be ah thats the question lets suppose you have a little rocketbelt and you decided to accelerate yourself you then measure the acceleration and compute the force to move you and you come out with your massdo you no robin you do not because there is nothing to measure movement against moving as a concept is meaningless so mass itselfaccording to machs principledepends on some external system mach thought it might be what he called the entire background of the universe to be meaningful and according to machs principle as my predecessor and others extended it so do all the other intrinsic characteristics of matter energy and space including the gosh numbers robin am i wearying you you bet your ass you are albert i snarled but go ahead he smiled and held up three fingers three what henrietta called point x as you remember henrietta failed her doctoral defense but i have made a study of her dissertation and i am able to say what she meant by it for the first three seconds after the big bang which is to say the beginning of the universe as we now know it the entire universe was relatively compact exceedingly hot and entirely symmetrical henriettas dissertation quoted at length from an old cambridge mathematician named tong b tang and others the point they made was that after that time after what henrietta called point x the symmetry became frozen all the constants we now observe became fixed at that point all the gosh numbers they did not exist before point x they have existed and are unchangeable ever since so at point x in time three seconds after the beginning of the big bang something happened it may have been some quite random eventsome turbulence in the exploding cloud or it may have been deliberate he stopped and smoked for a while watching me when i did not react he sighed and held up four fingers four robin and the last i do apologize for this long preamble the final point in henriettas conjecture had to do with missing mass there simply does not appear to be enough mass in the universe to fit the otherwise very successful theories of the big bang here henrietta made an immense leap in her doctoral dissertation she suggested that the heechee had learned how to create mass and destroy itand in this as we now know she was correct although it was only a guess on her part and the seniors before whom she conducted the defense of her dissertation were very quick to challenge it she then made a further leap she suggested that the heechee had in fact caused some mass to disappear not on a ship although if she had guessed that she would have been correct on a very large scale on a universewide scale in fact she conjectured that they had studied the gosh numbers as we have and come to certain conclusions which seem to be true here robin it gets a little tricky so pay close attentionbut we are almost home you see these fundamental constants like the gosh numbers determine whether or not life can exist in the universe among very many other things to be sure but if some of them were a little higher or a little lower life could not exist do you see the logical consequence of that statement yes i think you do it is a simple syllogism major premise the gosh numbers are not fixed by natural law but could have been different if certain different events had taken place at point x minor premise if they were different in certain directions the universe would be less hospitable to life conclusion ah thats the heart of it conclusion if they were different in certain other directions the universe might be more hospitable to life and he stopped talking and sat regarding me reaching down into a carpet slipper with one hand to scratch the sole of his foot i dont know which of us would have outwaited the other then i was trying to digest a lot of very indigestible ideas and old albert he was determined to give me time to digest them before either of those could happen paul hall came trotting into the cubicle i had made my own yelling company hey robin weve got visitors well my first thought was essie of course wed talked i knew she was on her way to the kennedy launchport at least even if not actually waiting there for our orbit to settle down and get off i stared at paul and then at my watch there hasnt been time i said because there hadnt he was grinning come and see the poor bastards he chortled and thats what they were all right six of them crammed into a five launched from gateway less than twentyfour hours after i had taken off from the moon carrying enough armament to wipe out a whole division of oldest ones ready to save and profit they had flown all the way out after heechee heaven reversed course and flown all the way back somewhere en route we must have passed them without knowing it poor bastards but they were pretty decent guys volunteers taking off on a mission that must have seemed insecure even by gateway standards i promised them that they would get a share of the profits there was plenty to go around it wasnt their fault that we didnt need them especially considering how much we might have needed them if we had so we made them welcome janine proudly showed them around wan grinning and waving his sleepgun around introduced them to the gentle old ones placid in the face of this new invasion and by the time all that settled down i realized that what i needed most was food and sleep and i took both when i woke up the first news i got was that essie was on her way but not due for a while yet i fidgeted around for a while trying to remember everything albert had said trying to make a mental picture of the big bang and that critical thirdsecond instant when everything got frozen and not really succeeding so i called albert again and said more hospitable how ah robin he saidnothing ever takes him by surprise thats a question i cant answer we dont even know what all the machian features of the universe are but maybe maybe he said showing by the crinide at the corners of his eyes that he was only guessing to humor me maybe immortality maybe a faster synaptic speed of an organic brain ie higher intelligence maybe only more planets that are suitable for life to evolve any of the above or all of them the important thing is that we can theorize that such more hospitable features could exist and that it should be possible to deduce them from a proper theoretical basis henrietta went that far then she went a little further suppose the heechee learned a little more astrophysics than we decided what the right features would beand set out to produce them how would they go about it well one way would be to shrink the universe back to the primordial state and start over again with a new big bang how could that happen if you can create and destroy mass easy juggle it around stop the expansion start it contracting again then somehow stay outside of the point concentration wait for it to explode againand then from outside the monobloc do whatever had to be done to change the fundamental dimensionless numbers of the universe so that a new one was born that would bewell call it heaven my eyes were popping is that possible to you or me now no absolutely impossible wouldnt have a clue where to begin not to you or me dummy to the heechee ah robin he said mournfully who can say i dont see how but that doesnt mean they wouldnt i cant even guess how to manipulate the universe to make it come out right but that might not be necessary you have to assume they would have some way of existing essentially forever thats necessary even to do it once and if forever why then you could simply make random changes and see what happened until you got the universe you wanted he took time to look at his cold pipe thoughtfully for a moment and then put it in his sweatshirt pocket unlit thats as far as henrietta got with her dissertation before they really fell in on her because then she said that the missing mass might in fact prove that the heechee had really begun to interfere with the orderly development of the universeshe said they were removing mass from the outer galaxies to make them fall back more rapidly perhaps she thought they were also adding mass at the centerif there is one and she said that that might explain why the heechee had run away they started the process she guessed and then went off to hide somewhere in some sort of timeless stasis maybe like a big black hole until it ran its course and they were ready to come out and start things over again thats when it really bit the fan no wonder can you imagine a bunch of physics professors trying to cope with something like that they said she should try for a degree in heechee psychology instead of astrophysics they said she had nothing to offer but conjecture and assumptionno way to test the theory just a guess and they thought it was a bad one so they refused her dissertation and she didnt get her doctorate and so she went off to gateway to be a prospector and wound up where she is dead and he said thoughtfully pulling the pipe out again i do actually robin think she was wrong or at least sloppy we have very little evidence that the heechee had any possible way of affecting matters in any galaxy but our own and she was talking about the entire universe but youre not sure not a bit sure robin i yelled dont you at least have a fucking guess sure thing robin he said gloomily but no more than that please calm yourself see the scale is wrong the universe is too big from anything we know and the time is too short the heechee were here less than a million years ago and the expansion time of the universe to date is something like twenty thousand times that longrecoil time could hardly be less its mathematically bad odds that they would have picked that particular time to show up show up he coughed i left out a step robin theres another guess in there and im afraid its my own suppose this is the universe the heechee built suppose they somehow evolved in a less hospitable one but didnt like it and caused it to contract to make a new one which is the one were in that doesnt fit badly you know they could have come out to look around maybe found it just the way they wanted it and now maybe the ones who did the exploring have gone back to get the rest of them albert for christs sake he said gently robin i wouldnt be saying these things if i could help it its only a conjecture i dont think you have any idea how difficult it is for me to conjecture in this way and i wouldnt be able to do it except forwell heres the thing there is one possible way for something to survive a contraction and a new big bang and that is to be in a place where time effectively stops what kind of place is that why a black hole a big one one big enough so that it is not losing mass by quantum tunneling and therefore can survive indefinitely i know where theres a black hole like that robin mass about fifteen thousand times the sun location the center of our galaxy he glanced at his watch and changed expression if my calculations are close robin he said your wife should be arriving about now einstein the first damn thing shes going to do is rewrite you he twinkled she already has robin he pointed out and one of the things she has taught me to do is to relieve tension when appropriate by some comical or personally rewarding comment youre telling me i ought to be all tensed up well not really robin he said all this is quite theoreticalif that much and in terms of human life perhaps a long way off but perhaps not that black hole in the center of our galaxy is at least one possibility for the place where the heechee went and in terms of flight time in a heechee ship not all that distant andi said that we had determined the objective of the oldest ones course that was it robin it was heading straight for that black hole when you turned it around i was tired of being on heechee heaven weeks before essie was she was having the time of her life with the machine intelligences but i wasnt tired of essie so i stayed around until she at last admitted she had everything she could use on ragflop tape and fortyeight hours later we were back at the tappan sea and ninety minutes after that wilma liederman was there with all the tools of her trade checking essie out to the last crumb under her toenail i wasnt worried i could see that essie was all right and when wilma agreed to stay on for a drink she admitted it then she wanted to talk about the medical machine the dead men had used to keep wan in shape all the time he was growing up and before she left we had set up a milliondollar research and development companywith wilma as presidentto see what could be done with it and thats how easy it was thats how easy it all is when everythings going your way or almost everything there was still that sort of uneasy feeling when i thought about the heechee at that place at the middle of the galaxy that is very unsettling you know if albert had suggested that the heechee were going to come out breathing fire and destruction within the next year why sure i could have worried the hell out of that if hed said ten years or even a hundred i could have worked up pensiveness as a minimum and probably fullscale fright but when you come to astronomical timeswell hell how easy is it to worry about something that might not happen for another billion years and yet the notion just would not go away it made me fidgety through dinner after wilma left and when i brought in the coffee essie was curled in front of the fireplace very trim in her stretch pants brushing her long hair and she looked up at me and said will probably not happen you know robin how can you be so sure there are fifteen thousand heechee targets programmed into those ships weve checked out what fewer than a hundred and fifty of them and one of those was heechee heaven law of averages says there are a hundred others like that somewhere and whos to say one of them isnt racing in to tell the heechee what were doing right now dear robin she said turning to rub her nose against my knee in a friendly way drink your coffee you know nothing about statistical mathematics and anyway whos to say they would mean to do us harm they wouldnt have to mean to i know what would happen for gods sake its obvious its what happened to the tahitians the tasmanians the eskimos the american indiansits what has always happened all through history a people that comes up against a superior culture is destroyed nobody means it they just cant survive always robin oh come on no mean it she insisted counterexample what happened when romans discovered gauls they conquered the shit out of them thats what true no nearly true but then a couple of hundred years later who conquered who robin the barbarians conquered rome robin im not talking about conquest im talking about a racial inferiority complex what happens to any race that lives in contact with a race smarter than they are why different things under different circumstances robin greeks were smarter than romans robin romans never had a new idea in their lives except to build with or kill people with romans didnt mind they even took greeks right into their homes to teach them all about poetry and history and science as slaves dear robin she said putting down her coffee cup and coming up to sit next to me wisdom is a kind of resource tell me when you want information who do you ask i thought it over for a minute well albert mostly i admitted i see what youre saying but thats different its a computers job to know more and think faster than i do in certain ways thats what theyre for exactly dear robin as far as can tell you have not been destroyed she rubbed her cheek against mine and then sat up straight you are restless she decided what would you like to do what are my options i asked reaching for her but she shook her head dont mean that anyway not this minute want to watch pv i have a taped section from tonights news when you and wilma were scheming which shows your good friends visiting their ancestral home the old ones in africa saw it this afternoon some local promoter had thought it would be good publicity to show olduvai gorge to the old ones he was right the old ones didnt like it a lothated the heat chirped grumpily at each other about the shots they had had to take didnt care much for the air flight but they were news so were paul and lurvy at the moment in dortmund to arrange for a mausoleum for lurvys father as soon as his remains got back from the food factory so was wan getting rich on pv appearances as the boy from heechee heaven so was janine having a marvelous time meeting her singingstar penpals at last in the flesh so was i we were all rich in money and fame what they would make of it after all i could not guess but what i wanted at last became clear get a sweater essie i said lets go for a walk we strolled down to the edge of the icy water holding hands why is snowing essie announced peering up at the bubble seven hundred meters over our heads usually you cant see it very clearly but tonight edgelighted from the heaters that keep snow or ice from crumbling it it was a milky dome broken with reflections from lights on the ground stretching from horizon to horizon is it too cold for you perhaps just here near the water she acknowledged we climbed back up the slope to the little palm grove by the fountain and sat on a bench to watch the lights on tappan sea it was comfortable there the air never gets really cold under the bubble but the water is the hudson running naked through seven or eight hundred kilometers before it hits the palisades dam and every once in a while in winter chunks of sheet ice bob under the barriers and wind up rubbing against our boat dock essie i said ive been thinking know that dear robin she said about the oldest one the machine oh really she pulled her feet up to get them off the grass damp from vagrant drifts from the fountain very fine machine she said quite tame since you pulled its teeth provided is not given external effectors or mobility or access to control circuits of any kindyes quite tame what i want to know i said is whether you could build one like it for a human being ah she said hum yes i think so would take some time and of course large sums of money but yes and you could store a human personality in itafter the person died i mean as well as the dead men were stored quite a good bit better would say some difficulties mostly biochemical not my department she leaned back looking upward at the iridescent bubble overhead and said consideringly when i write computer program robin i speak to computer in some language or other i tell it what it is and what it is to do heechee programming is not the same rests on direct chemical readout of brain old ones brain is not chemically quite identical with yours and mine therefore dead man storage is very far from perfect but old ones must be much farther from actual heechee for whom process was first developed heechee managed to convert process without any apparent difficulty therefore it can be done yes when you die dear robin is possible to read your brain into a machine then put machine in heechee ship and fly it off to sagittarius yy black hole where it can say hello to gelleklara moynlin and explain episode was not your fault for this you have my guarantee only you must not die for say five to eight years yet to allow for necessary research will you promise that for me please there are times when something catches me so by surprise that i dont know whether to cry or get angry or laugh in this case i stood up quickly and stared down at my dear wife and then i decided which to do and laughed sometimes you startle me essie i said but why robin she reached out and took my hand suppose it was the other way around hey suppose it was i who many years ago had been through a very great personal tragedy exactly like yours robin in which someone i loved very much was harmed very severely in such a way that i could never see that person or explain to her what happened do you not think i would want very much to at least speak to her again in some way to tell her how i felt i started to answer but she stood up and put her finger on my lips was rhetorical question robin we both know answer if your kiara is still alive she will want very much to hear from you this is beyond doubt so she said here is plan you will dienot soon i hope brain will go into machine maybe will make extra copy for me you permit but one copy flies off to black hole to look for kiara and finds her and says to her kiara dear what happened could not be helped but wish you to know i would have given life itself to save you and then robin do you know what kiara will answer to this strange machine that appears out of nowhere perhaps only a few hours her time after incident itself i didnt the whole point was that i didnt but i didnt say so because essie didnt give me a chance she said then kiara will answer why robin dear i know you would because of all men ever born you are the one whom i most trust and respect and love i know she would say this robin because for her it would be true as it is for me the place where the heechee went at six oclock on robin broadheads tenth birthday he had a party the woman next door gave him socks a board game and as a sort of joke present a book entitled everything we know about the heechee their tunnels had only recently been discovered on venus and there was much conjecture about the location of the place where the heechee went their physical appearance and their purposes the joke part of the book was that although it contained a hundred and sixty pages all of them were blank at that same time on that same dayor at any rate at its equivalent in local time which was a great deal differenta person was taking a turn under the stars before retiring for sleep he was also anticipating an anniversary of a sort but not a party he was a long way from robin broadheads birthday cake and candles more than forty thousand lightyears and a long way from the appearance of a human being he had a name but out of respect and because of the work he had done he was usually called something which translates as captain over his squaredoff finely furred head the stars were extremely bright and close when he squinted up at them they hurt his eyes in spite of the carefully designed glasslike shell that covered the place he lived and much of his entire planet sullen red typems brighter than the moon as seen from earth three golden cs a single hot strawcolored f painful to look at there were no os or bs in his sky there were also no faint stars at all captain could identify every star he saw because there were only ten thousand or so of them nearly all cool and old ones and even the dimmest clearly visible to the naked eye and beyond those familiar thousandswell he could not see beyond them not from where he strolled but he knew from his many spaceflights that past them all was the turbulent almost invisible bluetinged shell that surrounded everything he and his people owned of the universe it was a sky that would have terrified a human being on this night rehearsing in his mind what would happen after he woke it almost frightened the captain wide of shoulder and hip narrow front to back the captain waddled as he walked back to the belt that would bring him to his sleeping cocoon it was a short trip by his perceptions only a few minutes the captain said goodnight to his drowsy roommates removed the necklaces of rank from his shoulders unstrapped the lifesupport and communications unit from between his wide spaced legs raised the lid of his cocoon and slipped inside he turned over eight or ten times covering himself with the soft spongy dense sleeping litter the captains people had come from burrowers rather than scamperers across a plain they slept best as their prehistoric ancestors had slept when the captain had made himself comfortable he reached one skinny hand up through the litter to pull the top of the cocoon closed as he had done all of his life as all of his people had done to sleep well as they had pulled the stars themselves over to cover them when they decided on the necessity for a very long and worrisome sleep for all of them the joke of robins birthday book was a little spoiled because it was not quite true some things were known about the heechee in some ways it was evident that they were very unlike human beings but in very significant waysthe same in curiosity only curiosity could have led them to visit so many strange places so very far apart in technology heechee science was not the same as human but it rested on the same thermodynamics the same laws of motion the same stretch of the mind into tininess and immensity the nuclear particle and the universe itself in basic chemistry of the body they breathed quite similar air they ate quite compatible food what was central to what everyone knew about the heechee or hoped or guessedwas that they were not really when you came right down to it all that different from human beings a few thousand years ahead maybe in civilization and science maybe not even that much and in that what everyone guessed was not wrong less than eight hundred years passed between the time the first crude heechee ship ventured to try masscancellation as a means of transport and the time when their expeditions had washed over most of the galaxy eight hundred yearsbut what years the heechee exploded there were a billion of them then ten then a hundred they built wheeled and rollered vehicles to conquer the unfamiliar surface of their planet and in no more than a couple of generations were off into space on rockets a few generations more and they were searching the planets of nearby stars they learned as they went they deployed instruments of immense size and great subtletya neutron star for a gravity detector an interferometer a lightyear across to catch and measure the radio waves from galaxies whose redshifts approached the limit the stars they visited and the galaxies they gazed at were almost identical with those seen from earthastronomical time does not trouble with a few hundred thousand yearsbut they saw more keenly and understood more thoroughly and what they saw and understood was at the end of surpassing importance to them for alberts conjecture was truenearly truetrue in every detail up to the point at which it became terribly false as a result of their understanding the heechee did what seemed to them best they recalled all their farflung expeditions tidying behind them to carry away everything that might be useful and could be moved they studied some million stars and from those chose a few thousandsome to cast away because they were dangerous some to bring together it was not hard for them to do the ability to cancel mass or create meant that the forces of gravity were their servants they selected a population of stable stars and longlived winnowed out the dangerous ones and brought them together or near enough together to do what they wanted off them black holes come in all sizes a certain concentration of matter in a certain volume of space and gravity wraps it closed a black hole can be as big as a galaxy with its component stars hardly closer than in our own the heechees plans were not so grand they sought a volume of space a few dozen lightyears across filled it with stars entered it in their ships and watched it close around them from that time on the heechee were sealed off from the rest of the universe burrowed into their nest of stars time changed for them within a black hole the flow of time slowsslows greatly in the universe outside more than threequarters of a million years went by within what seemed to captain no more than a couple of decades while they were stamping out comfortable nests for themselves in their captured planets the mild gentle pliocene epoch gave place to the storms and siroccos of the pleistocene the gtinz ice crept down from the north and retreated then the mindel the riss the worm the australopithecines captain had kidnappedto help along perhaps or at least to study in the hope of finding hope in themdisappeared a failed experiment pithecanthropus appeared and was gone heidelberg man the neanderthalers they crept north and south as the ice directed inventing tools learning to bury their dead and ring them with a circle of ibex horns learningbeginning to learnto speak land bridges sprouted between the continents and were washed away over some of them scared starving primitive tribes crept a wave from asia that ultimately flowed down from alaska to cape horn another wave that stayed where it was growing pads of fat around the sinuses to shield its lungs against the stinging arctic cold the children that captain fathered in the warrens of venus and kept with him while he and his teams surveyed the earth and selected the most promising of its primates for acquisition were not yet fully grown when homo sapiens learned the uses of fire and the wheel and time passed each beat of captains twin hearts took half a day in the universe outside when the sumerians came down from their mountains to invent the city on the persian plateau captain was invited to participate in the forthcoming anniversary talk as he prepared his guest list sargon built an empire while he instructed his machines with the program for the meeting small shivering men hewed blue stone into menhirs to form stonehenge columbus discovered america while captain was fretful over lastminute cancellations and changes he finished his evening meal while the first human rockets tottered into orbit and decided to stretch his legs before retiring as a human explorer wild with surprise broke into the first heechee tunnel on venus he slept through the time of robin broadheads growth puberty voyage to gateway and voyages from it the discovery of the food factory the decision to explore it he half woke just as the herterhall party was starting its fouryear climb to orbit and went back to sleepto him it was the equivalent of less than an hourthrough all their wearying trip captain after all that was still relatively young he had the equivalent of a good ten years of active energetic life ahead of himor what the outside universe would see as a quarter of a million years the purpose of the anniversary meeting was to review the heechee decision to retreat to a black hole and to contemplate what else might need be done it was a short meeting all heechee meetings were short when they were not social and prolonged purely for the pleasure they gave machinemediated discussions eliminated so much waste that the fate of a world could be settled in minutes settled many things were there was disquieting news the ftype star they had somewhat hesitantly included in their nest was showing some signs which might indicate ultimate instability not soon but it might be well to consider expelling it from their neighborhood some of the news was unhappy but expected the most recent messenger ship from outside revealed no trace of another spacefaring civilization coming to life some of it was expected and discounted in advance the most rigorous theoretical tests had shown that the theory of oscillating universes was correct and that indeed the machsprinciple hypothesis which suggested that at an early point in the big bang the dimensionless numbers could be changed was valid finally the decision to so situate themselves that time outside passed forty thousand times faster than in their closedup sphere was reopened for discussion was to enough of a gain it could be made moreas much more as anyone could wishsimply by contracting the size of the hole and perhaps at the same time excluding that troublesome f studies were ordered congratulations were exchanged the meeting was over captain his work for the time through went once again to the surface for a stroll it was daylight now the transparent screens had darkened themselves accordingly even so fifteen or twenty bright stars shone in the bluegreen sky defying their sun the captain yawned widely thought of breakfast decided instead to relax he sat drowsily in the tawny sunshine thinking of the meeting and all that surrounded it heecheehuman similarities were great enough for the captain to be a little disappointed on the personal level that those creatures he himself had chosen and established in the artifact had not come to anything much of course they might yet the messenger rockets came in only every year or two as they might have estimated itmore like every fifty thousand years by the standards of human beings on earthand a stargoing civilization might slip between the cracks even if his own project failed there were still fifteen or sixteen others all around the galaxy where they had seen at least hopeful traces of someday intelligent life but most were not even as advanced as the australopithecines the captain sat back in his forked bench his lifesupport capsule comfortably resting in the angle beneath him and squinted up at the sky if they came he wondered how would they know when they came would the sky split open would the thin schwarzschild shell of their black hole simply evaporate and a universe of stars shine in not much more likely but if and when it happened they would know he was sure of that the evidence was sure it was not the sort of evidence that only the heechee could read if any of their experiments did attain civilization and science they would see it too the anisotropic nature of the k cosmic background radiation showing an inexplicable drift the physical theory that suggested such fundamental numbers as made life possible in the first place could be changed the subtle clues from distant galaxies that showed their rate of expansion was slowing down had already for some of them begun to reverse this was past the point of human capability for observationyet but only perhaps by a matter of years or decades when it became clear to the heechee not only that the universe might be destroyed in order to rebuild itbut that someone somewhere was actually doing itthey were appalled try as they would they could get no fix on who was doing it or where they might be all that was sure was that with them the heechee wanted no confrontation so captain and all the other heechee wished their experiments great wisdom and prosperity out of charity and kindness out of curiosity and out of something else the experiments were more than experiments they were a sort of buffer state if any of the experimental races the heechee had started truly had flourished they might by now be truly technological they might by now be finding traces of the heechee themselves and how awed they might be the captain thought by those evidences the heechee had left behind he tried to smile as he formed the equation in his mind experiments heechee heechee them whoever they were at least captain thought grayly to himself when they do come back to reoccupy this universe that they are reshaping to suit their whims theyll have to get through those others before they get to us
