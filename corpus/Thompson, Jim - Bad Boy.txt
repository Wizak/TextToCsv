bad boy by jim thompson copyright my earliest recollections arc of being pinched not in the figurative sense but actually i was an awkward largeheaded tot much prone to stuttering and stumbling over my own feet my sister maxine though somewhat my junior was quickmoving quickthinking glib and extremely agile when my actions and appearance irritated her and they seemed to almost constantly she pinched me when i failed to respond quickly enough to her commands she pinched me the metaphor as smooth as a babys skin has always been meaningless to me my infant hide appeared to have been stippled with a set of coal tongs one day shortly after the thompson family fortunes had undergone an unusually terrifying nosedive and we had moved into a particularly execrable section of oklahoma city maxine spotted two negro children returning home from the grocery they had a large bottle of milk with them bringing me up from the steps with a quick pinch maxine dragged me out to the sidewalk and accosted the two youngsters would they like to be white she inquired well in return for their milk she would perform the transfiguration she had done the trick for me and i had been blacker than they were much much blacker and now just look at me the tots were a little dubious but being pinched i loudly swore to maxines tale and being pinched again i hurried into the kitchen and got the implements a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush with which the transformation was to be effected at maxines instigation i took the patients out to the backyard water hydrant and began scrubbing them maxine took their milk into the privy drank all she could hold then dropped the bottle down the hole emerging she entered the house beginning to scream with horror as soon as she had got through the door mom came running out maxine in the vanguard pretending to pull me away from the puzzled negroes she got in several energetic pinches making me howlingly incoherent by the time mom reached the scene she gave the tots the price of a fresh quart of milk wiped them off and dragged me into the house declaring that she didnt know what she was going to do with me snickering hideously maxine remained in the yard free to go about her devilish designs being very young i was unable to explain the affair within the time that it would have done any good to explain i got an impression from it however very nebulous then but one that expanded and jelled later i was going to catch hell no matter what i did i might as well try to enjoy myself i was always a sucker for friendship anyone who spoke a friendly word to me could have the buster brown blouse which i customarily wore in my earlier years my father traveled considerably about oklahoma seldom staying in any town more than a month not long enough for me to become accustomed to a strange school yet too long for me to lay out just about the time i began to get acquainted we would puli up stakes so i hungered for friendliness and no matter how many times i was duped i never ceased to bite on the bait that was put in front of me there was a game called pushover in those days a boy would come up to you put his arm around your shoulder and engage you in kindly conversation then just when you were beginning to warm up to him another boy would kneel behind you the first would give you a push and you would fall backwards on your head i dont know how many times i fell for this game and similar ones before i began to get the idea that what appeared to be friendship might be something else entirely i never liked the idea and i fought against it in later life more or less as a duty i would draw back from a proffered kindliness and coldly demand the reason for it in time my father settled more or less permanently in oklahoma city where he became the law partner of logan billingsley brother of sherman the stork club proprietor in the early days of oklahoma pop had been a peace officer and had saved logan from being lynched i know nothing about the merits of the case but i do know that they became close friends and later partners logan had a son named glenn a more mischievous brat than which never lived i understand that he is now running a swank restaurant in hollywood but that has nothing to do with this story glenn led a charmed life one saturday afternoon when he was leaning out the office window he fell out but he survived the fourstory fall with no more than a scratch he landed on the awning of the streetlevel drug store went on through it and dropped into a baby carriage the vehicle was empty of its occupant fortunately for he made a wreck of it but as i say he wasnt hurt a bit we lived over in the west end of town in the vicinity of the willard school and a very tough section it was in those days i came home nightly with large chunks missing from my person and attire glenn came in always whole and happy and usually bearing a quantity of valuables which had had other owners that morning one morning a bunch of older boys dropped him down a manhole and sealed the lid back on most lads in such a situation would have perished of fright but not glenn he wandered around through the various arteries of the sewer picking up a sizeable quantity of small change from the silt along his way after a few profitable hours of this he made his way out through another manhole he then phoned the police quoting that a friend of his had been thrown into a sewer by a certain group of boys he gave their names then without giving his own name he hung up and went into town the cops collared the youths at school and readily wrung a confession from them the victim was identified as glenn a search of the sewer was begun for his body and the young criminals were taken to the police station facing a long stretch in the reformatory late in the afternoon glenn put in his appearance and was hailed by the admiring and relieved police as a hero they brought him home where he was tucked into bed apparently too shocked by his experience to eat actually there was nothing wrong with him but a stomachache and perhaps eye strain he had visited four picture shows and eaten several dollars worth of candy ice cream and other delicacies after that experience the worst toughs at school shied away from glenn he was pure poison i always admired him logan moved on to new york and greener pastures and pop became associated with another attorney tom connors tom had been quite a famous man and he still was a topnotch lawyer when he was sober he was a good shot and never without a pair of ivoryhandled fortyfives given him by the bandit pancho villa with two children and another on the way pop was becoming a little worried about the future so as a backlog against the uncertainties of the law business he bought a small neighborhood grocery store in the east side of oklahoma city he was out of town much of the time so it was up to mom and us kids to look after the store there was a large garden in the back yard and also a pear orchard our living quarters were in the rear of the store with free rent and free vegetables and fruit and a small steady business it looked like we had the financial problem licked in this we figured without tom connors he came out from the office one summer afternoon when pop was away drinking but not in bad shape we gave him the spare bedroom and left him alone after a brief nap he went out the back door and came back with a couple of quarts of booze then he began to prowl around the back yard we had finished eating by the time he returned and he had finished the bottle and there was an expression of deepest consternation upon his face my dear mrs thompson he said in his best courtroom manner what means have you taken to protect that very valuable pear harvest do you have a night watchman or a watch dog no mom smiled hesitantly tom shook his head grimly he was he said my fathers friend as such he did not propose to see him stripped of his chattels without a protest he would take care of the pear orchard himself when pop returned there would not be so much as a single pear missing procuring a ball of wrapping twine from the store he went into the back yard and climbed up a tree he laced the twine back and forth through the twigs and branches forming a sort of giant cobweb among them before he fell to the ground on his back nothing daunted he climbed into another tree and treated it as he had the first and so on to the next and the next there were twenty trees in the orchard i think tom must have strung well over a mile of string through them then with the cooperation of maxine and me he filled a number of tin cans with pebbles placed a few cans in each room of the house and tied the end of a string to each of them well there werent any pear thieves around that night but there was a high wind the trees began to sway and dip the pebblefilled cans started leaping a barrage of rocks whistled through the rooms smashing windows light fixtures and china tin cans crawled in and out of the beds wrapping cord miles of it seemingly sought grimly to truss us up struck and snagged in some very tender spots i started squawling for mom maxine miraculously found me in the dark and pinched me mom tried to smack both of us and almost broke her wrist on the bed rail then tom waked up he leaped to the floor a fortyfive in each hand and cried out that we were being raided shouting wild instructions in mexican he sprang for the back door immediately his feet were entangled in a score of cords and his flailing arms were likewise caught and made helpless he struggled onward manfully dragging the cans with him along with debris bedclothes and lighter bits of furniture at last however he stumbled struck his head against the doorcasing with the sound of a bursting pumpkin and fell down he began to snore peacefully mom lit a candle and came in and looked at him her face was pretty grim she was swinging a catsup bottle in one hand finally after an obvious struggle between her better nature and her natural impulses she threw a blanket over him and we all went back to bed tom got up ahead of us in the morning to go after more whiskey and by the time we arose he was anything but contrite fortified with several stiff slugs he led us out into the back yard and commanded us to look upon the wreckage there would we now tell him pointing at the fruitlittered ground that thieves had not been out during the night he denied that there had been any wind with mom protesting angrily tom went around and posted himself at the front door of the store fingering his fortyfives he questioned and harangued and threatened every patron who sought to enter he called them by fearful aliases and recited their records to them some of them fled and some of sterner stuff merely stamped away in high dudgeon around noon a tall heavyset man bearing a briefcase turned in at the walk pop he got tom to go to bed and later to a cure a week or so after that we disposed of the store in that time as i remember we didnt have a single customer pop was practically selfeducated his financial position was more often than not insecure and he was careless about dress and the social niceties but few men had as many friends among the great the wouldbe and the near few men had their advice so sought after pop had a horror of ignorance ill tell you why shortly and had made himself an expert on almost everything politicians from presidents to ward heelers prized his opinion on political matters grain speculators consulted him on the crop outlook wire services quoted his predictions on the outcome of prize fights and horse races he knew more about law accounting agriculture and a dozen other professions and pursuits than many men who made them their life work in the early twenties when we were living in fort worth texas dr frederick a cook the polar explorer was our dinner guest one night doc had entered the oil business a short time before and was riding high he was renting three floors of a downtown office building he employed close to a thousand people and his postage bill alone ran twentyfive hundred dollars a week he had brought a batch of advertising literature out for pop to look at pop did dont send this out doc he advised itll put you in the pen aw now jim doc laughed annoyed my copywriters have worked on that for weeks ive got thousands of dollars tied up in printing whats wrong with it it violates the bluesky laws your attorneys can show you where but my attorneys say its all right pop shrugged and changed the subject or tried to cook insisted on arguing about the literature he finally got a little angry about it the trouble with you jim he declared is that youre afraid every club is going to fly up and hit you youre wrong about this deal and ill prove it to you im going into the mail with this stuff tomorrow he got a twelveyear stretch in leavenworth pop was a wizard in large affairs but in mundane matters he was a flop you couldnt convince him of the latter periodically he went on familymanagement sprees and he either refused to admit the horriferous results or attributed them to our failure to cooperate as an eightyearold i can remember his asking mom about my tastes in literature he expressed his dissatisfaction with her reply by going out and buying a twelvevolume set of american history and another set of the letters of the presidents and he poohpoohed her angry opinion that the stuff was too old for me youre bringing these children up in ignorance he declared now when i was four years old i could name all the presidents and there followed a long list of accomplishments of which i was no more capable than i was of flying but for months afterward i was required to read the books aloud to him every night i read them at home while at school i read the adventures of bowwow and mewmew and tom and jane at grandmothers farm in the same fashion i was drilled in higher accountancy before i had mastered long division i was coached in political science before i ever saw a civics class i learned the dimensions of betelgeuse before i knew my own hat size i was always a puzzle and a plague to my teachers i often knew things that they didnt but seldom anything that i should i dont mean to give the impression that pop was harsh he was anything but he seldom raised his voice never once did he so much as paddle one of us kids it was simply that he couldnt be content to manage his own sphere and let mom manage hers every once in a while he would get the notion that we werent eating properly and he would undertake to put a little meat on our bones these undertakings usually manifested themselves as great messes of what he called succotash beans tomatoes corn peas and perhaps a bottle of catsup all cooked together in the largest kettle he could find mom would sternly forbid us to eat any of it so pop after disposing of a quart or two would take the receptacle under his arm and go around and make gifts of it to the neighbors it was pops greatest fault that he could seldom see bad in anyone he did not want it pointed out to him and he refused to admit it when it was after we sold our grocery store we moved over on west main street in oklahoma city there was a family across the street whose little girl was always fighting with maxine and mom after a few words with her mother decided that they were trash pop said that she shouldnt make statements of that kind we werent really acquainted with the people and shouldnt form judgments until we were pop had served us succotash that evening and mom was not in the best of humor if you think so much of them she suggested sweetly why dont you call on them take them some of that stuff they look to me like theyd eat anything there were a few more words and finally pop got up and put on his hat taking the kettle under his arm he marched stiffly out of the house and across the street some thirty minutes later he returned and with him he brought the detested neighbors the man and woman and their little girl the man was a small wiry fellow with the bluest eyes i have ever seen the woman was a gaudy gushy type at pops instigation they were paying us a social call mom sat with her lips compressed emitting monosyllables when she was forced to pop of course became more and more hospitable it developed that the man was the local agent for a st louis automobile dealer and pop promptly announced that he was interested in buying a car before the visit was over he made an appointment for a demonstration when our visitors had finally departed mom began to laugh rather wildly you buy a car are you crazy jim thompson weve got another baby coming and we owe everyone in the country now and you talk about buying a car ill just bet you that fellow is a criminal ill bet he steals those fine cars he drives around pop said this was preposterous i refuse to discuss the matter further well you wont catch me riding with you me or any of the kids and we didnt go either so pop went for the ride alone and several others the price of the car was surprisingly cheap so much so that pop who was usually agile in such situations found it difficult to avoid buying and mom who loved a bargain wavered somewhat but having stated so often that the man was a criminal she would not back down it was just as well i cannot remember the guys last name now although i should as many crime stories as i have written but his spry mannerisms and his bright blue eyes had earned him the sobriquet among the police of six states of monkey joe he was the southwestern outlet for a gang of missouri car thieves who had hundreds of thefts and i believe thirteen murders to their credit at the time the pinch was made freddie my other sister had just been born and we had other things than crime to talk about but the magazine sections of the sunday papers kept the case alive until we were less preoccupied for weeks they were filled with the pictures and exploits of joe the man with the monkeyblue eyes which may or may not explain why there was a sudden dearth of sunday papers around our house pop said there was no connection one day around the turn of the century a large young man with the profile of president mckinley wandered into territorial oklahoma from illinois he had a certain ponderosity of manner which set none too well with his background for while he could be considered unusually wellread for his day he had little formal education and his working experience was confined to a few months as a railroad fireman and a year or so as a country schoolteacher he conferred with a highly placed republican relative territorial oklahoma was governed by republicans and this man got him an appointment as a deputy united states marshal he did not ask for help after that nor did he need it for the young mans chief talent was something he had been born with the ability to make friends and i may as well say now it was to prove no unmixed blessing when statehood came he ran for sheriff in a solidly democratic county and won by a landslide he was reelected for two successive terms and except for larger plans could have held the office indefinitely the ultimate objective of those plans was the presidency of the united states for the man believed and did until the day he died that any man could be president as a long step toward that goal he won the republican nomination for congress from his district here at last the mans talent for friendship became a curse a mans best friends once they turn upon him become his worst enemies it was so in the young mans i may as well say my fathers case pops honesty was something painful to behold in the relatively minor office of sheriff he had seen no occasion to discuss his early history and antecedents nor to promulgate any but the most general of platforms as a congressman however he felt that his constituents had a right to know all about him and what to expect of him as a legislator though it damned near killed him and i mean that literally he told them the great body of voters men who had moved into oklahoma from the deep south men who had told each other fondly that ol jim aint like the rest of them nothuhnuhs heard him in shocked silence then with purplefaced fury they learned that the s in his middle name stood for sherman after general sherman with whom his father had marched to the sea they learned that the south whether it liked it or not was part of the united states and the quicker it accepted the fact the better they were told that as a republican he stood for the absolute equality of all races and that he would fight to obtain and maintain that equality needless to say pops honesty cost him the most smashing political defeat in oklahoma history not only that but it also made him a fugitive from justice for more than two years like many other frontier peace officers pop had been decidedly careless in his official bookkeeping he knew very little about such work and he was too busy or so he thought running down outlaws he knew that neither he nor his deputies had ever pocketed a penny of public funds that being the case what did it matter if at the end of his third term his books showed a technical shortage of some as a matter of fact it wouldnt have mattered at all except for the debacle of his congressional campaign everyone knew he was honest no one was going to make even an implied assault on a man with thousands of voters in his pocket he planned as soon as he had the time and money to hire a corps of expert accountants and get the sheriffs office mess straightened out but the end of the congressional race found him without money virtually without friends and with an overwhelming host of enemies who intended to see that he was given no time to adjust his accounts overnight he was faced with criminal charges and the almost certain prospect of a long stretch in prison knowing of nothing else to do he fled to mexico what had been an unusually promising career was now obviously at an end since he could barely support himself he was to all purposes permanently estranged from his wife and two small children he had no money and no way of earning any except by competing on even terms with peon labor rather i should say uneven terms the mexican government had no love for americans who took jobs from its own starving nationals i dont know what other men would have done under such circumstances but i can speak for myself id have walked into the rio grande and kept on walking until my hat floated that wasnt of course pops way of doing things all mans troubles he decided sprang from ignorance in this particular case ignorance of law and accounting he did not know enough but he would henceforth he would acquire the knowledge to solve this immediate difficulty then go on to improve and expand his learning in every possible field somehow he managed to acquire the funds necessary for correspondence courses in law and accounting during every minute he had free from drudgery he studied after some two years he received an llb degree by mail as well as a certificate as an expert accountant meanwhile he had got in touch with former intimates in oklahoma feeling toward him had died down if he wanted to come back theyd stake him to expenses and also go his bond while he was fighting the case pop went back he audited his own accounts and then argued his own case in court he proved that not only did he owe the county nothing but that the county actually owed him several thousand dollars eventually he became attorney and official accountant for the oklahoma peace officers association and developed a large private practice but even when he was well on the road to success his openhandedness and his reluctance to dun a client brought on long periods of financial destitution during such times mom maxine and i resumed a practice we had begun when he fled to mexico we went to live with moms folks in a nebraska country town i could say a great deal about the unpleasant features of living with relatives of living in a gossipy small town where everyone knows your circumstances and has little else to talk about but i have brooded overlong about these matters in other books so let us dismiss them with the statement that they did exist along with everything else i often managed to have a wonderfully amusing time for this for the attitude which enabled me to have it i am largely indebted to my grandfather myers the most profane acidtongued harsh kind delightful man i ever knew i recall an evening when my ultrapious grandmother had dragged me to a country revival meeting and i lay shivering in my dark bedroom afterwards i was too terrified to sleep i was certain that my sixodd years of life all spent in sinning from the preachers standpoint had earned me one of the hotter spots in hell and that i would certainly be snatched there before morning then though i had made no sound i knew damned well what my grandmother would do if i waked her up my grandfather crept in in his undershirt and trousers cant sleep huh he jeered in a harsh mocking whisper let some goddam fool scare the pee out of you huh well goddam if you aint a fine one he ordered me into my overalls and led me out of the house pausing in the kitchen where he picked up a pint cup of whiskey toddy which he always kept warming on the back of the stove we went out into the back yard and sat down on the boardwalk to the privy there after each of us had had a mighty sip of toddy and i had been allowed a few puffs from his pittsburgh stogie he delivered himself of a lecture i cannot repeat it here his acidly profane yet somehow hilarious discourse on certain types of religionists and the insanity of taking them seriously suffice it to say that coupled with the toddy it sent me into muffled gales of giggles it sent me smiling to sleep and left me smiling in the morning having suffered the cruelest of childhoods himself my grandfather believed that anything that contributed to a childs peace of mind was good and that anything that disturbed that peace was bad i hold to that same belief it is one of the very few things i do believe grandfather or pa as he was known to the entire clan was an old man from my earliest recollection just how old even he did not know orphaned shortly after birth in a period of indifferent vital statistics he had been handed around from one family to another worked always fed seldom and beaten frequently for all that his memory could tell him he had been born big rawboned and doing a mans work he might have been fifteen when he enlisted as a drummer boy in the union army but he believed he was nearer ten by the end of the war he was a fullfledged sergeant an inveterate gambler a confirmed drinkei and a stout apostle of the philosophy of easycome easygo he didnt know what he wanted to do but he was certain that it must pay a great deal and have very little physical work attached to it there was no such vocation of course for a brash young man who could barely read and write back in his home state of iowa he worked for a few years as a stonemason the only trade he knew and usually gambled away his money as fast as he got it when his luck at last changed for the better he took the resulting several hundreds and went to st louis there he sat in one of the big games for seventytwo hours straight leaving at its end with more than ten thousand dollars he liked big things simply for the sake of bigness and about the intrinsically biggest business in those days for the small capitalist was hardware and farm implements pa bought out his hometown dealer in those things and set out to all appearances on the career of a prosperous and respectable merchant these appearances were deceptive he was not respectable by many definitions of the term and any prosperity he may have enjoyed was as brief as it was accidental he liked to gamble and carouse as much as he ever had he felt a fatal friendliness for the financially distressed and as fatal an indifference for the wellheeled to his way of thinking the loss of ones money in a poker game was an entirely valid reason for failing to pay a bill and to such an unfortunate he was prepared to extend credit indefinitely fiscally excellent risks on the other hand were apt to be dunned ahead of time and to have their bills padded this on the theory that they had probably stolen their money anyway and that he could put it to better use than they could but his biggest trouble perhaps was his complete unreadiness to settle down now chained as he thought of it to a wife children and business he grew more impatient with every passing day he could not bear to haggle a customer who hesitated over a purchase would first receive a sharp reduction in price and then if he still hesitated the exasperated suggestion that he get the hell out until he made up his mind such shenanigans as these could only end in one way very late one summers night pa loaded a covered wagon with his family and such personal chattels as he could get onto it and quietly drove away leaving his home and his business behind him the word his is used loosely they were no longer his and the lighter articles he carted away would not have been if his creditors had caught him he homesteaded in nebraska territory and for more years than he cared to remember he did two mens work he farmed he ran a dairy he carried on an extensive masonry contracting business finally as he was nearing the age of fifty he paused to take inventory he owned his own comfortable home and several acres on the edge of town he owned several small rental properties in the town proper it was enough pa decided with his civil war pension he could get by nicely for the rest of his life he would never do another damned lick of work he bumped his masonry carts together loaded them with tools and implements piled his working clothes on top and set fire to the lot then donning his gentlemans uniform of blue serge suit large black hat and congress gaiters he set about catching up with his fun alas times had changed sharply for the worse during his long spell of industry there were no real gambling games any more only pennyante skirmishes which were an insult to a spirited man there were no real twofisted drinkers any more only mollycoddles who sipped halfheartedly at their drinks and then went on about their business there were no real men any more if you called a man the ninny would have you hauled into court instead of making the proper response with fists and feet a practical man pa drew such satisfaction as he could from his whiskey jug his boxes of long black stogies and verbal jousting with his wife but the first two were only adjuncts to the good life not the life itself and my grandmother would not play fairly with him after a few relatively feeble remarks about how nastymouthed filthy and noaccount he was she would simply lock herself in her room leaving pa more frustrated than ever surcease came or rather began with pas decision that he needed a horse and buggy to get around in there are tamer animals in the jungles of africa than the one he brought home not only was it unbroken as the seller had honestly pointed out but it declined to be broken and slowly as the terrifying beast kicked to pieces his brand new buggy pas face lit up in a beautiful smile that was the beginning the end did not come until pa by breeding and selection had populated the barnyard with the muliest cow the fightingest chickens and the fiercest hogs ever assembled by man the chickens did not lay and were too tough to eat the hogs were lean musclebound warriors which no stockbuyer would have as a gift the horse could not be made to perform for more than a few minutes at a time the cow the only one i have ever seen do so gave skimmed milk and very little of that pa loved them all they gave him what he needed every trip into the barnyard was an adventure the chickens ran at him wings beating furiously the cow butted and tried to crush him against her stall the hogs were constantly attempting with occasional success to knock him down and gnaw on him the horse kicked bucked and nipped the animals were at some disadvantage in being unable to curse but otherwise the incessant warfare was carried on on terms as even as pa could devise the kicking horse got kicked the butting cow got butted the zooming chickens with their furiously beating wings were in turn zoomed at pa thrashing his arms wildly the hogs who used everything they had on him got considerably better than an even break pa met their onslaughts with nothing more than his boots and cane although pas bathing was confined to washragandbasin dabbling this should not be interpreted as meaning that he was hygienically careless he simply had his own ideas about personal hygiene nights mornings and numerous times in between he took great draughts of whiskey to kill the poisons in his system to maintain his body at the same even temperature he wore heavy woolen underwear winter and summer he ate large quantities of liver brains and kidneys and bedtime found him battening down every window in the house to shut out the noxious night air finally to get back to the subject of animals he would not sit down in the privy in the normal fashion but stood up on the seat and hunkered over the hole he was in this semihelpless position one day when the privy door blew open a huge dominecker rooster seeing a onceinalifetime chance dashed in and pecked him severely about the loins pa was outraged by this grossly unfair attack but he did not resort to an axe as a less fair man would have he simply ignored that particular rooster from then on when the fowl flew at him he would ward it off brusquely or merely step aside then calmly proceed on his way after a few days of such rebuffs the rooster began to stand by himself in lonely corners of the barnyard his comb wilted his beak drooped nearer and nearer to the ground now and then the other chickens always quick to spot an outcast would swoop at him and peck him sharply on the head but he never fought back one day when he was dreaming no doubt of happier times he wandered too close to the hog lot a sow poked her snout through the rails and ended his misery forever pa said it served the sonofabitch right and let that be a lesson to me why me i dont know but i could see that he was badly upset over the affair stamping into the house he emptied the pint toddy cup without pausing when my grandmother anticipating the usual outburst of prandial profanity remarked that if he didnt like her cooking he knew what he could do pa only looked at her moodily in fact he ate almost a half a pie leather and lard to use his customary appellation before getting back to normal and hurling the plate into the garden all my life i have been the victim of the inhumane and unjust botching of potentially good food my mother was a woman of indifferent appetite and thus lacked the basic essential of a good cook my wife well my wife is a wonderful cook but i usually do the family cooking i got ptomaine poisoning from the very first restaurant meal i remember eating looking back from my present state of antiquity i cant recall eating more than a few dozen good meals that i did not prepare myself if i dine at a friends house a treasured recipe handed down in the family for generations will suddenly go sour a restaurant with an unimpeachable reputation will blithely risk all for the dubious pleasure say of serving me stale eggs fried in goat grease i have known but one other person to suffer from such a frightful conspiracy a small con man named allie ivers he had a way of protesting which only insufficient nerve has kept me from using allie owned an enormous sponge selected with much care for its unusual powers of absorption before dining out he would fill this sponge with dirty water when his meal was served him he would slide this sponge under his napkin hold the napkin to his mouth and but need i say more suffice it to say that the sight of allie staggering about in apparent agony a horrible liquid spouting from his napkin could empty a crowded restaurant in the space of five minutes but i was about to speak of mas my grandmothers cooking and since i cannot use pas descriptive terms and no others are adequate i am somewhat at a loss as to how to proceed i must settle i suppose for the statement that nowhere in hobo jungles soup kitchens greasy spoons labor camps nowhere i repeat have i eaten anything as bad the good woman was an omnivorous reader of farmmagazine food and health authorities and her ideas changed with theirs from day to day salt caused hardening of the arteries so that condiment might be omitted from a dish which had to have it baking powder had been known to cause digestive disturbances so ma until she was advised to the contrary would leave it out of her biscuits on the other hand a few drops of vanilla added to baked beans not only gave them an unusually piquant flavor but was a certain safeguard against pellagra so you know what went into the bean pot it made no difference to ma that one might prefer unpiqued flavors pellagra and even death to beans with vanilla in them you got vanilla at least you got it until she learned say that leftover chocolate custard made a marvelous addition whatever that meant to bostons favorite vegetable the fact that ma might not have any leftover chocolate custard was no deterrent to her compounding of such a recipe she would make some and leave it over ma need i say had a decidedly literal mind mom maxine and i were in no position to complain although following pas precepts i often did to my eventual sorrow but pa protested enough for all of us insofar as he could he stuck to a diet of meat cooked by himself or eaten raw and he encouraged us to do the same but every mealtime brought on an outburst of profanity table pounding and hurled dishes as furious as it was futile it was one of my regular aftermeal chores to go out into the garden and bring in any dishes which had not been shattered i think the fates must have provided ma with a steellined stomach as recompense for depriving her of all sense of taste in no other way can i account for her ability to eat heartily and healthfully of her own fortunately inimitable cooking as for the thompsons i think we certainly should have died except for pas constant dosing of us with whiskey both on arising and retiring we were required to take generous drinks of toddy and when school was in session we kids got another big drink upon our arrival home in the evenings in winter the whiskey was a cold preventative to pas notion in warm weather it served to purify the blood in days to come i was to regret this early acquired taste for alcohol but at the time i do not believe we could have survived without it while ma could botch a meal quite capably by herself it cannot be denied that she received considerable inadvertent assistance from pa for pa was the official firebuilder and he pursued this vocation more as an outlet for his tempestuous temperament than for any utilitarian purpose pa began the chore by opening all the drafts on the kitchen range and walloping it fore and after with an extraheavy duty steel poker this shook the soot out of it so he said it also put him in the fine and furious fettle necessary for the task ahead removing every lid from the top of the stove pa piled in kindling corn cobs coal newspapers and everything else handy with a wild indiscrimination that was marvelous to behold onto this pile which normally extended a foot or so above the top of the stove he dropped an incendiarists handful of burning matches then snatching up a gallon can of kerosene he emptied the better part of its contents into and over the range no fire in the hell which pa incessantly referred ma to could have been more aweinspiring it didnt just burn it exploded it groaned and panted and heaved snatching at persons and objects tenfeet away and leaping clear to the ceiling by the time it had burned down enough for pa to replace the stove lids weird things were happening to its internal structure coal was smothering the kindling halfburned newspapers were clogging the drafts according to whim it might go out entirely at the very moment ma began her alleged cooking or suddenly puffing smoke and sparks through every crevice in the range it might begin to burn anew and with an intensity that made mock of the original blaze beyond beating it with the poker which was ever ready to do pa refused to take any responsibility for the stoves fractious actions it wasnt his fault if ma didnt know how to keep a good fire going anyway as he pointed out with some truth nothing short of taking ma out and shooting her a course he frequently recommended could greatly improve the household cookery very early one morning pa poked me into wakefulness with his cane and presented the inevitable cup of toddy i was to get dressed and come quietly out of the house at once he was going to take me to see what a bunch of goddamned fools look like i obeyed of course and as we strode away from the house in the dusky dawn his calloused hand gripping my small one pa jogged my memory with a little jovial profanity no revival meeting was complete in those days without a prediction from the preacher as to the date when the world would end the preacher who had scared the daylights out of me had stated that six calendar weeks from the day of his departure the world would be no more very few of the townspeople had taken this nonsense literally not sufficiently so at any rate to act upon it but silently pa had marked those few well and shortly we were standing before the residence of such a family pa who had known almost exactly what to expect emitted an amazed and scornful snort and loudly proclaimed that he would be goddamned what he demanded of me as though i were personally responsible for the sight were this man and his wife and their three children doing in their nightgowns and why had they climbed upon the roof of their modest cottage well why the nightgowns were they going to spend all their time in heaven sleeping and why stand on the roof didnt they think god could lift em all the way didnt they know he could spot as big damned fools as they were even if they hid in the cellar this indirect quizzing of the pious porchperchers was just getting under way when from opposite directions of the street two furious clouds of dust appeared they came parallel with us simultaneously and from them there eventually emerged pas son and soninlaw respectively my uncles newt and bob the two men joined us on the walk and where pa had left off in his razzing they took up when the possibilities of the situation were exhausted all of us hurried on foot around the town before the damned fools come to their senses but i think i shall drop the curtain on that tour while i tried to outdo my relatives in laughter that morning i actually felt a strong sympathy for those we laughed at i winced for them and i still do perhaps because i have been a bigger fool so many times myself newt we did not use titles such as uncle and aunt on my mothers side of the family was a bettereducated version of his father without however possessing quite so much of pas rough good humor he had been farming on his own for only a few years when he came off secondbest in a battle with a horse and his left foot had to be amputated and possibly because he tried to walk without a crutch or cane the stump became infected periodically thereafter he had to be operated on he had to submit to the gradual trimming away of his leg and the fitting of a succession of artificial limbs he was in almost constant pain and his surgical expenses were enormous yet as he went about the tilling of a large farm and the rearing of a big family he never complained there was a surly undertone to his laughter but he did laugh and he was apt to be painfully sardonic and sarcastic even in kindness but he was kind an englishman of noble family my uncle bob had settled in this small nebraska town for reasons he never revealed he began his business career there as a storekeeper branched from that into dealing in land and wound up as a banker although not a modest man in many ways he took no credit for his success but attributed it all to the invention of the cash register except for that splendid device he could not have trusted his affairs to employees thus leaving himself free for increasingly larger and profitable ventures bob had an ironclad rule never to touch his capital for living expenses he also insisted on making an annual and substantial increase in that capital he was the local agent for dozens of items ranging from patent fleasoap to gasoline lamps and persons who borrowed money from him were apt to find themselves loaded with these things as a condition for receiving their loans most practitioners of the sharp deal are closemouthed not so my uncle bob to anyone he could buttonhole he bragged about how he had stung this person or skinned that one actually as i came to learn in time bobs avariciousness was a pose his schemes and his jeers were simply his way of making smalltown life bearable like pa bob was far too big a man for his environment the only way he could endure it was to dwell in a kind of tantrum secretly bob was one of the most generous men in town although we must have been aware of each other before then i seem to have made almost no impression on him nor he on me until i was almost seven the occasion was dinner at his house he was seated at the head of the long table and i at the foot and in between were his wife his six children his four persian cats and his two airedale dogs there was a long hickory ferrule at his side which he wielded throughout the meal occasionally correcting a cat or a dog with it but more frequently smacking his children when they erred in etiquette betwixt ferocious scowls at me he sent his offspring to the front room by turns to rewind the phonograph and replace one classical record with another i was greatly awed when abruptly he asked me if i knew what branns iconoclast was i could scarcely gather my wits sufficiently to stammer out an affirmative something to eat isnt it he beamed at me falsely something like cornflakes nno i said faintly its a magazine bob chortled sarcastically wagging his head in ironic wonder a magazine eh oh that was very good i would tell him next he supposed that shakespeare was not the name of a fountain pen i would tell him that would i and he bared his teeth in so terrible a grimace that my hair literally stood on end nevertheless i told him even as he had prophesied bob snarled at me hideously then suddenly threw out another question who he said was scoopchisel sscoop i dont know i said you dont know you dont know his face colored in a spasm of rage and bewilderment and for a moment i thought surely that this was to be my end but somehow though the effort was obviously a drain on his innermost resources bob managed to bring himself under control he addressed me at length and with patience a fond glow coming into his fine gray eyes and always thereafter i discovered i could move him into this benign mood by raising the subject of scoopchisel scoopchisel the greatest writer of all time a man robbed of his proper due by his sneaky brotherinlaw byron it was scoopchisel who had written the immortal lines so get the golden shekels while youre young and gettings good and when youre old and feeble you wont be chopping wood but he was at his best when annotating the work of other poets to fitzgeralds inquiry i often wonder what the vintner buys one half so precious as the stuff he sells scoopchisel had retorted protection anent popes statement hope springs eternal in the human breast scoopchisel had said until youre married then it moves its nest i was so impressed with the works of scoopchisel that even after pop and the rest of us had reassembled and i was well advanced in grammar school i quoted him which inevitably led of course to my inditing a pained and accusing letter to my uncle bob he replied promptly he would not advise me he wrote to accuse my teachers of ignorance nor would he confess that scoopchisel had never existed he would only say that every man had to believe in something and that he liked to believe in scoopchisel and even though the latter had never lived he damned well should have in short bob concluded keep your hat on and your head ducked the woodpeckers are after you newt and bob had sons approximately the same age and some eight or ten years older than i was two more inventive mischievous lads would be hard to find and they stood always ready to supply any devilment which i could not dream up for myself one of our more successful enterprises was the electrification of certain privy seats around the town my cousins did the wiring and supplied the dry cells i lying with them in a nearby weedpatch was allowed to throw the switch at the crucial moment there are no statistics i suppose on the speed with which people leave outdoor johns but i am certain that if there were the victims of our rural electrification project would still be holding the record i entered the first grade of school in this town and shortly thereafter i had reason to complain to my two cousins that my teacher was picking on me the good youths were seriously disturbed or seemed to be we retired to the loft of newts barn to confer there after we had all had a good chew of tobacco and a swig from a purloined bottle of wine they reached a decision my teacher they advised me was suffering from a malady known as hominess she wanted some but didnt know how to get it it was their suggestion that i linger in the schoolroom after the class had gone and jab her where she lived this would show her that i was a pretty gay guy and my troubles would be well on the way toward their solution well i had seen just enough of the mating antics of farm animals to accept this scheme as entirely plausible i became so enthusiastic in fact that my cousins began to believe in the stunt they fell for their own rib as hard as i had excitedly and no longer joking they repeated their instructions adding a message for me to pass on to the teacher i was to tell her that they were rarin to go any time and place she suggested that they would undertake to do their best for her and she would leave the trysting place relaxed and rejoicing that was not the exact message but it conveys the general idea the words my cousins used while considerably more graphic were somewhat less polite so i trotted off for school the next morning silently rehearsing the scene i was about to play convinced that happier days were just ahead true to my instructions i lingered behind at recess time when i at last started out the door where the teacher was waiting impatiently i triggered my forefinger and jabbed then having proved i was a gay guy i started to deliver my cousins message i didnt get as much as a word of it out before the teacher an applechecked german girl affixed her hand to my ear and hauled me squawling toward the principals office i was saved from i dont know what unpleasantness by two circumstances first the teachers sense of delicacy prevented her from more than hinting at the nature of my crime the strongest indictment that the principal could evince from her was the statement that i had been pranking nasty secondly this principal like many another person in the town was in the financial clutches of my uncle bob and was reluctant to offend him as he felt he would by punishing me so he gave me a mild talkingto after the teacher had been sent on her way plus a pat on the head and the suggestion that i pattern my conduct in the future after that splendid uncle of yours then i was dismissed to the playgrounds i looked up my two cousins forthwith and charged them with giving me some very bad advice they having lost much of their previous days enthusiasm were vastly relieved to learn that i had not involved them and they readily acquiesced to my demand that i give each a swift kick in the arse thus the matter ended whether my teacher was any kinder to me thereafter i dont remember probably she had been kind enough in the first place i do recall that never again did she come within my reach she was no fool even if i was these cousins of mine operated under a peculiar code of logic which although it seemed entirely clear and sensible to them was as maddening as it was incomprehensible to the outside world even i a sympathetic participant in most of their stunts was baffled and bewildered by them more often than not one spring when the boys had foresworn crime for several months and there was a growing feeling that they might escape death by hanging ending their existence with nothing worse perhaps than life imprisonment their delighted families presented each with a handsome bicycle i was on hand at newts farm where the presentation ceremonies were held and an impressive occasion it was as head of the clan pa spoke first punctuating his bloodcurdling remarks with wild slashes of his cane which might well have brained less agile youths newt and bob were the next speakers in that order brandishing their respective cane and ferrule then with the air sizzling with profane threats the ladies stepped forth wielding whips and switches and while their vocabularies were free of curses their lectures were nonetheless fearsome and aweinspiring the general feeling seemed to have been expressed by pas declaration that the boys had better by god behave themselves and take care of their bikes or they would be nailed to the barn door and skinned alive the boys listened with seeming meekness then accompanied by me they repaired to the interior of the barn where they proceeded to disassemble the bicycles into several hundred odd pieces discovered in this outrage as they soon were the two youths pleaded for time given a matter of a week they promised and they would convert those childish playthings the bicycles into a thing of great beauty and utility exasperated and exhausted the adult relatives gave their consent without striking a blow the week passed in a hubbub of furious activity the boys acquired several sheets of stout roofing tin they got hold of a quantity of hard wood and steel rod and paint and the basic parts of an old gasoline water pump assisted by me they pounded and sawed shaped and soldered painted and sawed and bolted together and by the eve of the seventh day so very real though often misdirected was their genius they had created an automobile it looked like an automobile save for the wheels down to the minutest detail it ran quite as well as many of the automobiles of that day our adult kin were both dumbfounded and delighted as we made a brief trial run up and down the barn corridor all unsuspecting of the ultimate and abysmal objectives of the two youths they made no protest when the latter announced that the first fullscale demonstration would be held on the morrow both my cousins and i spent the night at newts house the following morning attired in our sundays best we marched haughtily into the barn we tuned and oiled the motor of our automobile until it purred like a cat we wiped the gleaming red body free of the last speck of dust then we climbed into the front seat with me in the middle and drove grandly out into the yard we circled it twice allowing our beaming relatives and the neighbors they had pridefully summoned to feast their eyes upon us with this the promised demonstration taken care of we suddenly roared fullspeed to our previously determined destination the open door to the food cellar the door was flush with the ground and opened into a long steep flight of stairs leading under the house we went crashing and smashing down them shedding fenders and other of the automobiles components as well as sizeable bits of our own epidermis then at the bottom where the steps ended in an upright door the engine shot from beneath the hood and we shot over it the whole house shook with the impact of flying bodies and machinery and the explosions of fruit and vegetable jars bruised bleeding and besmeared we managed to claw our way back to daylight and the fearsome reception awaiting us but the automobile had so wrecked the stairs and jammed into the lower door that no one could get back down into the cellar as soon as he could do anything but curse newt announced that he was through i give up by god he stated and he declared that since the family was cut off from its supply of fruit and vegetables they could all simply die of scurvy and the sooner the better theres a hell of a lot worse ways of dying he pointed out grimly and no one could gainsay him fortunately after a few weeks of meat and gravy and the like and when scurvy seemed actually imminent he was persuaded to adopt a more sensible course the result was a new entrance to the cellar through the kitchen floor a new door and new stairs and complete physical exhaustion for my cousins and me for newt naturally did not lift a finger on the job he was one of the three foremen pa and bob being the other two and so well did they handle their duties we were hardly able to stir from our beds for a week the one last piece of orneriness which my cousins and i collaborated in almost got us all killed it came about after much reading and discussion of the literature of parachuting an art then in its infancy mom and we kids were preparing to join pop in oklahoma and the various connections of the family had gathered at newts house for a farewell sunday dinner when the meal was over my cousins and i slipped out to the barn loft where earlier we had concealed three bed sheets and a length of clothesline rope in no time at all we had parachutes i dont know what else to call them tied to our shoulders and were ascending the sixtyfoot tower of the cow lot windmill it was a cold windy fall day shivering i looked at the stock tank adjacent to the mill studied the fourfoot depth of water which was supposed to break our fall shivering a little sick at my stomach i wanted to withdraw but my colleagues jeered me hideously at one and the same time they swore that i was a damned cowardly calf and a mighty brave kiddo so up the tower i went my cousins followed me goosing and punching one another arrived at the top they ordered me to move around the platform to make room for them i tried to but the platform was small the only way i could hang on was by reaching up and grasping the directionarm of the windmill fan the action coincided with a sudden sharp gust of wind and this with my weight resulted in disengaging the locking device before i knew what was happening the mill had begun to spin and i was swung out into space jerked and flung first one way then another my cousins ducked and cursed frantically as my flailing feet almost knocked them from their perch shouting at me to drop in the tank dammit they both tried to scramble down the ladder at the same time neither would give way to the other and they jammed there tangled in a mass of sheets and clothesline i continued to swing this way and that screaming my eyes clenched tightly the back door of the house opened and people streamed out pa newt and bob were in the vanguard the first two waving their canes bob brandishing a long hickory ferrule which he was seldom without and usually found use for behind this trio came one of my aunts carrying a buggy whip another equipped with a piece of harness strap and mom and ma armed with switches a plentiful supply of which was always kept around the house they might not know how to get us down from the tower as soon became apparent but they had plans for us obviously when we did get down all my mothers family were like that and yet they were warmhearted childrenloving people too it was simply second nature with them to attack every situation with acid words on their lips and a weapon in their hands gathered around the base of the tower around the tank they shouted up incoherent directions and threats mom tried to climb up after me and was dragged back pa and newt gave the wooden uprights a severe caning above the turmoil there suddenly came the sound of splintering wood and the step to which my cousins were clinging gave way they went plummeting down into the tank landing squarely on their backs the water rose out of the vessel and descended upon the waiting posse the latter cursing and screaming according to sex latched on to the two youths and proceeded as the saying was to tan their hides this exercise coupled with the cold water so calmed my relatives that they at last thought to relatch the lock on the mill i was able to swing back to the platform and thence descend to earth where everything considered i got off pretty lightly since everyone was exhausted my sister freddie was born during a severe economic depression it was a hard winter for the nation in general and for the thompsons in particular pop had begun to dabble in the oil business and not very profitably mom was in the hospital much of the time our house had twelve rooms and the fires of hell couldnt have kept it warm the plumbing was constantly freezing and bursting i froze and burst out with cold sores which my schoolmates promptly diagnosed as cancer looking back i find my cold sores to have been the one cheerful facet of that winter i had but to wave my festered hands and the toughest bully in school fled before me shrieking there were repercussions with my recovery but even these worked out to my advantage i got a great deal of splendid exercise in racing up alleys and shinnying over back fences my reflexes became trigger quick without losing the look and the feel of it much of my awkwardness disappeared to take moms place while she was in the hospital pop hired a woman who with undeserved generosity shall be known herein as mrs cole a large puffy woman with a ragged topknot of walnutstained hair she was the indigent relative of some friend of pop that was all the recommendation he needed i came home from school one night and found her lying on the lounge in the front room she was wearing house slippers and a shapeless motherhubbard she waved at me limply and remained prone lets see now she said youre johnnie aint you huhuh im jimmie you hadnt ought to say huhuh johnnie you ought to say yes maam and no maam why i said mrs cole frowned slightly but made no answer she intended apparently to make friends with me i got awful bad rheumatism johnnie i cant do much youre sure going to help me a lot aint you i said i guessed i was what you want done help me set up johnnie i took her by the hands and helped her to sit erect groaning and panting prodigiously she got to her feet with a kind of funny feeling in my throat i watched her go into moms room and close the door after a few minutes she came out smelling strongly of medicine or something moving much more spryly maxine came in and was put through the same rigmarole that i had been at first maxine said no she wasnt going to be a good girl and help a lot then she said maybe she would what times does your pappy come home mrs cole inquired and learning that he was due any minute she went into the kitchen when pop arrived she was setting the table obviously suppressing great pain pop was impressed and alarmed youd better sit down awhile he suggested theres no hurry about supper oh no said mrs cole in a piteous voice but youre sick do you want me to get a doctor mrs cole said she was past the point of being aided by doctors ill be all right mr thompson i been sufferin for twenty years and i reckon i can stand a few more dont you worry none i aint going to be no burden on you why of course you wont be pop declared warmly you just sit down now and ill fix things jimmie run down to the store and get some beans peas corn catsup and he and mrs cole ate about a quart each of the succotash maxine and i sopped up a little of the juice with some bread afterwards we went to the store and charged a chocolate pie and a pound of wienies and ate sitting out on the steps pop had to leave town for a few days early the next morning he did not disturb mrs cole when he left and when we arose she was still abed she was pretty sick i guess with a hangover from her medicine and declared pitifully that she could not arise just dont bother me now she whined warm you up some of that nice good succotash maxine and i bought some pie soda pop and potato chips for our breakfast we had hershey bars and bologna for lunch by supper time mrs cole was getting pretty hungry herself and became active long enough to open a can of chili and fry some hamburger things went on like that for weeks pop had to be out of town the greater part of the time and when he wasnt he spent little time at home his mind was more than occupied with financial matters anyway he had never been inclined to concern himself with family routine except on the periodic sprees i have mentioned and those werent much fun without mom around once in a while he would ask us how we were feeling or if we shouldnt clean up a little but i doubt if he heard our answers we couldnt see mom often and then for only a few minutes and we were made fairly presentable for those visits so we went on for weeks unfed unwashed and in the main unschooled for mrs cole never knew whether we went or not and the attendance laws were unenforced we slept with our clothes on a laborsaving and warmthpromoting trick mrs cole had taught us we ate almost nothing but pie chili and hamburger we spent our days in prowling the dime stores seeing picture shows and loafing one noon while we were seated on the porch eating a lunch of pie and pop mom came home she had left the hospital without the doctors permission she had had a premonition she said that she was needed at home maxine and i dashed out to the taxi jumping up and down with delight we asked her if she was going to stay with us and we tried to take freddie away from her and and then we kind of stood back shuffling our feet whats the matter mom i said what you crying about nnothing said mom oh you poor babies where is that woman mrs cole shes still in bed she dont get up this early moms eyes flashed and she brushed her nose angrily against freddies blanket oh doesnt she she said well she was so weak she could hardly walk but she went up the stairs ahead of us she laid freddie down on the lounge and looked around the living room an angry moan like that of a spurred horse broke from her lips she moaned again as she surveyed the filthy dining room glancing into the kitchen she moaned loudest of all stepping to the door of her bedroom she drew back her fist but she lowered it in a gentle knock and the second knock was no more than firm inside the room the bed creaked and mrs cole grunted sleepily now you just stop botherin me she whined i told you not to call me till you seen your pappy comin a terrible smile spread over moms face she knocked again you hear me called mrs cole you want anything to eat go down to the store an get it i got all i can do lookin after myself mom knocked again now you better get away from there mrs cole shouted go to a pitcher show go down by the river an play get away from there afore i come out to you mom began knocking steadily and mrs coles warnings grew more dire at last she arose lumbered to the door and flungit open as i have indicated she was not a fastthinking woman and it was fixed in her mind that it was maxine and i who had been doing the knocking so glaring angrily at mom she spoke the words that were intended for us now youre gonna get it she declared ill warm your britches for you you wont be able to set down for a week when when when go ahead said mom cat got your tongue wwho who are you im these childrens mother said mom im the wife of the man who hired you to look after them im the wife of the man whos been paying you good money to turn my home into a pigsty im the wife of the man who im the i could murder you yelled mom and she damned near did shrieking objurations at mrs cole just to look at us kids just to look at this house she gave the housekeeper a kind of bearing down shake which brought her heavily to her knees she boxed her ears then until her topknot came undone and then mom began kicking her mrs cole fell to her face and tried to crawl away and mom followed kicking giving her a crack upon the ears when the opportunity presented finally her strength exhausted she stumbled and sat down upon her very wisely mrs cole lay still and mom was sitting on her weeping hysterically when pop and the doctor arrived pop had been out of his office when mom left the hospital he had hurried home as soon as he was notified of her unauthorized departure mom was put to bed the doctor examined mrs cole he had had a few words with mom and he was an observant man so in pops presence he told mrs cole that he was slighting his duty in not reporting her to the police her rheumatism and other ailments were myths he said she had better start getting more exercise and lay off whatever she was drinking mrs cole departed swiftly and meekly but her memory lingered on it was months before pop could acquire the nerve to interfere in household matters and he was pretty diffident about it then one saturday morning a few weeks after the cole affair mom maxine and i were eating breakfast when a polite knock sounded on our back door maxine and i hollered come in and mom shushed us and went to answer the door we heard a soft voice inquire begging your pardon but do you have any work i can do and moms reply well i dont know we cant really afford to hire anyone right now then following a heavy silence she said but dont you want to come in out of the cold a woman with a little boy of about four came in negroes the woman was about twentyfive and her eyes looked almost as large as her pinched starved face she wore only a shawl around the shoulders of her patched but spotless gingham dress although the weather was below zero the boy a wizened but cheerfullooking little fellow was little more warmly garbed mom told them to sit down and went over to the stove and got busy that was one thing about mom she never wasted words when action would do the trick she cooked them an enormous breakfast and cleared out shooing us ahead of her digging back in the closets she produced an armful of her and my discarded garments old and outworn but still serviceable now you just put these on before you leave she said when she took them into the kitchen youll catch your death of cold running around the way you are yesm the woman said now what work do you want me to do thats all right said mom no maam it wont be all right unless i do some work oh well said mom you can wash the dishes if you want to viola that was the womans name washed the dishes afterwards a little moppingup was indicated so she mopped the floor in so doing she got water across the threshold of the next room so naturally that had to be mopped too and before it could be mopped it had to be swept and while one was sweeping one room it was foolish to ignore another after sweeping the furniture had to be dusted and viola went to work for us some relative of hers gladly took her son to board for a fraction of her wages and viola moved into our house and while she was an angel if there ever was one she was a source of deep confusion at least to mom and me mom had always had to be somewhat penurious to offset pops generosity she had become irrevocably sharp in money matters when she was quoted a price on an object she automatically demanded a lower one backing the demand with derisive comments on the potential purchase salesgirls hid when they saw mom coming when a huckster or peddler stopped at our house he usually left with a bewildered look on his face and bitter curses on his lips that was mom and that couldnt be mom where viola was concerned viola was constantly belittling her own efforts mom had to scold her to keep her from working herself to death and force presents and money upon her with naggings mom became terribly upset after a session with viola she was apt to be kind to butchers her pet abomination one night when she had been skinned into accepting two pounds of bone and gristle masquerading as stew meat mom broke down and cried she told viola she was driving her crazy and if viola didnt stop it she didnt know what she was going to do viola wept right along with her she said she knew she hadnt been earning her keep but she would do better from now on moreover she had saved most of her wages and we could have the money back we were a northern family by heritage but we had lived a big part of our lives in the south and we we children at least thought southern hence the reason for my puzzlement with viola it was obvious even to me that she was a far superior person to mrs cole she was in fact the mental and moral superior of many white people i knew but she was black and everyone knew that negroes were a shiftless lazy lot who couldnt be trusted out of sight everyone knew that the lowest white was better than the best black the only way i could account for violas superiority was on the basis that she was part white but this she would not admit no sir mister jimmie she laughed when i plagued her im black all right all black but how do you know viola you might not be i just know i know the same way you know youre white i could not desist once i got some riddle on my mind preferably one that was foolish or of no possible consequence to me i could not expel it until it was solved so in the end i forced viola to confess her whiteness she was peeling potatoes and she had just nicked her thumb with the knife she held the bleeding digit up for me to see you see there mister jimmie you dont see any white blood like that thats allnegro blood it is not either i exclaimed thats white peoples blood its just like mine youre joking me mister jimmie i am not youre white viola partly white anyways i guess i ought to know what white peoples blood looks like i guess you should viola admitted in an awed voice well what do you know i knew all the time i was right i said loftily mom looked upon viola more as a friend than a servant but as she was fond of saying she didnt want friends around all the time thus as she recovered her health and the economic situation improved viola left us for another job once a week however she returned to us for a day to give the house a good cleaning she did not want to take any pay for this work but mom always forced her to take something if not money some discarded clothes as for her new employers viola had very little to say about them about all we could get out of her was that they were mighty nice people but that shed rather be with us it was pop who finally let the cat out of the bag not naturally that hed been trying to keep the truth from us he just hadnt thought it of any particular consequence why shes working for the governor he revealed he gave her some little job in the mansion on my sayso but the family liked her so well shes running the whole thing now she the governor said mom blankly oh my goodness ive had her coming over here on her day off to sweep and scrub and when viola next appeared mom rebuked her for the deception then insisted on treating her as company viola didnt want to be treated as company she just couldnt bear it she said and since mom remained firm her visits became more and more infrequent finally they stopped altogether we missed her terribly having achieved considerable success in his dual profession of attorneyaccountant pop swiftly began to lose interest in it that was pops way he was forever advising others notably me to choose one line of endeavor and stick to it but he himself was incapable of such singleness of purpose political friends who learned of his feelings offered to obtain him an appointment as united states marshal pop declined they offered him a federal judgeship he declined that too various lucrative ventures and positions were proffered him and he consistently turned them down he was quite capable of making his own way in life he stiffly averred and during the next two or threeodd years he set about earnestly to prove it i could not name all the ventures he was active in during that period but they included the operation of a sawmill the proprietorship of a hotel truck farming running a bushleague ball club the garbagehauling contract for a certain oklahoma metropolis and turkey ranching as each business or endeavor failed we were left with certain mementos of it assets to use the term loosely which were at once nonliquidatable but yet for one reason or another impossible to discard thus by the time of the demise of the turkey ranch our residence and its environs were so encumbered that one could hardly get into it or once in out zoning laws and health ordinances were unheard of or unenforced in those days else all of us would certainly have been carted off to institutions penal or protective as it was mom finally became hysterical she declared that she herself would see to pops commitment if he did not come to his senses ggarbage wagons she wept ggarbage wagons in the front yard and aand hhorses in the garage aand ploughs on the front porch aand she went on with her recital becoming more and more agitated with the mention of each item the incubators in the bedrooms the gangsaws in the living room the cigar showcases in the kitchen the tomato plants in the bathroom the dozens of newly hatched young turkeys which roamed the house from one end to the other the and that ball player yelled mom i swear jim thompson if you dont get him out of here ill ill murder both of you this last reference was to the occupant of our sleeping porch a rheumy old party who combined an affection for chewing tobacco with very poor eyesight he could not have hit a bull with a bass fiddle as the saying is pop of course perversely regarded him as a second ty cobb you get him out of here mom shouted get all this junk away from here either he and it goes or the children and i do pop gave in not naturally because he could be swayed by threats but because he was quite as weary of the situation as mom was he found some political sinecure for the ball player and gave away the other animals and items good riddance it was as none knew better than he but you could never make him admit it for years nay decades no visitor came to our house without learning that pop had once owned a very valuable ball player or some very valuable horses or several hundred prize turkeys to hear pop tell it he had been on the point of cornering the world market in tomatoes or timber or hotel gaboons all the nominal dross which mom had forced him to get shed of had actually been gold and only her callous and ignorant interference had prevented his reaping untold wealth of course he would sigh bravely in concluding his recital i dont blame mrs thompson in the least it was my own fault for listening to her he would laugh hollowly then his face fixed in a stoical mask and while mom choked and stammered incoherently our guests would stare at her openmouthed pity and horror mingling in their eyes of necessity and as much as it irked him pop had continued to practice law and accountancy but he was constantly on the lookout for some new field of activity and he finally found it or so he felt in the booming oklahoma oil fields i mentioned a few pages back that his first dabblings in this business were not too successful this on reflection seems an unfair statement of the case they were successful enough but pops generosity and trustingness turned them into failures on one occasion after several shrewd deals he gave a friend twentyfive thousand dollars to tie up some leases for him instead the man bought an automobile agency and placed it in his wifes name there was nothing rop could do about it the law regards such an action as a breach of trust and its attitude briefly is that anyone who suffers it has only himself to blame another time pop accepted the word and the handshake of a pipeline executive in lieu of a written contrast as a result when the pipeline company found it inexpedient to connect with his first oil well he could only let the torrent of black gold pour into the nearest creek it was a few months after this last fiasco when pop was again hard at work at his nowdetested lawaccountancy practice that he met a man named jake hamon or i should say remet him for he had known him casually during his early days in oklahoma at that time jake a former roustabout with the ringling brothers circus had been a sixforflyer around the pioneer tent and shack towns that is he bought wages from workers in advance of their due date giving the needy borrower five dollars for each six he had coming jake was still in the loan business at the time of his and pops later encounter though on a slightly different level he owned a string of oklahoma banks he also owned a railroad oil wells refineries office buildings so much in fact that he had acquired the sobriquet of john d rockefeller of the southwest he asked pop to audit his banks and to equip them with a more efficient accounting system pop having nothing better to do gladly agreed i wont charge you anything of course he said casually just my expenses why jake demanded well pop was a little set back his generous offers were not usually received in this fashion well after all were old friends and jake interrupted with a rude fourletter ejaculation who the hell says were friends he snarled i havent seen you in years and if youre as big a dope as you act like i dont want to see you again friend hell ive heard about some of your friends forget that friend crap name me a fee for this job or get the hell out of my office smarting pop named him a fee one that was outrageously high and jake chortled happily you see he grinned all you need is a tough guy like me to ride herd on you you stick with me jim and youll wear diamonds so pop went to work for jake and for the first time in his life he held on to a large share of the money he made the relation of the two men at first was that of employer and employee from that it shifted to a point where pop was jakes advisor on various deals at a percentage of the profits and in the end they became partners in the deals usually oil with jake providing the lions share of the money and pop carrying out the necessary negotiations pop became a familiar figure at lease auctions and distress sales the transactions were frequently cash on the barrelhead and on at least one occasion pops briefcase contained a million dollars of jakes money while pop made and continued to make a great deal of money with jake the southwests rockefeller himself profited vastly by the association even as he watched over pop so did pop watch over him checking the ugly temper and cynical attitude which as jake would surlily admit had cost him millions and made him a publicrelations mans headache unfortunately no one likes to be reminded of his faults real and harmful as they may be and the closer their association became and the greater their familiarity the more flaws they found with one another nothing that the other did was right pop was a softie jake an illiterate boor jake was a slob pop a hightoned dude so it went since pop was genuinely fond of jake and vice versa and both had given concrete proof of that liking it always seemed incredible to me that they could have come to a parting of the ways pop refused to talk about the breakup for a long time when he finally did explain i could only sit and gape for the casus belli had been a suit of underwear it had happened the breakup in the sweltering hotel room of an oklahoma boom town they were there pending the closing of a business deal and during their stay jakes mistress had arrived he got her a room across the hall from theirs and spent the nights with her during the day he stayed in his and pops room conferring upon business matters it was hot as i have said he seldom wore anything but his underwear and one morning when he was prowling restlessly about their room he surprised pop in a disgusted frown whats the matter with you he inquired gruffly i was about to ask you the same thing pop retorted what do you mean what are you staring at anyway since you asked me said pop coldly i was looking at your underclothes when was the last time you changed them why you jakes face turned scarlet you twobit bookkeeper i ought to he exploded into a torrent of abuse pop replied similarly before they could see the ridiculousness of the situation and get control of themselves each had said unforgivable or at least unforgettable things and their partnership was ended they saw one another after that but there was a certain stiffness between them and pop had reason to suspect or felt he had that jake still bore a grudge against him next pop lost almost ten thousand dollars in a poker game with jake gaston b means and warren g harding the game took place on the harding presidential campaign train upon which as two of the southwests most prominent republicans pop and jake were guests of honor it began with relatively low stakes which jake with much jibing and jeering managed to steadily increase finally with all the cash available in the pot means dropped out and the contest was between jake harding and pop in other words since pop was too stiffnecked and proud to demand a tablestakes game it was no contest jake could write his check for any amount and certainly the iou of a future president was good for any amount only pops betting was restricted he tossed in his hand a club flush immediately although he had anted heavily on the previous round jake laid down his hand the value of which was absolutely nothing harding took the pot with three threes pop was considerably if not justifiably irritated he did not see jake again until some two years later when the latter summoned him to his death bed then with matters past mending they sadly agreed that the biggest mistake of their lives had been the ending of their association pop feeling that oklahoma was not big enough for the two of them had transferred his activities to texas and there he had drilled four oilless wells in a row at a cost of more than two hundred thousand dollars each jake sans any friendly restraint or guidance had become increasingly misanthropic and finally his mistress took a gun to him and he died of the wounds we moved to fort worth texas in the fall of shortly before the coming of my thirteenth birthday the city was riding a tidal wave of postwar wealth new building was months behind the demand and there were a dozen purchasers for every available house so for several weeks we were forced to live in a hotel suite the period was one of the most unpleasant in my checkered career for the first time in my memory i was immediately under pops eye day in and day out and pop who had taken only a spasmodic interest in me until then now began to make up for lost time i was a rich mans son he pointed out and some day i would inherit great wealth i must be made into a proper custodian for it sane sober considerate i should not be allowed to become one of those illmannered irresponsible wastrels who behaved as though they had been put on earth solely to enjoy themselves no error in my deportment was too tiny for pop to spot and criticize no flaw in my appearance was too small from the time i arose until the time i retired i was subjected to a steady stream of criticism about the way i dressed walked talked stood ate sat and so on into infinity all with that most maddening of assurances that it was for my own good we had two cars in the hotel garage pop took me there and placed me under the supervision of the foreman mechanic instructing him to treat me as he would any hired hand for the ensuing week i assisted in the overhauling of our automobiles rather i did the overhauling with some minor assistance from one of the mechanics i was too outraged and sullen to discuss the work so i did not dispute pops bland statement that the experience would teach me a great deal for that matter it did teach me a great deal namely that repairing cars was a lousy way to make a living and never again except in the direst emergencies did i so much as change a tire always in the past mom had served as a bulwark against pops extremes of family management but she proved remiss in this emergency a fact decidedly less puzzling in retrospect than it was at the time pop had behaved intelligently instead of with his sporadic brilliance throughout his partnership with jake harmon and she was naturally inclined to regard his intense interest in me as a continuation of that intelligent behavior moreover say what you will it is difficult to dispute the judgment of a man who has made a million dollars i was finally impelled to dispute it in fact to raise holy hell about it when pop took me to buy my school clothes the chief item of which was a blueserge knickerbocker suit with velvetbraided lapels and pearl buttons i had not used any profanity in years and never in front of pop whose nearest approach to cursing was an occasional darn or gosh but now i cut loose before i could be dragged out of the swank mens clothing store the swallowtailed clerks were fleeing for cover their manicured fingers stoppering their scarlet ears i was returned to the hotel and confined to my room as further punishment i was advised that i would not be allowed to accompany the family on a tour of the oil fields but would remain in fort worth in the custody of pa i advised the family at the top of my lungs that they could all go to hell pa had joined us in fort worth with the announced intention of getting us settled but actually i am sure as a way of getting away from ma he had given me none of the support i expected in my skirmishes with pop and i was thoroughly disgusted with him pa the orphan said that i was damned lucky to have a smart man like pop looking after me he said that it was every mans right to make a damned fool of himself and that my turn would come later i was disgusted with pa i felt that he had failed me sorely thus the following morning when he came into my room after the familys departure i told him to get the hell out have a smoke said pa tossing me a footlong pittsburgh stogie got a little surprise for you the surprise or part of it arrived right behind him a whitejacketed waiter with a pitcher of boiling water a bowl of lemons and sugar pa took a bottle of bootleg corn whiskey from his hip and mixed us two tremendous hot toddies kind of like old times aint it he said slanting his savagely humorous old eyes at me you remember that night out by the privy when now what the hell you sniveling about anyway i nnothing i said choking back a sob light up then drink up stop acting like a goddamned calf anything i hate to see its a fella cryin in good whiskey i lit up and drank up the steam from the toddies mingled with the clouds of cigar smoke and the morning sunlight shone through it upon pas bald head it seemed to me he wore a halo i tell you somethin jimmie he said casually freshening our drinks from the bottle we all got our own way of doin things an thats the way we got to do em aint no man can do a thing another fellas way aint no use tryin to make him hell just go his own way all the harder an hell be your enemy besides i nodded my understanding although i was far from agreeing with his doctrine pa went on to remark that while other people had their ways he also had his and it was no more than just and proper that he should pursue that way since i had been left in his charge in other words he concluded anyone that thinks youre going to tag around with me in that outfit your pop bought you has got another goddamned think coming he gave me another stogie and urged me to help myself to a second toddy then he left the room returning a few minutes later with one of his uniforms complete even to the widebrimmed black hat and congress gaiters all that was missing was the cane and pa promised to pick one up for me if i felt too naked without it happily the stogie lodged in the corner of my mouth i dressed the hat and the gaiters had to be stuffed with paper to be wearable and since pa stood six feet to my five and weighed two hundred pounds to my oneten the suit was a trifle large but this difficulty was easily solved to our satisfaction at least the pants legs were rolled up and under for a few inches likewise the coat sleeves a few pins here and there and the job was done true the seat of the pants bagged to my knees but the coat reached below them one hand washed the other to use pas metaphor i looked fine he declared and no one but a damned fool would think otherwise so equipped with fresh stogies we sallied forth during my long residence in fort worth i often felt that it was cursed with more than its share of damned fools but it was a western city and peculiarities of dress went more unmarked than otherwise thus while i drew a number of startled glances no one damned fool or otherwise said or did anything about me pa and i ate a whopping breakfast of steak eggs and hot cakes and only once did he see fit to criticize me that was when he observed me eating from the sharp edge of my knife and he pointed out the danger of it suggesting that i use the reverse edge instead after breakfast we went to a pool hall where pa beat me five games of slop pool and i beat him two we returned to the hotel then for a few beforelunch drinks and following lunch we went to a penny arcade pa had brought the bottle with him and he became quite rambunctious when a night with a paris cutie did not come up to his expectations he caned the machine i think he would have caned the arcade proprietor but that shrewd gentleman wisely gave him no back talk instead he returned pas coins and led him out to the sidewalk he pointed to a burlesque house across and down the street why look at pictures he inquired when you can see the real thing well now said pa greatly mollified maybe you got something there friend fort worth had a number of burlesque houses at that time and we were able to obtain choice seats on the front or baidhead row except for three brief and alternate absences we stayed there until the house closed at midnight those absences well first i went outside to buy a cane so that i could hook the girls on the ramp as pa did then pa went out for a fresh supply of whiskey then i went out for a carton of coffee and sandwiches it was a wonderfully satisfying day pa had given a bottle to the ushers and sent a couple of others backstage and in that place he and i could do no wrong we hooked the girls garments until they were reduced to near nudity pa climbed upon the ramp and chased them backstage yet they respondcd with laughter and joyous shrieks and occasionally one would stoop swiftly and plant a kiss on pas head each of the succeeding three days at the end of which the family returned was a reasonable facsimile of that first day hot toddies in the morning then a pool game then a burlesque house with drinks and meals being imbibed at strategic intervals also much talk from pa much advice delivered in his casual backhanded fashion i am afraid that most of what he said was wasted upon me but i was imbued with a little of his wisdom at least briefly i gave pop no further argument about the clothes and i submitted silently if sullenly to his criticisms for a time i was docile then we bought a house and pa returned to nebraska and i started to school texas had only eleven grades of school as compared with the twelve in other states thus as an eighthgrade student in the oklahoma schools i was technically a firstyear highschool student in texas being extremely praisehungry and anxious to shine in pops eyes i took advantage of that technicality nowadays it is no unusual thing for a twelveyearold and i was still twelve to enter high school but it was unusual at that time more important in my case it was completely unjustifiable i had read voraciously and far in advance of my years and i was a walking compendium of largely unassimilated knowledge drilled into me by pop but i was sadly prepared for the inelastic highschool curriculum in our various moves from place to place i had been absent from grammar school practically as much as i had attended now i was missing a whole year i knew nothing of cube and square root and many other things upon which the highschool subjects were predicated despite the sorry state of my elementary schooling i think i might have done passably in the higher grades if i could have put my heart into it i have almost always managed to do the things i really cared about doing similarly however and doubtless regrettably i can do nothing at all if i do not care and i become uncaring very quickly if i am prodded or driven or if the people involved are distasteful to me to put the last thing first the texans are distasteful or so i soon convinced myself i studied their mannerisms and mores and in my twisted outlook they became mongoloid monsters i saw all their bad and no offsetting good texans made boast of their insularism they bragged about such things as never having been outside the state or the fact that the only book in their house was the bible texans did not need to work to improve their characters as pop was constantly pressing me to do all texans were born with perfect characters and these became pluperfect as their owners drank the unrivaled texas water breathed the wondrous texas air and trod the holy texas soil texas it appeared had formed all but a minuscule part of the confederacy and as such had slapped the troops of sherman silly and sent grants groaning to their graves singlehanded almost anyway it had thrashed the bully north then as a generous though intrinsically meaningless gesture it had conceded defeat thus ending the awful bloodshed and preserving the union just as all texas males were omnipotent invincible and of irreproachable character so were all texas women superbly beautiful and utterly virginal and woe to anyone who hinted the contrary being of an open mind i was willing to concede that the texas female was probably somewhat more personable than a ubangi but i would make no concessions on the second score i delighted in pointing out the historic incompatibility of virginity with wife and motherhood mockinnocent i demanded that the peculiar texas situation be explained to me as a rule my heretical quizzing was rewarded at this point with a punch in the nose if not i would extend the questioning into the sacrosanct realm of texas sweethearts and sisters that invariably would get me not one punch but a dozen anything that a texan might be sensitive about or hold sacred i jeered at there was no trick too low for me if it would discomfit the texans i recall and it makes me squirm to do it the pleased astonishment of the coach when i applied for a place on the highschool track team how unselfishly delighted he was that i was at last coming out of my shell i recall his almost tearful joy as i skimmed tirelessly and swiftly around the track a half mile mile mileandahalf two miles i was a naturalborn twomiler he declared rangy wiry long legged i was the best twomiler he had ever seen and he hugged me ecstatically the twomile event was in the bag if only he had a few more lads like me it was a damned good thing for him that he didnt have any more like me for while i represented our school in the intramural twomile race i did not run it i trotted up in front of the grandstand sat down in the middle of the track and lighted a cigarette only my tender years i suspect saved me from being lynched i had nor completely plumbed the abyss of ignominy when i came under the influence of a boy scout leader and for a time my descent was checked then suddenly and inexplicably he became cool and critical and i resumed my career of making everyone else as miserable as i was years later when i was shaking out of the grandfather of all hangovers pop tried to get at the root of my trouble i just cant understand it he complained i cant see how it started you were always such a bright likeable willing youngster so wellbalanced and adaptable i was huh i laughed hoarsely well well of course you were why your scoutmaster made a special trip to my office to tell me about you he said you were the finest boy in his troop dont kid me i said that guy got me to liking him then he turned on me and he never gave me a pleasant word from then on now i wonder why he did that pop frowned in honest puzzlement i believe i did tell him that praise could be very bad for a boy and that i hoped you wouldnt acquire a swelled head but surely well i was easily the most unpopular student in school also it goes without saying i was the poorest student i had read all the standard historians gibbon wells even herodotus yet i could not rather would not pass the texas history courses i had read a complete twelvevolume botanical encyclopedia but i failed in botany i had read ibanezs mare nostrum as well as some of alarcons shorter plays in their original language yet i failed in spanish i had sold fillers to the pulp periodicals and brief humorous squibs to such magazines as judge but i failed in english most thoroughly i failed in algebra and geometry two subjects which struck me as so wholly nonsensical that they were beneath beneath contempt if you follow my meaning in one of my softer moments i proposed a bargain to my math teacher if she would prove to me that her chosen subjects were not as stupid as i claimed then i would study them she did not take me up on the offer and she seemed very embittered by it the good woman gave me what is doubtless the lowest grade ever meted out to a student not just a zero but zerominus i was a highschool freshman at twelve almost six years later i was still a highschool freshman from being the youngest i became the oldest from being a beardless stripling i grew into manhood strangers to the school often mistook me for a member of the faculty i was expelled and suspended so many times for disobedience refusing to study cutting classes playing truant et cetera that i lost track of them so also did the school suspensions were piled upon expulsions and expulsions upon suspensions so that the harried records clerk never knew when i was legitimately present or illegally absent along toward the last just before she gave up the unequal struggle with my status i overheard the tag end of her plea to one of my teachers please do not suspend him until he is reinstated from expulsion so i can suspend him as of last month so i can reinstate him to be expelled sosso im ggoing ccraaazy now and then sometimes for the better part of a term i escaped into the upper classes but inevitably my scholastic record would catch up with me and i would be returned to the freshman fold one term having received so many lectures that i had begun to fear for my hearing i decided to try to reform i promoted myself into the senior class there where i rightfully should have been had i behaved as i should have i was polite to the teachers and i studied as i had never studied before my grades soared higher and higher as the end of the term neared i was placed in that select group of students whose marks were so good that they were excused from final examinations when finally they were apprised of my status my teachers were incredulous they had had no dealings with me before that term and they could not believe that i was the james thompson who had established an alltime record for boorishness and boobery unfortunately there was indisputable proof that the onerous and ornery james was one and the same with theirs so since i lacked the prerequisite courses my brilliant terms work availed me nothing i received no credit hours for it i was right back where i had started still a freshman despite my chagrin and disappointment i did not feel that my work had been entirely wasted for one thing i had rid myself of a worrisome suspicion that i was as stupid as most people thought for another i had been made to see the inexorable crux of my problem obviously mere study and better behavior were not going to get me out of high school not that is within a reasonable time no matter how hard i studied nor how well i behaved i would still have to spend four more years in school on top of the approximately six years i had already served the records would force me to so there was the problem not in me as i saw it but in the records something would have to be done about them at this time and for some time prior to it i was employed as a night bellboy in a large hotel the list of my acquaintances extended into places which in my present pious state gives me shivers to think about a square sam myself i was known to be strictly okay and a right kid in no time at all i was in touch with a burglar explaining my problem and asking his help on a fee basis i dunno kid he said scratching his head doubtfully id like to help you out but well i just dunno but its a cinch i said the stuff isnt in a safe all you have to do is pick the locks on a couple doors then you get rid of my record card and fill in one of their blanks ill tell you just what to put on it and i dont know nothing about those things kid id foul it up for you sure dont do anything to it then just get rid of the record and bring me one of the blanks and huhuh i go into a place once im through with it i dont go back no more anyway suppose they look for that card and it aint there theyd come down on you like a ton of bricks kid well i hesitated how about this take someone with you that look kid he held up a hand you just dont do things that way a guys a penman he dont do nothing else he wouldnt touch a burglary for love or money theres only one way to do this job get to the party that keeps the records put a fix in with her shes not on the take i said glumly i know that dame well he shrugged thats the way youll have to swing it if you cant do it from the inside you just aint gonna get it done i left him disconsolately all the more depressed because i knew he was right a new record card filled out in a hand wholly dissimilar to that of the other cards would be damnably incriminating even with a fix in the crime was certain to be spotted for as long as school was in session the cards were referred to and there were certain teachers who knew my record by heart i had not one problem then but two to do the job from the inside and to do it right at the close of the school term thus by the time there was again occasion to refer to that card i would be safely out of reach my sins would have become dim in the minds of the authorities and any longmemoried snoop who sought to make trouble would find his contentions impossible to prove it was a large order one seemingly impossible to fill yet fill it i must or become the worlds only senile schoolboy so fill it i did and i shall tell you how i did it a little later meanwhile let us move back in the story taking its events in as proper a sequence as their general impropriety will permit pops luck went sour almost from the day he set foot in texas the fortune which i was to inherit shrank at the rate of almost four hundred thousand dollars a year i naturally thought it was a hell of a note to be losing all that dough without so much as a soda to show for it but i was more concerned with certain issues tangential to the main one briefly as i discussed them with pop they were about as follows first of all was a man who had made such a thorough screwup of his own affairs a suitable mentor for me second with him losing money at the rate of a couple thousand dollars a week was there any sense in my knocking myself out for a pittance on some parttime job finally since i apparently would have no dough to look after wasnt all this spartan training i was undergoing pretty damned stupid i was not trying to be snide or facetious and i was irritated and bewildered that pop should think i was i pointed out that if i wanted to be smartalecky or nasty i could do a heck of a lot better than that but pop was as near to being furious as i have ever seen him addressing me as sirrah he let it be known that i was pretty poor comfort for a man no longer young whose lifes gleanings were slipping through his fingers never to be grasped again he said that when he was my age he had done such and such and so and so and all i could do was get into trouble and sass my betters he said that i was completely irresponsible and outofhand and that the remedy lay in work and more work he had been too easygoing with me he said but now the old free and easy days were over i was to study every night from dinner until bedtime also since i had chosen to quit my parttime job as a soda jerk i would find suitable employment on the weekends the first ordinance did not bother me particularly i was no more popular in the neighborhood than i was elsewhere and normally remained indoors at night for reasons connected with my health i did not study naturally but the fact was difficult to prove i was always writing something i always had a halfdozen books spread in front of me they never had anything to do with my lessons but pop would have been the first to argue the fact the prince to his way of thinking was a splendid and necessary adjunct to the study of civics so also was there an indisputable relationship between schopenhauer and sociology malthus and mathematics and lycurgus and commercial law it was easy then to meet pops study requirements but finding parttime work was something else again such employment was difficult to find in that day and it paid very little when one did find it it will seem incomprehensible to our contemporary youth who sneer at offers of a fivedollar fee for mowing a lawn but my wage as a soda jerk had been five dollars for an approximate thirtyhour week pop was a firm believer in the adage that there is always work for those who want it and when i found none in the time allotted me he supplied it he bought a ladder brushes and a supply of paint and set me to work painting the house now while i showed little liking for useful employment it does not necessarily follow that i liked useless work any better and this was worse than useless the house was only a few months old it stood in need of paint much less than i disgusted and resentful i did the job at the rate of a few inches a day painting over and over the same places the end effect naturally was that of a checker board and the whole place had to be done over by professional painters we lived in an unincorporated suburb of fort worth like our neighbors a meat packer a steel magnate and another oil man we had bought the lots surrounding ours and our total land holdings were probably an acre pop now caused a barn to be built on this surplus land and furnished it with two purebred jerseys and i i was advised was in the dairy business since we were outside the city limits our neighbors were without legal recourse mom her frugal soul mollified by the prospect of free milk for the household did no more than hint that pop had become a hopeless lunatic i protested of course bitterly profanely and continuously and knowing something of pop you will know how little my protests accomplished i was to have full charge of the cows a free hand as pop put it the family would receive its milk free the remainder would be distributed through a housetohouse milk route which would be no trouble at all for me to establish i would be allowed to keep any monies remaining after the care and feeding of the cows had been paid for its a wonderful opportunity for you said pop you should be very grateful i said something that sounded like ship not that i gave a damn really but there were no profits from the business jerseys are not the hardiest breed of cattle and one visit from a veterinarian consumed the returns from a weeks sale of milk too while customers were fairly plentiful in the beginning they did not continue so they seemed alarmed by a milkman who lost no opportunity to declare that he would be fried with onions sooner than touch a drop of that blank blank tripleblank jersey juice i put up with the dairy until summer then being told that i would have to keep the cows staked out during the day move them around on a tether from one vacant lot to another i went down to the railroad yards and caught a northbound freight i got as far as kansas before i was apprehended and returned i waited a few days then caught a freight southward i was brought back from houston pop sold the cows i was made to feel of course that i had behaved very badly the family had been put to much expense and trouble on my account and the only return i would give them was insolence and shiftlessness i was bewildered by this attitude and still am even more now than i was at the time i have three children one a fifteenyearold boy i think they are pretty good kids but honesty compels me to say that no one of them has ever made a bed washed a dish or swept a floor without violent protest moreover they commonly refer to their mother and me as nuts or screwy and they frequently suggest that we turn blue or stop breathing or otherwise end our patent misery you see when these children were quite young we had an elderly man living with us this man would not let the children lift a finger to any task reproaching us scornfully and speaking darkly of child slaves he would not let us reprove them no matter what their misdeeds he sternly ruled down the suggestions that treats should be withheld for bad behavior and that allowances should be earned with household chores naturally the kids got pretty spoiled who was this man you ask who was the man who encouraged our children in insolence who constantly bawled us out for failing to swallow his dictum that kids were kids and should only be addressed with words of praise who pop we spent a large part of that summer at the fashionable spa in waukesha wisconsin the family lounged about the place taking the waters and i found employment as a plumbers helper i did not mind it too much jack the plumber i was assigned to was a prize goldbrick a man who saw no virtue in work whatsoever i can lay right down aside a job and go to sleep he would boast he seldom referred to work as such apparently hating even the sound of it he spoke of it rather with a kind of glum obliqueness as the killer he struck me as being an extremely wise and discerning man and i treated him with due deference under his earnest tutelage i became almost as expert at stalling and loafing as he one morning the morning after a day we had killed in repairing a leaky toilet trap the boss plumber confronted jack with considerable severity he said that he had put up with just about all he was going to and that he would be forced to take steps unless jack improved his ways jack blinked at him stolidly then he reached into an inside pocket took out a notebook and withdrew a sheaf of clippings from it read those he commanded the boss read them perforce they were all obituaries of people who had died while working ats what youre up to jack would growl at the conclusion of each clipping you tryin to kill me maybe there was obviously but one acceptable answer to the question and the boss made it over and over in fact as jack glowered and glared at him his huge hands fondling a thirtysixinch stilison our employer began to anticipate the gloomy inquiry he could not stand it if anything happened to us he babbled we must take better care of ourselves and avoid overexertion in the summer heat jack finally allowed him to escape to his office whereupon of course my colleague placed his hands on his hips spread his feet sucked in his lungs threw back his head opened his mouth to its widest and addressed the ceiling with a bellowed promise to kill that dirty sonofabitch along with obituaries of people who had succumbed to the killer jack collected french postcards and many was the hour we whiled away with these in the restfully cool sanctuary of bathrooms basements and cessbasins looky at them jack would say now aint that somethin now aint that somethin i would respond betcha theys plenty o peopled give a thousand dollars to see somethin like that betcha they is plenty jack felt there was an unreasonable and foolish prejudice against these art studies and that a fortune awaited the person who could overcome it everyone likes em themselves he said but theyre afraid to let on now if you could get everyone to lookin at em all at the same time out in the open like yeah i frowned wisely all at the same time out in the open like jack was much impressed with the manner in which i held up my end of our discussions he said i had a way of getting right to the point of a thing and that i did wonders toward clarifying his own thinking we were installing guard rails in a local foodprocessing plant when the solution to the frenchpostcardprejudice problem came to him generous man that he was and grateful for the many times i had gotten to the point of things he promised me a full half of his potential millions yes sir jimmie he said nodding to a conveyor belt thats the way to do it we hit the nail right on the head yes sir i said blankly thats the way to do it them packages them packages we slip em in there we slip hey i said what are we waiting for it seemed odd that this triumphant moment should have marked the beginning of the end of a beautiful friendship but i am forced to report that it did for now instead of plunging forthright into the cause and forging ahead to victory and riches jack held back in ultracaution we had to do the thing right he said and they was plenty of things to be worked out before we could do it right as the days passed and two items appeared in the ranks of thingstobeworkedout for each one i expunged i became impatient with jack then suspicious of him i declared that he was deliberately delaying operations until i had returned to texas where i would be unable to reap my just dues as coowner of the company jack was placatory for a time but i seemed to detect a certain lack of candor in his manner a damning sheepishness so my indictments continued and finally he was brought to respond with hideous slurs he said i was an eager beaver willing and willful fodder for the killer he would bet money he said that i liked to work he had had his doubts about me from the beginning and my vigorous manner and unseemly impetuosity had now revealed the awful truth to him we stopped speaking after that we did not speak again until the eve of my departure for texas when we shook hands diffidently and exchanged stiff farewells more than thirty years have passed since that stilly evening in a wisconsin plumbing shop thirty years in which i have become the noninventing inventor of such things as storybook toilet paper cigarettes with builtin matches neckties which assume the hue of the gravy dropped on them and a tongueshaped sponge for licking stamps so i can understand jacks attitude now i can see that the more beautiful a dream the more hopeless its realization that we have but to grasp to destroy it all i could see at the time however was that a venal and crafty man had taken sorry advantage of an innocent and trusting boy and for months after our return to texas i searched for proof of jacks perfidy every container of food that came into the house was carefully dissected by me cartons labels wrappers tax stamps i even took apart the lids of catsup bottles and cracked open the stoppers to sauce carafes since i declined to explain this activity mumbling only of a million dollars and people who thought they could kid me the family was more than ever convinced that i didnt have a brain in my head which i imagine was a pretty fair statement of the case the school i attended was not too far distant from glen garden country club so it was only natural that i should gravitate there in search of weekend employment i found it as a caddie and i liked it at least i liked it better than the other types of work i had thus far encountered there was something about receiving pay from play which pleased me very much and as a glen garden caddie one had the privilege of playing on the course at certain hours you were out at the club at the crack of dawn you and ben hogan and byron nelson and all the other caddies who were ambitious to improve their game there wasnt a full set of clubs among the lot of you but that didnt matter you formed into foursomes according to your handicap you strode down the dewwet fairway calling back and forth to one another diagnosing each others drives and approaches as competently as any pro later in the day when the jobs were being passed out you would engage in profane and bloody struggle behind the caddie shack but now all the niceties of etiquette were observed all was politeness and consideration the game made you that way i thought it was pretty swell well though caddies were paid sixtyfive cents for eighteen holes and there were more caddies than there were those who wanted them on a good day during a tournament for example you might get out twice for a total of thirtysix holes and if the tips broke right for you you might make as much as a dollar seventyfive or two dollars this was darned big money of course for a mere twelve or fifteen miles trudging with a fiftypound bag on your back but it was seldom that one enjoyed such great good fortune on an average you were lucky to get out for eighteen or maybe a round and nine and there were days when you waited around from dawn to sunset without ever getting out obviously as pop pointed out caddying was neither dependable nor lucrative he did not forbid me to continue with it in fact although my habit of ellipsis may have made him appear otherwise pop very seldom ordered me or forbade me to do anything pop believed in reasoning a thing through in looking at a matter from all sides there were times as i have indicated when i preferred being proved an ingrate idiot and allaround horses ass to giving in but these times were infrequent i didnt particularly mind being an ii and ha but the process of establishing my status was just too damned wearying to be endured pop spoke amusingly of grown men chasing a little white ball around a cow pasture he looked down his nose as i boasted of breaking forty he himself had broken forty at my age he said forty acres of virgin land with only a onehorse plough i was spending two days a week at the golf course two days that once gone were lost to me forever two a week one hundred and four a year three hundred and twelve in three years pop grew more eloquent with every word and i grew older when at last i retired to the bathroom for a smoke it was with bent back and trembling rheumatic legs and i had to study myself in the mirror for minutes before i was convinced that i still had teeth and did not have a long gray beard naturally i retired from glen garden as i mentioned a while back i had sold several short squibs to magazines this activity was not encouraged since my puny sales were taken as proof that i lacked talent and was frittering away my time but neither was it actively discouraged i had ceased to write except occasionally and in the greatest secrecy out of fear of publicity i had taken dreadful and prolonged razzing as the result of my writing and i wanted no more of it semaj nosmot how mellifluous the name had sounded when i invented it and how hideous it became to me ah vanity vanity what pitfalls dost thou mask semaj nosmo i used that pen name only once but unfortunately that once was on a return envelope i returned home from school one evening to find myself addressed as semaj and nosmot and i could see nothing at all funny about it a fact which i was soon stating at the top of my lungs but i was the only one who couldnt mom and pop soon called a halt seeing that i was badly hurt and upset but they could not restrain an occasional snicker and chuckle nor were they very successful in restraining maxine and freddie wherever i went in the house there were whispers of nosmot and snotpot and semaj and messy jam and even as i started to flee the house a chorus of catcalls drifted in from the street sema juh nosmot fell in uh piss pot maxine and freddie had found the joke too good to keep it had gotten into the public domain all of which constituted enemy territory the above doggerel comprises but one of the jibes to which i was subjected in the ensuing weeks and since there is no point in repeating it and the others are largely unprintable i shall spare you further details of my ordeal the point is that i had ceased to pursue writing for fear of being pursued by nosmot but the furore had died down by now the razzers had worn their material threadbare and were as weary of it as i was it seemed safe enough to resume writing but with the returns from magazines so small i tackled a new outlet i gathered up the several invoices from my freelance checks and exhibited them to the editor of the fort worth press modestly suggesting that in me there was at least the making of a star reporter he did not seem to look at me in quite that way or for that matter in any other way with the ears beneath my porkpie hat growing redder he remained bent over his work for the space of perhaps ten minutes and he appeared deaf to the jovial patter which poured more and more desperately from my lips my skintight valentino pants suddenly seemed six sizes too large for me there was a terrible lump in the vicinity of my adams apple somehow i gathered i had erred grievously in my approach but i could not think how it could have been as a close student of hollywood movies i had become an expert on editorreporter relations reporters always sat down on the editors desk they always kept their hats on their heads and cigarettes in their mouths they always addressed the editor as old socks or kiddo and tossed off such bright remarks as dont pump me mac im full of beer i had done all these things it looked to me like this guy didnt know his stuff at last he looked up then he stood up silently he plucked the hat from my head and the cigarette from my mouth then he placed his palms against my shoulder and gently but firmly pushed me from his desk would you like to sit down he asked politely yyes sir i stuttered please do he said gesturing to a chair i sank into it he asked my age fffffourfifteen i swallowed almost fifteen oh his face softened id have said you were older these checks theyre really yours youve actually sold to those magazines yes sir thats very good ive never been able to sell as much as a twoline joke to a magazine why dont you just keep on with it why do you want a job on a newspaper i explained the situation pretty incoherently i imagine but he seemed to understand well he said at last i cant offer you a thing you go to school you say until threethirty in the afternoon yes sir but cant offer you a thing nothing at all do you use a typewriter yes s nope its out of the question nothing i can do for you know the city pretty well y well he said casually i think we can probably work something out for you but first this was long before the founding of the american newspaper guild seasoned reporters drew twentyfive dollars and less for a work week of fifty and sixty hours and youngsters breaking in frequently worked for no reward but the experience so for the times the terms of my employment were more than generous i reported on the job at four in the afternoon and remained as long as i was needed for my principal duties as copy boy phoneanswerer coffeeprocurer and occasional typist i was paid four dollars a week for the unimportant stories i was allowed to cover i was paid three dollars a column to the extent that they were used in the paper due to their very nature my stories were usually left out of the paper or appeared in such boileddown form that the cash rewards were infinitesimal about all i could count on was my four dollars salary which just about paid my expenses this circumstance coupled with the fact that i was away from home to all hours soon resulted in a series of conferences between pop and me the discussions ended several months later when i ended my employment with the press as is apparent i was a very perverse young man i customarily headed myself in exactly the opposite of the direction which others tried to head me and i resented all attempts at reforming me with this kind of makeup i had profited about as little personally from my experience on the press as i had in cash but the seeds of improvement had been sown through the medium of example i had been shown and allowed to observe instead of being told and gradually the seeds sprouted i abandoned my valentino pants and haircut i ceased to smoke except when i actually wanted a cigarette i became careful about such things as shined shoes and clean fingernails i started to become courteous i was still guarded and terse ever on the lookout for slights and insults but i did not ordinarily go out of my way to be offensive as long as i was treated properly and my standards in this matter were high i treated others properly i would like to say in this connection that good manners and consistent courtesy toward others are the most valuable assets a reporter can have i know having worked on metropolitan dailies in various of these united states in my time i have interviewed hundreds of people notorious and notable movie stars and murderers railroad presidents and perjurers princes panderers diplomats demagogues the judges and the judged i have interviewed people who never gave interviews who never saw reporters who had no statement for the press i once interviewed a west coast industrialist third highestsalaried man in the united states because of his morbid fear of kidnappers he had made his home into a virtual fortress and he was almost hysterical when i having got hold of his phone numbei called him up he had never given an interview he had never had his picture taken and he would not do so now i told him i could understand his feelings and we would forget about the story but would he be kind enough to talk to me for my own personal benefit i had made no whopping success of my own life i said and i would appreciate a few pointers from a man who had grudgingly and after checking back to see that the call was bona fide he consented i went out to his house in the morning and i stayed on through lunch and into the afternoon finally as i was getting ready to leave he said that he felt rather uncomfortable about withholding the story i said he didnt need to feel that way at all i was in his debt for the privilege of talking to him oh hell he laughed abruptly im probably a damned fool but i got the story also a picture soon after that since no one tried to rob or kidnap him the industrialist got rid of his guards and his armament and began enjoying life and his income only once in my experience as a reporter did courtesy and consideration fail to pay off that was in the case of a washington real estate lobbyist an illmannered boor with an inflated head whom allwise providence has since removed from circulation this man had sent advance notice of his arrival in the city where i was working and i and the opposition reporters were at the train to meet him we were there at his invitation understand but he looked through us coldly if we wanted to talk to him he said we could do it at his hotel we followed him there and still he had no time for us perhaps after he had had his breakfast we waited while he had his breakfast we waited while he got his haircut we waited while he kidded interminably with the cigarstand girl he then advised us that he was going up to his suite for a nap and that he would probably be able to see us in an hour or so the other reporters and i looked at each other we went to the house phones and conferred with our editors their opinion of this character happily coincided with ours that he was a peabrain who needed a lesson in manners and that the pearls of wisdom which he allegedly had for our community should be retained for shoving purposes i relayed this message to the lobbyist he slammed up the phone threatening to get all you bastards and your editors too he got in touch with our publishers he got in touch with our managing editors and our desk men he threatened and blustered he pleaded he begged he tried to bring outside influence to bear on the newspapers he called press conferences and no reporters showed up he addressed banquets and meetings and issued a steady stream of press releases not a word of what he said or wrote appeared in the newspapers now the real estate interests are probably the most powerful bloc in any community but the potential club they formed and which our friend had waxed vain in swinging could swing more than one way and so he soon found out the local realty operators began to look at him askance what kind of man was it they wondered who could so mortally offend three large newspapers in how many other cities had he incurred similar displeasure they and other groups around the country were paying for his activities they were paying him to influence legislation to make them look good to the public was this the way he went about it the lobbyist was in complete disfavor with his nominal supporters when at weeks end he sneaked out of town but despite the allaround frost he had received his manners remained virtually as bad as ever back in washington he dished out considerably more boorishness than a certain party girl cared to take she retaliated vigorously and effectively her attack didnt quite kill him mores the pity but being concentrated on the area which the marquis of queensberry held sacrosanct it did the next best thing briefly while the lobbyist may still be interested in women he has nothing to interest them noblesse oblige after leaving the press i found brief employment on western world an oil and mining weekly i had no regular hours being summoned for work only during certain rush periods when extra help was needed neither did i have any regular duties i did a little of everything from addressing envelopes for the subscription department to reading copy to running errands to rewriting brief items occasionally when there was space to fill i also wrote poems very bad ones i fear of the robert service type my pay was a magnificent three dollars a day but i never knew when i would be called to work having to hold myself in readiness at all times and the times that i was called seemed constantly to conflict with my familys plans and schedules also or so i imagined my adult colleagues were not treating me with proper respect but consistently took advantage of their age and my youth to heap me with indignities they were all my bosses all had the privilege of sending kid shakespeare and young pulitzer after coffee or carbon paper and they invariably chose to do so at the worst possible moments as surely as there were visitors in the office as surely as i was in the throes of epic composition frowning importantly as i addressed my typewriter there would be a cry of hey kid followed by the suggestion that i wake up or get the lead out and busy myself with some quasihumiliating errand or task this was probably all for my own good a writer who cannot take it may as well forget about writing but i had taken and was taking so much elsewhere actually or in my imagination that i could take little more and finally after a wild scene in which to my horror i very nearly bawled i stormed out of the office and returned no more i went into a kind of decline during the next few months i could not muster the slightest interest in the several parttime jobs i secured in a grocery store a bottling plant and on an ice wagon and was soon severed from them to all practical intents and purposes i ceased to look for others i was not unwilling to work but i was not going to work for nothing nothing being the standard rate of pay as i saw it moreover i was not going to work at something that didnt make any sense a category as generally standard as the rate of pay i played hooky more and more often spending my school hours in burlesque houses to finance these expeditions i put in an occasional day at the golf course a photograph of this period reveals me as a thin neat solemnfaced young man surprisingly innocuouslooking at first glance it is only when you look more closely that you see the watchfully narrowed eyes the stiffness of the lips the expression that wavers cautiously between smile and frown i looked like i hoped for the best but expected the worst i looked like i had done just about all i was going to do to get along and others had better start getting along with me i found people who met this last requirement at one of the smaller burlesque houses which soon received my entire patronage it opened around ten in the morning and except for interludes of cowboy pictures the stage shows were continuous the performers saw me a dozen times a day always applauding wildly they began to wink at me to nod and soon we were greeting each other and exchanging brief pleasantries across the footlights there was an amplitude of seats during the hours of my attendance so the managerownerbouncer made no objection to my semipermanent occupancy of one of them in fact amiable man that he was he came to profess pleasure over my patronage and alarm at my absences he said he felt kind of funny opening the house without me meanwhile sliding a pack of cigarettes into my pocket or asking if id had my coffee yet he pressed me constantly to come clean with him to tell him what i honestly thought of his shows and he seemed never annoyed nor bored with my consistently favorable reviews i became sort of a fixturewithoutfolio around the place showing up when i could making myself useful when i chose i relieved the tickettaker i butched candy i assisted backstage with such widely assorted tasks as firing blank cartridges and hooking brassieres i drew no pay but i was never in want on the contrary i ate and smoked much more amply than i had on my salaried jobs the impression had become prevalent somehow that i needed looking after and everyone took it upon himself to do so through the medium of the friday amateur shows i was even provided with substantial amounts of spending money perhaps you remember these shows threesided contests between the audience the amateur and the implacable hook some totally talentless but determined wretch would stand stiffly centerstage reciting say dan mcgrew or singing mother machree and the louder he talked or sang the louder became the howls and boos of the audience he would persist poor devil even hurling back the squashy vegetables which were hurled at him but his evil destiny would not be denied the dreaded hook a long pole with a shepherds crook at the end suddenly fastened around his neck a stagehand yanked vigorously and the hapless amateur literally soared into the wings lest nasty suspicions arise in the minds of the spectators i could only appear on the show every two or three weeks but i did very well at that usually receiving the fivedollar grand prize or at least the threedollar second prize and yes the judging was completely fair my friend the manager held the various prizes over the various participants heads the amount of applause one received determined the size of his prize if any i had a halfdozen very corny and completely unoriginal routines worked out with the assistance of the shows regular comics but my act was usually confined to two which seemed to delight the audience more each time they saw them in one i dashed onto the stage with a prop bundle of newspapers under my arm madly shouting such nonsense as seven shot in a crap game ten found dead in a graveyard woman killed dick ramsays wife big disaster at soup factory vegetables turnip and pea and so on for a matter of three or four minutes the second act and the most popular of the two was somewhat more elaborate i strolled out of the wings clad only in a lace baby cap and a diaper and with a simulated chaw of tobacco in my cheek then taking exaggerated aim at the props about the stage i spat the pit drummer providing suitable sound effects and with every simulated expectoration a chair fell apart a picture shattered a milk bottle exploded or a table was shorn of a leg that was all there was to it but the audience loved it it was almost always the winner of the grand fivedollar prize one evening following my act when i was lounging backstage in my diaper a man in puttees and a checkered coat suddenly appeared as from nowhere and virtually hurled himself upon me i was of course guilty of all sorts of crimes from truancy to smoking on street cars and i was sure the total had long since equaled a capital offense thus i could only believe that this man was a detective and his rapidfire babble an indictment i neither heard what he said nor was able to reply it was left to the performers to interpret to me and respond for me which they repeatedly and enthusiastically did but even after he had left with a savagely jocular slap at my diaper i remained in a trembling daze me an actor a motion picture actor it just couldnt be it was however as i found out the following morning when i reported at what had been the office of a onetime lumber yard the checkcoated putteed man was the directorproducer of a brandnew picture company dedicated to the production of tworeel comedies and i was to act in those comedies starting as of right now i had what it took he assured me he had been in the business for years and he was never wrong about these things i have since learned enough about picturemaking to know that scenes are shot out of sequence and they appear to be a meaningless jumble to one unfamiliar with the story involved but knowing nothing of the kind then i became as bewildered as i was dazed i moved in an alltooapparent stupor which no amount of shouting from the directorproducer could snap me out of my mind found much to feed its suspicion that i was the butt of a cruel joke in rapid order i was costumed as a cowboy a baker a conductor a policeman a lifeguard and a blind beggar i was impelled to dive through windows fall down steps and stumble into mud holes i was knocked down walked on booted and tossed i was hit with pies crockery salami baseball bats and beer barrels and once a live bull snake was hurled at me so that it twined around my neck the more i went through of this the less i became accustomed to it i performed like a zombie of the piltdown era finally his aggravation having increased by the fact that a blemish on my chin loomed monstrously large in the rushes the director profanely discharged me i was one goddamned thing he said that he had been wrong about naturally having put him to so much trouble and expense i received no pay the aforementioned blemish turned out to be the opening salvo in an attack of barbers itch so for more than three weeks i was confined to the house brooding over my recent failure and the many failures preceding it actually as i eventually learned i had lost nothing the picture company had begun operations on a shoestring hoping to obtain financing via stockselling failing to do this it had been unable to finish even that one first picture it was never released and the producerdirector skipped town owing everyone i recovered from my malady and returned to the burlesque house but i was no longer happy there as i had been everyone was nice to me and everyone tactfully avoided the mention of motion pictures yet i was moody and restless i felt that i had to do something i simply had to something to rid me of the ugly stigmata of failure why good god i was almost sixteen years old and i had been a success at nothing every night as i brooded wakefully in bed i swore that i would make the following day different from the one just spent but the following day found me spending it exactly as i had the previous one i would be back at the burlesque house relieving the tickettaker butching candy romping backstage with the chorus girls wasting the golden hours which once gone would never come again late one afternoon a vaguely familiarlooking young man purchased a box of candy from me he was both casual and brisk about it first fumbling interminably for the necessary dime then whipping out a fivedollar bill and impatiently demanding his change i counted it out to him just as i finished his hand came out of the pocket with the dime he had been looking for here he said crisply heres your dime lets have the five back i gave it to him rather i allowed him to withdraw it from my hand i wandered absently on down the aisle absorbed with the problem of doing something and a full five minutes passed before it dawned on me that i had been done out of four dollars and ninety cents it was too late then of course to do anything about it my fives artist would have skipped the show immediately and gone in quest of another sucker nonetheless i dashed back up the aisle looking for him and there he was still in the same seat grinning at me and holding up the five just keeping in practice he said innocently you werent worried were you i had first seen allie ivers in police court where he appeared on a charge of swindling a storekeeper and i appeared in the interests of the fort worth press he was thin blond and pale with the most innocent blue eyes i have ever seen he looked about sixteen years old the first time i saw him he still looked sixteen ten years later our paths crossed and recrossed during those years and he often referred to me as his best friend i knew him far better than anyone else yet throughout our association i never knew where he lived i never learned anything about his background or antecedents and i was never sure of how he would behave from one day to the next about all you could be sure of with allie was that he would almost always do the unexpected particularly if it was illegal and to hell with the consequences once in an unusual moment of confidence he gave me a hint of his philosophy id dive off a thousandfoot cliff he said to get to a drowning man after that i dont know maybe id save him maybe id hang an anchor around his neck first stealing his shirt i suggested well said allie reasonably what would a drowning man need with a shirt that was as close as i ever got to really knowing allie he remains the most imponderable of the strange characters who throughout my life have gravitated to me like filings to a magnet the judge took one look at him that day in police court and decided that no such demure youth could have mitted twenty dollars from the grocers cash drawer then shortchanged him with his own money he rebuked the arresting officer and dismissed allie i followed him outside identifying myself as a reporter i asked him to tell me the truth was he guilty or not now allies favorite reading was the penal code and his knowledge of law was something to turn a supremecourt justice green with envy so after a momentary start he widened his wide blue eyes and confessed his guilt thats not all he said i stole a package of peanuts on my way out of the store i made a note of this and allie went on to recite other crimes his regular occupation he said was stealing fur coats from whores theyve all got them he explained i dont know why they sock so much dough in coats when they spend ninetenths of their time in bed i asked allie about his modus operandi he said it was simple having gained entry to the whores room in the guise of a customer he asked for a complete examination of the merchandise before purchasing then with the deluded woman in the altogether and hence unable to pursue him he grabbed her coat and fled its nice clean work said allie im going to get back to it as soon as the market gets better right now ive got all the pawnshops overstocked allie said that next to stealing fur coats he liked to steal baggage and this too was simple he added modestly involving little more than the ownership of a red cap and a badge also he went on he had done very well for himself by dividing the city into districts and assigning them to pickpockets on a percentage basis my big trouble said allie in conclusion is that im too restless i keep jumping around from one racket to another as soon as i get one going good i move on to something else i was as preposterously naive in some ways as i was sophisticated in others but i would like it made clear lest i appear a bigger dunce than i was that i believed allies story because it was true every word of it this selfish young man had not only stripped whores of their hirsute habiliments and trusting travelers of their luggage he had also defrauded some supposedly shrewd denizens of the underworld itself in fact as he confided to me later he was never happier than when engaged in taking the takers they put him on his mettle added zest to existence in a way that the yokels never could in the case of the pickpockets for example allie had visited houston and galveston convincing a coterie of dips that the fix was in in fort worth and that for a percentage of their take he was prepared to assign them choice districts wherein they might run wild they fell for it a number of them at least and descended upon fort worth allie began collecting his percentage the pickpockets began landing in jail to the runofthemill operator the incarceration of the first pickpocket would have been a signal to skip town but allie ivers definitely was not runofthemill as one after another of the pickpockets was knocked off allie went around to the others and explained that the guy had been gypping him on his percentage and had thus lost his license to steal he sternly advised them to take heed and to make no errors in arithmetic while calculating his due understandably alarmed and anxious to retain his good will the dips gave him his agreed on cut and more besides within a very few days of course the true state of affairs became known ie they had been paying for a fix which did not exist but while there was an intensive search for him for a time allie also seemed not to exist and the eventual opinion in police circles was that the pickpockets had created him a fictitious fall guy in the hope of excusing their own misdoings allie spent the winter in miami for my health he explained succinctly well though to get back to the confession he had made to me the truth or the falsity of it made not the slightest difference to a libelconscious newspaper true or false and my editor called it a hopdream on paper it was a yarn such as to invite mayhem on the reporter who submitted it being a man of exquisite courtesy and kindness my editor merely folded and refolded it forming it into a plug which he held in shape with a rubber band he handed this to me that hole in your head he said take care of it allie and i met outside the burlesque house and he insisted on taking me to dinner he said he had thought about me many times worried about that story he had given me he had meant no harm by it and hoped it had played no part in my descent to my present position i was pretty short with him at first but he seemed so genuinely interested in my welfare that i swiftly thawed we had dinner in a very good restaurant and i brought him uptodate on my activities he laughed a great deal but softly and sympathetically there was the look in his eyes of a bored child who has stumbled upon a strange and intriguing toy well have to do something about you he kept saying yes well certainly have to do something what kind of uh work are you doing now i asked bellhopping he said im down at the h hotel its not quite as good as stealing but its a change i was getting pretty bored with the con thats a pretty swell hotel i said ive been in worse allie shrugged theyve got very good locks on the doors could i i hesitated do you suppose i could why not why dont you ask aw i guess i better not i said i have to go to school ive been laying out a lot but i have to go thats all right said allie you can work at night they have a hard time keeping boys on the night shift i i guess not i said i they wouldnt hire me my folks wouldnt want me working at night and kind of lost your nerve huh allie nodded wisely afraid to try anything for fear you wont make it that wont do drink your coffee and lets get going we went with me lagging behind and protesting that id better not at the side door of the hotel allie drew me up to the leaded panes and pointed to a paunchy pompouslooking man with a carnation in the buttonhole of his black broadcloth coat thats the man you see the assistant manager on this shift said allie now you go in there and tell him he either gives you a job or youll piss in his hip pockets aw for i tried to break loose do it your own way then im going to stand right here and watch you huhuh allie i muttered i dont look good enough and and i got a pain in my stomach an hell think im crazy asking for a job in a place like allies hand closed around my forearm in a grip that was surprisingly and painfully strong you get in there he said firmly if you dont ill yell for the cops ill say you made me an indecent proposal something told me he would do exactly that i went in the assistant manager glanced at me wearily as i began a jumbled application for a job on nights then while i was still mumbling he murmured a word which sounded like hate and which i was sure summarized his feelings about me and strolled away relieved that he had not had me arrested i turned and tottered toward the door i had taken only a few steps when a swarthy slickhaired young man with captain emblazoned across his winecolored jacket appeared at my side youre going the wrong way mac he said smoothly the tailor shops back this way ttailor shop i said he grinned and took me by the elbow couldnt understand old mushmouth huh youll get used to him now lets get you fixed up with a uniform it was a weird wild and wonderful world that i had walked into the luxury hotel life of the roaring twenties it was a world which typified rugged individualism at its best or worst a world whose urbane countenance revealed nothing of the seething and sinister turmoil of its innards a world whose one rulewas that you did nothing you could not get away with there was no pity in that world the usual laws governing rewards and punishments did not obtain it was not what you did that mattered but how you did it nominally there were strictly enforced rules against such things as getting drunk on duty intimacy with lady guests and forcing tips from the stingy but the management could have knowledge that you were guilty of all those crimes and as long as you did them in such a way as not to give rise to complaints or disturb the routine of the hotel nothing would be done rather you would be regarded as a boy who knew his way around and was on his toes and this attitude i suppose was not nearly so strange as it seems it was the bellboy who was always in the closest contact with this hurlyburly world a world always populated by strangers of unknown background and unpredictable behavior alone and on his own with no one to turn to for advice or help he had to please and appease those strangers the eccentric the belligerent the morbidly depressed he had to spot the potential suicide and soothe the fighting drunk and satisfy the whims of those who were determined not to be satisfied and always no matter how he felt he had to do those things swiftly and unobtrusively briefly he had to be nervy and quickthinking he had to be adequate to any emergency and a boy who was inadequate in his own emergencies was also apt to be so in those concerning the hotel in a word he wasnt sharp he didnt know his way around and thus axiomatically did not belong around in the indictments lodged against bellboys in the hotel growler the rough equivalent of a ships log one word appeared over and over caught a boy was fired or fined or turned over to the police because he had been caught in an offense not merely because he had committed one there was no day off in the hotel world the night shift worked seven days a week from eleven at night until seven in the morning the day shifts were also on the job seven days but their hours were adjusted to the then universal longday shortday of the hotel world one of the two shifts came on at seven in the morning quit at noon returned at six and worked until eleven at night the following day it came to work at noon and quit at six pm the other shift working the doublewatch longday one night when there was an unexpected flurry of business a day boy was held over onto the night shift it was his second holdover of the day and he had been on duty since seven in the morning so after the business had been taken care of he claimed the late boys privilege of a room and fell exhausted into bed unfortunately he had not rid himself of his cigarette before going to sleep when he awakened a couple of hours later he was on the point of being incinerated and asphyxiated almost strangled he got the windows open then he dragged the mattress and bedclothes into the bathroom and put them under the shower scorched but not seriously harmed he got the fire out but the expensive blankets spread and boxmattress were ruined being caught in a mess like this would bring down the direst punishment which the hotel could devise the boy considered every angle of the seemingly hopeless situation then he went downstairs confessed his crime to the night clerk and proposed a way of extricating himself with honor and profit all he needed he said was the use of the emergency key and the assistance of one of the lobby porters being exceedingly sharp himself the night clerk flatly refused under no circumstances would he involve himself in the matter im going into the coffee shop for a bite to eat he said and i had better not hear of you using the emergency key or the porters while i am gone i understand the boy nodded i see what you mean now one of the more or less regular residents of the hotel was a morethanregular drinkei a man who passed out early and stayed passed out it was his misfortune to be a guest of the hotel on this particular night he burst into consciousness from his stupor with his room filled with acrid fumes and his bed and himself literally floating in water he did not need to ask the assembled company which included the porter clerk and bellboy the cause of his plight that was all too obvious all he could do was thank them for saving his unworthy life and offer recompense for the damage he tipped everyone handsomely he distributed additional gratuities when he paid the clerks claim for damages then because he had been so tractable in a trying situation he was transferred to another room at no charge itll have to be one thats been slept in the clerk explained but i know the former occupant quite well and i assure you not at all the man protested very kind of you so they took him down to the other room and put him to bed on a mattress and under bedclothes that were still warm with his own body news of this stunt spread throughout the hotel and the employee participants were marked as men on their way up as for their scapegoat the managements attitude toward his part in the affair was also characteristic here was a man who got so besotted that he could be lifted and moved about without waking obviously anyone who habitually attained such a condition was a menace to himself and the hotel so his name was entered on the heel list a catalogue of undesirables and he ceased to be a guest since practically every hotel man worth his salt had begun his career as a bellhop the tendency was not to be too severe on a sinner who on the whole appeared to be a good boy if you didnt cry if you were by and large personable punctual and perspicacious if you were an allaround boy one who could fill in instantly for the valets food checkers waiter captains and the operators of elevators switchboards and elliottfisher machines if you were all that you were entitled to consideration no matter what your misdeed there was only one elevator operator on the night shift and he was often too busy with guest traffic to bother with mere bellboys thus we were in the habit of opening up one of the driverless cars and transporting ourselves this fact led to my first experience with the strange ways of hotel discipline and a singularly terrifying experience it was i had been on the job about two months at the time and was attending a party of vaudevillians in a thirdfloor suite i had also been imbibing freely with those vaudevillians so much so that i was very far from being sharp and on my toes i left their rooms and trotted back to the elevator banks i inserted a key in the door of my chosen car swung the door open and stepped inside inside the shaft that is another boy had come along and taken my car i fell five floors in all the three aboveground and an additional two into the basement and subbasement it wasnt an unchecked fall of course i was grabbing at cables and gear all the way but you may take my word for it that even with full catchascatchcan privileges and no holds barred a fivestory fall is a hairraising and painful ordeal i lay at the bottom of the pit for a few minutes too shocked and painwracked to move then groaning and mumbling dazedly i sat up the pit door snapped open and an ashenfaced engineer looked in at me he helped me out then ran to inform the room clerk of my accident this particular clerk one of several i was to work with was the epitome of all clerks crisp cool and cynical he looked me over the corflers of his mouth quirking strangely hurt pretty bad eh he said like to take the rest of the night off nno sir i suppressed a groan i feel fine youre drunk youve got a breath that would knock a horse down i havent had a thing to drink i said ive been chewing a new kind of cough drop youre drunk thats why you fell down the elevator shaft me i laughed shakily i didnt fall down the shaft sir i was uh go on and youd better make it good understand i uh i save tinfoil sir off of cigarette packages and gum wrappers i climbed in there to look for some the engineer turned suddenly and departed the clerk was abruptly stricken with a spasm of coughing he recovered from the fit jerked out a pad of fine slips and began to write youre going to have to sharpen up he said curtly get on your toes and stay there youre a fairly good boy show quite a lot of promise on some occasions but youll have to do a lot better yes sir i said all right he ripped off the fine slip and handed it to me now get yourself washed up and cleaned up and get up on that floor right away understand yes sir i said and i looked down at what he had written to j thompson bellboy fine caught in general untidiness my next experience with the peculiar ways of hotel discipline came one morning when i had been held over onto the day shift i was very tired and had taken a few drinks to pep myself up those few set so well with me that i took a few more after which as nearly as i could reconstruct events i sat down in one of the lobby sand jars and went to sleep the bell captain promptly spotted me and i was hustled down to the locker room the assistant manager the same one who had hired me followed us vowing that i ought to be murdered of all the nogood blank blank blanks he yelled youre the worlds worst youre fired get me fired yyes sir i said another thing he snarled turning toward the door one more thing dont you dare come around here asking for your job back for at least a week to the best of my recollection i was fired six times during my several years at the hotel i was always rehired sometimes within the same night five of my firings were for drinking the other for smoking in a guests room all very serious offenses yet the hotel consistently rehired me where it curtly refused jobs to boys discharged for nominally trifling reasons failure it seemed could only be offset by ability the sharp received every consideration the dull got nothing this was all wrong i am sure but as a frequent traveler and dinerout i often look back with longing on the days when an employee might be discharged on a moments notice without severance pay for himself or penalty for his employer simply on the grounds that he was unsuited to his job as a bellboy i supposedly drew a salary of fifteen dollars a month but in practice i seldom saw a penny of it it was almost always consumed by fines cleaning and pressing charges insurance fees and the like my earnings were in tips which ranged from virtually nothing a night to as much as fifty dollars on a bad night a sunday say with no parties going on and few guests arriving i might make less than a dollar but on a good saturday or during a lively convention it would be no trick at all to knock off twentyfive thirtyfive or fifty or more dollars or i should say it was easy enough to do after i learned my way around my first week on the job i barely earned enough to pay for my cigarettes and carfare during normal times only two bellboys were used on the night shift and they were often idle except for the hotels endless untipped dead work my first working companion a boy of some forty years took advantage of my ignorance to the end that i did the lions share of the dead work and got a very small lambs share of the profitable bells he would take a call over the bell captains telephone without letting on that it was a call it would be a wrong number or a guest inquiring about his mail or something of the kind then having saved up four or five bells he would take care of them all on one trip he also sent me on calls to empty rooms and gave me bells which he knew to be trifling while he took the good ones after a week or so of this i began to get wise to pelly or pelican as he was called and i retaliated with the same stunts he had been pulling on me i tried to reason with him i pointed out that as surely as he tricked me i would trick him and that we would both lose money as a result but pelican took this as a sign that i was weakening he told me in effect to do my damnedest and that i would find his damnedest considerably better we night boys had many duties which took us behind the desk chores such as cleaning the key rack and sorting mail so around three oclock one morning i removed a rate slip from the room rack and called pell from a mezzanine house phone i spoke in a high pseudofeminine voice i told him that the window in my room was stuck and asked for a bellboys assistance in opening it pell promised to take care of the matter but i could tell he was suspicious peering through the rails of the mezzanine i saw him hurry to the room rack then nod triumphantly as he saw that there was no rate slip for the number i had given him obviously or so he thought the room was unrented actually it was occupied by one of the crustiest old dowagers ever to curse a hotel with her patronage pell snatched up the bell captains phone and rang the room i crept down the stairs slipped around behind the key rack and returned the rate slip to its proper place then i sauntered up behind him listening to him read me off im comin after you he was saying you keep up that squeakyvoice crap an ill come right up theren get you ill turn you wrong side out kick your tail end right out through your teeth who i think im talkin to why you goofy pinheaded grannydodger im im he had turned and seen me a look of pure horror spread over his face yyou he stuttered pointing a wobbling finger at me i ththought that you yeah i grinned at him as i was saying pell i think wed better stop rooking each other dont you he slammed up the receiver silencing the outraged shrieks that were pouring over the wire lifting it again he gave hasty instructions to the night switchboard operator she was to say that the call had come in from the outside from whom she did not know if she made the story stick he would buy her a fivepound box of candy well she made the story stick and pell escaped the penalty for his lack of sharpness but never again did he gyp me on a call we got along so well together that i felt quite depressed when he was literally chased out of the hotel i was saddened by the event but i still think it was one of the most hilarious i have ever witnessed pell and the then room clerk a mr hebert detested each other pell was constantly stating his intention of quitting or getting a transfer to days just as constantly hebert announced his intention to fire pell or have him transferred yet neither did either they chose rather to stay on the same shift making things tough for each other being in authority hebert would appear to have had the advantage of pell he could fine him load him with dead work bawl him out cruelly before other employees having done those things however and being unwilling to fire him there was little else he could do pell a mere bellboy with no authority could do plenty he was a very smooth talker a wonder at insinuating himself into the good graces of touchy and exacting guests having convinced such a person that he was all for him and hated to see him mistreated pell would reluctantly reveal that the man had been given the worst room in the house and at double the usual rate they call this the dead room he would say i think there must be some kind of germs in the wallpaper the way everyone dies that stays here now i know you wont let on that i told you i just think youre a very nice gentleman and i dont expect any big tip for tipping you off but at this juncture the guest would usually tip pell handsomely step to the telephone and sulphurously demand that hebert switch him to another room hebert would want to know why naturally the guest enjoined to secrecy by pell would refuse to explain he simply wanted another room and he wanted it right now by god and hed better not by god be gypped on the price redfaced and bewildered wondering aloud what the hell was getting into people hebert would do his best to satisfy the man but the suspicions of a man who had been placed in the dreaded dead room at a double rate were not easy to assuage by the time he had finished talking to the guest hebert was on the point of talking to himself sweat was pouring from his face and he was trembling in every joint and there was a wild look in his eyes it was pell who spread the rumor that hebert wore no pants behind the high marble counter a canard which according to the sex and temperament of the guest resulted in looks of disgust scowls and howls of laughter for the baffled and blushing room clerk pell was also responsible for the widespread belief that hebert maintained a stable of whores in the hotel renting them out at very low rates to gentlemen who could prove they were all right he dont care about the money see pell would explain hes one of these guys that gets a bang out of it now dont let on that i told you poor hebert he had a strong hunch that pell was at the bottom of his many and maddening difficulties but he could not prove it if pell had had as much patience as ingenuity i think he might have succeeded in his announced intention of driving hebert nuts but harassed as he was hebert stubbornly refused to crack up and annoyed by this perverseness and emboldened by success pell attempted a master stroke as i have mentioned there were two assistant managers one was a primly urbane man who managed to be both exquisitely efficient and completely unimpressive the other the mr mushmouth who had hired me was likewise an able hotel man but so turbulent and foiblefilled that he seemed to mirror the strange world he worked in essentially kindhearted he was always a little wary ready to leap down the throat of anyone who seemed to take advantage of him short and paunchy he was also very vain vain and sensitive he was ever ready to interpret a friendly smile as condescension or a helpful gesture as a jibe and hell had no fury like his when he felt himself slighted i got along very well with him probably i suppose because we were much alike he would come in at the side door at around six in the morning of his long day his shoulders hunched like a prize fighters his sleephaggard face set in a deep and watchful scowl crossing the lobby at a steady but wary gait he would pause at the end of the long marble counter where he liked to find me stationed and slowly turn sideways to it then he would remove his beautiful homburg hat and diffidently thrust it at me mrningjim he would grunt mrningsir i grunted back at him srningouside rnedallnightsir huh yuhsr at this point he would usually turn and scowl at me and i would scowl back at him but sometimes when the feeling was upon him he would continue the conversation for several minutes deliberately speaking with increasing unintelligibility and being replied to similarly until we made less than no sense at all i was the only one he would speak to until he had had his breakfast hebert poor soul insisted on crying out a cheery good morning to him but all he got in return was a hatefilled glare after breakfast the assistant manager would return to the lobby for a brief report on the nights events from hebert then he would reclaim his hat and make an outside inspection of the hotel his routine was always the same he was always the same vain sensitive quick tempered thus the raw material of pells plot against hebert there was a great deal of paper work on the night shift and hebert was supplied with a rubber stamp of his name to use on the countless invoices and charge slips which required his endorsement pell obtained an impression of the stamp on a piece of paper he had a duplicate made and brought it to work with him then the explosive and suspicious little assistant manager was in an even more terrible mood than usual that morning he barely grunted at me and he looked like he could have killed hebert for the latters insistently cheerful greeting shoulders hunched hands clenched into fists he disappeared into the coffee shop pell plucked the homburg from my fingers and went behind the keyrack i followed him immediately but he had already begun his vandalism and nothing was to be gained by interfering with him i could only stand and watch as over and over until the fine silk lining was a mess he stamped the name ej hebert in the assistant managers hat now he said you and i had better get out of here we dont want to be around when old mushmouth comes after his lid youre telling me i said we hid on the mezzanine directly above the cashiers cage where hebert was working we waited listening to the occasional thud as hebert used his stamp the assistant manager returned and they conversed briefly then seeing that neither pell nor i were around the am asked hebert to hand him his hat certainly sir said hebert and still carrying his rubber stamp he went around behind the keyrack pell and i returned to the lobby he by the front stairs me by the rear i made myself as inconspicuous as possible but pell took up a position on front post only inches away from the window where the assistant manager was waiting hebert came back with the hat carrying it tenderly crownup as he had found it he passed it through the window ankyou grunted the assistant manager starting to lift it to his head then he paused eyes popping ana said wottnell he looked up glaring terribly at hebert and an almost subhuman growl came from his throat hebert smiled nervously something wrong he said the assistant manager made no answer he simply grabbed hebert by the necktie hauled him halfway through the window and began beating him with the hat the room clerk was taken completely by surprise but he was not too dazed to see that pell had somehow inspired the assistant managers attack so he grabbed the bellboy by the collar and dragged him into the fray for every blow he received he gave one to pell and pell tangled between the two men and helpless with laughter was powerless to resist the assistant manager tried to shove him out of the way the better to get at hebert but the clerk hung onto him pell was jerked back and forth catching the blows intended for hebert as well as those intended for him and as the struggle waxed furious an ink pad flew from his pockets and a rubber stamp with it panting the assistant manager released his hold on hebert and made a grab for pell bstd he snarled flinging himself at the bellboy but fast as he was he wasnt quite fast enough the last i saw of pell he was heading for the rear landing and the assistant manager was right behind him aiming a kick at his fleeing posterior at every third step a few years ago i met one of the boys by then a man of course i formerly hopped bells with he was the owner of an automobile agency in a large southwestern city and i was also enjoying some small success naturally we fell to discussing the other boys we had known those whose later lives were familiar to us one had been killed by the fbi while resisting arrest as a suspected kidnapper one had been hopelessly crippled while attempting to blow up a safe two had committed suicide when still very young men one had overdosed himself with salvarsan bit his tongue off in a spasm of agony and drowned in his own blood not a very pretty picture but that was only part of it another boy of our acquaintance had become a renowned geologist another a doctor and another a minister two others were managers of large hotels all in all my friend said i suppose about as many of us turned out all right as didnt about the same percentage youd find in any other group thats true i nodded the percentage is the same but i dont think youll find the division within another group so drastic take a bunch of grocery clerks starting out togethei or a group of filing clerks or service station attendants some will get ahead some wont but the spread between them wont be small and gradual five of them will die violent deaths while the other five become relative big shots my friend frowned thoughtfully yknow he hesitated its kind of like it was on the job isnt it there wasnt any middle ground you were either in or you were out thats the way it looks it did you a lot of good or a lot of harm which do you think it did you well i said im here in most pursuits temptation stands on the sidelines it does not grab but beckons and once passed it is gone but it was not thus in the luxury hotel of my day temptation followed you placing herself in your path at every turn and paradoxically succumbing to her often meant a reward and resistance punishment you worked in the hotel but you worked for the guests your earnings your very job depended upon their good will so why offend a wealthy drunk by refusing to drink with him why snub a lovely and wellheeled widow when it was so easy to please her and what about these people anyway if they were all wrong these publicly acclaimed models of success and deportment then who was right there was an unhealthy tendency to acquire complete contempt for the monied and a consuming regard for money money was apt to mean far too much and people nothing living in a world of topsyturvy standards and constant temptation a boy could easily become involved in serious and longlasting trouble to survive in that world he had to be very very lucky and have a fair degree of intelligence but more than anything else he had to be able to take it to absorb the nottobeavoided abnormal without being absorbed by it or to state the matter simply he needed a strong sense of humor if he had that he was usually all right far from harming him the hotel life would do him a lot of good it was during the big conventions of business and fraternal organizations that as the saying was the men were separated from the boys they descended upon the hotel on an average of twice a month and i grew to look upon them with a kind of delighted horror they meant much money but they also meant wracked nerves and utter physical exhaustion all the incongruities and inconsistencies of hotel life were multiplied a dozen times over a day or so before a convention started the hotshots would drift into town these were the professional bellboys menwho traveled the country over and made a career of working the conventions they knew all the angles and they played them all they had to all bellboys paid a daily tax or kick to the captains for the privilege of working the convention hotshots not only paid this but they also paid for their jobs during an oil mens convention for example a fourday job sold for two hundred dollars plus a daily tax of ten dollars since selling jobs is a federal offense the question of what happened to all this money is one i consider too delicate to answer but i will say that no hotshot ever successfully appealed a bell captains decision to the management and one of the captains told me he was goddamned lucky to hang onto a third of the take the hotshots received nothing for their money but the hotels permission to go to work there was no guarantee that they would not be fired or jailed thirty minutes after they stepped on the floor there was no guarantee that they would be able to get or hold onto a uniform to work in that was their headache something to be worked out between them and the regular bellboys there were never more than twentyfive uniforms but the number of bellboys during a convention often rose to a total of forty and while the hotshots were tough the regulars were no pantywaists so every change of shift marked the beginning of a battle with as many as three boys struggling for the same uniform lockers were broken into tailor shop employees were threatened and bribed boys were tripped up and knocked down and sat on and stripped of their uniforms one did not enter the locker room unless he was prepared to do battle not all the quarrels arose over uniforms gypping on bells was the order of the day and if a guy didnt like it he knew what he could do about it those fights they were strange hideously fascinating affairs the combatantstobe would first remove their uniforms and stow them away for safekeeping then wordlessly and without preliminary the fight would start its one rule was that no blows could be struck to the face a knee in the groin was all right a kick in the instep was all right or a rupturing punch to the kidneys or a paralyzing blow to the heart but a mans face must never be marked the fighters would weave their way through the crowded locker room here passing in front of a boy who was shaving there squeezing between a pair who were fastening one anothers collars no one paid any attention to them no one tried to interfere everyone had more than enough to do to take care of himself since all the boys were above average toughness and since one rarely knew a dirty trick unknown to the other the fights usually ended in some kind of compromise a nogyp compact would be sworn to or an agreement would be arrived at whereby a uniform and a workingshift were shared often it was that way but not always inevitably some of the hotshots were driven on and some of the regulars driven out everyone had it in for everyone else no matter what he made no one was satisfied there were thousands of dollars in cash among the bellboys as the end of a convention approached and every boy knew it and wanted it not just part but all this resulted in twentyfourhouraday dice games in the locker room some of the biggest games i have ever seen and i have seen some big ones the play would go on and on with the players dropping out when they lost the dice hopping bells for an hour or so then getting back into the game as their turn came again it was an allornothing contest no man was allowed to quit winner as long as the others wanted to play if one was forced to drop out of the game his winnings were impounded with one of the captains they could be maddening things those last man takes all games with forty boys involved the odds were forty to one against your being the final victor yet i could never keep my money in my pocket where it belonged i would come down at night and lay bets while i dressed i might be cleaned out immediately but more often than not i would win five hundred a thousand fourteen or fifteen hundred but always the time came when i had to quit leaving my winnings with the captain when the end of the convention came and the final game with it i sometimes had two or three thousand dollars riding and i would envision myself as that lucky last boy a teenager retired on a modest fortune now however piker bets were disallowed you faded what the other man wanted to shoot and what he often chose to shoot was the exact amount of your winnings the others had come into the game with big bankrolls and added to them they could double up and triple up on the bets cleaning you or i should say me out in minutes and needless to say they invariably did still and all thanks to a confidential talk with allie ivers i did not do too badly in these games i never got out with my temporarily won thousands but by the process of ratholing surreptitiously palming an occasional ten or twenty i often got away with hundreds the cops on the beat were aware of these dice games and frequently came in for a few minutes to watch the play on the whole they were like most of the other cops i have known good honest fellows doing a hard and thankless job at low pay but there was an exception in the person of a cop called red a husky giant with closeset eyes who had admittedly donned a shield for what he could get out of it red was always gambling and losing then lying about the sum he had lost and grumbling that the game was crooked he was always begging for a few dollars to get back into the game the loan being repayable on a tomorrow that never arrived the boys sneered at him insulted him profanely refused to fade when he was shooting still red hung on a whining grumbling insultproof sponge i had been bellhopping for something more than a year when red tried to tap me for ten dollars i told him to go to hell more accurately i told him i wouldnt lend him the sweat from my socks if he paid me niagara falls for interest why jesus christ i protested my voice cracking with irritation whats the matter with you anyway youre a cop youre supposed to be someone how in hell can you hang around here begging money from bellboys aw come on he insisted not in the least embarrassed whats ten bucks to you youve got plenty of dough nothing doing i said youve already fourbitted me out of five or six bucks chisel someone else ill pay it back first thing tomorrow nuts i went on dressing trying to ignore him but he wouldnt give up he didnt want the money to shoot craps with he said he didnt even want it for himself he needed it for his wife and baby for some medicine and groceries wife and baby i said i didnt know you were married sure i am been married right along come on jimmie i wouldnt ask you for it if i just didnt have to have it well i hesitated ive got a family of my own to take care of if i was sure youd pay the dough back tell you what ill do he said promptly ill hock my night stick with you thats good security you know i cant get by working very long without it all right i said i think im making a mistake but i gave him the ten and locked his night stick in my locker when i came to work the following night the locker had been broken open and the club was gone i was pretty sore to put it mildly but the situation appeared to have its bright side having done this to me red would doubtless steer clear of the hotel for some time to come i was starting to change clothes consoling myself with the thought of redfree nights sans whining and begging when the lockerroom door opened and in he came he was grinning broadly the night stick was dangling from his wrist about that club he said a fellow over at the station house had an extra he wasnt usin he gave it to me i see i said so i guess ill just let you keep that other one all right i said you dont mind do you he grinned thats all right with you aint it supposing it wasnt i said yeah he chuckled supposin he went out laughing openly i went on dressing id paid ten bucks to get the horse laugh and i had to like it id been dared not to like it allie ivers had come onto the night shift with me and knew of my loan to red he was as chagrined as i when i told him how red had repaid the favor youre not going to let him get away with it are you he demanded dont tell me youre just going to grin and take it what else can i do fix the bastards clock make him wish hed never been born yeah and how am i going to do it ill think of something allie promised he did think of something and before the night was over i listened to his scheme incredulously by no means sure that he wasnt joking youre kidding i forced a laugh we cant do anything like that sure we can said allie ill get this babe i know to give him a fast play make a date with him shell give him the number of one of the rooms the hotels blocked off for the summer when he comes in here youll have to slip him upstairs of course ill but a a cop i protested my god allie to do that to a cop hes no cop wearing a uniform doesnt make a man a cop whats the matter with you anyway im trying to do you a favor well i i thought you trusted me well i i was still less than seventeen years old and seventeen is seventeen no matter what it has been through or up against moreover despite my patent hardheadedness i suffered from a deeply rooted feeling of inferiority i wanted to be liked and felt impelled to defer to those who gave me liking so i consented to allies plan two days later at about twothirty in the morning red beckoned to me furtively from the lobby side entrance i went out to the walk he pressed a tendollar bill into my hand just playing a little joke on you he said giving me an amiable nudge in the ribs okay were friends again what do you want i said he told me although of course i already knew suddenly as though it were anothers voice speaking i heard myself refusing youve got no business up there no ones got any business there those rooms are blocked off theyre too hot to stay in this time of year why they havent even got any bedding in em and the telephones are discon oh yeah he grabbed me roughly by the arm dont hand me that stuff i got plenty of drag around this town you try to crap me an ill make you hard to catch all right i said if thats the way you want it he went around to the rear entrance and i took him upstairs on the service elevator he followed me down to the hall to a small court room then dismissing me with a contemptuous nod he tapped on the door it opened and he stepped into the darkness there was a dull thud and a grunt and the door closed again i went back to the rear landing where i waited nervously for allie he arrived shortly with reds pants which he tossed down the incinerator chute he similarly disposed of the key to the room everythings fine he assured me urging me toward the elevator didnt hurt him a bit but allie i whats going to happen to him how do i know said allie cheerfully id say hed probably sweat to death if he stays in that room very long good riddance too but yes sir allie mused its quite a problem all right he cant call for help he cant use the telephone and if he did manage to get down the fire escape where would he go from there whats he going to do without ailie i said i just remembered something theyve got the water cut off in those rooms we cant leave him there in this weather without any water hes got plenty said allie i noticed there was quite a bit in the toilet bowl whatever reds sufferings were during the two days he spent in that room they could have been as nothing compared to mine i was sick with fear and worry finally on the night of the second day i insisted on putting an end to reds imprisonment allie pointed out that red could gain release from the room any time he chose to all he had to do was pound on the door until someone heard him but he cant do that how would he explain i wonder said allie he was entirely prepared to leave red in the room until thirst and heat and hunger drove him to some act of desperation but seeing that i was on the point of a nervous collapse he reluctantly gave in to me we filched the passkey from the desk and a pair of porters pants from the laundry early the next morning some two hours before the end of our shift we went up to the room the door was still locked from the outside we unlocked it cautiously looked in and went in red was gone obviously he had left by the fire escape but what he did after reaching it i do not know he may have crept down to the alley at night and hailed a cab or he may have gone up the escape to another room helped himself to the occupants clothes and then made his exit i dont know how he got away from the hotel only that he did allie and i learned that he had been fired from the force presumably for absence without leave yet the grins and winks of the other cops hinted that this was not the sole reason for his dismissal apparently and literally red had been caught without his pants as a result of this we gathered he had not only been fired but also floated out of town like a bum said allie and whats wrong with that pa my grandfather used to say that being broke wasnt so bad but going broke was pure hell watching pops decline his brief and occasional ups and his long steady downs i saw the bitter wisdom of pas philosophy having drilled four dry wells for himself pop began drilling on contract for others mortgaging his oil field equipment to get the necessary financing he did very well on the first contract and almost as well on the second but the third was a financial failure plus the drill bit struck granite a few hundred feet down and this virtually impenetrable rock forced him to take a year to drill a well which should have been completed in a month he lost all of his earlier profits and all of his drilling equipment and wound up thousands of dollars in debt our cars were sold our house and furniture mortgaged he leased a smaller rig and went into the business of pulling pipe from abandoned wells but the cycle of mild successes and whopping failures still pursued him two jobs made money the third was a breakeven the fourth put him out of business his credit ruined and more deeply in debt than ever he set himself up as a rig building contractor an enterprise which required only hand tools and labor and here at last it seemed he was on his way back up he squeezed the last possible penny from every contract he oversaw his own jobs he did hard physical labor himself but he was getting old nearing an age when active participation in an exacting business would be impractical and while he made some money on every job it was never very much with little but his time and experience to invest his income was proportionate to get into the big money you had to take turnkey contracts ie you supplied all necessary material for a job as well as the labor by so doing you profited on dozens of commodities instead of one and your overall reward was large if of course you figured correctly and nothing went wrong so pop sunk everything he had and everything he could get into a turnkey contract and his estimates were so sound that he completed it days ahead of the penalty date he sent due notice to the contractee the latter wired his congratulations he would arrive the following day to inspect and accept the job well he arrived all right but the following day there was no job to inspect the first tornado in its history had struck the area splintered to smithereens the rig was scattered over half the county with no capital and no credit pop became a dealer in leases or to use a contemporary and contemptuous term a lease louse there were thousands like him in the oil country cities middlemen of middlemen men so far removed from the principals in a deal that they frequently did not know the latters identities one would get hold of a lease on a shortterm option another would assume the job of getting it drilled on a percentage basis he had no assets of his own but he knew someone who knew someone with assets supposedly and this last person knew someone who knew someone who would do the drilling for part cash and an interest and the partcash man knew someone who knew someone who could get workmen on a cashinterest basis and but enough it was not as funny as it may sound sometimes at the end of a transaction there were a few thousands to split up between the dozens of lice rarely however was a transaction carried through to a successful culmination somewhere along the way as it moved from one broke broker to another with each snipping away a fragment it simply disappeared one of the choice jokes around fort worth concerned a louse who turned out to be a dozen other guys he put a shorttime option into the mill then knowing the ramifications through which it must proceed plunged back into the milieu of someone who knew someone after weeks of frantic effort the first deal seemed ready to bear fruit all the principals and subprincipals and subsubprincipals were to meet in his office as he waited for them his one worry was that they might not all be able to crowd into the tiny cubbyhole the time of the meeting came and went hours passed and it grew dark and still the louse remained alone finally the tragicomic truth dawned on him no one was going to show up because everyone was already there i could never laugh much over that joke since pop was the louse involved he gave up his cubbyhole and became a curbstone operator i looked him up one morning and asked him to come to breakfast with me he did so rather coolly he had been cool and formal with me for some time at first he had argued sternly against my going to work at the hotel then his affairs went from bad to worse and my earnings were necessary for the maintenance of the family pops attitude changed he no longer argued it seemed to him i suppose that i had usurped his position in the family i could not help it perhaps nor could he but the fact remained i was my own man so be it we were like polite strangers to one another rather than father and son so this morning we sat across from each other in the restaurant booth dabbling aimlessly with our food and talking in monosyllables and finally after a number of false starts i managed to broach the subject that was on my mind its about one of the guests at the hotel pop hes acted kind of funny ever since he checked in always watching me when he thought i wasnt looking and making up excuses to talk to me prying into my background well last night i took some cigarettes up to his room and he opened up with me i found out what it was all about i see pop murmured absently very interesting well i hesitated the point im getting at what i wanted to ask you was did you ever hear of a man named l l pop showed a little more interest i knew him fairly well he was on president hardings private train with me for a day and a night what became of him no one knows he was president of some corporation in kansas city he disappeared one night with more than a million and a half dollars of the companys assets cash and negotiable securities why do you pop broke off abruptly his eyes suddenly sharp with interest i nodded hes here pop its the same guy i was telling you about hes still got most of the loot and hell give it up if hes promised immunity from prosecution he trusts you more than he trusts anyone else anyway can you swing it i mean can you ccan we make the bonding company give us a cut for i was afraid hed say no he was always so straitlaced and upright about everything but he had been a lawyer and knew that such deals were made every day the proposed transaction was entirely legitimate he said and he became almost as excited over it as i was whats his room number ill call him right now and tell him hes checked out i said he moved out of the hotel as soon as hed talked to me and i dont know where he went to but we made arrangements for us to meet him tonight how much would we make on the deal pop five or ten thousand pop laughed fondly somewhat more than that he said ten percent is the usual fee for a negotiator and i imagine the bonding company would be very happy to pay it in other words if l has as much as a million and a half left we should get a hundred and fifty grand wow we talked and talked becoming really friendly for the first time in months i confessed that along with being pretty stubborn and hard to handle i had been drinking far too much that anything at all was too much for a boy my age pop confessed that his own behavior left much to be desired and declared he was turning over a new leaf things would be different with us from now on hed get into some safe but reasonably profitable branch of the oil business id quit the hotel and concentrate on school get out of high school some way and go on to college pop and i agreed that it was best to say nothing to mom about the impending deal not too worldly wise it would only worry her we ran through the arrangements for meeting that night making sure we had them right then since it was far too late for me to go to school i went on home mom was pretty cranky with me unlike pop she did not feel that my financial contributions to the family exempted me from parental dominion she wanted to know why i hadnt gone to school instead of loafing around town and she obviously did not care at all for the evasive answers i gave her she scolded and fussed until at last there was nothing left to say and she was as weary as i i went to bed then telling her to call me at seven as i wished to see a show before going to work i was supposed to meet l at eightthirty on the bridge over the north trinity river he would pick me up in a car providing i was alone and he deemed it safe and we would drive on into the packingtown section of fort worth at ninethirty still providing that l was given no cause for alarm we would pick pop up in an isolated area they would then exchange commitments as attorney and client and the details of the transaction would be worked out well mom did not call me at seven but at nine she said that if i was too tired to go to school i was too tired to go to shows it was ten oclock before i got to the bridge an hour and a half late for my appointment with the suspicious badly frightened l it was too late of course i waited for him until it was almost one making myself seriously late for work but he never showed up where he went or what became of him i do not know i was sick with disappointment and the blow was a crushing one for pop as for mom well what was the use in telling her the truth that the two hours of sleep she had forced on me had cost more than one thousand dollars a minute on week days i went from work to school and remained in class until threethirty in the afternoon it was usually five or six oclock before i could get to bed and i had to rise at ninethirty in order to be at work on time obviously i did not get much sleep daytime sleep is apt to be an uneasy thing achieved in spats and spurts which leave one wakeful but unrested frequently during the dazzlingly hot texas summer i went whole days with no sleep at all being of very hardy stock i seemed little affected by my rigorous nearsleepless life for more than two years but it was telling on me i had acquired a persistent and annoying cough my appetite was almost nonexistent i was drinking more and more so much that i was buying pints and quarts instead of depending on free drinks from guests also although the fact was hard to detect on one with my wiry build i was losing weight steadily as i passed my eighteenth birthday and entered my third year at the hotel the hitherto concealed signs of illness began to break through to the surface i was suddenly gaunt instead of merely thin i had brief but frightening spasms of nervous trembling my cough had a hollow echoing sound i was filled with morbid selfdoubts and no amount of whiskey would completely dispel them mom and pop begged me to quit the job in our circumstances the suggestion seemed maddeningly foolish and i refused to discuss it because i was supposed to be a fairly good boy the nominally hardboiled management tried to give me a hand the word filtered down from somewhere that i should not be fined or disciplined except on higher authority and i should not be held over except in extreme emergencies moreovei if i chose to sleep an hour or so at night in one of the checkedout rooms no one was to take notice of it and whatever i wanted to eat within reason was to be provided at no charge by the coffee shop chefs i appreciated these favors both for their intrinsic value and for the good will they reflected but i enjoyed them no more than a week or two before i was forced to call a halt they made the other boys too resentful a man may survive with the disesteem of his employers but let him be generally disliked by his fellowworkers and he is through my friend the assistant manager he of the sensitive soul and the terrible temper had shown increasing concern for my obvious illness he always lingered for a few moments after handing me his hat mumbling diffident inquiries as to how i was getting along and grumbling suggestions to take it easy better get off of bells he suggested one morning try you on something else and try me he did in succession i worked as assistant night auditor valet food checker telephone operator elevator operator steam presser and assistant maitre dhotel but in the end i came back to bellhopping i believe that the challenge of so many jobs was good for me and i certainly acquired much valuable experience but i was not improved healthwise and i could not afford the financial loss which the other positions put me to they paid well enough i suppose but the amounts seemed niggardly compared with my bellboy earnings so half regretfully i returned to my original job i dragged through the months obsessed with a weird feeling that i was slowly falling apart and though i felt pretty hopeless about it i attended school faithfully this was my last chance i knew the last year i would be going to school either i got out now with proper scholastic credit or i never would my six years of misery and frustration there would be wasted spring came and suddenly i felt better than i ever had i was eating and sleeping less than ever coughing harder and drinking more but still i felt wonderful nothing seemed to bother me i was never tired my mind had never been sharper i was brimming over with good feeling always smiling always ready to burst into laughter at the smallest joke my extensive reading had not carried me into the fields of psychiatry and morbid psychology hence i accepted my feeling of wellbeing at its face value instead of as the euphrasy the false elation which precedes collapse persons far advanced in alcoholism know that feeling so do tuberculosis patients and those suffering from severe nervous complaints it is natures way of preparing the afflicted for the ordeal of breakdown being triply prepared for reasons you may probably guess i felt triply good on friday afternoon of the nexttothelast week of school i paused at the doorway of a study hall called gaily to the girl inside then moved by a sudden hunch went in and joined her how you doing gladys i said keeping you in after school are they nno she tittered shyly everyones so busy getting ready for graduation that they asked me to help with this stuff she was a bashful dowdy girl one of those helplessly homely drudges who knew everything in the books and little outside of them and who would go through life in some minor illrewarded capacity i had known her in several classes during my periods of selfpromotion and while i was a different type of outcast i sympathized with and felt sorry for her because she was shy and obliging she was constantly being imposed on the school employees were always dragging her in on jobs which they were paid to do making out report cards huh i said like to have me read the record cards off to you you can go a lot faster that way weel she tittered again if youre sure you want to theres nothing i want to do more i said truthfully and dragging a chair up to the desk i sat down at her side i took charge of the record file and began calling the names and grades off to her coming to my card i made myself a senior and gave myself passing grades in every subject she looked up a faint frown on her face i uh i didnt know that yes i said nothing i mean i was just going to say how funny it is that people can be in the same grade and have different teachers for every subject well i shrugged its a big school incidentally some of these record cards are pretty badly worn i think wed better make out some new ones i pulled a dozen odd cards from the file sliding my own in among them somewhat troubled she began making out new cards from the information i gave her i called out my name i called out the class senior second semester i started calling off credit hours slowly she laid down her pen and looked up again jjames you cant youre not going to graduate are you the diploma list is already made out and i ddont believe i saw your name on no i said im not going to graduate gladys b but i dont have enough credit hours to graduate i said just enough for college entrance yyes but that isnt much is it ive gone to school here for six years ive made some of the highest grades ever made by a senior but i still cant graduate all i have is enough credits to go to college if i ever have the chance to go does that seem like a lot to you do you think its too much gladys she looked at me steadily then slowly she shook her head no she said i dont think its too much and she picked up the pen again a new card went into the file one of more than a dozen it gave me fourteen and a half credit hours one and a half short of the number necessary to graduate i took all the old cards with me tearing them up on the way home thus i finished high school just before figuratively speaking i was finished i hadnt been home an hour when the good feeling rushed from me like water rushing down a drain then after a long moment of absolute emptiness my heart stuttered and raced beating faster and faster until one beat overlapped the other blood gushed from my mouth and i fell to the floor in convulsions doctors came although i was unaware of their presence they administered to me wonderingly i was eighteen years old and i had a complete nervous collapse pulmonary tuberculosis and delirium tremens from a purely medical standpoint i should have died in fact i should have been dead long before i seemed to be completely drained of physical resistance well over six feet tall i weighed less than a hundred and ten pounds and a good part of that weight in the doctors estimation appeared to be scar tissue my kidneys were bruised my ribs floated my skull had been fractured in three places i had an incipient rupture my shoulders were sprained so that the arms did not articulate properly in their sockets my knuckles had been knocked down my fingers broken nothing about me was as it should be physically speaking as the doctors saw it i had nothing with which to battle the diseases from which i was suffering fortunately for me i come from very rugged stock on both sides of the family my ancestors were a tough stubborn people migrating from england to ireland to holland and thence to america they drifted westward from pennsylvania after the revolution against king george and the farther west they went the tougher and more stubborn they seemed to get they regarded illness and injury as annoyances and succumbing to them weakness many had died violent deaths few of any infirmity but old age so while i was bedfast for several months i lived because the willtolive was bred into me because i was too stubborn to die my illness and the financial crisis it precipitated was not without its bright side it forced us to do things which we should have done long before we gave up our home and its furnishings and moved into a rented house in a workingclass neighborhood thus we were simultaneously freed of oppressive interest payments and the necessity of maintaining face among people who had known us when we could live on half the amount we had formerly spent we were free forever from our most avaricious and persistent creditors pop worried less and was able to move about more freely he made several fast lease deals which though small were enough to keep us going after a convalescence of some four months i was able to be up and about taking care of myself instead of being taken care of but i was still very weak and thin and the doctors were not at all pleased with the state of my lungs i would never recover in their opinion in the low damp climate of fort worth i belonged in a high and dry altitude and the quicker i got to it the better so early one morning i stood at the edge of the highway on the outskirts of fort worth one arm supporting an upstretched thumb the other clutching a small bundle there was a change of clothing in it toothbrush and razor a nickel tablet and pencils that was about all a car stopped the driver swung the door open and i climbed in where you going kid west i said how far a long ways i dont know exactly lookin for work what kinda line you in im a writer i said and somehow my voice rose im a writer sure now he said amiably sure you are we sped down the highway and the sun rose behind us warm friendly gentle silvering the long asphalt ribbon to the west i spent more than three years in west and far west texas a bum and casual laborer at first an itinerant but solvent worker later in the beginning i thought it one of the most desolate areas of the world populated by the worlds most arrogant and highhanded people only harsh necessity kept me there as time went on however i came to love the vast stretches of prairie rolling emptily toward the horizon there was peace in the loneliness calm and reassurance in this virgin vastness virtually unchanged by the assaults of a hundred million years troubles seemed to shrink and hope loomed large everything would go on one knew and man would go on with it disappointment and difficulty were only way stops on the road to a happy destination as for the west texans i became every bit as fond of them as i was of the land they lived in they were not quite so much arrogant i found as plainspoken their first sayso on a subject was also their last one they said what they meant whether painful or pleasant and they meant what they said no snub was implied by silence it meant only that the west texan concerned had nothing to say one day a few weeks after leaving fort worth i went into a store in the then village of big springs to buy a work shirt the proprietor tossed one on the counter the price he said was two dollars and fifty cents what i exclaimed twofifty for just a plain blue work shirt you want it he asked well no i cant pay reckon were kind of wastin time then he said casually and he tossed the shirt back on the shelf redfaced my ears burning i turned and walked away i had reached the door when he called to me still in that casually indifferent tone i hesitated then i turned around and went back what price shirt was you lookin for bub he said somethin about a dollar about that i nodded but think i got one left yeah here it is he took it off the shelf the twofifty shirt and began wrapping it up how about some pants he said that pair you got on is just about the most raggedassed i ever seen i laughed unwillingly i guess not theyre pretty bad all right but call it a dollar for the shirt and pants he said what size you wear bub he wrapped the two garments tossed them to me and raised his hand in an indifferent salute i thanked him telling him i would be in to pay what i owed as soon as i could glad to see you bub he nodded dont owe me nothin though but the shirt alone was it and the pants was one buck i set my own prices bub dont need no one to help me well i i see i said so long he said and without another word he slouched back to the rear of the store thus your typical west texan a man who might give you a mile but who would not give in to you an inch they seldom smiled those west texans and i dont recall ever hearing one laugh yet they had a wonderful sense of humor their wit was of a dry backhanded sort based on antiexaggeration and understatement delightful once you understood it baffling and even a little terrifying to an outsider one of my earlier positions was as a sweater in an oil field gambling house a sweater as you may know is one grade above a bum a person tolerated by the management for making himself useful to the customers he is allowed to sleep on the dice tables at night now and then when he hustles a round of drinks or sandwiches the players toss him a chip the job is obviously a precarious one and the man who holds it is usually the possessor of a large thirst hence he is in a more or less constant state of anxiety figuratively and often literally he sweats this place was about twenty miles out of the county seat of big springs and late one night it was raided by a party of deputy sheriffs players and house employees resisted furiously the lights were shot out and bullets bludgeons and bottles crashed and thudded in the darkness unable to see who was whom everyone began an indiscriminate slugging of everyone else i crawled behind the bar and eventually made my way out to the roof and down to the ground here i was grabbed by an old rancher who was loading his ancient touring car with casualties from the brawl give me a hand with these fellas slim boy he said gotta get em in town to a doctor i demurred at first feeling more than a little shaky but the rancher had thoughtfully borried a quantity of potables from the bai and being liberally refreshed with these i soon fell to with a will we piled the combatants into the car my companion merrily insisting that there was always room for one more and roared off toward town the road was a former cowpath now deeply rutted by trucks and filled with sinkholes and washouts as the car bounced and sailed into the air landing with bonebreaking violence groans arose from our cargo the rancher frowned with annoyance he increased his speed and the groans increased they became yells shrieks curses some of the awfullest profanity i have ever heard filled the night grimly my friend emptied the bottle he had been drinking from and handed it to me bunch o dirty mouths he scowled give em what for slim boy make em quiet down oh i dont think id better i said after all theyre hurt fellas that yells that loud aint hurt much give em somethin to fuss about but theyre cops deputy sheriffs theyll huh he slammed on the brakes i thought they was sportin fellas grumbling angrily he took a shotgun from the floor boards of the car and climbed out sternly he ordered the thoroughly revived deputies to unload they did so he lined them up in front of the headlights of the car examined them briefly and declared them physically fit danged ornery coyotes he said bitterly buttin in on a nice friendly game takin advantage of a pore ol man what cant see good ill learn you by gadfrey you want to get to town start walkin it was ten miles into town a greater distance perhaps than many of the saddleborn bootshod deputies had walked in their entire lives moreover as one of them pointed out it was almost impossible to see where one was walking hadnt ought to do this to us jeb he protested a dark night like this a fellas liable to step spang onto a rattlesnake dont give a dang if you do the rancher retorted never liked rattlesnakes nohow we left them there on the prairie and drove back for a load of gamblers more than three hours later we passed the deputies as they limped into the outskirts of big springs fearing repercussions i was not very conspicuous around the gambling hall for the ensuing week but my trepidation seemed unwarranted the deputies dropped in for drinks and a hand of cards amiably admitting their error in raiding the place just plumb bit off moren we could chew they said didnt have no idee theyd be so many o you fellas around their attitude was generally that they had perpetrated a joke which had backfired on them and exactly two weeks from the date of the first raid they raided the place again one man was killed in attempting to escape two others were critically wounded then with the remaining habitues under arrest the deputies took axes and chopped the gambling hall into kindling all this quite casually as politely as circumstances would permit they had taken the joke that was played on them now they were returning it fortunately i had stopped sweating the night before and was not among those present my new job was with a salvage contractor a man who bought abandoned derricks and dismantled them for their lumber it was quite a profitable business lumber being a highpriced commodity in the plains areas and he paid his employees well but none of them worked for him very long those who did not have the good sense to quit when they saw what was required of them inevitably fell victim to the laws of gravity i was put next to the job by a character named strawlegs a onetime banjo player and an alltime dipsomaniac he brushed over the nature of the work lightly emphasizing only the money to be made but even had i known nothing of the oil fields and i knew quite a bit i would have known that the job was dangerous youre dead wrong strawlegs insisted and ill prove it to you grab ahold of that porch roof there thats right pull your feet up now youre all right arent you you can do it cant you but im only a few inches off the ground whats the difference as long as you dont let go it wouldnt be any harder if you were a few feet up or a hundred and ten i suggested sardonically well i took the job needing money badly and strawlegs who was then the contractors only other employee received fifty dollars for recruiting me my survival during the subsequent several weeks can only be credited to a miracle we would climb to the top of a derrick lugging tools and ropes with us then perched more than a hundred feet in the air we would weave ropes through the crown block and swing off into space the ropes could not be tied around us of course they were wrapped around our waists in a halfhitch which we snubbed with our feet we would swing down to the first crosspieces get a lowering rope around them and knock and pry them loose at one end then we would swing over to the other end hang on with one hand and knock and pry with the other eventually lowering the lumber to the ground there are four sides to a derrick of course strawlegs and i each took two always careful to work opposite each other in this way neither side became weaker than the others and the great tower did not immediately react to the loss of its bracing it was not until you were about a third of the way down a mere eighty feet or so above the sagebrush and cactus that weird and frightening things began to happen the giant legs of the derrick would start shivering first one then another until they were all shivering in unison then with ominous gentleness one side would lean forward and the other backward swinging you in through the tower or swaying you out of it and just when you were sure that it was going to topple carrying you with it it would straighten again and lean over another way when it wasnt shivering it was leaning and when it wasnt leaning it was dancing shimmying in a crazy catercornered way finally as you neared the bottom it was doing all three there was virtually nothing to hold the huge beams in place and they showed their freedom with such a wild swaying and pitching that it was all one could do to hold on usually we did not take out the last crosspieces as the contractor put it there was no use in taking chances we slid down past them scurried out of the tower and cut the guy wires on one side then we ran and the tall timber skeleton collapsed with an earthshaking crash because the work was always a long ways from town strawlegs and i usually lived on the job setting up batch in the inevitable tool shed now and then however we had to or felt we had to go into big springs and on one such occasion we got involved in a donnybrook i cant say how it started and i doubt that any of the other participants could it was just one of those things that happen when too many men get too much to drink anyway strawlegs got a fractured skull out of it and had to be taken to a hospital and i got knocked through a plateglass window a party of deputies began collaring the miscreants one of them laid hands on me and hustled me toward his car but i havent done anything i said not too truthfully you think i like getting knocked through windows shoulda aimed yourself better he said ought to been ziggin when you was zaggin thats not very damned funny i said i get and thats a fact he nodded soberly you wanta move or you want me to move you i was fined eighteen dollars for disturbing the peace then much to my amazement i was given three days to pay up and released without bond i passed the deputy on the way out of the courthouse see you soon he said sure youll see me all right i said ill see you he said and thats a fact the derrick we were working on was forty miles from town it had been erected more than ten years before and the trail to it was so overgrown and eroded that it was practically impossible to see let alone traverse even the contractor had lost his way several times and wound up in another county it was springbreaking lowgear going for a stout truck i was sure that the deputy would never find the trail nor get to the end of it if he did find it the morning of the fourth day arrived the contractor was off scouting another job strawlegs was still in the hospital i was up in the derrick rigging the ropes and removing shivs from the crown block when a car came over the horizon it was listing to one side steam pluming from the radiator and it clattered deafeningly it stopped fifty yards or so away and the deputy got out he waved to me then sauntered up to the derrick floor teetering in his highheeled boots howdy he called upward and waited dropped around to see your buddy yesterday said to tell you he was feeling fine i stared down at him finally i found my voice have a nice ride tolable left town last night well here i am i said come on and get me aint in no hurry just as soon rest a spell why dont you shoot me i said im a pretty desperate criminal aint got no gun he grinned up at me lazily never seen much sense in shooting and thats a fact he stretched out on the derrick floor and put his hands under his head he closed his eyes i sat on a crosspiece for a while smoking then i climbed up to the top of the rig and took the hatchet from my belt i chopped at the edge of the crown block sending down a shower of greasesoaked splinters he brushed them off lazily pulling his hat over his face i chopped out a small piece of the block catching it in my hand before it could fall i took careful aim and let go it struck near the side of his head bounced into the air and landed between his folded hands he sat up he looked up at me then looked at the piece of wood he took out his pocketknife and began to whittle there is always a wind in west texas it blows relentlessly straight off the north pole in winter straight out of hell in summer it was summer now early summer the wind rolled through the derrick at a baking dehydrating one hundred and twenty degrees there was no protection from it i had no water by noon i was getting dizzy and my throat felt like it had been blistered the deputy stood up looked around and sauntered into the tool shed some fifteen minutes later he came out wiping his mouth with the back of his hand like to have some chow he called a little water you kidding i croaked ill find a pail you can pull it up on the rope he started for the tool shed again in spite of myself i laughed let it go i said im coming down he was a goodlooking guy his hair was coalblack beneath his pushedback stetson and his black intelligent eyes were set wide apart in a tanned finefeatured face he grinned at me as i dropped down in front of him on the derrick floor now that wasnt very smart he said and thats and thats a fact i snapped all right lets get going he went on grinning at me in fact his grin broadened a little but it was fixed humorless and a veil seemed to drop over his eyes what makes you so sure he said softly youre going anywhere well i i gulped i i awful lonesome out here aint it aint another soul for miles around but you and me llook i said im i wasnt trying to lived here all my life he went on softly everyone knows me no one knows you and were all alone what do you make o that a smart fella like you youve been around youre all full of piss and high spirits what do you think an ol stupid country boy might do in a case like this he stared at me steadily the grin baring his teeth i stood paralyzed and wordless a great cold lump forming in my stomach the wind whined and moaned through the derrick he spoke again as though in answer to a point i had raised dont need one he said aint nothin you can do with a gun that you cant do a better way dont see nothin around here id need a gun for he shifted his feet slightly the muscles in his shoulders bunched he took a pair of black kid gloves from his pocket and drew them on slowly he smacked his fist into the palm of his other hand ill tell you something he said tell you a couple of things there aint no way of telling what a man is by looking at him there aint no way of knowing what hell do if he has the chance you think maybe you can remember that i couldnt speak but i managed a nod his grin and his eyes went back to normal look kind of peaked he said whynt you have somethin to eat an drink before we leave i paid my fine i also paid for a bench warrant the deputys per diem for two days and his mileage and you can be sure that i made no fuss about it i never saw that deputy again but i couldnt get him out of my mind and the longer he remained there the bigger riddle he presented had he been bluffing had he only meant to throw a good scare into a brash kid or was it the other way the way i was sure it was at the time had my meekness saved me from the murder with which he had threatened me suppose i had hit him with that block of wood suppose i had razzed him a little more suppose i had been frightened into grabbing for my hatchet i tried to get him down on paper to put him into a story but while he was very real to me i could not make him seem real rather he was too commonplace and innocuous nothing more than another smalltown deputy put down on paper he was only solemnly irritated not murderous the riddle of course lay not so much in him as me i tended to see things in black and white with no intermediate shadings i was too prone to categorize naturally using myself as the norm the deputy had behaved first one way then another then the first again and in my ignorance i saw this as complexity instead of simplicity he had gone as far as his background and breeding would allow to be amiable i hadnt responded to it so he had taken another tack it was simple once i saw things through his eyes instead of my own i didnt know whether he would have killed me because he didnt know himself finally as i matured i was able to recreate him on paper the sardonic likeable murderer of my fourth novel the killer inside me but i was a long time in doing it almost thirty years and i still havent got him out of my mind while the derrick dismantling was dangerous it was not particularly arduous as oil field jobs went the contractor didnt hurry us there was a chance to rest between jobs we worked a few days and laid off a few a situation perfectly suited to a man who was not in the best of health so though i swore to quit daily i stayed on for weeks strawlegs and i were fairly wellheeled when winter came on and we were forced to quit because jobs generally had to be scrounged for in the oil fields and transportation service was nonexistent we bought an old modelt touring car we oddjobbed through the boom towns of chalk and foursands then settled down temporarily on a pipeline job between midland and big springs the pay was fair fourfifty a day less a dollar deducted for slop and flop the bosses were hard men but they were not slave drivers still i soon had more of the job than i could take and so had strawlegs neither of us was physically capable of swinging a shovel and pick for nine hours a day seven days a week winter was with us however we had very little money and no other prospects for work the only thing to do seemingly was to stay here without working so after many inquiries and a careful study of camp routine we did that the bosses assumed naturally that everyone in camp was working it followed then that everyone would have earnings from which the dollaraday could be deducted and no headcount was made at meal times thus to eat and sleep free it was only necessary to keep out of sight during working hours immediately after breakfast strawlegs and i slipped off into the underbrush remaining there until lunch time after lunch we disappeared again and returned for supper and the night strawlegs was welleducated and had traveled widely and well before booze got the best of him we both shared a deep interest in the nominally inconsequential and could spend hours discussing the stamen of a sage bloom or the antics of an ant there were four hundred men in the camp drifters bums jailbirds fugitives from justice of necessity such camps were always isolated and they moved in and out of counties as the work progressed it was impossible for the local authorities to police them so the camp bosses did the job sometimes they were deputized sometimes not in any case they dispensed a pretty fair brand of justice gamblers and bootleggers followed the job traveling in cars and setting up their own tents on the outskirts of camp they were allowed to operate freely as long as they did it at night and behaved themselves the bootleggers product had to be good and his prices reasonable the consistently lucky gambler was quickly spotted and eliminated more than once i have seen a boss step up to a crap or blackjack table and order the proprietor to pack and get there would be no explanation beyond possibly youve got enough or knock off while youre able to and i never knew of but one gambler to object the words were hardly out of his mouth before a fist landed on it and a boot landed under his table scattering chips cards and cash to the wind one night two whores drifted into camp and were promptly ordered to leave the bosses were somewhat more explanatory about this edict than others since ladies were involved they pointed out that the men were generally a rough and ready lot who would certainly look upon the women as fair and free game the two would get nothing for their trouble but exercise and much more of that than they wanted well the women left but sullenly and late that night they slipped back into camp the forty men in the first of the ten tents took charge of them they got no farther and they almost didnt get out of it alive as their wild shrieks ripped through the night the strokes leaped cursing from their cots they jerked on their boots snatched up pick handles and advanced on number one tent on the run but there were only ten of them and many of the men in adjoining tents sided with the occupants of the first one the onslaught of the bosses was met with clubs knives cot legs and razors as fast as one workman went down his head split open by a whizzing pick handle two more sprang forward to take his place but the pipeliners didnt have to win and the strokes did have to otherwise they were through in the oil fields so finally they formed a ring around the mauled and hysterical women and fought their way out of camp the camp set an abundant table in the hundredyardlong dining tent there were usually three kinds of meat even at breakfast in addition to meat the average lunch and dinner included a halfdozen vegetables cornbread biscuits and light bread coffee and milk pie cake and fruit but preparing twelve hundred huge meals a day under primitive conditions was something to test a saint and pipeline cooks were very far from sainthood thus despite good raw materials the end product was not always good and despite the variety and abundance one did not always get what he wanted or as much as he wanted it was hard to get a dish passed when it was passed it was likely to be emptied before it got to the man who requested it so the moment they sat down at the table the men started grabbing meat potatoes and cake whatever was nearest them and fearful that they might get nothing more they dumped the contents of the bowl or platter onto their own plates one man would have eight or nine pounds of meat in front of him another a gallon of potatoes another a whole cake and so on the flunkies rushed more food to the table refills of the original dishes but these likewise were apt to proceed no farther than the men who grabbed them they would simply throw away the remainder of the uneaten cake meat or potatoes and empty the second dish onto their plates inevitably much more food went under the table than into the mens stomachs the bosses did what they could to correct the situation but they were never completely successful the cooks invariably harddrinking shorttempered men grew murderous they botched food deliberately they threw dirt into it sometimes they did worse one night we were served great platters of golden brown breaded pork chops there were so many of them that even the greediest men could see that there was plenty for all and every man was able to fill his plate then they cut into the chops and the meat almost dripped with blood it hadnt been cooked only browned lightly on the side outraged and profane yells rose from the table snatching up handfuls of the bloody pork the men rushed toward the rear of the tent where the meals were prepared the cooks stopped their charge temporarily with hurled kettles of boiling food then before their wouldbe murderers could fully recover the culinary staff fled the tent as one man scampering across the prairie in their white uniforms and caps like so many overstuffed outsize jackrabbits i imagine that they were later picked up and driven into town by some of the bosses at any rate they did not return to camp and a new batch of cooks was brought in in time to cook the morning meal by working as a team at the table strawlegs and i fared uncommonly well and the abundance of food combined with the long days of rest did wonders for us we moved on when the job ended in midwinter very nearly broke but in better health than we had enjoyed for a long time we went back to foursands there was no work there so after a few days we went to the town of midland we found no work here either not enough to support us finally much against our better judgment we sold a third interest in the car to a man named bragg i learned two very valuable things from this transaction first that when things get so bad they are about to get better second that no bargain is better than a bad one the day after the deal was made we got work on a highline job but bragg would not allow us to buy him out we were stuck with him and if there was ever an undesirable partner to have in anything he was it he was a giant of a man more than six feet six inches tall more than two hundred and fifty pounds of almost solid muscle and every ounce and inch of him was packed with unadulterated meanness bragg publicly addressed us as turds and turdheads he would talk about revolting subjects at mealtimes making us sick to our stomachs he was forever knocking us breathless with slaps on the back or bumping into us in such a way as to send us sprawling then he would insist on shaking hands crushing our fingers until we were forced to grovel i remarked a few pages back that no one is wholly bad but if bragg had a single redeeming feature i dont know what it was the nicest thing i can say about him is that he was a nogood doubledyed rotten sonofabitch we had to live on the job sleeping and cooking out when the weather permitted shackingup in the nearest tool house when it did not bragg bedded down on the cushions of the car and covered himself with the side curtains strawlegs and i had to make do with our blankets bragg ate twothirds of the food or more he paid for a third or less and sometimes he would pay for nothing it was always our fault whenever anything went wrong with the car bragg would neither pay for repairs nor let them go unmade about the only work strawlegs and i could do was with the pick and shovel digging the holes for the highline towers bragg however was skilled at several kinds of the work involved he worked steadily two days to our one while we were often too hard up to buy cigarettes he saved money hand over fist he would take the car with him on days when we were not working returning at nightfall like as not with a broken spring or a blownout tire which of course he blamed on us braggs idea of a hilarious joke was to leave us out on the prairie all day dozens of miles from town without food or water knowing of nothing else to do strawlegs and i stayed on hopefully at first thinking that things might improve then out of pure stubbornness obviously bragg wanted us to give up and move on leaving him in possession of the car so though it was a losing proposition for us we stayed when the highline job ended in the spring we suggested selling the car and dividing the proceeds bragg flatly refused he was going on to the town of rankin he said to an impending pipeline job we could do as we pleased but he was going in the car necessarily taking our twothirds with his third strawlegs and i decided to go to rankin it lay seventy miles to the west and there was not a filling station nor house throughout the distance the road was a rutted red clay trail stretching through a dry sparsely grassed desert we had two blowouts in the first ten miles by nightfall we were only halfway to our destination we had to stop then since we could not proceed fast enough for the magnetopowered lights to function pitching camp at the side of the trail strawlegs and i were allowed a little bread and bologna and water bragg took charge of the rest when morning came he finished what remained of the food and water and ensconced himself comfortably in the back seat with his feet in our necks and nothing in our stomach we continued on our way we didnt continue far before the radiator began to boil and cursing us for the lack of water bragg ordered a stop we let the engine cool a while and drove on again a few more miles and the overheated motor again forced us to stop bragg got out of the car and hauled us out perching himself precariously on the front spring he unscrewed the cap of the radiator and urinated in it he stepped down grimly advising us to emulate his example we did insofar as we were able to but we had had very little water and the drying wind had taken most of that from us for all braggs cursings and poundings on the back we could not produce something we did not have we drove another ten miles perhaps before the redhot engine again forced a halt and this time there was another difficulty which called for water our joltings and the climate had loosened the spokes of the right rear wheel unless they were soaked and allowed to swell the wheel would soon fall apart bragg cursed us until his throat was hoarse he grabbed us by the neck and bumped our heads together smart bastards he grunted just look what you went and done whatcha going to do now you can have my share in the wreck i said for it would cost far more to repair now than it was worth im going to walk on into town that goes for me too said strawlegs oh no you dont snapped bragg you aint givin me your share not now anyways and you aint goin off to town after water were goin to carry it in me and you turds and youre damned well goin to carry your share carry it we stared at him incredulously carry the it carry the car grab onto it well we carried it the right side of it that is with strawlegs and i at the front wheel elevating the heavier section and bragg at the rear we lugged the car the ten miles into town strawlegs and i were more dead than alive when we got there but with bragg prodding and threatening us we managed to get the old ford into a junk yard the proprietor gave us ten dollars for it distributing the money himself so that strawlegs and i got our share this was not braggs idea of a fair way to divide things but there was not much he could do about it there were hundreds of pipeliners in town men we had known from the last job he could not get tough with us without becoming painfully involved with them moreover i think he saw that he had pushed us just about as far as he could and that he would either have to kill or be killed if he didnt leave us alone so he parted from us with many curses and threats and we never saw him again neither in town or out of it the pipeline job was not nearly so imminent as it had been rumored to be and i imagine he decided not to wait for it with no work immediately available in rankin strawlegs and i caught a ride to mccamey an orchestra was winding up its engagement in the town and strawlegs had known the leader in better days the latter offered him a job as a banjo player and at my urging he took it it meant the parting of the ways for us of course but that parting was not too far off at best certainly i did not intend to tramp through the oil fields any longer than i had to strawlegs was a very good banjo player as if you have guessed his right name you know he was also a very good little guy on the last night of the orchestras engagement in mccamey he met me outside the dance hall and pressed his earnings to date upon me youll need this before you find work he insisted anyway youve got it coming to you he then revealed that he had gotten fifty dollars from the derricksalvaging contractor for recruiting me so seeing him consciencestricken over the deed and greatly concerned for my welfare i took the money and we said goodbye the hiring office for the projected pipeline was at rankin but construction of the line was to begin near the town of iran extending from there to the gulf of mexico i went there finding no work in mccamey and a hundred men for every job in rankin iran was far far west texas a handful of false front buildings and a few dozen people dropped down in the middle of nowhere the town had once been the center of a shallow oil field but now there was almost no drilling activity it existed largely as a stop on the stage lines west and as a trading post for ranchers obviously the residents had little for themselves but what little they had they shared they were a more sharply drawn version an emphasized extension of their brethren west texans i was so touched by their kindness and reluctant to impose upon it that i stayed outside of town as much as possible with a few cans of food coffee flour and salt pork i jungled up on a table rock overlooking the pecos river cooking in a lard can sleeping with my back to a low fire i was safe there from the rattlesnakes and other poisonous creatures which infested the area now and then at night i had brief spells of delirium tremens a recurrent form which sometimes afflicts a person long after he has stopped drinking but they were never severe almost as soon as i started yelling the illusion of things crawling over me vanished i wrote a great deal during the days vignettes sketches of people i had met most of what i wrote i tore up i passed the days writing thinking swimming in the river eating and sleeping so the long summer waned and fall came construction on the pipeline began i was given the job of guarding it at night i dont know why there was nothing about me that would have intimidated the most timid malefactor and i had never fired a gun in my life a few years ago before i began to fight back at booze instead of merely fighting it i was a patient in a west coast sanitarium for alcoholics i had become a habitue of such places as had many of my fellow patients by way of whiling away the time we took turns at relating the horrific adventures which alcohol had gotten us into one man an actor had inadvertently crawled into the pullman berth occupied by a heavyweight fighter and his wife a reporter had bedded down in a garbage wagon and was dumped into a penful of hungry hogs a writer gripped by a fit of vomiting had become lodged head and shoulders in a toilet seat and had to be extricated with crowbars one of the best or at least the funniest stories was told by a hollywood director a sadeyed little man who was given to spells of extreme melancholia for years when he reached a certain stage of saturation he would telephone the newspapers and announce that he was about to commit suicide he really meant to when he made the calls but by the time the reporters arrived he was always out of the notion the reporters and photographers became very irritated with him the least he could do they declared was to scratch himself up a little or take a few too many sleeping pills or do something they could make a story out of but the director adamantly resisted their pleadings and cursings and jeerings scratch himself horrors he might get an infection sleeping pills never they gave him a stomachache now the local reporters always had more than their fill of hollywood characters and this guy seemed to be a little too much to bear they couldnt ignore him he was an important man and there was always the chance that he might decide to go through or partly through with his threat every newspaper man in town was burned up with him along toward the last the desk men were conversing with him somewhat as follows now bob youve disappointed us very badly im afraid we cant believe you any more unless you give us at least a little evidence of good faith i will the director would sob honestly i will i know i havent done the right thing by you boys but im going to make up for it now well the editor would hesitate fretfully ill give you one more chance to make good the director summoned them late one night deciding as usual after they arrived that neither death nor its approaches seemed attractive but before the first trembling syllables passed his lips the reporters grabbed him cackling with insane glee they begged him not to hang himself dont do it old friend please dont hang yourself they shouted and they removed the cord from his robe and knotted it about his neck the reporters stood him up on the end of the bed and tied the cord to the chandelier they jerked the bed from beneath him the chandelier came loose from its moorings the director landed on the floor and it landed on top of him stunned as he was he retained enough sense to scramble under the bed and stay there of course they didnt intend to actually hang me he explained relating the story but they did want me strung up long enough to get a picture and ill bet those heartless coldblooded bastards would have torn down every chandelier in the house to get one the newspaper men spent some time in trying to drag him from beneath the bed but seeing that he remained obdurate and elusive and in view of the fact that they had accomplished their purpose of teaching him a lesson they finally left the director emerged into the open he wasnt really hurt but in his dazed and drunken condition he saw himself at deaths door he telephoned for an ambulance the vehicle arrived and he was loaded in it sped away again eventually coming to a long hill about halfway up the incline the back doors flew open and the director flew out he shot down the hill on the wheeled stretcher by the time he neared the bottom he was traveling at a really awesome speed the stretcher swerved suddenly and leaped the ditch it crashed through a barbed wire fence ploughed through a fruit orchard and came to rest finally more than a hundred yards from the highway the director got the straps unloosened and staggered back to the road his pajamas in tatters and much of his epidermis as well he limped back to his house i looked like a walking pile of hamburger he said there wasnt a spot on me that wasnt black and blue or bleeding naturally i called the newspapers to give them the story of my terrifying experience they told me to drop dead i called the hospital i was going to have them verify the story to the newspapers they told me to drop dead too you see these bastardly ambulance attendants had lied about me it scared hell out of them when they saw i was missing so they picked the stretcher up out of that field and told the hospital authorities that i had refused to leave the house it didnt mean a thing that i was virtually cut to ribbons drunks are always messing themselves up so there i was with the biggest story that ever came out of hollywood and i couldnt get a damned line in the newspapers that was the last time i committed suicide there just wasnt any point to it those suspicious bastards wouldnt give me a writeup if i did kill myself i had no adventures which would top that one but i recounted a couple anyway one occurred on the pipeline as an outgrowth of my recurrent dts the other i had gone north to enroll at the university of nebraska i had had to leave texas very hastily for reasons i will reveal later and i needed work immediately i tried the two newspapers in lincoln i tried the university press and the branches of two syndicates finally i tried a farm paper and here the two young assistant editors instead of delivering the fast brushoff i had gotten elsewhere looked upon me as though i were something good to eat they gave me the best chair in the office they pressed cigarettes upon me they beamed and cooed over me nodding significantly to one another i should say that i was very well dressed the hotel had expected its employees to dress well and i had never regarded good clothes as a luxury i had on a hundred and fifty dollar suit and thirtyfive dollar shoes an imported topcoat was slung over my arm and i had pigskin gloves in one hand and a fortydollar borsalino hat in the other so the editors looked at me and each other and they thought it highly possible that they could give me a job not right at the moment but youre enrolling in the college of agriculture of course good god no i laughed im going to go into liberal arts why would a guy who wants to be a writer go to the editors started talking to me no one but positively no one enrolled in liberal arts any more a ba degree had as little academic standing as a diploma from a barber college the thing to shoot for was a bsc in agriculture there was a terrific demand for writers who knew agriculture the government was snatching them up as fast as they graduated there were splendid openings on farm periodicals why take their own case for example they were ag college seniors and already they had these excellent jobs they insisted that i go out to the house for dinner to discuss the matter well i knew nothing of such things i supposed that a bunch of them were keeping batch at this house they spoke of it dawned on me as we went up the walk of the splendid edifice that i had made a mistake but i didnt know how to get out of it i still didnt know hours later after i had been wined and dined and talked to so much by so many that my head was swimming it was the traditional fraternity rush and it rushed me right off my feet they pledged me to the house they enrolled me in the college of agriculture and that was the beginning of one of the most godawful periods in my harried and exasperating career the students were assumed to have a sound general knowledge of farming which i didnt have i had been too young during my several years on farms to learn anything furthermore my hatred of cows was so great that i detested practically everything connected with farming my brothers could get me no jobs naturally i had to get my own and plenty of them to keep up my fraternity assessments the brothers had all they could do and then some to keep me from flunking out they didnt mind losing my company understand they could have done very well without that but the house treasury couldnt afford to lose the income which i represented they had to keep me in the fraternity hence they had to keep me from flunking like most fraternities the house had exhaustive files of examination papers extending back for decades there were also files on the various faculty members complete dossiers of their likes dislikes and eccentricities so while one group of brothers worked on me another turned the heat on my instructors wherever they went the poor devils were surrounded by earnest young men pleading my cause so persistently and insistently that it was impossible to say no to them there was one man however who did say no loudly emphatically and repeatedly he was a little italian an exchange professor in pathology and he had been sore at me ever since i had dropped my fountain pen into a sixtypound churn of butter he said that since it was impossible to dissect me the next best thing was to flunk me he was a hard guy but the brothers had dealt with these tough babies before and when as promised he flunked me on the midterm final they gave him the works the entire membership of the fraternity turned the heat on him the house was powerful on the campus and the result of the works was nothing less than astounding the professors mildest jokes in class were greeted with wildly appreciative laughter his most inane remarks were applauded as pearls of wisdom he was literally carried about the campus by a horde of young men whose admiration for him was equalled only by their praise of italy the professor began to weaken they gave him the killer punch he was made the guest of honor at a house dinner and every brother stood up one at a time and sang his praises for a minimum of ten minutes at midnight they chauffeured him home so flushed with pleasure that his face looked like a beet and when the escorting party returned i was informed that i was in i was to be given a new examination on the morrow and i would be certain to pass it the news obviously called for a celebration and we had one i had a terrific hangover the next morning when i presented myself to the professor he was all smiles and mysterious grimaces wiggling his eyebrows significantly he whispered that we would go downtown for the examination a ver fine place i know he giggled a frien he has so kinly let me use it here where there ees so mooch pipples i had never been able to understand him well one of the many reasons he had disliked me but i thought i saw his point it was saturday and a great many students were around if anything unorthodox was to be done it was best to do it elsewhere we went downtown to a building largely occupied by governmental agencies at the tenth floor we walked down the dark corridor to a door near the end there was no sign on it except an abbreviation as incomprehensible in my fuzzy state as it was uninteresting and an arrow indicating that the entrance proper was elsewhere the professor unlocked the door and waved me inside the shades were drawn and the room was quite dark judging by the heavy leather chairs and the rows of glassshelved bookcases it was some kind of law office he led me into an adjoining room equipped only with a table and several chairs and turned on the light ver nice yes he raised his eyebrows at me zis way there is no complaint you pass examination ver steef you do it i do noting yeah i said i guess thats right i lock doors so ees no distorbance two hours yes i come back he left by the door of the other room i unlimbered the pint of whiskey in my pocket and had a hair of the dog sitting down at the table i took out the list of examination questions and i almost fell out of my chair i didnt know what had happened whether he had overestimated my abilities or given me the wrong set of questions or whether he had decided to play a cruel joke on the brothers and me but i knew i could never pass this examination i didnt know the answer to a single question i took another long drink trying to think i took two more drinks if i could get in touch with the house put one of the brothers to work on the cram file i looked around the room i glanced into the other one no telephone and the doors were locked i paced back and forth fretfully too worried to give the professor the cursing he deserved i raised the shade and the window and looked out the room faced on a court catercornered to my window some five feet away was another it was glazed and only raised a few inches so i could not see what it opened into but it seemed to me it should be a corridor i studied it thoughtfully raising the bottle again i came to a decision i couldnt jump or step across to that window but it would be an easy fallover a trick i had learned in my derricksalvaging days if i didnt make it of course if i should slip or miss but i had done harder fallovers before and almost as high up high enough up to be fatal if i had fallen height didnt mean anything in itself a trick could be done as easily at a hundred feet as at ten i climbed out on the ledge crouching i straightened until i was almost erect feet braced arms outstretched i let myself fall there was a split second when i was holding on with nothing but my heels staring down into empty space then my hands smacked down on the wooden base of the window and my fingers gripped the inside i raised my head and peered in it wasnt a corridor but a restroom i was looking at an angle into one of the stalls an elderly woman a char apparently was seated on the toilet she looked at me i looked at her she blinked absently and shook her head she took off her glasses and blew on them i eased my hands back out of the window to the brick ledge outside suspended in an aching shaking arc holding on with my toes and fingertips i waited and waited and waited i couldnt go back i couldnt go on i could of course but the old gal might drop dead she undoubtedly would scream her head off and how could anyone explain a deal like this crawling through the tenthfloor window of a womens john i think i have never heard a sweeter sound than the flushing of that toilet unless that is it was the click of the hall door as it closed behind her she had gone without coming near the window apparently she distrusted her eyes as much as she seemed to i gripped the inside of the window again and pulled myself up on the ledge but i couldnt go on with my plan the woman was probably working in the corridor or i might run into someone else anyway i just didnt have the heart for it i repeated my fallover returning to the room i had come from i sank down at the table and killed the rest of the bottle i was seated there halfdozing when the professor arrived we are all feenished eh we are mister tomseen where is you have wreeten notheeng not a damned notheeng i nodded surlily whatd you expect what deed i he choked his eyes began to bulge mister tomseen why do you theenk i what do you think this ees he waved his arms wildly the gesture encompassing the other room and the abbreviated legend on the door what mister tomseen you cannot read no you have no eyes yes he glared i stared and slowly the terrible truth dawned on me a friend of his a governmental agency and what kind of agency would a friend of his oh i groaned oh no yes mister tomseen oh yes a babe in arms no a drooling idiot no they could not do it too smart they would be but you you me i had done it i had failed a pathology examination in a pathology library now back to the pipeline stretched out along the big ditch and moving farther and farther into the wilderness as the line progressed were several hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment and supplies there were two ditches twenty electric generators a dragline trucks and tractors there were gasoline and oil dumps bins of tires tubes spark plugs and a hundred other accessories it was my job to guard this stuff all night long i tramped up and down the ditch walking the line above the pecos at one point i carried a weatherproof gasoline lantern and a repeating rifle my instructions were literally to shoot any sonofabitch that shows his face and ask questions afterward i rather liked the job in the beginning the days were still long and even at midnight there was a friendly semitwilight over the prairie by standing on top of a ditching machine i could see from one end of the job to the other very little walking was necessary and when i did walk it was with comparative safety i could see and avoid the rattlesnakes the tarantulas and the great twelveinch centipedes who considered this area their own private domain these things had been bad enough before the coming of the pipeline but with its advent they seemed to have gotten ten times worse they werent any more numerous of course but they were considerably more active the reverberations of the machinery shook them in their subterranean apartments dynamite blasted out great sections of their cities the ditches scooped them up there was one nest of a hundred and sixty rattlesnakes and hurled them out upon the prairie naturally they didnt like this a damned bit the more foolhardy and determined of them gave battle on the spot this was their home and they did not intend to be dispossessed the majority however preferred to bide their time they vanished among the sage and rock waiting until the earthshaking machinery stilled its clatter and the sun went down then they came swarming back to seek their former dwelling places and to scare hell out of me having no place to hibernate they became increasingly active and aggravated as the days shortened and cold weather set in they crept under the canvas jackets of the generators they hid in the recesses of machinery they moved endlessly up and down the line creeping into the joints of pipe crawling under the curves of the gasoline drums i was safe from them nowhere neither on the ground nor up on the machinery i had thought i was completely rid of the dts the illusion of crawling things now they came back and with increased frequency and intensity i fought them in the only way i knew how i would force myself to walk straight toward the spiders and snakes that loomed in the light of my lantern sometimes they would melt away under my boots and sometimes they would not instead of vanishing a diamondshaped head would lash out venemously or a ball of centipedes would explode and swarm up my legs i would drop my lantern and run brushing hysterically at myself run and run shrieking until i could run no more i gave up fighting too often an apparent illusion became reality i tried to get transferred to a day job but it was no soap they could get no one to take my place every morning i told myself that i couldnt take another night but every night i came back i had waited all summer for the line to start and it seemed a shame to quit now also i had invested heavily in winter clothes which would be of no use to me on another job so i hung on night after night and every night was more agonizing and fearful than its predecessor a tarantula bite is not fatal i understand only painful but these evillooking spiders terrified me more than any of their nightmarish colleagues they grew to the size of soup plates and they were furred like rabbits they could leap like rabbits too a dozen feet or more and they invariably would leap at anything that showed up in the darkness the lantern my face and hands i never saw one of them alone there was always at least a pair of them marching side by side and sometimes there were squadrons i lived in mortal fear of them late one night i was walking the line across the pecos moving cautiously to preserve my balance on the snowcovered pipe i had reached a point about midstream when looking ahead i saw a double file of pieshaped blots a squadron of tarantulas marching straight toward me i knew it was an illusion but but nothing if a thing exists in a mans mind it exists my heart began to pound wildly i choked up with terror i turned around and started to head back toward the other bank there marching toward me from that direction was another tarantula squadron i let out a wild yell and plunged from the pipe i fell thirty feet smashing through the icesheathed river and going all the way to the bottom fortunately it was not wide at that point and despite my heavy boots and layers of thick clothing i managed to get to shore soaked to the skin i scrambled up the bank and cranked up a generator i jumped the spark on a plug got a fire started and rigged up a makeshift shelter with canvas i huddled in it hugging the fire while my clothes dried shivering miserable but thoughtful i had gotten over my illness now and for some time i had been going downhill again no job was worth that and certainly this one was not it was time to pull out to get completely out of the oil fields my destiny wasnt here i had never intended it to be the west had been good to me but it had done all it could now it was my turn to do something and something much better than what i had been doing my clothes dried dawn spread over the prairie i kicked out the fire walked into camp and quit i returned to fort worth in the winter of except for the fact that maxine had married everything was about the same or more so pop was earning practically nothing the family was barely skimping by i applied for a job at the hotel and was turned down flatly the assistant managers and bell captains i had known were gone the am i applied to liked neither my appearance or my record nothing for you he said curtly youve been in too much trouble around here anyway youre too big to be hopping bells a fellow as big as you ought to be out heaving coal it doesnt have to be bellhopping i said my face turning red i can hold almost any job around a hotel sorry ill tell you something i said i think youre too little to be an assistant manager he grinned coldly and walked away i thought he had acted pretty onery but i couldnt greatly disagree with him on the point of my size when i first went to work at the hotel i had been well under six feet now i was six feet four while i was still underweight my broadened shoulders gave me the appearance of massiveness i was pretty selfconscious about my size there were few other hotel jobs worth having but i hadnt really wanted to hop bells i was too big being a menial contrasted unpleasantly with the rugged independence of my recent years but i had to have a job and quickly so unable to find anything else i went to work in a chain grocery theoretically the work week was a mere seventyfour hours seven to seven on weekdays and seven to nine on saturdays the actuality however was something else one had to arrive at six during the week to have the store ready for its seven oclock opening and at least another hour was spent in cleaning up and closing up at night on saturday the biggest business day one came to work at five and was lucky to get away in the early hours of sunday morning sunday or what remained of it was usually spent at sales meetings refurbishing the store or in taking inventory my salary was eighteen dollars a week i learned a very valuable lesson from this outfit ie the longer the application blank the worse the employer this company insisted on knowing everything even remotely concerned with a prospective employee everything from the size of his shoes to the religious and political preferences of his relatives in fact the only thing it was not interested in was how he could exist on a virtually nonexistent wage although it was obviously a losing proposition i held onto the job looking around for another whenever i had the opportunity this finally led me to a meeting with allie ivers who since i knew what his attitude would be i had hitherto avoided allie had been permanently discharged from the hotel for dropping the baggage of a nontipping guest out of a window he was now the manager of a wildcat taxi service a calling well suited to his superb gall and larcenous nature you he exclaimed staring at me incredulously you are putting in a hundred hours a week for a lousy eighteen bucks im ashamed of you jimmie you can go back to the hotel they wont take me i said im too big keep on working in that store said allie grimly and you wont be theyll have you down in worse shape than you were before you went west you cant feed yourself let alone your family youre about to be kicked out of your house and you all need clothes and medical attention ill tell you whats too big about you your head you think youre too good to hop bells thats not it i mumbled although it was just about it maybe i could have gone back but i sort of told this assistant manager off so what you know how hotel men are he probably laughed about it when he got off by himself anyway theres two assistant managers and one sticks strictly out of the others business well i said evasively how would i go about it how would you go about it allie mocked you stand there acting dumb and asking me get out of here get over there and get you a job i got out i went over to the hotel i talked with the coffee shop manager and the maitre d i talked with a room clerk a couple of the auditors the chief engineer and the steward i knew all these people and had done favors for them they all agreed to put in a strong word in my behalf now an assistant manager is held responsible for anything that goes wrong on his shift and a great many things can go wrong if his key personnel so choose insofar as his position will permit he must be obliging with them it was sunday afternoon when i talked with my various friends at the hotel having been unable to install a telephone at home i waited around the lobby for the results the assistant manager on duty was the same one who had turned me down he saw me and started toward me several times each time his phone rang calling him back to his desk after the last call he motioned for me to come to him been studying you he said his mouth twitching you dont look nearly as big to me as you did yes sir i said you look a lot bigger to me he grinned good naturedly well like to come to work tonight very much if i can get a uniform altered to fit me you will he said firmly and i did out of the great mass of stuff i had written in the oil fields i had placed two short pieces with a locally published magazine of regional literature the rate of pay had been low but because of its high standards it was considered an honor to appear in it i responded promptly when the editor having learned that i was back in town asked me to drop in for a visit i spent the larger part of an afternoon with him he was a kindly man but a frank one and i was able to accept his estimate of me without resentment i had talent he said and also that dogged persistence without which talent was worthless but that was just about all i had whatever my skill i was writing from motives which were basically childish i was trying to get even with people to show em i wasnt so dumb as they thought i was and to make them sorry for the many slights real and fancied which i had suffered i lived too much inside myself i needed to write more much more of what i saw and less much less of what i wanted to see i was not well read as i had thought myself here again i had tried to show people to prove that i knew more than they did i had read something of everything but never everything of anything the editor thought it would help me immeasurably to go to college college would bring some order to my chaotic efforts at selfimprovement it would help to bring me out of myself i would be placed in an environment where writing was not looked upon as effete or slightly ridiculous he himself was an alumnus of the university of nebraska if i could see my way clear to enrolling it was just possible that he could arrange a student loan for the tuition or perhaps a small scholarship i thanked him and promised to think about it but the project was obviously impossible financially speaking we were just beginning to see daylight at home and summer was coming on always a bad time for hotel business i told mom and pop about it and they insisted that i should go by any and all means pop could find some way of maintaining himself mom and freddie could stay with my grandparents who as you will remember lived in a small nebraska town but i just couldnt see it all we had was each other and i would be almost twentythree years old when the fall school term started it was crazy to think about it but i did think about it of course and very unwisely i mentioned it to allie hmmm he mused i think you should go jimmie how much dough would you have to have a lot more than ill ever get i said maybe not i think i may be able to think of something i met him the following night and he had indeed thought of something in fact he had done a great deal more than think about it i listened to his proposition and told him flatly to go to hell but whats wrong with it he inquired putting on an air of great puzzlement theres big dough in it and you dont have to invest any whats wrong with selling whiskey its against the law for one thing so what it wont be very long everyone knows prohibitions on the way out hell you can clean up jimmie you can get away with it where no one else could you stand in good all over the hotel the management trusts you and theyre going to keep right on trusting me too you can wholesale push the stuff with all the service employees well see that they dont buy from anyone else and you can hold the price up whos we some of als boys theyre taking over here on the booze al you mean uhhuh that one incidentally jimmy i dont think theyll like it if you turn this proposition down they can lump it then i scoffed al capones boys you mean allies dont you get someone else to hustle your booze its not mine honest allie held up a hand im not making a nickel on it i was just trying to help you out youd better go back to stealing baggage i said youre not good at lying any more i went on to work about one oclock that morning mom called me she sounded frightened jjimmie two men ttwo men in a big cadillac were jjust here yes i said whats the matter what did they want mom i ttried to stop them but they came right on in they left four cases of whiskey for you i met them the next morning or rather they met me as i came out of the hotels service entrance softspoken modishly dressed young men not a great deal older than i they were not at all like the creatures which my study of gangster movies had led me to expect we had breakfast together and i felt encouraged to explain why i could not sell whiskey for them they listened quietly without interruption i finished my explanation and still they sat waiting staring at me steadily well i laughed nervously thats you see how it is ive never done anything like that and what you going to do with the stuff then one of them interrupted casually you cant sell it what you going to do how you going to pay for it well i i you owe for four cases ninetyeight a case call it three hundred and ninety dollars you got the dough look i snapped i didnt order that stuff you can come out to the house and pick it up or ill have it brought back to you any place you say but you got the dough he repeated how you going to pay for it then but i just finished telling all right i said all right ill sell this but good you got a nice setup there be good for ten fifteen cases a week when you get organized it was like talking to a stone wall they didnt argue their attitude was simply that there was nothing to argue about to be honest i think i could have been firm at this point without serious danger to myself i wasnt involved with them yet they had too much to lose to risk trouble with someone who could appeal to the authorities with figuratively clean hands they were paying off of course but no fix is ever solid the purchaser is supposed to use it with discretion to do nothing which will seriously embarrass the seller so i had only to say no and keep saying it and i believe the matter would have been ended but despite a lifetime of pushing around i had never developed a tolerance for it and this latest instance which had seriously frightened my mother was particularly distasteful to me it seemed to me that these characters needed to be taught a lesson and that i was just the lad to do it all right i shrugged how much time do i have to pay up how much do you need well just getting started this way itll probably take me a week to sell it all of it of course i can pay you off a case at a time if they didnt want to do that as i was sure they would not it would be too much trouble also it bespoke a distrust which could be very unhealthy for the enterprise we wont crowd you any you have to run over a day or two sometime why just say so you play with us we play with you later on maybe you can make it cash on the line i couldnt do that for quite a while i said well i could i guess but but they understood id just been squeezing by i and my family needed all sorts of things and i was to go right ahead and take care of those needs naturally that was as it should be what was the sense in a guy working if he didnt have any dough to spend wed wait awhile before going on a cash basis say a couple of months from now we worked out the arrangements for delivery and payment i went on home pop was out of town for a few days and was thus unaware of the previous nights happenings much against her will i persuaded mom to keep mum i dont know why she sighed i just dont know why it is youre always getting mixed up in something i didnt mix up in it i said i was mixed up you certainly are youre really mixed up if you think you can cheat those fellows honest to goodness jimmie do you actually believe you can you wait and see i promised ill take those birds like grant took richmond the hotel was what was known in the trade as a tight or clean house bellboys returning from errands outside the hotel were always subjected to close scrutiny by the house detectives if their uniforms bulged suspiciously or if they were carrying a package of a certain size they were almost certain to be searched whiskey was bootlegged of course in spite of all the hotels precautions but to carry out an operation the size i contemplated was impossible by the usual pintatatime methods my base of operations as i saw it would have to be on the inside i have mentioned that a number of the lowerfloor rooms were blocked off in hot weather since it was hot now i purloined the key to one using it as a storage room for whiskey which i brought in in inexpensive suitcases a supposed guest drove up at the side door and tapped his horn for a bellboy i trotted out removed his baggage and carried it up to my room this same thing took place a dozen times a day with bona fide guests and baggage so my comings and goings went unmarked apparently and while other boys had been caught and discharged and sometimes jailed for bringing in a pint i brought in case after case there was no trouble at all for quite a while i paid for the four cases promptly at the end of the week the following week having obtained a transfer to days i sold six and the week after that i sold seven each week i brought in a little more paying up on the dot when the week was ended in a very few weeks i was handling and paying for upwards of ten cases now regardless of what my wholesalers thought this was an enormous amount of whiskey to move in any hotel even one that ran wide open i had to rewholesale the bulk of it to other bellboys and service employees taking a very short profit or no profit and along toward the last in order to get rid of the stuff i sold several cases at a loss on the overall transactions of course i made money several times the sum i would have made at legitimate bellhopping but this was nothing like the amount which i might reasonably have been expected to make the money was spent almost as fast as i got it on clothes on medical and dental attention on a car which i had mom buy and leave on the sales lot these things and our daytoday living expenses left me with very little surplus cash als boys were scheduled to supply that a quantity sufficient to travel on and to live on indefinitely and comfortably afterward the boys were just a little hesitant when at the beginning of the week i meant to be my last i ordered twenty cases i had always paid off hitherto and i had an excellent reason for wanting so much but still this convention you say its going to be a big one you read the papers i shrugged how come you want all the stuff at once why dont you take part of it at the beginning of the week and part in the middle i always have got it all in at one time i said yeah but twenty cases thats two grand well lets let it go i said easily well have thirtyfive bellboys working and theres a chance i might be able to turn the whole twenty the first day or so but give me five or ten or whatever you want to i got the twenty but not without some uneasiness on the part of the boys they hinted strongly that a substantial cash down payment would be welcome and when i pleaded a shortage of money a partial payoff for the midweek was arranged that was fine with me i wasnt going to be around by the middle of the week if things went as i planned i would work two days of the fiveday convention and skip town i figured that i should at least be able to dump the whiskey at its wholesale price probably with the house packed and so many boys working i would do considerably better than that with only a little luck i should turn it for three thousand or if the breaks really fell my way four or five thousand anyway it would be a very nice piece of change enough to give pop a stake enough so that mom and freddie could live with me when i entered the university of nebraska instead of staying with my grandparents the opening day of the convention was one of my long days seven until noon six until ten as always during the first shifts of a convention there was very little fast money the guests werent limbered up yet they were interested only in getting registered and cleaned up i sold two pints of whiskey at retail and the remainder of a case less one pint at wholesale that was every nickel i had in the world a little more than a hundred dolars when i knocked off at noon i went home and to bed intending to store up rest for the long hard grind i had ahead of me the whiskey would be reasonably safe from theft during these first two shifts but it would not be safe after that as soon as they got themselves oriented and the booze market began to boom every hotshot bellboy in the hotel would be after the stuff they would try to steal it from me just as i was stealing it from my wholesalers they would steal it dump it and skip exactly as i planned to do when i went back to the hotel tonight i would have to stay there sleeping in the whiskeystorage room and never getting too far away from it until i was ready to pull out it would be tough nervewracking almost thirtysix hours of staving off a threesided peril the wholesalers were suspicious of me and might become more than that at any minute the hotshots were out to rob me the hotel detectives to catch me the federal prohibition agents i had seen no signs of the prohibs so far but that didnt mean they werent on to me bushels of empty bottles were being carted out of the hotel every week the management was getting alarmed if the prohibition agents were on their toes at all it was too much to worry about i closed my eyes and went to sleep about three that afternoon mom shook me awake jimmie they found your whiskey prohibition officers huh what i sat up drowsily how do you know it just came over the radio they got five cases they said and theyre looking for the person it belongs to i was still half asleep too drowsy for the moment to comprehend the true and terrible nature of my plight as i recall it i even laughed a little sleepily only five cases huh well that wasnt so bad and as long as they didnt know who then it hit me and suddenly i was wide awake and shivering five cases hell if they had found five cases they had found it all it had all been there in the one room theyd only reported five cases but theyd gotten every damned last bottle those prohibs yes and doubtless the assistant managers and house detectives would be drinking my booze for the next six months they knew who the stuff belonged to all right theyd just been waiting for me to get the cache built up good now theyd knocked it over and it was my cue to stay away from the hotel and keep my mouth shut otherwise but my wholesalers i couldnt skip town now i didnt have the money and if i stayed here and couldnt pay them for all i knew they might have gotten the news already theyd think id sold fifteen cases and theyd want their dough probably since i could no longer work at the hotel theyd demand a settlement for the full amount the loss of an alleged five cases to the prohibs would be my headache i pushed mom out of the way and snatched up the telephone i called allie ivers he had just heard the news himself and his alarm was every bit as great as mine im sorry as hell you got into this jimmie i just thought you cpuld play it safe and easy and i know i know i said i laid myself wide open what had i better do beat it get out of town as fast as you can but i cant ill have less than a hundred bucks by the time i gas up the car ive got a thousand miles to travel and i have to take my mother and sister with me and you wont have a head left on your shoulders if you hang around here im not kidding you jimmie if i thought it was safe for you to wait until tomorrow id have you do it i could scrape up some dough for you and forget it i said ill i guess well manage some way i hung up the telephone and began flinging on my clothes i told mom to start packing packing she stared at me incredulously packing are you completely out of your dont pack then just get ready to travel pop can take care of the other things later mom grumbled but she didnt argue much without understanding all the details she knew i was taking the only way out of a very serious mess she called freddie from the schoolgrounds where she was playing with some other children the two of them began to pack and i called a taxicab i sped into town and got the car from the sales lot i had never seen it before except from a distance but mom had always been a shrewd bargainer and she seemed to have surpassed herself in this case the body the tires the upholstery all looked firstclass the motor seemed to be a little tight and sluggish but that was only natural in a car which had been standing idle for several months pop was at home when i returned he was obviously displeased with the news of my bootlegging but more concerned for my safety i had to leave the family was breaking up it was no time for the reproaches which he must have felt like handing me we got the car loaded and made our farewells hardly more than an hour from the time of the radio news flash mom and freddie and i were on our way out of town it was a scorching hot afternoon we had gotten about five miles out on the highway when the smoke began to rise from the hood before i could get to a filling station some five miles farther the motor was pounding ominously i got out and looked it over the radiator was full of water the fan belt was okay and the oil gauge stood at the full mark i let the car cool awhile then i drove on again the motor grew hotter the pounding louder mom looked at me frowning whats the matter jimmie why does it do that weve got a flat crankshaft i said its been packed with sawdust and tractor oil now its working loose is it will it cost much to fix it will and it wont stay fixed the bearings will work right loose again but how what in the world will we do go as far as we can then well well have to see when the time comes we rode on and smoke and fumes poured up through the floor boards the whole car shook with the pounding of the motor freddie stoppered her ears with her fingers and hung her head out the window mom snatched her back inside turned on me furiously honest to goodness jimmie what is the matter with you this cars about to fall apart and were practically broke and weve got to travel halfway across the united states and and and you sit there laughing whats the matter with you anyway how can you do it i dont know i said i guess i just dont know of anything else to do end
