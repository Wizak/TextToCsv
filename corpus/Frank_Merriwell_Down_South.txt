with astonishing strength pulled him off the prostrate lad see page frank merriwell down south chapter i a wonderful story it is in the heart of the sierra madre range one hundred and twentyfive miles west of zacatecas said the dying man across the blue chasm you can see its towers and turrets glistening in the sunshine it is like a beautiful dream dazzling astounding grand he wanders in his mind softly declared professor scotch poor fellow his brain was turned and he was brought to his death by his fruitless search for the mythical silver palace the man who lay on a bed of grass in one corner of the wretched adobe hut turned a reproachful look on the little professor you are wrong he asserted in a voice that seemed to have gained strength for the moment i am not deranged i am not deceived by an hallucination with my eyes i have seen the wonderful silver palace yes more than that i have stood within the palace and beheld the marvelous treasures which it contains the professor turned away to hide the look on his face but frank merriwell deeply interested bent over the unfortunate man asking by what route can this wonderful palace be reached there is no route between us and the silver palace lie waterless deserts great mountains and at last a yawning chasm miles in width miles in depth this chasm extends entirely round the broad plateau on which the wonderful palace stands like a dazzling dream the bottom of the chasm is hidden by mists which assume fantastic forms and whirl and sway and dash forward and backward like battling armies indians fear the place mexicans hold it in superstitious horror it is said that these mistlike forms are the ghosts of warriors dead and gone a wonderful people who built the silver palace in the days of cortez built it where the spaniard could not reach and despoil it despite his doubts the professor was listening with strong interest to this remarkable tale the fourth person in the hut was the dutch boy hans dunnerwust who sat on the ground his back against the wall his jaw dropped and his eyes bulging occasionally as he listened to the words of the dying man he would mutter chimminy gristmas for several weeks frank merriwell our hero hans his chum and professor scotch his guardian had been exploring the country around the city of mendoza mexico they had come to mexico after having numerous adventures in our own country as related in frank merriwell out west a former volume of this series only a short hour before they had run across the sufferer whose head seemed so full of the things he had seen at what he called the silver palace they had found him almost dead in a hut at the edge of a sandy plain suffering great pain and calling loudly for aid they had done what they could and then he had begun to talk as related above with surprising strength the man on the bed of grass sat up stretching out his hands gazing across the sunlit sandplain beyond the open door of the hut and went on i see it now i see it once again there there see it gleaming like a dazzling diamond in the sunshine see its beautiful towers and turrets that dome is of pure gold within those walls are treasures untold there are great vaults of gold and silver ornaments bars and ingots there are precious stones in profusion and all this treasure would make a thousand men rich for life but its not for me its lost to me forever with a stifled moan he fell back into franks arms and was lowered on the bed of grass professor scotch hastily felt the mans pulse listened for the beating of his heart and then cried quick frank the brandy it may be too late but well try to give him a few more minutes of life thats right palpitated frank bring him back to consciousness for we have not yet learned how to reach the silver palace there is no such place as the silver palace sharply declared the professor as he forced a few drops of brandy between the lips of the unfortunate man the fellow has dreamed it perhaps perhaps why frank i took you for a boy of more sense think think of the absurdity it is impossible it may be i know it is vell maype you dond nefer peen misdooken brofessor insinuated hans recovering for a moment from his dazed condition the professor did not notice the dutch boys words for the man on the bed of grass drew a long fluttering breath and slowly opened his eyes i thought i saw the palace once more he whispered it was all a delusion that is true nodded the professor it is all a delusion such a place as this silver palace is an absurd impossibility the illness through which you have passed has affected your mind and you dreamed of the palace it is not so returned the man reproachfully i have proof you doubt me you will not believe be calm be quiet urged the professor this excitement will cut your life short by minutes and minutes are precious to you now that is true minutes are precious hastily whispered the man it is not the fever i am dying of no no the water from the spring you may see behind the hut it has destroyed many people this morning before you came a peon found me here he told me he said the spring was poison the water robs men of strength of life i could not understand him well he went away and left me i could see him running across the desert as if from a plague and now i am dying dying but the silver palace observed frank merriwell you are forgetting that yah nodded the dutch lad you peen forgetting dot aind id the proof urged frank you say you have proof yah put in hans you say you haf der broof vere id peen it is here declared the unfortunate as he fumbled beneath the straw you are my countrymen you have been kind to me alwin bushnell may never return it is terrible to think all that treasure may be lost lost forever who is alwin bushnell my partner the one who was with me when i found the palace where is he now heaven knows he went for another balloon another balloon yes it was with the aid of a balloon that we reached the silver palace without it we could not have crossed the gulf absurd muttered the professor despite the fact that the word was merely murmured the miserable man on the bed of grass did not fail to catch it oh i will convince even you he exclaimed gasping for breath and continuing to fumble beneath the straw you shall see you shall know but our balloon we had no means of obtaining a further supply of gas it was barely sufficient to take us across the gulf with a few pieces of treasure we struck against the side of the bluff we were falling back into the abyss barely were we able to scramble out of the car and cling to the rocks then we saw the balloon rise a little like a bird freed of burden but it suddenly collapsed fluttered downward and the mists leaped up and clutched it like a thousand exulting demons dragging it down from our sight we crawled up from the rocks but it was a close call a close call he lay exhausted his eyes closed his hand ceasing to fumble beneath the straw once more professor scotch gave him a little of the brandy frank merriwell was more than interested he could feel his heart trembling with excitement something seemed to tell him that this man was speaking the truth and he was eager to hear more for a long time the unfortunate lay gasping painfully for breath but at last he was easier he opened his eyes and saw frank watching him steadily with an anxious expression ah he murmured exultantly you believe me you do not doubt i must tell you everything you shall be jack burks heir think of it heir to wealth enough to make you richer than monte cristo witness witness that i make this boy my heir he turned to the professor and hans and both bowed the former saying we are witnesses good we escaped with our lives but we brought little of the treasure with us i was determined to find the way back there and i made a map see here it is he thrust a soiled and crumpled piece of paper into franks hand and the boy saw there were lines and writing on it how we found our way out of the mountains how we endured the heat of the desert i cannot tell went on the weak voice of the man on the bed of straw we reached zacatecas and then bushnell went for another balloon he knows friends who have money and power and he will get the balloon if he lives but the proof the proof that you were going to show us it is here look from beneath the straw jack burk drew forth a queer little figure of solid gold a figure like the pictures of aztec gods which frank had seen this is proof declared the man it is some of the treasure we brought from the palace bushnell took the rest the professor excitedly grasped the little image and gazed searchingly at it it is all right it is genuine he finally exclaimed of course it is genuine said the man on the bed of grass and there are more in the silver palace there the treasures of the aztecs were hidden and they have remained the country all around is full of fierce natives who hold the palace in awe and prevent others from reaching it they have kept the secret well but vot vos dot interrupted hans at some distance on the plain outside the hut were wildly galloping horses for they could hear hoofbeats and loud cries then came a fusillade of pistol shots illustration frank began shooting and his first bullet brought down one of the ponies of the pursuers see page chapter ii gone bandits cried jack burk it may be pacheco pacheco questioned frank pacheco the human hawk he haunts the mountains and the desert he pursued us across the desert but we escaped him i have been in hiding here to avoid him he believes we brought much treasure from the mountains the professor had leaped to the door and was looking away on the plain now he cried excitedly look here a band of horsemen pursuing a white man plainly an american look he is shooting again once more the shots were heard frank ran to the door catching up a rifle that had been leaning against the wall of the hut for he knew he was in a bad mans land stand aside he shouted forcing his way past the professor no countryman of mine can be in danger that i do not try to give him a helping hand what do you mean to do get a crack at those greasers you are crazy you will bring the entire band down on us let em come one yankee is good for six greasers past the hut at a distance a single horseman was riding hotly spurring the animal which bore him at least a dozen darkfaced fiercelooking ruffians mounted on hardy little ponies were in pursuit as professor scotch had said the fugitive was plainly an american a native of the united states he had turned in the saddle to send bullets whistling back at his pursuers frank ran out and dropped on one knee the professor followed him and hans came from the hut just as frank lifted the rifle to his shoulder and was on the point of shooting the voice of jack burk sounded from the doorway to which he had dragged himself it is bushnell my partner al al al bushnell his voice was faint and weak and it did not reach the ears of the man out on the plain then frank began shooting and his first bullet brought down one of the ponies of the pursuers sending a bandit rolling over and over in the dust to leap up like a cat and spring behind a comrade on the back of another pony dot peen britty goot vrankie complimented hans dunnerwust again and again frank fired and the bandits quickly swerved away from the hut feeling their ponies sway or fall beneath them in an astonishingly brief space of time the course of pursuit was deflected giving the fugitive a chance to get away into mendoza which lay at a distance of about three miles from the hut the man in flight heard the shots saw the figures in front of the hut and waved his hand to them the professor excitedly beckoned for bushnell to come to the hut but the horseman did not seem to understand and he kept straight on toward the town confound him exploded the professor why didnt he come he dond like a trap to run into said hans but there is no trap here how he known dot well i dont know as i blame him of course he could not be sure it was not a trap and so he was cautious frank was calmly refilling the magazine of the rifle with fresh cartridges why you didnt shoot some uf der pandits deat vrankie asked hans i do not wish to shed human blood if i can avoid it you dont done dot uf you shoot six or elefen uf dose togs oh they are human beings dont you belief me dey vos volves kiotes well i did not care to shoot them if i could aid the man in any other way and i succeeded see they have given up the pursuit and the fugitive is far away in that little cloud of dust frank yes professor we should follow him and bring him back to his dying partner and leave jack burk here alone possibly to die alone we cant do that of course not what then well have to consider the matter but burk look see there professor he is flat on his face in the doorway he fell like that after trying to shout to his partner frank leaped forward and turned the man on his back it was a drawn ghastly face that the trio gazed down upon professor scotch quickly knelt beside the motionless form feeling for the pulse and then shaking his head gravely what is it anxiously asked frank has he he was silent at a motion from the professor who bent to listen for some movement of the mans heart after a few seconds professor scotch straightened up and solemnly declared this is the end for him we can do nothing more he is dead yes there was an awed hush now we can leave him the professor finally said pacheco the bandit cannot harm him now they lifted the body and bore it back to the wretched bed of straw on which they tenderly placed it the idol the golden image said the professor you must not forget that frank you have it little danger that i shall forget it it is here where it fell from my fingers as i ran out he picked up the image and placed it in one of his pockets then having covered the face of jack burk with his handkerchief frank led the way from the hut their horses had been tethered near at hand and they were soon mounted and riding away toward mendoza the sun beat down hotly on the plain of white sand and the sky was of a bright blue such as frank had never seen elsewhere outside mendoza was a narrow canal but a few feet in width and half filled with water from which rose little whiffs of hot steam along the side of the canal was a staggering rude stone wall fringed with bushes in strips and clumps beyond the canal which fixed the boundary of the plain of sand through vistas of tree trunks could be seen glimpses of brown fields fading away into pale pink violet and green the dome and towers of a church rose against the dim blue low down and on every side were spots of creamwhite red and yellow with patches of dark green intervening revealing bits of the town with orange groves all about across the fields ran a road that was ankle deep with dust and along the road a string of burros loaded with great bundles of green fodder were crawling into the town an undulating mass of yellow dust finally revealed itself as a drove of sheep urged along by peons appeared groups of natives were strolling in both directions seeking the shadows along the canal the women were in straw hats with their black hair plaited and little children strung to their backs the men wore serapes and sandals and smoked cigarettes along the side of the canal were scattered scores of natives of all ages and both sexes lolling beneath the bushes or soaking their bodies in the water while their heads rested on the ground those stretched in the shadow of the bushes had taken their bath and were waiting for their bodies to dry covered simply by serapes from beneath such a covering darkeyed native girls stared curiously at the passing trio causing hans no small amount of confusion i say vrankie said the dutch boy vot you dinks apoudt dot pusiness uf dakin a path in bublic mit der roadt beside it seems to be the custom of the country smiled frank and they do not seem to think it at all improper vell somepody better toldt dem to stob id id keeps mein plood mein face in so much dot i shall look like you hat peen drinking they think nothing of it explained the professor you will notice with what deftness they disrobe slipping out of their clothes and into the water without exposing much more than a bare toe oxcuse you fluttered hans i dond like to took mein chances py looking somepody mighd make a misdake the sun was low down as they rode into the town we have no time to lose said frank we must move lively if we mean to return to the hut before nightfall thats right nodded professor scotch they were successful in finding a native undertaker but the fellow was very lazy and he did not want to do anything till the next day tomorrow seсors tomorrow he said that did not satisfy however and he was soon aroused by the sight of money learning where the corpse was he procured a cart and a burro and they again set out along the road they found whole families soaking in groups in the canal sousing their babies in the water and draining them on the bank young indian girls in groups were combing out their hair and chatting merrily among themselves and with friends in the water dere oughter peen some law for dot muttered hans leaving the canal they set out upon the sandplain the undertakers burro crawling along at an aggravating pace its master refusing to whip it up despite urging the sun had set and darkness was settling in a blue haze on the plain when the hut was reached frank lighted a pocket lamp he always carried and entered a cry of astonishment broke from his lips professor professor he called the body is gone chapter iii held for ransom gone the professor was astonished shimminy gristmas i dond toldt you dot came from hans dunnerwust yes gone repeated frank throwing the light about the room and finally bringing it back to the bed of grass but but its impossible impossible or not it is true as you may see but the man was dead as dead as he could be yah snorted hans py shingoes dot peen der trute dot man vos teader as a goffin nail und dond you vorget him the trio were silent staring in stupefied amazement at the bed of grass an uncanny feeling began to creep over frank and it seemed that a chill hand touched his face and played about his temples hans teeth began to chatter i am quite ill the professor faintly declared in a feeble tone of voice the exertions of the day have been far too severe for me yah yah gurgled the dutch lad you vos anodder oxcuse me while i go oudt to ged a liddle fresh air he made a bolt for the open door and professor scotch was not long in following frank however was determined to be thoroughly satisfied and he again began looking for the body of the dead man once more going over the entire hut the body is gone beyond a doubt he finally muttered there is no place for it to be concealed here and dead men do not hide themselves he went out and found professor scotch and hans awaiting his appearance with no small amount of anxiety ah said the professor with a deep breath of relief you are all right all right said frank with amusement of course i am what did you think fancy i was going to be spirited away by spooks the little man drew himself up with an assumption of great dignity young man he rumbled in his deepest tone dont be frivolous on such an occasion as this you are quite aware that i do not believe in spooks or anything of the sort but we are in a strange country now and strange things happen here yah nodded hans dot peen oxactly righdt for instance the disappearance of that corpse is most remarkable dot peen der first dime i nefer known a deat man to ged ub un valk avay all alone mit himseluf by declared hans what do you think has happened here professor asked frank it is plain jack burks body is gone sure enough and does it not seem reasonable that he walked away himself vell you dond know apout dot broke in hans maype he dond pelief we vos goin pack here to bury him und he got tiret uf vaiting for der funerals there must have been other people here after we left said frank right nodded the professor bandits bushnell one or the other perhaps both frank fell to examining the ground for signs but although his eyes were unusually keen he was not an expert in such matters and he discovered nothing that could serve as a revelation the man was dead beyond a doubt professor you are sure sure roared the little man bristling in a moment of course im sure do you take me for a howling idiot dont get excited professor the best of us are liable to err at times it would not be strange if you but i didnt i tell you i didnt the body may have been removed by the bandits which hang about this section or by al bushnell burks partner yes bushnell may have recognized him although he did not seem to do so in that case he has been here and that explains everything everything he took the body away to give it decent burial and we have had our trouble for nothing by this time the native undertaker got the drift of the talk and set up a wail of lamentation and accusation he had come all that distance at great expense to himself and great waste of time during which he might have been sleeping or smoking it was robbery robbery robbery it was like the americanoes he had a wife and many very many children depending on him he had been tricked by the americanoes and he would complain that he had been cheated they should be arrested they should be compelled to pay oh come your perch off und gone took a fall to yournseluf cried hans in disgust you gif me der lifer gomblaint the native continued to wail and lament and accuse them until frank succeeded in quieting him by paying him three times as much as he would have asked had the body been found in the hut the old fellow saw how he could make it appear as a clean case of deception on the part of the strangers and he worked his little game for all there was in it having received his money he lost no time in turning his cart about and heading back toward mendoza evidently fearing the body might be found at last and forced upon him wed better be going too said professor scotch thats right agreed frank there is no telling what danger we may encounter on the plain after nightfall vell dond let us peen all nighd apout gedding a mofe on fluttered hans hastening toward the horses so they mounted and rode away toward mendoza although frank was far from satisfied to do so without solving the mystery of the remarkable disappearance darkness was falling heavily on the plain across which a cool and refreshing breath came from the distant mountains frank kept his eyes open for danger more than half expecting to run upon a gang of bandits at any moment as they approached the town they began to breathe easier and before long they were riding along the dusty road that led into the little town entering mendoza they found on each hand low buildings connected by long white adobe walls against which grew prickly pears in abundance running in straggling lines away out upon the open country about the edges of the town were little fires winking redly here and there with earthen pots which were balanced on smoldering embers raked out from the general mass withered and skinny old hags were crooning over the pots surrounded by swarthy children and lazy men who were watching the preparation of the evening meal groups of peons muffled to the eyes with their serapes were sitting with their backs to the adobe walls apparently fast asleep but frank noted that glittering black eyes peered out from between the serapes and the huts and he had no doubt but that many of the fellows would willingly cut a throat for a ridiculously small sum of money within the town it was different all day the window shutters had been closely barred but now they were flung wide and the flash of dark eyes or the low musical laugh of a seсorita told that the maidens who had lolled all the hot day were now astir doors were flung wide and houses which at midday had seemed uninhabited were astir with life in the patios beautiful gardens were blooming and through iron gates easychairs and hammocks could be seen many of the seсoritas had come forth and were strolling in groups of threes or fours dressed in pink and white lawn with spanish veils and fans the most of them wore white stockings and redheeled slippers many a witching glance was shyly cast at frank but his mind was so occupied that he heeded none of them the hotel was reached and they were dismounting when a battered and tattered old man about whose shoulders was cast a ragged blanket and whose face was hidden by a scraggly white beard came up with a faltering step pardon me he said in a thin cracked voice i see you are americans natives of the states yankees and as i happen to be from michigan i hasten to speak to you i know you will have pity on an unfortunate countryman my story is short my son came to this wretched land to try to make a fortune he went into the mines and was doing well he sent me home money and i put a little aside so that i had a snug little sum after a time then he fell into the hands of pacheco the bandit you have heard of pacheco gentlemen we have said frank who was endeavoring to get a fair look into the old mans eyes we surely have agreed the professor vell you can pet my poots on dot nodded hans the wretch the cutthroat cried the old man shaking his clinched hand in the air why didnt he kill me he has robbed me of everything everything tell us finish your story urged the professor frank said nothing the light from a window shone close by the old man frank was waiting for the man to change his position so the light would shine on his face for some moments the man seemed too agitated to proceed but he finally went on my son my son fell into the hands of this wretched bandit pacheco took him captive then he sent word to me that he would murder my son if i did not appear and pay two thousand dollars ransom money two thousand dollars i did not have it in the world but i had a little home i sold it i sold everything to raise the money to save my boy i obtained it and then then my friends i received another letter then pacheco demanded three thousand dollars der brice vos on der jump murmured hans but that is not the worst cried the old man waving his arms excitedly oh the monster the demon he wrung his hands and groaned as if with great anguish be calm be calm urged professor scotch my dear sir you are working yourself into a dreadful state how can i be calm groaned the stranger it is not possible to be calm and think of such a terrible thing what terrible thing asked frank you have not told the entire story and we do not know what you mean true true listen with that letter pacheco the monster sent one of my boys little fingers shimminy gristmas i dond toldt you dot do i horrible horrible the professor and hans uttered these exclamations but frank was calm and apparently unmoved with his eyes still fastened on the face of the old man how you toldt dot vos der finger uf your son mister thats it thats it how could you tell asked the professor my son my own boy he added a line to the letter stating that the finger had been taken from his left hand and that pacheco threatened to cut off his fingers one by one and send them to me if i did not hasten with the ransom money dot seddled you you recognized the handwriting as that of your son i did but i recognized something besides that what the finger oh you may have been mistaken in that surely you may i was not how do you know by a mark on the finger ah what sort of a mark a peculiar scar like a triangle situated between the first and second joints besides that the nail had once been crushed after which it was never perfect that was quite enough nodded professor scotch yah agreed hans dot peen quide enough alretty still frank was silent watching and waiting missing not a word that fell from the mans lips missing not a gesture failing to note no move this silence on the part of merriwell seemed to affect the man who turned to him saying a trifle sharply boy boy have you no sympathy with me think of the suffering i have passed through you should pity me what are you trying to do now asked frank quietly i am trying to raise some money to ransom my son but i thought you did raise money so i did but not enough finish the story well when i received that letter i immediately hastened to this land of bandits and halfbreeds i did not have three thousand dollars but i hoped that what i had would be enough to soften pachecos heart to save my poor boy and you failed the old man groaned again my boy is still in pachecos power and i have not a dollar left in all the world failed miserably failed well what do you hope to do what are you trying to do raise five hundred dollars how in any way by begging i do not know how anyway anyway will do but you cannot raise it by begging in this land man said the professor this is a land of beggars everybody seems to be poor and wretched but i have found some of my own countrymen and i hoped that you might have pity on me oh i did hope what you didnt expect us to give you five hundred dollars think of my boy my poor boy pacheco has threatened to murder him by inches to cut him up and send him to me in pieces is it not something terrible to contemplate vell i should dink id vos gurgled the dutch boy but how did you lose your money i was robbed by whom pacheco how did it happen i fell into his hands and he took your money without setting your son free he did did you tell him it was all you had in the world i told him that a score of times what did he say told me to raise more or have the pleasure of receiving my boy in pieces how long ago was that three days near here yes how long have you been in mendoza two days and during that time i have received this from pacheco he took something from his pocket something wrapped in a handkerchief with trembling fingers he unrolled it exposing to view a bloody human finger chapter iv unmasked hans and professor scotch uttered exclamations of horror starting back from the sight revealed by the light that came from the window set deep in the adobe wall franks teeth came together with a peculiar click but he uttered no exclamation nor did he start this seemed to affect the old man unpleasantly for he turned on frank crying in an accusing manner and tone have you no heart are you made of stone hardly was the reply this finger it is the second torn from the hand of my boy by pacheco the bandit pacheco the monster pacheco seems to be a man of great determination professor scotch gazed at frank in astonishment for the boy was of a very sympathetic and kindly nature and he now seemed quite unlike his usual self frank frank think of the suffering of this poor father yah murmured hans shust dink how pad you vould felt uf you efer peen py his blace put in hans sobbing chokingly it is very very sad said frank but there seemed to be a singularly sarcastic ring to the words which fell from his lips have you seen your son since he fell into the hands of pacheco sir asked the professor yes i saw him but i could scarcely recognize him he was so changed so wan and ghastly the skin is drawn tightly over his bones and he looks as if he were nearly starved to death did he recognize you yes what did he do the man wrung his hands with a gesture of unutterable anguish oh his appeal i can hear it now he begged me to save him or to give him poison that he might kill himself where is he now in a cave where is the cave that i cannot tell for i was blindfolded all the time except while in the cave where my boy is kept it is near mendoza it must be within fifty miles of here perhaps it is nearer possibly but you have no means of knowing in which direction it lies no your only hope is to raise the five hundred dollars that is my only hope and that can scarcely be called a hope for i must have the money within a day or two or my boy will be dead hum hum coughed the professor this is a very unfortunate affair very unfortunate i am not a wealthy man but i you will aid me shouted the old man joyously heaven will bless you sir heaven will bless you i have not said so i have not said i would aid you scotch hastily said i am going to consider the matter ill think it over then i have no hope why not if your heart is not opened now it will never open my poor boy is lost and i am ready for death the old man seemed to break down and sob like a child burying his face in his hands his body shaking convulsively frank made a quick gesture to the others pressing a finger to his lips as a warning for silence in a moment the old man lifted his face which seemed wet with tears my last hope is gone he sighed and you are travelers you are rich he turned to frank to whom with an appealing gesture he extended a hand that was shaking as if with the palsy you surely you will have sympathy with me i can see by your face and your bearing that you are one of fortunes favorites you are rich a few dollars my dear man said frank quite calmly i should be more than delighted to aid you if you had told the truth the old man fell back he was standing fairly in the light which shone from the window what do you mean he hoarsely asked do you think i have been lying to you do you fancy such a thing i fancy nothing i know you have lied frank cried professor scotch in amazement shimminy gristmas gurgled hans dunnerwust in a dazed way the manner of the old man changed in a twinkling you are insolent boy you had better be careful now you threaten laughed frank well i expected as much from a beggar a fraud and a scoundrel professor scotch and hans fell into each others arms overcome with excitement and wonder frank was calm and deliberate and he did not lift his voice above the tone used in ordinary conversation still another step did the man fall back and then a grating snarl broke from his lips and he seemed overcome with rage he leaned forward hissing you insulting puppy the truth must always seem like an insult to a scoundrel do you dare what is there to fear much frank snapped his fingers your tune has changed in the twinkling of an eye you are no longer the heartbroken father begging for his boy but you have flung aside some of the mask and exposed your true nature professor scotch saw this was true and he was quaking with fear of what might follow this remarkable change as for hans it took some time for ideas to work their way through his brain and he was still in a bewildered condition for a moment the stranger was silent seeming to choke back words which rose in his throat finally he cried oh very well i did not expect to get anything out of you but it would have been far better for you if i had now what frank asked the question as the speaker faltered you shall soon learn what i am going to leave you but we shall see more of each other dont forget that wait do not be in a hurry i am not satisfied till i see your face with the final words frank made a leap and a sweep of his hand clutching the white beard the man wore and tearing it from his face the beard was false the face exposed was smoothly shaven and weathertanned ha cried frank triumphantly i thought so this poor old man is carlos merriwell my villainous cousin chapter v kidnaped as our old readers know carlos merriwell was franks deadly enemy although they were blood cousins carlos was the son of asher merriwell the brother of franks father at the time of his death asher merriwell was supposed to be a crusty old bachelor a man who had never cared for women and had never married but he had not been a womanhater all his life and there was a romance in his career asher merriwell had been snared by the wiles of an adventuress and he had married her by this woman he had a son but the marriage had been kept a secret so that when she deceived him and they quarreled they were able to separate and live apart without the fact becoming public that merriwell had been married fortunately the woman died without openly proclaiming herself as the wife of asher merriwell in her veins there had been spanish blood and her son was named carlos after the death of his wife asher merriwell set about providing for and educating the boy although carlos continued to bear his mothers maiden name of durcal as carlos grew up he developed into a wild and reckless young blade making no amount of trouble and worry for his father asher merriwell did his best for the boy but there was bad blood in the lads veins and it cost the man no small sums to settle for the various sports in which carlos participated finally carlos took a fancy to strike out and see the world for himself and he disappeared without telling whither he was going after this he troubled his father at intervals until he committed a crime in a foreign country where he was tried convicted and imprisoned for a long term of years this was the last straw so far as asher merriwell was concerned and he straightway proceeded to disown carlos and cut him off without a cent it was afterward reported that carl durcal had been shot by guards while attempting to escape from prison and asher merriwell died firmly believing himself to be sonless at his death asher left everything to frank merriwell the son of his brother and provided that frank should travel under the guardianship of professor scotch as the eccentric old uncle believed travel furnished the surest means for broadening the mind but carlos merriwell had not been killed and he had escaped from prison finding he had been cut off without a dollar and everything had been left to frank carlos was furious and he swore that his cousin should not live to enjoy the property in some ways carlos was shrewd in others he was not he was shrewd enough to see that he might have trouble in proving himself the son of asher merriwell by a lawful marriage and so he did not attempt it but there was a still greater stumbling block in his way for if he came out and announced himself and made a fight for the property he would be forced to tell the truth concerning his past life and the fact that he was an escaped convict would be made known having considered these things carlos grew desperate if he could not have his fathers property he swore again and again that frank should not hold it with all the reckless abandon of his nature carlos made two mad attempts on franks life both of which were baffled and then the young desperado was forced to make himself scarce but carlos had become an expert crook and he was generally flush with illgotten gains so he was able to put spies on frank he hired private detectives and frank was continually under secret surveillance thus it came about that carlos knew when frank set about upon his travels and he set a snare for the boy in new york city straight into this snare frank walked but he escaped through his own exertions and then baffled two further attempts on his life by this time carlos found it necessary to disappear again and frank had neither seen nor heard from him till this moment when the fellow stood unmasked in the mexican town of mendoza frank had become so familiar with his villainous cousins voice and gestures that carlos had not been able to deceive him from the first frank had believed the old man a fraud and he was soon satisfied that the fellow was carlos on carlos merriwells cheek was a scar that had been hidden by the false beard a scar that he would bear as long as he lived professor scotch nearly collapsed in a helpless heap so completely astounded that he could not utter a word as for hans he simply gasped shimminy gristmas a snarling exclamation of fury broke from carlos lips oh youre too sharp my fine cousin he grated his hand disappearing beneath the ragged blanket you are too sharp to live out came the hand and a knife flashed in the light that shone from the window of the hotel frank however was on the alert and was watching for just such a move with a twisting movement he drew his body aside so the knife clipped down past his shoulder cutting open his sleeve but failing to reach his flesh that was near it he said as he whirled and caught carlos by the wrist frank had a clutch of iron and he gave carlos wrist a wrench that forced a cry from the fellows lips and caused the knife to drop to the ground you are altogether too handy with such a weapon said the boy coolly it is evident your adeptness with a dagger comes from your mothers side your face is dark and treacherous and you look well at home in this land of dark and treacherous people carlos ground forth a fierce exclamation making a desperate move to fling frank off but failing oh you are smart the fellow with the scarred face admitted but you have been lucky you were lucky at fardale and you were lucky in new york now you have come to a land where i will have my turn youll never leave mexico alive i have listened to your threats before this i have made no threats that shall not come true what a desperate wretch you are carlos i would have met you on even terms and come to an agreement with you if you bah do you think i would make terms not much you have robbed me of what is rightfully mine and i have sworn you shall not take the good of it ill keep that oath a strange cry broke from his lips as he found he could not tear his wrist from franks fingers then came a rush of catlike footfalls and a clatter of hoofs all at once voices were heard crying ladrones ladrones dark figures appeared on every hand sending natives fleeing to shelter spanish oaths sounded on the evening air and the glint of steel was seen shimminy gristmas gurgled hans dunnerwust uf we dond peen in a heap uf drouble i know noddings its the bandits frank called professor scotch they have charged right into the town and they ha ha laughed carlos you fear the bandits they are my friends they are here and it is my turn a horseman was riding straight down on frank and the boy flung carlos aside making a leap that took him out of the way something glittering brightly descended in a sweep toward franks head but the blow was stopped by carlos who shouted something in spanish frank understood spanish well enough to catch the drift of the words and he knew his cousin had not saved him through compassion but for quite another purpose carlos coveted the riches into which frank had fallen and he meant to have a portion of the money if frank were killed there was little chance that he would ever handle a dollar of the fortune so he had cried out that his cousin was to be spared captured and held for ransom that was enough to warn frank of the terrible peril that overshadowed him at the moment out came his revolvers and his back went against the wall upward were flung his hands and the weapons began to crack two horses fell sent down by the first two bullets from the pistols of the boy at bay but frank found he could not shoot horses and save himself for dark forms were pressing upon him and he must fall into the clutches of the bandits in another moment unless he resorted to the most desperate measures if you will have it then you shall he muttered through his set teeth turning his aim on the human forms spouts of red fire shot from the muzzles of the revolvers and the cracking of the weapons was followed by cries and groans through a smoky haze frank saw some of the dark figures fling up their arms and topple to the ground within a few feet of him he wondered what had become of hans and the professor for he could see nothing of either and they had been close at hand a moment before in the midst of all this frank wondered at his own calmness his one thought was that not a bullet should be wasted and then he feared he would find his weapons empty and useless before the desperadoes were rebuffed but this reception was something the bandits had not expected from a boy they had no heart to stand up before a lad who could shoot with the skill of a gringo cowboy and did not seem at all excited when attacked by twenty men mexican halfbloods are cowards at heart and by the time they saw two or three of their number fall before the fire from franks revolvers they turned and took to their heels like a flock of frightened sheep say holdt on avile und led me ged a few pullets indo you mein friendts it was hans voice and looking down frank saw the dutch lad on the ground at his feet whither he had crept on hands and knees what are you down there for hans vot you dink vrankie you dond subbose i sdood up all der dime und ged in der vay der pullets uf vell you may oxcuse me i dond like to peen a deat man alretty yet thats all right hans i admire your judgment dank you vrankie i admire der vay you vork dose revolfers dot peat der pand und dond you vorged him at this moment a horse with a double burden swept past in the flare of light help frank frank merriwell help save me merciful goodness cried frank it is the professors voice und he vos on dot horse yes a captive dots vat he vos our own horses where are they we must pursue what have become of our horses dose pandits haf dooken them i susbect this was true frank had killed two of the horses belonging to the bandits but the desperadoes had escaped with the three animals hired by our friends but that was not the worst for professor scotch had been captured and carried away by the bold ruffians frank heard the professors appeals for help and heard a mocking coldblooded laugh that he knew came from the lips of carlos merriwell then the clatter of hoofs passed on down the street growing fainter and fainter till they left the town for the open plain and finally died out in the night chapter vi carried into the mountains in vain frank attempted to organize a party to pursue the bandits the citizens of mendoza were completely terrorized and they had no heart to follow the desperadoes out upon the plain which was the bandits own stamping ground frank urged entreated begged and finally grew furious but he simply wasted his breath no no seсor protested a mexican you no find anybody dat chase pacheco dis night no no not much pacheco you dont mean to say you cant mean dat was pacheco and his band seсor frank groaned pacheco he muttered huskily pacheco the worst wretch in all mexico he is utterly heartless and the professor will but pacheco is not the worst he suddenly gasped there is carlos merriwell who must be one of the bandits he may take a fancy to torture professor scotch simply because the professor is my guardian what you say seсor asked the curious mexican i do not understand all dat you speak frank turned away with a gesture of despair vot you goins to done vrankie asked hans dolefully i do not seem to be able to do anything now this matter must be placed before the authorities but i do not fancy that will amount to anything the officers here are afraid of the bandits and the government is criminally negligent in the matter of pushing and punishing the outlaws the capture of an american to be held for ransom will be considered by them as a very funny joke vell i dond seen vot you goin to done apout it i do not see myself but come on and we will find out he sought the highest officials of the town and laid the matter before them in the most polite manner possible they protested their pained solicitation and commiseration but when he urged them to do something they replied tomorrow seсor or the next day we will see what we may be able to do tomorrow cried frank desperately with you everything is tomorrow tomorrow today tonight now is the time to do something delays are fatal particularly in pursuing bandits and kidnapers but they shook their heads sadly and continued to express sympathy and regret all the while protesting it would be impossible to do anything before tomorrow or the next day frank was so furious and desperate that he even had thought of following the bandits with hans as an only companion but the man of whom he had obtained the horses in the first place would not let him have other animals that was not all this man had gone through some kind of proceeding to lawfully seize frank and hans and hold them till the animals captured by the bandits were paid for at the price he should name and this he proceeded to do now frank did not have the price demanded for the three horses and he could not draw it that night so he was obliged to submit and the two boys were prisoners till near three oclock the next afternoon when the money was obtained and the bill paid at the hotel frank found a letter awaiting him and to his unbounded amazement it was from the professor with haste he tore it open and these words are what he read dear frank pacheco commands me to write this letter we are at the headwaters of the rio de nieves but we move on to the westward as soon as i have written he tells me we are bound for the mountains beyond huejugilla el alto which is directly west of zacatecas as the bird flies one hundred and ten miles he bids me tell you to follow to huejugilla el alto where he says arrangements will be made for my ransom remember jack burk he spoke of the mountains to the west of zacatecas pacheco threatens to mutilate me and forward fragments to you if you do not follow to the point specified he is watching me as i write and one of his men will carry this letter to mendoza and deliver it the situation is desperate and it strikes me that it is best to comply with pachecos demands in case you care to bother about me if you want me to be chopped up bit by bit and forwarded to you do not bother to follow i have no doubt but pacheco will keep his word to the letter in this matter i am my dear boy your devoted guardian and tutor horace orman tyler scotch that this letter was genuine there could be no doubt as it was written in the professors peculiar style of chirography but it did not sound like the professor and frank knew well enough that it had been written under compulsion and the language had been dictated by another party poor old professor murmured the boy poor old professor he shall be saved he shall be saved he knows i will do everything i can for him yah but he dond seem to say dot der ledder in observed hans who had also read every word huejugilla el alto is one hundred and ten miles west of zacatecas vere you belief they findt dot name vrankie frank did not mind the dutch lads question but bowed his head on his hand and fell to thinking we must have horses and we must follow remember jack burk surely the professor put that part of the letter in of his own accord he did not speak of the silver palace but he wished to call it to my mind that palace according to burk lies directly west of zacatecas somewhere amid the mountains beyond this place he has mentioned the professor meant for me to understand that i would be proceeding on my way to search for the palace perhaps he hopes to escape yah broke in hans berhaps he meant to done dot vrankie we would be very near the mountains it must be that we would be in the mountains i guess dot peen shust apoudt vere we peen vrankie if he escaped or should be rescued or ransomed we could easily continue the search for the palace you vos oxactly righdt we must have horses and a guide we can ged dem mit money we had better proceed to zacatecas and procure the animals and the guide there shust oxactly vot i vould haf suggestet vrankie we will lose no time about it vell i guess nod but carlos carlos my cousin it is very strange but professor scotch does not mention him py shimminy dot peen der trute and i am certain it was carlos that captured the professor i heard the fellow laugh his wicked triumphant laugh i heardt dot meinseluf vrankie carlos must be with the band yah and pacheco is carrying this matter out to suit my cousin yah hans it is possible you had better remain behind vot vos dot gurgled the dutch lad in blank amazement vot for vos i goin to gone pehindt und stay vrankie i see a trap in this a plot to lead me into a snare and make me a captive vell dond i stood ub und took mein medicine mit you all der dimes vot vos der maddetr mit me vos you lost your courage in me alretty yet hans i have no right to take you into such danger without doubt a snare will be spread for me but i am going to depend on fate to help me to avoid it vell i took some stock dot fate in meinseluf if i should take you along and you were killed i took your chances on dot mein poy vot vos i draveling aroundt mit you vor anyhow you vant to know aindt id you are traveling for pleasure and not to fight bandits uf dot peen a bard der bleasure uf you dond haf some righdt to

dot frank laughed hans he said you are true blue we will stick by each other till the professor is saved from pacheco and carlos merriwell yah we done dot they clasped hands and that point was settled chapter vii the camp in the desert without unnecessary delay they took the train from mendoza to zacatecas which was a much larger place in zacatecas they set about the task of finding a reliable guide which was no easy matter as they soon discovered the mexican halfbloods were a lazy shiftless set and the fullblooded spaniards did not seem to care about taking the trip across the desert till late that night frank searched in vain for the man he wanted and he was finally forced to give up the task till another day such a delay made him very impatient and he felt much like starting out without a guide depending on a compass with which he believed he would be able to make his way due west to huejugilla el alto the landlord of the hotel at which they stopped that night was a fineappearing man and frank ventured to lay the matter before him the landlord listened to the entire story looking very grave shook his head warningly and said do not think of attempting to cross the desert alone young seсors without a guide you might get lost and perish for water by all means take a guide but how are we to obtain a trustworthy guide sir that is truly a problem but i think i may be able to assist you in the morning if you can it will be a great favor many thanks young seсor i will see what can be done if you would take my advice you would not go to huejugilla el alto why not it is far from the railroad and is situated in a very wild region if you were to go there and should never be heard of again it would not be easy for your friends to discover what had become of you pacheco directed you to go there and he means you no good it is likely you will walk into a trap that pacheco has set for you i have considered that said frank quietly and i have decided to go oh very well with a gesture expressive of regret i know it is quite impossible to change the determination of you americans if you have firmly decided to go you will go even though you knew all the deadly dangers that may lie in wait for you being again assured that the landlord would do his best to obtain a guide frank proposed to retire for the night for all of the troubles that beset him frank was able to sleep soundly having trained himself to sleep under almost any circumstances hans also slept and snored to be awakened in the morning by frank who was shaking him roughly come hans it is time we were stirring vot vos dot cried the dutch lad in surprise we dond peen asleep more as fifteen minutes alretty yet it is morning i dond toldt you so vell dot peats der pand hans got up and dressed with great reluctance yawning and declaring over and over that the nights in mexico were not more than fifteen or twenty minutes in length the landlord had prepared a special breakfast for them and it proved the best they had found since leaving the states so they ate heartily and felt much better afterward after breakfast the landlord himself informed them that he had been able to obtain a guide he is the very person you want young seсors for he knows the desert and he knows the mountains you may depend on him to lead you straight across to huejugilla el alto the guide was waiting for them wrapped to his chin in a crimson poncho and smoking a cigarette he was a darkfaced somewhat sinisterlooking fellow and he gave his name as pedro while frank did not like the appearance of the man he felt that it was not policy to delay longer and a bargain was soon made pedro not only agreed to take them quickly across the desert but he contracted to furnish horses for them the forenoon was not far advanced when they rode out of zacatecas and with the sun at their backs headed toward the west before the day passed pedro showed by many things that he was quite familiar with the desert he knew where shade and water were to be found and at noonday they rested long beside a spring with the sun beating on the wide waste of sand over which the heat haze danced and where no cooling breath seemed astir the heat affected hans much more than it did frank the dutch boy suffered but he made no complaint with the sun well over into the western sky they pushed onward again they did not halt as the grateful shadows of night lay on the desert but followed pedro on and on at last far across the desert they saw the twinkling of a light that seemed like a fallen star its a campfire declared pedro in spanish who can be there it may be bandits suggested frank somewhat wary no declared the guide bandits do not build fires on the open plains bandits it cannot be he did not hesitate to lead them straight toward the fire frank whispered to hans have your weapons ready this may be the trap as they approached the fire they were able to make out the figures of two or three horses but no human being was to be seen although a coffeepot sat on some coals fragrant steam rising from the nozzle pedro stopped seeming somewhat uneasy for the first time what is it asked frank with apprehension yah vot id vos asked hans vos der camp left all alone mit ids lonesome not that seсors but we have been heard and the ones at the camp are hiding and watching vell i like dot maype dey haf der trop on us alretty soon that is likely said frank pedro called out something in spanish but there was no answer save that one of the horses lifted its head and neighed then frank tried it in english ho the camp who is there and where are you almost instantly a mans voice replied im out hyar whar i kin take a peep at yer as i heard yer comin didnt know but you wus greasers an i aint got no use fer ther onery varmints as yer kin talk united states just move right up ter the fire and join me at supper there was a hearty freedom about the invitation that dispelled franks fears immediately and they rode forward into the firelight as they did so a man rose from where he had been stretched on the sand and came forward to meet them great scott shouted frank as the firelight fell on the mans face its alwin bushnell jack burks partner chapter viii the treasure seeker thet thars my handle acknowledged the man but im strapped ef i understand how you uns happen ter know it he stared at the boys and the guide in blank amazement seeing pedros face fairly he gave a slight start and then looked still more closely theres no doubt palpitated frank you are alwin bushnell thats me nodded the camper and you are alone certun sure bound west i reckon for the mountains and the silver frank caught himself and stopped short remembering pedro and knowing the guides ears and eyes were wide open to hear and see everything bushnell fell back a step a look of still greater surprise coming to his bronzed and bearded face wats thet thar you wus goin ter say he demanded wait said frank i will tell you later it is better plainly alwin bushnell was puzzled and not a little amazed you know my handle an you seem ter know whatever way im trailin this yere lays over me as i acknowledges instanter thats not hard to explain then i begs yer to explain it without delay your partner told us of you old jack yes when and whar two days ago outside of mendoza he wuz thar yes but how did yer know me we saw you when when you were pursued across the plain by bandits bushnell slapped his thigh thar he cried i remembers yer now you wuz near a doby hut an yer opened up on ther pizen skunks as wuz arter me thats right wall im much obliged fer you socked ther lead ter them critters so they switched off an let me get away you kin shoot boy some some waal thats right you bet give us a wag of your fin im mortal glad ter clap peepers on yer fer i never expected ter see yer an thank yer fer thet trick frank swung from the saddle and surrendered his hand into the broad paw of the rough and hearty westerner who gave it a crushing grip and a rough shake repeating im mortal glad ter see yer thets whatever but i want ter know how you happened to chip inter thet thar little game you took a hand at jest ther right time ter turn ther run of ther cards an i got out without goin broke i chipped in because i saw you were a white man and you were hard pressed by a villainous crew who must be bandits i believe in white men standing by white men say thets a great motter young man white men stand by white men as fer me i dont like a greaser none whatever as he said this bushnell gave pedro another searching look and the guide scowled at the ground in a sullen way now continued the westerner wat i wants ter know next is wat yer knows about jack burk we had a place all agreed on ter meet wen i returned but he wusnt thar an i hed ter go it alone thats why im yere alone it was not burks fault that he did not meet you say you so then lay a straight trail fer me ter foller he was sick is that whatever waal derned ef i could seem ter cut his trail anywhar i went an i made a great hustle fer it he was in the hut where you saw us waal dern my skin ef id knowed thet id made a straight run fer thet yere ranch bet yer boots he came to the door and shouted to you you dont tell me thet an i didnt hear him waal waal whar wuz my ears whar is he now dead bushnell reeled is he that he gasped recovering an i didnt get to see him say this clean upsets me sure as shootin the man seemed greatly affected poor old jack he muttered weve made many a tramp together an we struck it rich at last but hell never git ther good of thet thar strike then he seemed to remember that he was watched by several eyes and he straightened up passing his hand over his face jack shall hev a big monumint he cried tell me whar my old pard is planted that is something i do not know mr bushnell the man was astonished dont know why hows thet frank told the entire story of burks death and mysterious disappearance to which bushnell listened with breathless interest when it was finished the man cried thet thar beats me i dont understand it none whatever no more do i confessed frank there is no doubt but burk was dead and the corpse did not walk away of its own accord it was my intention to investigate the mystery but later events prevented frank then explained about the kidnaping of professor scotch by the bandits while the boy was relating this bushnell was closely studying the guides face as revealed by the firelight frank noted that a strange look seemed to come into the eyes of the westerner and he appeared to be holding himself in check when this explanation was finished bushnell asked and you are on your way ter huejugilla el alto with ther hope of rescuin ther professor we are replied frank you pet my life nodded hans this is the guide who was recommended to you in zacatecas yes you trust him fully we are obliged to do so waal boys ef this yere critter cant take yer straight ter pacheco nobody kin what do you mean jest this cried bushnell explosively this yere greaser galoot wat yer calls pedro is nobody but ferez who is ferez hes pachecos lieutenant frank uttered a cry of amazement and anger wheeling quickly on the mexican his hand seeking the butt of a revolver but the darkfaced rascal seemed ready for such an exposure for with a yell of defiance he dropped behind his horse and the animal shot like a rocket from the firelight into the shadows which lay thick on the desert bushnell opened up with a brace of revolvers sending a dozen bullets whistling after the fellow in less than as many seconds at the first shot hans dunnerwust fell off his horse striking on his back on the sand where he lay faintly gurgling uf you dond shood der odder vay i vos a tead man dont let him escape with a whole skin shouted frank as he began to work a revolver although he was blinded by the flashes from bushnells weapon so that he was forced to shoot by guess ferez seemed to bear a charmed life for he fled straight on into the night sending back a mocking shout of laughter from far out on the waste he cried bah gringo dogs you cannot harm me i will see you again americanoes this is not the last with an angry exclamation of disappointment and anger bushnell flung his empty revolvers on the sand at his feet dern me fer a fool he roared ef id done my shootin first an my talkin arterward he wouldnt got away but ferez had escaped and they could only make the best of it when this was over and the excitement had subsided they sat about the fire and discussed the situation frank then showed the golden image which burk had given him and explained how the dying man had told of the silver palace bushnell listened quietly a cloud on his face at the conclusion of the story he rose to his feet saying ef jack burk made you his heir thet goes an i aint kickin none whatever old jack didnt hev no relatives so he hed a right to make any galoot his heir but thars goin ter be plenty of worry fer anybody as tries ter reach ther silver palace howd you spect ter git crost ther chasm as yet i have not taken that into consideration the kidnaping of professor scotch has banished thoughts of everything else from my mind waal ef jack burk made you his heir youre entitled ter your half of ther treasure providin youre ready ter stand your half of ther expenses ef we fail ter git thar you may depend on me so far as that is concerned waal then you see i hev three hawses one is fer me ter ride another is ter kerry provisions and ther third is ter tote ther balloon the balloon thets whatever i hev another balloon with which ter cross thet thar chasm its ther only way ter git over in crossin ther balloon will be loaded with a ballast of sand but when we come back ther ballast will be pure gold chapter ix the professors escape they did not expect to reach huejugilla el alto without being molested by bandits for it was presumed that pachecos lieutenant would carry the word to his chief and the desperadoes would lose no time in moving against them knowing their danger they were exceedingly cautious traveling much by night and keeping in concealment by day and to their surprise the bandits made no descent upon them huejugilla el alto proved to be a wild and picturesque place being far from the line of railroad it had not even felt the touch of northern civilization and the boys felt as if they had been transported back to the seventeenth century hyar lads said bushnell yer will see a town thets clean greaser all ther way through an its ten ter one thar aint nary galoot besides ourselves in ther durned old place thet kin say a word of united states the westerner could talk spanish after a fashion and that was about all the natives of huejugilla el alto were able to do with the exception of the few whose blood was untainted and who claimed to be aristocrats however for all of their strange dialect and his imperfect spanish bushnell succeeded in making himself understood so they found lodgings at a low rambling adobe building which served as a hotel they paid in advance for one day and were well satisfied with the price although bushnell declared it was at least double ordinary rates we aint likely ter be long in town before ferez locates us an comes arter his hawses ther derned bandits are bold enough long ther line of ther railroad but they lay way over thet out hyar wuss then all ther people of ther towns kinder stand in with ther pizen varmints stand in with them how why hide em when ther soldiers is arter em an dont bother em at any other time i presume they are afraid of the bandits which explains why they do so afeared waal ill allow as how they may be but then thars something of ther bandit in evry blamed greaser i ever clapped peepers on theyre onery they are frank had noted that almost all westerners who mingled much with the people of mexico held spaniards and natives alike in contempt calling them all greasers he could not understand this for as he had observed the people of the country were exceedingly polite and chivalrous treating strangers with the utmost courtesy if courtesy were given in return rudeness seemed to shock and wound them causing them to draw within themselves as a turtle draws into its shell indeed so polite were the people that frank came to believe that a bandit who had decided to cut a mans throat and rob him would first beg a mans pardon for such rudeness and then proceed about the job with the greatest skill suavity and gentleness having settled at the hotel bushnell ordered a square meal and when it was served they proceeded to satisfy the hunger which had grown upon them with their journey across the desert bushnell also took care to look after the horses and equipments himself ef ferez calls fer his hawses i dont want him ter git away with this yar balloon an gas generator said the westerner as he saw the articles mentioned were placed under lock and key ef we should lose them itd be all up with us so fur as gittin ter ther silver palace is concerned frank expected to hear something from pacheco as soon as huejugilla el alto was reached but he found no message awaiting him poor professor he said i expect he has suffered untold torments since he was kidnaped yah nodded hans uf brofessor scotch dond peen britty sick uf dis vild life mit mexico you vos a liar that night they were sitting outside the hotel when they heard a great commotion at the southern end of the town vot vos dot gasped the dutch boy in alarm sounds like dere vos drouple aroundt dot logality thats right agreed frank feeling for his revolvers and it is coming this way as fast as it can mebbe another revolution has broke out observed bushnell lazily best git under kiver an let ther circus go by they could hear the clatter of horses hoofs the cracking of pistols and a mingling of wild cries all at once frank merriwell became somewhat excited on my life i believe i hear the voice of professor scotch he shouted yah said hans i belief i hear dot too they may be bringin ther professor in said bushnell ef hes thar well take an interest in ther case you bet yer boots into the hotel he dashed and in a moment he returned with his winchester along the street came a horseman clinging to the back of an unsaddled animal closely pursued by at least twenty wild riders some of whom were shooting at the legs of the fleeing horse while one was whirling a lasso to make a cast that must bring the animal to a sudden halt ten to one the fugitive is the professor shouted frank peering through the dusk then i reckon well hev ter chip in right hyar an now said bushnell calmly he flung the winchester to his shoulder and a spout of fire streamed from the muzzle in an instant the fellow who was whirling the lasso flung up his arm and plunged headlong from the horses back to the dust of the street professor professor shouted frank stop stop here cant do it came back the reply the horse wont stop jump off fall off get off some way all right here goes in another moment professor scotch for it really was that individual flung himself from the back of the animal he had ridden struck the ground rolled over and over like a ball and lay still within thirty feet of frank groaning dolefully in the meantime al bushnell was working his winchester in a manner that was simply amazing for a steady stream of fire seemed to pour from the muzzle of the weapon and the cracking of the weapon echoed through the streets of huejugilla el alto like the rattling fire from a line of infantry after that first shot bushnell lowered the muzzle of his weapon as in most cases at short range his motto was to shoot low for he well knew more lead could be wasted by shooting too high than in any other manner in about three seconds he had thrown the pursuing bandits into the utmost confusion for they had never before encountered such a reception in huejugilla el alto and it was the last thing they had expected with all possible haste they reined about and took to flight hearing the bullets whistling about them or feeling their horses leap madly at the sting of lead or go plunging to the ground the inhabitants of the town had fled into their houses before the rush of the bandits so there was little danger that any of bushnells bullets would reach innocent persons the confusion and rout of the bandits was brought about in a few seconds and bushnell was heard to mutter one white man is good fer a hundred onery greasers any time ther derned skunks haint got a blamed bit of sand frank ran and lifted the fallen professor flinging the man across his shoulder and carrying him into the hotel hans followed with frantic haste and bushnell came sauntering lazily in after the bandits had been routed and driven back are you badly hurt professor asked frank anxiously im killed groaned scotch dolefully im shot full of holes and every bone in my body is broken farewell my boy well meet in a better land where there are no bandits to molest or make afraid where are you shot everywhere all over you cant touch me where im not shot they fired more than four hundred bullets through

away then lets get away immediately fluttered the professor if i fall into their hands again im a dead man yes we will get out immediately decided frank but well do it as secretly and silently as possible bushnell nodded his satisfaction and thirty minutes later the party was ready to move they left the hotel by a back way and guided by the landlord made their way along dark and narrow streets creeping cautiously through the town till the outskirts were reached there frank gave the landlord some money and after calling down blessings on their heads he quickly slipped away and disappeared now well hustle right along said the westerner well put a good long stretch between ourselves an huejugilla el alto before mornin were off bound straight inter ther mountains and straight for the silver palace added frank chapter x the stranger they were fortunate in getting away without being seen by any of the bandits and at dawn they were well up into the mountains where bushnell found a secluded place for them to camp and rest as rest was something of which they all sorely stood in need bushnell prepared breakfast and frank insisted that professor scotch should explain how he escaped from pachecos gang dont ask me sighed the little man fondling his red whiskers i cant explain it really i cant why not well you see i dont know how i happened to do it they forced me to write that letter against my will two of them standing over me with drawn daggers while i was writing and prodding me a bit whenever i refused to put down the words pacheco ordered written then pacheco speaks english as well as i do what does he look like i dont know how is that he kept his face concealed with his serape quite up to his eyes thars a mystery about pacheco broke in bushnell no one seems ter know jest what ther varmint looks like go on professor urged frank tell us just how you escaped i tell you i do not know myself all i know is that they tied me to a horse and brought me across a plain of burning sand where i nearly perished for want of water and was nearly sawed in two by the backbone of the horse i rode i believed it was a case of gone goose with me at last they camped in a wild spot and i was so badly used up that i could scarcely eat or do anything but lay around and groan they seemed to think there was no need of watching me very closely and i noticed that i was alone sometimes then feeling utterly reckless i began to watch for a chance to sneak away i didnt care if i were shot or if i escaped and perished from hunger and thirst i was bound to make the attempt last night i made it a saddleless horse strayed along where i was and i made a jump for the animal before they knew what i was doing i was on the beasts back and yelling into its ears like a maniac the horse scooted out of the camp and i clung on the bandits pursued me and everything else is a haze till i heard frank calling for me to jump off i recognized his voice and fell off the horse although i had not the least idea in the world where i was waal chuckled bushnell thets wat i call dead fool luck beggin yer pardon fer speakin so open like at which i means no harm whatever oh ye neednt beg my pardon quickly said professor scotch i dont want any credit for getting away it wasnt a case of brains at all breakfast was prepared and they ate heartily after which frank hans and the professor lay down to sleep while bushnell smoked a black pipe but even bushnell was not made of iron and the pipe soothed him to slumber so the entire party slept with no one to guard all at once some hours later they were awakened by an exclamation from frank who sat up and stared at the form of a stranger the latter being quietly squatting in their midst calmly puffing at a cigarette while his poncho was wrapped about him to his hips franks exclamation awakened bushnell like an electric shock and even as his eyes opened his hand shot out the fingers grasping the butt of a revolver that was pointed straight at the stranger stiddy thar called the westerner i hev ther drop on yer an ill sock yer full of lead ef yer wiggle a toenail you hear me chirp the stranger continued smoking his coalblack eyes being the only part of him to move for all of the threatening revolver hans sat up gasping shimminy gristmas der pandits haf caught us alretty soon at this professor scotch gave a groan of dismay faintly gurgling then im a goner that the stranger was a halfblood could be seen at a glance drap thet cigaroot an give an account of yerself instanter right off ordered bushnell threateningly who in blazes be yer the cigarette fell from the mans lips and he answered i am rodeo waal who is rodeo the brother of pacheco dont i toldt you dot panted the dutch boy professor scotch groaned again and

whoopin distance i am alone there is no one within call waal wat be yer hyar fer thets what i wants ter know i found you asleep and i came to warn you of what danger the ladrones are on your trail

and there is an impostor in his place frank was impressed and his hand fell on bushnells arm i believe the fellow really speaks the truth he said he seems sincere and his eyes are square and steady

to kill the murderer of my brother and i will keep the oath thats why i am here i have been watching the band for two weeks i know every move they will make i know when you leave huejugilla el alto

why i have warned you seсors it is done and now i will go he arose to his feet heedless of bushnells command to keep still and strode toward the horses they saw an extra animal was there and in a moment he had flung himself on the creatures back buenos dias seсores a clatter of hoofs the flutter of a poncho and a crimson serape and rodeos horse was galloping up the ravine that still led deeper into the mountains man and horse soon vanished from view chapter xi the awakening volcano two days later shortly after sunset the party camped far in the depths of the sierra madre mountains the words of rodeo the halfblood had proved true for they were pursued by the bandits but thanks to the skill of bushnell they had been able to give the desperadoes the slip by ther end of another day we oughter be able ter clap our peepers on ther silver palace declared the westerner professor scotch was now as eager as any of them to see the wonderful palace all his doubts having been dispelled by bushnells straightforward narrative of the discovery of the place by himself and jack burk i wonder what causes that column of smoke we saw rising amid the mountains to the westward today said frank bushnell shook his head thet thar has troubled me some he admitted it seems ter be fair an squar in ther direction of ther silver palace maype dose pandits peen aheadt uf us und purn der balace up suggested hans with an air of very great wisdom i scarcely think they would be able to burn a building made of stone gold and silver smiled frank waal not much said bushnell ther palace will be thar when we arrive you neednt worry about thet they were very tired and feeling secure in the depths of a narrow ravine they soon slept with the exception of frank who had the first watch the moon came up over the mountain peaks which stood out plainly in the clear light every gorge and fissure being cut black as ink and showing with wonderful distinctness the shadow was deep in the narrow ravine and frank sat with his back to a wall of rock looking upward when he was startled to see a figure rise in the bright moonlight on the brink of the ravine above stood a man who seemed to be peering down at them awaken cried this man in a loud voice you are in great danger the cry aroused every sleeper and bushnell started up with his winchester clutched ready for use what is it he asked frank clutched his arm gasping merciful goodness look there look at that mans face can the dead return to life he pointed at the man on the brink of the ravine above them the light of the moon fell fairly on the face of this man which was plainly revealed to every one of the startled and thunderstruck party move lively down there cried the man with a warning gesture there have been spies upon you and pacheco knows where you have stopped for the night bushnell dropped his rifle clutching at the neck of his shirt and gasping for breath by ther livin gods he shouted its my pard jack burk or its his spook id vas a sbook gurgled hans dunnerwust quivering with fear id vos der sbook uf der man vot we seen deat as a toornail in truth the man on the brink of the ravine looked like jack burk who had been declared dead in the adobe hut near mendoza it is a resemblance it must be a resemblance muttered frank once more the man above uttered a warning you were trailed by a spy he declared the spy saw you camp here and he has gone to bring pacheco and the bandits they will be here soon if you escape you must move without further delay it not only looks like my pard said bushnell hoarsely but it has ther voice of my pard ef jack burk is dead thet shore is his spook and then as suddenly as he had appeared the man above vanished from view gone gasped professor scotch wiping the cold perspiration from his face i never took stock in ghosts before but now remember his warning cut in frank we had better heed it dot vos righd nodded hans yes thets right agreed bushnell well git out of hyar in a howlin hurry ef jack burk is dead then thet wuz his spook come to warn his old pard there was saddling and packing in hot haste and the little party was soon moving along the ravine for at least thirty minutes they hastened onward and then the westerner found a place where the horses could climb the sloping wall of the ravine and get out of the gorge it was no easy task to make the animals struggle to the top but bushnell succeeded in forcing them all up when the party was out of the ravine every one breathed with greater freedom there said frank i do not feel as if we might be caught like rats in a trap frank was the last to move from the ravine and just as he was about to do so he seemed to catch a glimpse of something moving silently in the darkness hist came the warning from his lips come here bushnell professor hans stay with the horses be cautious and come lively he flung himself on his face in the shadow of a great bowlder and peered down into the darkness below the westerner and the professor came creeping to his side what is it asked bushnell look directed frank what do you make of it peering down into the dark depths of the gorge they saw black figures flitting silently past men and horses as they were able to make out horsemen breathed the professor they must be the bandits but look came cautiously from franks lips they are riding swiftly yet the feet of their horses make no sound thats right gasped scotch great jupiter can they be more ghosts mysteries are crowding each other said frank bushnell was silent but he was watching and listening like a band of black phantoms the silent horsemen rode along the ravine and disappeared frank could hear the professors teeth chattering as if the man had a chill this bubbubbeats my tuttuttuttime confessed scotch i rather think wed better turn back and let the silver palace alone rot growled bushnell them varmints wuz pachecos gang an they hed the feet of their critters muffled thets all dont git leery fer thet all ther same ef jack burk or his spook hednt warned us them onery skunks wud hed us in a consarned bad trap this was the truth as they all knew and they were decidedly thankful to the mysterious individual who had warned them bushnell now resorted to the trick of covering the trail in order to do which it was necessary to muffle the feet of their horses and lead them over the rocky ground where their bandaged hoofs could make no mark at length he came to a stream and he led the way into the water following the course of the stream and having the others trail along in single file directly behind him when they halted again bushnell assured them that there was little danger that the bandits would be able to follow them closely and they rested without molestation till morning at daybreak the westerner was astir being alive with eagerness and impatience as he repeatedly declared they would behold the wonderful silver palace before another sunset eating a hasty breakfast they pushed forward with the westerner in the lead once more the tower of smoke which they had noted the day before was before them but now it seemed blacker and more ominous than on the previous day it was not far from midday when away to the westward they heard rumbling sounds like distant thunder vot id vas aind id asked hans in alarm i dond seen no dunder shower coming up somevere do i it did not seem like thunder said frank soberly it was more like a rumbling beneath the ground and i fancied the earth quivered a bit perhaps it is an earthquake put in the professor apprehensively i believe they have such convulsions of nature in this part of the world bushnell said nothing but there was a troubled look on his face and he urged them all forward at a still swifter pace the smoke tower was now looming near at hand and they could see it shift and sway grow thin and roll up in a dense black mass it cast a gloom over their spirits and made them all feel as if some frightful disaster was impending again and again at irregular intervals they heard the sullen rumbling and once all were positive the earth shook it was noticed that directly after each rumbling the smoke rolled up in a thick black mass that shut out the light of the sun and overcast the heavens the professor was for turning back but bushnell was determined to go forward and frank was equally resolute hans had very little to say but his nerves were badly shaken in less than an hour we shall be able to see the silver palace assured bushnell we would be fools to turn back now so they went on and at last they climbed to the top of a rise from which point the westerner assured them that the palace could be seen an aweinspiring spectacle met their gaze they looked across a great gulf from which the smoke was rolling upward in clouds and out of which came the sullen mutterings they had heard merciful goodness cried professor scotch it must be the crater of a volcano yah gasped hans und der volcano vos doin pusiness at der oldt standt alretty yet the volcano may have been dormant for centuries said the professor but it is coming to life now where is the silver palace demanded frank bushnell clutched the boys arm with a grip of iron pointing straight through the smoke clouds that rose before them look he shouted hoarsely it is thar see the smoke grows thinner an thar she am see her glitter in thet thar palace is stored enough treasure ter make us richer then ther richest men in ther world an ten thousand volcanoes aint goin ter keep me from it you bet yer boots true enough through the parted smoke clouds gleamed the towers and turrets of the wonderful palace that had remained hidden in the heart of the mountains hundreds of years jealously guarded by the fierce natives who believed it sacred and who had kept the secret well from the outside world chapter xii doom of the silver palace bushnell leaped from his horse and began tearing the packs from the backs of the led animals he worked with mad haste and there was an awesome insane glare in his eyes the man is crazy roared professor scotch the volcano is certain to break forth before long it must be on the verge of breaking forth now if we remain here we are doomed oxcuse me fluttered hans i vos retty to gone righd avay queek the professor turned to frank with his appeal come boy lets get away before destruction comes upon us we must not remain here frank sprang down from his snorting horse flung the rein to hans and leaped to bushnells side you are mad to think of remaining here he said swiftly come away and we will return when the volcano is at peace no thundered the treasureseeker i will not go the silver palace is there and i mean to have my share of the treasure go if you are afraid but here i stay till the balloon is inflated and i can cross the chasm the wind is right for it and nothing shall stop me he picketed the horses and began ripping open the packs frank turned to professor scotch saying quietly bushnell will not go and i shall stay with him at the same time i advise you to go take hans with you and get away from here leave a plain trail and bushnell will be able to follow it if we succeed in reaching the palace and returning alive the professor entreated frank to change his mind but the lad was determined and nothing could alter that determination at last scotch gave up in despair groaning if you stay i stay i am your guardian but you seem to have things all your own way if this volcano cooks us all you will be to blame for it frank said no word but went about the task of assisting bushnell in the work of inflating the balloon the westerner had a gas generator which he was getting in order as soon as this was ready the balloon was unrolled spread out drawn up by means of poles and lines and then secured to the ground by one stout rope which was hitched about the base of a great bowlder then bushnell built a fire and set the gas generator at work in the meantime the volcano had continued to mutter at intervals the clouds of smoke parted and they saw the wonderful silver palace standing on a plateau beyond the chasm the palace seemed to cast a spell over them all and they felt the fever of the goldhunter beginning to burn in their throbbing veins it was more than an hour after their arrival that the balloon began to fill with gas and frank uttered a cheer as he saw the silk bulging like a bladder that is inflated with wind ha ha laughed bushnell wildly in a few minutes well go sailin over ther gulf right through ther smoke ter ther silver palace ha ha ha the mans face was flushed till it was nearly purple and his eyes were bloodshot the fever had fastened itself firmly upon him more and more did the balloon expand bushnell had brought out a folding car which he securely attached in ten minutes more well be ready for the trip he shouted at that instant a series of wild cries reached their ears and turning swiftly they saw a band of darkfaced men pouring through a fissure in the rocks to the north of them shimminy gristmas cried hans dunnerwust in terror dot seddles us who is it who are they fluttered the professor they look like bandits acknowledged frank it is pachecos band cried bushnell hastily securing his rifle ther pizen varmints hev come ten minutes too soon ther balloon would take us all over in another ten minutes but now it wont carry more than two we must hold ther skunks off till she fills right shouted frank merriwell and we must be ready to go the instant she does fill we cant hold em back long for we have no shelter here professor hans into that car get in i say and be ready well try to stand the whelps off till the balloon is inflated but we must be ready to start at any instant professor scotch and hans were hastily bundled into the car the bandits hesitated long enough to gather and prepare for the charge with their chief in the lead it was plain they saw the treasureseekers had no shelter and they meant to close in without delay reddy for em frank called bushnell dropping on one knee his winchester in his hands theyre comin right soon this was true with mad cries and a fusillade of shots the bandits charged bushnell opened fire and frank followed his example several of the bandits were seen to fall but still the others came on lead wont stop em snarled the westerner itll be hand ter hand in a jiffy and that means well get wiped out the balloon wont carry moren two possibly three in with ye boy you may escape it dont make any diffrunce bout an old coon like me not much will i get in and leave you cried frank we are partners in this expedition and partners well stay to the end but ther others ther professor an ther dutch boy they might escape if they shall escape out flashed a knife in frank merriwells hand and with one sweeping slash he severed the strong rope that held the tugging tossing balloon to the earth away shot the balloon a cry of amazement and horror breaking from the lips of the professor and hans mein gootness gasped the dutch boy vot vos happened ill tell you groaned the professor the balloon could not carry all four of us and frank merriwell like the noble generous hotheaded foolish boy he is refused to leave bushnell at the same time he would not doom us and he cut the rope setting the balloon free he has remained behind to die at bushnells side led me git oudt sobbed hans i vant to go pack und die mit him it was too late now look see there we are directly over the silver palace what a beautiful the professors words were interrupted by a frightful rumbling roar that came up from the gulf surrounding the plateau on which the palace stood all the way around that gulf a sheet of flame seemed to leap upward through smoke and then paralyzed helpless hypnotized by the spectacle they saw the plateau and the palace sink and disappear into the blackness of a great void then like a black funeral pall the smoke rolled up about them and shut off their view but they knew that never again would the eyes of any human being behold the marvelous silver palace of the sierra madre mountains when the balloon had ascended higher another current of air was encountered and the course changed away they floated over the mountain peaks and out beyond the great range at last they came down made a safe landing and to their satisfaction found themselves within a mile of huejugilla el alto they had escaped the most frightful perils but professor scotchs heart lay like lead in his bosom and hans dunnerwust was not to be comforted for they had left frank merriwell to his doom in huejugilla el alto they remained four days neither of them seeming to have energy enough to do anything and on the fourth day frank al bushnell and two others rode into town and stopped at the hotel picture the meeting between frank and his friends hans shed nearly a bucketful of joyful tears and professor scotch actually swooned from sheer amazement and delight when the professor recovered he clung to franks hands saying this is the happiest moment of my life if i am not dreaming frank my dear boy i never expected to see you again how did you escape the eruption of the volcano broke the bandits up explained frank and by the time they had recovered and were ready to come at us again a band of natives headed by rodeo pachecos brother came down on them a terrible battle ensued the bandits were defeated many of them slain among the latter being the false pacheco and whom do you fancy the impostor proved to be professor i havent the least idea he was my villainous cousin carlos merriwell and he is dead yes that is a good thing he will not trouble you any more no i shall never be troubled by him again with rodeo and the natives was jack burk jack burk the man is dead not quite professor declared a familiar voice and burk himself stepped forward i am still quite lively for a dead man but i saw you dead declared the astounded professor you saw me nearly dead but not quite you remember i told you of a native who had found me in the hut and how he had said it was not a fever that ailed me but was a trouble brought on by drinking the water of the spring near the hut yes i remember and i told you the native hastily left me left me to die alone as i supposed i remember that he did not leave me to die but went for an antidote while you were away he returned and administered some of the antidote for the poison bringing me around although but a feeble spark of life fluttered in my bosom then he took me on his shoulders and carried me from the hut to another place of shelter where he brought me back to my full strength in a remarkably brief space of time i understand why we did not find you said the professor we followed the bandits jack burk continued this native was rodeo the brother of the true pacheco and he is here rodeo stepped forward bowing with the politeness of a spanish don rodeo made me swear to aid him in hunting down the murderer of his brother that was the pay he asked for saving my life i gave the oath and it was his whim that i should not reveal myself to you till the right time came but when i saw the spy tracking you saw him locate you and saw him hasten to tell the bandits i was forced to appear and give a warning we took you for a ghost i thought it possible you might and i fancied that might cause you to give all the more heed to the warning well of all remarkable things that ever happened in my life these events of the past few days take the lead declared scotch however i have come through all dangers in safety and i am happy for frank is alive and well but the silver palace is gone with all its marvelous treasure said frank thets right boy nodded bushnell gloomily ther palace has sunk inter ther earth an nary galoot ever gits ther benefit of all ther treasure it contained dont take it so hard partner said jack burk mexico is the land of treasures and we may strike something else before we cross the death divide vell sighed hans dunnerwust you beoples can hunt for dreasure all you dond vant to but i haf enough uf dis pusiness alretty soon i nefer vos puilt for so much oxcitemend und i vos goin to took der next drain for home as soon as i can ged to him uf i dond done dot i vos afrait mein mutter vill nefer seen her leedle hansie some more i fancy i have had quite enough of mexico for the present smiled frank the united states will do me a while longer and so if you are going home hans professor scotch and myself will accompany you till we strike uncle sams domain at least a few days later bidding their friends adieu they left mexico taking their way northward to new orleans where new adventures awaited them as the chapters to follow will prove chapter xiii a stampede in a city it was the day before mardi gras in new orleans and the queen city of the south was in her gayest attire being thronged with visitors from the north and from almost every part of the world it was monday when rex king of the carnival comes to town and takes possession of the city early in the forenoon the river front in the vicinity of canal street was thronged with people seeking advantageous positions from which to witness the kings landing it was a jovial goodnatured gathering such as is never seen in any other city every one seemed to have imbibed the spirit of the occasion and there was no friction or unpleasantness every one was exceedingly polite and courteous and all seemed to feel it a duty to make the occasion as pleasant for other folks as possible the shipping along the river was decorated and flags flew everywhere the sun never shone more brightly and new orleans never presented more subtle allurements seated in a private carriage that had stopped at a particularly favorable spot were professor scotch and frank who had arrived a few days before professor said frank who was almost bursting with pentup enthusiasm and youthful energy this makes a fellow feel that it is good to be living in all the places we have visited i have seen nothing like this i am sorry hans is no longer with us to enjoy it and you will see nothing like it anywhere in this country but right here declared the professor who was also enthused northern cities may get up carnivals but they allow the spirit of commerce to crowd in and push aside the true spirit of pleasure in all their pageants and processions may be seen schemes for advertising this that or the other but here you will see nothing of the kind in the procession today and the parade tomorrow you will see no trade advertisements no schemes for calling attention to dr somebodyorothers cure for ingrowing corns nothing but the beautiful and the artistic frank laughed its seldom you speak like this professor he said you must be in love with the south i am a northerner but i think the south very beautiful and i admire the people of the south more than i can tell i do not know as they are naturally more gentle and kindhearted than northerners but they are certainly more courteous and chivalrous despite their quick tempers and more passionate dispositions northerners are too brusque if they ask pardon for rudeness they do it as if they regretted the breath spent in uttering the words it is quite the opposite with southerners for they seem hold on professor interrupted frank you may tell me all about that some other time hark hear the whistles on the river the king must be coming yes he is coming there was a stir among the people a murmur ran over the great throng then the royal yacht accompanied by more than a dozen other steamers all gayly decorated was seen approaching the great crowd began to cheer hundreds of whistles shrieked and roared at the same instant bands of music were playing and as the royal yacht drew near the levee at the foot of canal street the booming of cannons added to the mad uproar of joy all over the great gathering of gayly dressed people handkerchiefs fluttered and hats were waved in the air while laughing excited faces were seen everywhere the mad excitement filled frank merriwells veins and he stood erect in the carriage waving his hat and cheering with the cheering thousands although there was such an uproar at that moment that he could scarcely hear his own voice the king attired in purple and gold was seen near the bow of the royal yacht surrounded by courtiers and admirers to franks wonder a dozen policemen had been able to keep canal street open for the procession from the levee as far as could be seen elsewhere and on each side of the street the throng packed thickly but they seemed to aid the police in the work of holding the street clear so there was no trouble at all not once had frank seen the pushing and swaying so often seen when great crowds assemble in northern cities and not once had the policemen been compelled to draw a club to enforce orders as the royal yacht drew into the jetty a gathering of city officers and leading citizens formed to greet and welcome him these gentlemen were known as dukes of the realm and constituted the royal court they were decorated with badges of gold and bogus jewels the yacht drew up at the levee and king rex accompanied by his escort landed where he was greeted with proper ceremony by the dukes of the realm then the king was provided with a handsomely decorated carriage which he entered and a procession was formed the kings carriage somewhat resembled a chariot being drawn by four mettlesome coalblack horses all gayly caparisoned with gold and silver trimmings and nodding plumes a magnificent band of music headed the procession and then came a barge that was piled high with beautiful and fragrant flowers in this barge was a girl who seemed to be dressed entirely in flowers and there was a crown of flowers on her head she was masked but did not seem to be more than sixteen or seventeen years of age she was known as the queen of flowers and other girls ladies of the court dressed entirely in white accompanied her the kings carriage followed the flower barge and directed by the queen who was seated on a throne of flowers the girls scattered flowers beneath the feet of the horses now and then laughingly pelting some one in the throng with them as the procession started the cannons boomed once more and the steam whistles shrieked and then in less than a minute there came a startling interruption the cheering of the people on one of the side streets turned to shrieks of terror and warning and the crowd was seen to make a mad rush for almost any place of shelter whats the matter frank asked professor scotch in alarm dont know was the reply as frank mounted to the carriage seat on which he stood to obtain a view why it seems that there are wild cattle in the street and theyre coming this way good gracious gasped the professor drive on driver get out of the way quickly thats impossible sir replied the driver immediately if i drive on we are liable to be overturned by the rushing crowd it is safer to keep still and remain here those cattle look like texas longhorns cried frank so they are sir assured the driver they have broken out of the yard in which they were placed this morning they were brought here on a steamer texas longhorns on a stampede in a crowded city fluttered frank that means damage no end of it in truth nearly half a hundred wild texan steers driven to madness by the shrieking whistles and thundering cannons had broken out of the fraily constructed yard and at least a dozen of them had stampeded straight toward canal street persons crushed against each other and fell over each other in frantic haste to get out of the way for the cattle to pass some were thrown down and trampled on by the fearstricken throng men shouted hoarsely and women shrieked mad with terror blinded by dust furious with the joy of sudden freedom the texan steers heads lowered horns glistening eyes glowing redly and nostrils steaming charged straight into the crowd it was a terrible spectacle for heavens sake is there no way of stopping those creatures cried frank well all be killed quavered professor scotch into canal street rushed the crowd and the procession was broken up in a moment the one thought of everybody seemed to be to get out of the way of the steers the horses on the flower barge became unmanageable turned short snorting with terror and upset the barge spilling flowers girls and all into the street then in some way the animals broke away leaving the wrecked barge where it had toppled the girls with one exception sprang up and fled in every direction the one exception was the queen of flowers who lay motionless and apparently unconscious in the street with the beautiful flowers piled on every side of her she is hurt cried frank who was watching her why doesnt some one pick her up they do not see her there amid the flowers palpitated the professor they do not know she has not fled with the other girls the cattle the steers will crush her shouted the driver not if i can save her rang out the clear voice of our hero professor scotch made a clutch at the lad but too late to catch and hold him frank leaped from the carriage clearing the heads of a dozen persons struck on his feet in the street tore his way through the rushing excited mob and reached the side of the unconscious flower queen he lifted her from the ground and at that very instant a mad steer with lowered head and bristling horns charged blindly at them chapter xiv the hot blood of youth a cry of horror went up from those who beheld the peril of the brave boy and the queen of flowers for it looked as if both must be impaled by the wicked horns of the mad steer well it was that frank was a lad of nerve with whom at such a moment to think was to act well it was that he had the muscles and strength of a trained athlete frank did not drop the girl to save himself as most lads would have done she felt no heavier than a feather in his arms but it seemed that he would be unable to save himself if he were unincumbered had he leaped ahead he could not have escaped with all the energy he possessed he sprang backward at the same time swinging the girl away from the threatening horns so that his own body protected her in case he was not beyond reach of the steer in such a case and in such a situation inches count and it proved thus in this instance one of the steers horns caught franks coat sleeve at the shoulder and ripped it open to the flesh as far as his elbow the sharp point seeming to slit the cloth like a keen knife but frank was unharmed and the unconscious girl was not touched then the steer crashed into the flower barge frank was not dazed by his remarkable escape and he well knew the peril might not be over like a leaping panther the boy sprang from the spot avoiding other mad steers and frantic men and women darted here and there through the flying throng and reached a place where he believed they would be safe it was a brave and nervy act the act of a true hero the stampeded steers dashed on and the danger at that point was past men and women had been trampled and bruised but remarkable though it seemed when the steers were finally captured or dispatched it was found that no person had been killed outright men crowded about frank and the flower girl the lad had placed the girl upon some steps and he called for water remove her mask directed some one give her air yes remove her mask cried scores of voices they were eager to see her face that they might again recognize the girl who had passed through such peril frank hesitated although he also longed to look on the face of the girl he had saved she was most beautifully formed for a girl of her age and that her face was pretty he had not a doubt he reached out his hand to unfasten the mask as he did so his wrist was clutched by strong fingers and a panting voice hissed in his ear would you do it well you shall not i will take charge of that young lady if you please looking over his shoulder frank saw the dark excited face of a youth of twenty or twentyone that face was almost wickedly handsome although there was something decidedly repellent about it the eyes were black as midnight while the lips were full and red with a twisting snap frank freed his wrist you he said calmly who are you one who knows this unfortunate young lady and has a right to protect her which is ver true sah declared a man with a bristling white mustache and imperial who stood just behind the youth with the dark face i give you my word of honah sah that it is true the words were spoken with great suavity and politeness and frank noted that the speaker seemed to have a military air frank hesitated and then straightened up stepping back and bowing as he said that settles it gentlemen if you know the young lady i have nothing more to say the young man instantly lifted the flower queen in his arms as he did so she opened her eyes and frank saw she was looking straight at his face then came a staggering surprise for the boy from the north he saw the girls lips part and he distinctly heard her faintly exclaim frank merriwell frank fell back a step then started forward you you know me he cried quick as a flash the youth with the dark face passed the girl to the man with the white mustache and imperial and the latter bore her through the throng to a carriage frank would have followed but the darkfaced youth blocked the way saying harshly hold on you did her a service how much do i owe you stand aside came sharply from franks lips she knows me she spoke my name i must find out who she is that you cannot do who will prevent it i will frank measured the other from head to heels with his eyes stand aside now dont go to putting on any airs with me my smart youngster by sheer luck you were able to save her from possible injury like all northerners you have your price for every service how much do i owe you franks face was hot with anger you say like all northerners but it is well for the south that you are not a representative southerner you are an insolent cad and a puppy you have insulted me i simply returned what you gave and it shall cost you dear hissed the youth with the dark face quickly he leaned forward and struck franks cheek with his open hand then something else happened like a bolt franks fist shot out and caught the other under the chin hurling him backward into the arms of a man behind him where he lay gasping and dazed frank would have rushed toward the carriage but he saw it move swiftly away carrying the mysterious queen of flowers and with deep regret he realized he was too late the man with the bristling white mustache and imperial did not depart in the carriage but he again forced his way through the crowd and found his companion slowly recovering from the stunning blow he had received mistah raymon sah what does this mean he cried in amazement it means that i have been insulted and struck hissed the one questioned quivering with unutterable anger struck sah cried the man in unbounded amazement you were struck impossible sah impossible it is true who struck you sah this young coxcomb of a northern cur the man glared at frank who with his hands on his hips was quietly awaiting developments apparently not at all alarmed he did not quail in the least before the fierce fireeating look given him by the man with the bristling mustache and imperial if this ah young gentleman struck you mistah raymon sah there can be but one termination of the affaiah he will have to meet you sah on the field or humbly apologize at once thats right blustered the young man fiercely ill have his life or an instant apology frank smiled as if he were quite amused as i happen to feel that i am the one to whom an apology is due you will have to be satisfied with taking my life he said the youth with the dark face drew out a handsome card case from which he extracted an engraved card which he haughtily handed to frank who accepted it and read aloud mr rolf raymond a very pretty name allow me my card mr raymond i am stopping at the st charles hotel you will be able to find me without difficulty rest assured that a friend of mine will call on you without delay mr merriwell stiffly said raymond thrusting franks card into his pocket professor scotch had forced his way through the crowd in time to catch the drift of this and the full significance of it dawned upon him filling him with amazement and horror this will not do it will never do he spluttered dueling is a thing of the past there is a law for it i will not have it frank you hotheaded young rascal what do you mean by getting into such a scrape keep cool professor said the boy calmly if this young gentleman insists on forcing me into a duel i cannot take water i must give him satisfaction i tell you i wont have it roared the little man in his big hoarse voice his face getting very red i am your guardian you are a minor and i forbid you to fight a duel if mistah merriwell will apologize it is possible that considering his age sah mistah raymon will not press this mattah smoothly said the man with the bristling mustache what has he to apologize for asked scotch he struck mistah raymon sah did you do that frank yes but he struck me first he did eh roared the professor getting very red in the face well i dont think youll apologize frank and youre not going to fight youre a boy let him take a man if he wants to fight anybody im just his hairpin and ill agree to do him up with any kind of a weapon from a broadax to a bologna sausage chapter xv mystery of the flower queen frank looked at professor scotch in amazement for he had never known the little man to use such language or show such spirit in the face of actual danger i wonder if the professor has been drinking and if so where he got his drinks was the thought that flashed through franks mind mistah raymon sah has no quarrel with you sah said the individual with the bristling mustache if there is to be any further trouble sah i will attend to your case you who are you i sah am colonel la salle vallier the ver particular friend of mistah raymon if yo say so we will exchange cards sah then we will exchange here is mine and here sah is mine this said colonel vallier precludes yo from interfering in this othah affair professor scotch hey it does hows that id like to know i am at your service professor bowed the colonel you shall make such arrangements as yo choose pistols or swords make no difference to me for i am a dead shot and an expert swordsman i trust yo will excuse us now gentlemen we will see yo later goodday he locked arms with the young man and they turned away with a sweeping salute the throng parted and they passed through professor scotch stood staring after them till frank tapped him on the shoulder saying come professor we may as well get out of this excusea me seсors said a soft musical voice and a young man with a spanish face and pink cheeks was bowing before them i tink you needa to be tole bout it told about what demanded frank who took an instant dislike to this softly smiling fellow with the womanish voice and gentle ways what do you mean excusea me repeated the stranger who was gaudily dressed in many colors yo are strangarars from de noath an yo do not knowa de men what you have a de troub wid excusea me i am manuel

you for your kind advice said frank quietly i presume it is well meant but it is wasted this is a free country and a dozen fireeaters like colonel la salle vallier and mr rolf raymond cannot drive us out of new orleans till we are ready to go eh professor well i guess not rumbled the little man stiffening up and looking as fierce as he could oh ver well ver well said mazaro lifting his eyebrows the ghost of a scornful smile on his face you knowa your own biz goodday seсors goodday sir they passed through the crowd and sought their carriage which was waiting for them although the driver had begun to think they had deserted him the procession which had been broken up by the stampeded steers was again forming making it evident that the pleasureloving people were determined that the unfortunate occurrence should not ruin the day the queen of flowers and her subjects had vanished and the flower barge was a wreck so a part of the programme could not be carried out the procession formed without the flower barge and was soon on its way once more the band playing its liveliest tune the way was lined with tens of thousands of spectators while flags fluttered from every building all along the line the king was greeted with cheers and bared heads it was a most magnificent spectacle the carriage bearing frank and the professor had found a place in the procession through the skill of the driver and the man and boy were able to witness this triumphal entrance of king rex to the crescent city at the city hall the duke of crescent city who was the mayor welcomed rex with great pomp and ceremony presenting him the keys and the freedom of the city shortly afterward the king mysteriously disappeared and the procession broke up and dispersed frank and the professor returned to the st charles hotel both feeling decidedly hungry frank had little to say after they had satisfied their hunger and were in their suite of rooms he had seemed to be thinking all the while and the professor again repeated a question that he had asked several times what in the world makes you so glum frank what are you thinking about the queen of flowers was the reply my boy cried the professor enthusiastically i am proud of you yes sir proud but at one time i thought you were done for that steer was right upon you and i could see no way for you to escape the creatures horns i held my breath expecting to see you impaled and then i saw you escape with no further injury than the slitting of your coat sleeve but to this minute i cant say how you did it frank scarcely seemed to hear the professors words he sat with his hand to his head his eyes fixed on a pattern in the carpet she knew my name he muttered she spoke it distinctly there can be no doubt about that professor scotch groaned dismally there you go again he exclaimed now what are you mumbling about the queen of flowers confound the queen of flowers exploded scotch you saved her life at the risk of your own but you dont know her from adam she knows me how is that she spoke my name you must be mistaken i am not professor scotch looked incredulous why she was unconscious she was when i saved her from the steer and she recovered afterward yes just as colonel vallier was taking her to the carriage and she spoke your name then yes first i saw her open her eyes and i noticed that she was looking straight at me then i heard her distinctly but faintly pronounce my name the professor still looked doubtful you were excited my boy and you imagined it no professor it was no case of imagination i know she called me frank merriwell but what puzzles me is the fact that this young cad raymond was determined i should not speak with her and she was carried away quickly why should they wish to keep us from having a few words of conversation that is a question i cannot answer frank theres a mystery here professor a mystery i mean to solve i am going to find out who the queen of flowers really is and get into more trouble you hotheaded young rascal i should think you were in trouble enough already with a possible duel impending a twinkle of mischief showed in franks eyes how about yourself professor oh the young scoundrel wont dare to meet me blustered scotch throwing out his chest and strutting about the room but he is not the one you will have to meet you exchanged cards with colonel la salle vallier as a mere matter of courtesy that might go in the north but you exchanged under peculiar circumstances and taking everything into consideration i have no doubt but you will be waited on by a friend of colonel vallier you will have to meet him hey roared the professor turning pale is it possible that such a result will come from a mere matter of politeness why im no fighter frank im no bloodandthunder ruffian i did not mean to hint that i wished to meet the colonel on the field of honor but you have and you cant back out now you heard what manuel mazaro had to say about him he is a dead shot and a skilled swordsman oh professor my heart bleeds for you but you shall have a great funeral and ill plant tiddlywink posies all over your grave cжsars ghost groaned scotch collapsing on a chair and looking very ill indeed this is a terrible scrape i dont feel well i fear i am going to be very ill chapter xvi professor scotch feels ill frank found it impossible to restrain his laughter longer and he gave way to it ha ha ha he merrily shouted you surely look ill professor id like to have your picture now ha ha ha it would make a firstrate picture for a comic paper this is no laughing matter came dolefully from scotch i dont know how to fire a pistol and i never had a sword in my hand in all my life and to think of standing up and being shot full of holes or carved like a turkey by that fireeater with the fierce mustache it is awful awful but you were eager to fight the young fellow no i was not i was simply putting up a bluff as you call it i was doing my level best to get you out of the scrape frank i didnt think he would fight me and so i pretended to be eager to meet him and now see what a scrape i am in oh my soul and body what can i do fight never i dont see how you can get out of it ill run away in a moment frank became very grave that is impossible professor he said with the utmost apparent sincerity think of the disgrace it would be in all the papers that professor scotch a whitelivered northerner after insulting colonel la salle vallier and presenting his card had taken to his heels in the most cowardly fashion and had fled from the city without giving the colonel the satisfaction that is due from one gentleman to another the northern papers would copy and you would find yourself the butt of ridicule wherever you went the professor let out a groan that was more dismal and doleful than any sound that had previously issued from his lips what can i do he gasped there is one way to get out of the difficulty name it name it shouted the wretched man ill do anything then commit suicide the professor collapsed again are you entirely heartless he moaned can you joke when i am suffering such misery his face was covered with perspiration and he was all aquiver so that frank was really touched you can apologize professor apologize for what i dont know that i have done anything to apologize for but then ill apologize rather than fight well i guess youll be able to get out of it some way but it was no easy thing to reassure the agitated man as frank soon discovered ill tell you what professor said the boy you may send a representative a substitute i dont think it will be easy to find a substitute oh ill find one perhaps colonel vallier will not accept him but you must be too ill to meet the colonel and then hell have to accept the substitute or nothing but who will act as substitute i dont know any one in new orleans wholl go and be shot in my place barney mulloy has agreed to join us here and he may arrive on any train went on frank mentioning an old school chum that wild irishman cried the professor hopefully why hed fight a pack of wildcats and think it fun yes barney is happiest when in trouble according to my uncles will i am at liberty to carry a companion besides my guardian on my travels and so when hans dunnerwust got tired of traveling and went home i sent for barney knowing hed be a firstclass fellow to have with me he finally succeeded in making arrangements to join us and i have a telegram from him stating that he would start in time to reach here before tomorrow if you are forced into trouble professor barney can serve as a substitute that sounds very well but colonel vallier would not accept a boy then barney can disguise himself and pretend to be a man im afraid it wont work not that barney mulloy will hesitate to help me out of the scrape for he was the most daredevil chap in fardale academy next to yourself frank you were the leader in all kinds of daring adventures but barney made a good second but he cant pass muster as a man perhaps he can but you have not yet received a challenge from colonel vallier so dont worry about what may not happen i cant help worrying i shall not take any further pleasure in life till we get out of this dreadful city oh brace up come on lets go out and see the sights no frank no my boy i am indisposed i am quite ill besides that i might meet colonel vallier i shall remain in my room for the present so frank was obliged to go out alone and when he returned for supper he found the professor in bed looking decidedly like a sick man i am very ill frank very ill scotch declared i fear i am in for a protracted illness nonsense professor why youll miss all the fun tomorrow and were here to see the sport confound the sport i wish we had stayed away from this miserable place why you were very enthusiastic over new orleans and the people of the south this morning hang the people of the south hang them all theyre too hotheaded theyre altogether too ready to fight over nothing now im a peaceable man and i cant fight i simply cant well well i dont fancy youll have to fight said frank whose conscience was beginning to smite him then ill have to apologize and ill be jiggered if i know what im going to apologize for what makes you so sure youll have to apologize look at this read it the professor drew an envelope from beneath his pillow and passed it to frank the envelope contained a note which the boy was soon reading it was from colonel vallier and demanded an apology giving the professor until the following noon in which to make it and hinting that a meeting of honor would surely follow if the apology was not forthcoming whew whistled frank this does seem like business when did you receive this shortly after you went out i scarcely thought the colonel would press the affair theres a letter for you on the table from whom is it dont know raymond i suppose the same messenger brought them both frank picked up the letter and tore it open it proved to be from rolf raymond and was worded much like the note to professor scotch the warm blood of anger mounted to the boys cheeks this settles it he exclaimed mr rolf raymond shall have all the fight he wants i am a good pistol shot and more than a fair swordsman at fardale i was the champion with the foils if he thinks i am a coward and a greenhorn because i come from the north he may find he has made a serious mistake the professor literally writhed in the bed but you may be killed and id never forgive myself he moaned killed or not i cant show the white feather cried frank warmly i do not believe in duelling nor do i but i have found it necessary to do some things i do not believe in i am not going to run and i am not going to apologize for i believe an apology is due me if any one this being the case ill have to fight oh what a scrape what a dreadful scrape groaned scotch wringing his hands why did we ever come here oh do brace up professor cried frank impatiently we have been in worse scrapes than this and you were not so badly broken up it was only a short time ago down in mexico that pachecos bandits hemmed us in on one side and there was a raging volcano on the other but still we live and have our health ill guarantee well pull through this scrape and ill bet we come out with flying colors you may feel like meeting rolf raymond but i simply cant stand up before that fireeating colonel there seems to be considerable bluster about this business and ill wager something you wont have to stand up before him if you will put on a bold front and makebelieve you are eager to meet him oh my boy you dont know you cant tell come professor get out of bed and dress we want to see the parade this evening they say it will be great oh i wish the parades were all at the bottom of the sea we couldnt see them then for were not mermaids or fishes will you never be serious i dont know perhaps i may when im too sick to be otherwise are you going to get up no do you mean to stay in bed yes and miss the parade tonight i dont care for the old parade well i do and im going to see it will you see some newspaper reporters and state that i am very ill dangerously ill that i am dying do this favor for me frank colonel vallier cant force a dying man to meet him in a duel i am shocked and pained professor that you should wish me to tell a lie even to save your life but ill see what i can do for you chapter xvii led into a trap frank ate alone and went forth alone to see the parade the professor remained in bed apparently in a state of utter collapse the night after mardi gras in new orleans the krewe of proteus holds its parade and ball the parade is a most dazzling and magnificent spectacle and the ball is no less splendid the streets along which the parade must pass were lined with a dense mass of people on both sides while windows and balconies were filled shortly after the appointed time the parade started it consisted of a series of elaborate and gorgeous floats the whole forming a line many blocks in length hundreds of flaring torches threw their lights over the moving tableau and it was indeed a splendid dream never before had frank seen anything of the kind onehalf as beautiful and he was sincerely glad they had reached the crescent city in time to be present at mardi gras the stampede of the texan steers and the breaking up of the parade that day had made a great sensation in new orleans every one had heard of the peril of the flower queen and how she was rescued by a handsome youth who was said to be a visitor from the north but whom nobody seemed to know now the krewe of proteus was composed entirely of men and it was their policy to have nobody but men in their parade these men were to dress as fairies of both sexes as they were required to appear in the tableau of fairyland but the managers of the affair had conceived the idea that it would be a good scheme to reconstruct the wrecked flower barge and have the queen of flowers in the procession but the queen of flowers seemed to be a mystery to every one and the managers knew not how to reach her they made many inquiries and it became generally known that she was desired for the procession late in the afternoon the managers received a brief note purporting to be from the flower queen assuring them that she would be on hand to take part in the evening parade the flower barge was put in repair and piled high with the most gorgeous and dainty flowers and surmounting all was a throne of flowers before the time for starting the mysterious masked queen and her attendants in white appeared when the procession passed along the streets the queen was recognized everywhere and the throngs cheered her loudly but out of the thousands hundreds were heard to say where is the strange youth who saved her from the mad steer he should be on the same barge franks heart leaped as he saw the mysterious girl in the procession there she is was his thought how can i follow her how can i trace her and find out who she is as the barge came nearer he forced his way to the very edge of the crowd that lined the street without having decided what he would do but hoping she would see and recognize him when the barge was almost opposite he stepped out a little from the line and lifted his hat she saw him in a moment as if she had been looking for him she caught the crown of flowers from her head and tossed them toward him crying for the hero he caught them skillfully with his right hand his hat still in his left and the hot blood mounted to his face as he saw her tossing kisses toward him with both hands whats it mean asked a spectator dont know answered another but a third cried ill tell you what it means that young fellow is the one who saved the queen of flowers from the mad steer i know him for i saw him do it and i observed his face that explains why she flung her crown to him and called him the hero yes that explains it three cheers for the hero hurrah hurrah hurrah the crowd burst into wild cheering and there was a general struggle to get a fair view of frank merriwell who had suddenly become the object of attention the splendors of the parade being forgotten for the time frank was confused and bewildered and he sought to get away as quickly as possible hoping to follow the queen of flowers but he found his way blocked on every hand and a hundred voices seemed to be asking whats your name where do you belong wont you please tell us your name havent i seen you in new york arent you from chicago somewhat dazed though he was frank noted that beyond a doubt the ones who were so very curious and who so rudely demanded his name were visitors in new orleans more than that from their appearance they were people who would not think of such acts at home but now were eager to know the northern lad who by one nervy and daring act had made himself generally talked about in a southern city some of the women declared he was so handsome and so manly to franks increasing dismay id give a hundred dollars to get out of this he thought he must have spoken the words aloud although he was not aware of it for a voice at his elbow low and musical said come disaway seсor an i will tek yo out of it frank saw manuel mazaro close at hand the spaniard for such mazaro was bowed gracefully and smiled pleasantly upon the boy from the north a moment frank hesitated and then he said lead on ill follow quickly mazaro skirted the edge of the throng for a short distance plunged into the mass made sure frank was close behind and then forced his way through to a doorway disa way he invited frank hesitated where does it lead through a passage to annodare street seсor frank felt his revolver in his pocket and he knew it was loaded for instant use i want to get ahead of this procession i want to see the queen of flowers again i will tek yo there seсor lead on frank passed his hand through the crown of flowers to which he still clung without being seen he took his revolver from his pocket and held it concealed in the mass of flowers it was a selfcocker and he could use it skillfully as mazaro had said the doorway led into a passage this was very narrow and quite dark no sooner were they fairly in this place than frank regretted that he had come for he realized that it was a most excellent chance for assassination and robbery his one fear was of being attacked behind he was quite ready for any that might rise in front disa way seсor mazaro kept repeating disa way frank fancied the fellow was speaking louder than was necessary in fact he could not see that it was necessary for mazaro to speak at all and then the boy was sure he heard footsteps behind them he was caught between two fires he was trapped franks first impulse was to leap forward knock mazaro down and take to his heels keeping straight on through the passage a second thought followed the first quite swiftly he knew not where the passage led and he knew not what pitfalls it might contain at that moment frank felt a thrill of actual fear nervy though he was but he understood that he must not let fear get the best of him and he instantly flung it off his ears were open his eyes were open and every sense was on the alert let them come he almost exclaimed aloud i will give them a warm reception then he noticed that they passed a narrow opening like a broken door and the next moment he seemed to feel catlike footfalls at his very heels in a twinkling frank whirled about crying hold up where you are i am armed and ill shoot if crowded he had made no mistake for his eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness of the passage and he could see three dark figures blocking his retreat along the passage for one brief second his eyes turned the other way and it seemed that manuel mazaro had been joined by two or three others for he saw several forms in that direction this sudden action of the trapped boy had filled these fellows with surprise and dismay and curses of anger broke from their lips the words being hissed rather than spoken frank knew he must attract attention in some way and so of a sudden he fired a shot into the air the flash of his revolver showed him several dark villainous faces upon him cried mazaro in spanish be quick about it back shouted frank lifting the revolver ill not waste another bullet thots th talk me laddybuck rang out a familiar voice give th spalpanes cold lead an plinty av it frankie oim wid yez barney mulloy frank almost screamed in joyous amazement chapter xviii barney on hand thots me name an this is me marruck cried the irish lad from the darkness there was a hurrying rush of feet and then smack smack two dark figures were seen flying through the darkness as if they had been struck by batteringrams hurrah cheered frank thrusting the revolver into his pocket and hastening to leap into the battle give em glory barney hurro shouted the irish youth th united shtates an ould oireland foriver nothing can shtand against th combination this unexpected assault was too much for manuel mazaro and his satellites carrrramba snarled the spaniard dis treek is spoiled we will have to try de odare one pardnares were reddy fer yer thricks ye shnakes cried barney are you armed asked frank to th muzzle wid grapeshot an canister was the reply but the boys were not compelled to resort to deadly weapons for the spaniard and his gang suddenly took to their heels and seemed to melt away in the darkness musha musha gasped barney where hiv they gone oi dunno theyve skipped an lift us widout sayin goodavenin so it seems th impoloight rascals they should be ashamed av thimsilves barney frankie at school you had a way of always showing up just when you were needed most and you have not gotten over it its harrud to tache an ould dog new thricks frankie you dont want to learn any new tricks the old ones you know are all right barney give me your hand frankie here it is an im wid yez me by till oi have ter lave yez which wont be in a hurry av oi know mesilf the two lads clasped hands in the darkness of the passage now said frank to get out of this place th sooner th quicker which way shall we go better go th way we came in right barney but how in the world did you happen to appear at such an opportune moment that sticks me oi saw yez me by whin th crowd was cheerin fer yez but oi couldnt get to yez though oi troied me bist and you followed oi did but its lost yez oi would av ye wasnt sane to come in here by thim as

oi wouldnt know thot av oi should hear it astraddle av th north pole do yez well i am sure i knew your voice the moment i heard it and the sound gave no small amount of satisfaction the boys now hurried back along the narrow passage and soon reached the doorway by which they had entered the procession had passed on and the great crowd of people had melted from the street as soon as they were outside the passage barney explained that he had arrived in town that night and had hurried to the st charles hotel but had found professor scotch in bed and frank gone th profissor was near scared to death av me said barney he wouldnt let me in th room till th bellboy had described me two or thray toimes over an whin oi did come in he had his head under th clothes an be me soul i thought by th sound that he wur shakin dice it wuz the tathe av him chattering togither frank was convulsed with laughter while barney went on profissor sez oi av its doice yere shakin oill take a hand at tin cints a corner what did he do then he looked out at me over the edge av th bedsprid an he sez sez he are ye sure yere yersilf barney mulloy or are ye colonel sally de la vilager or something av th sort in

fardale an its a debt av gratitude oi owe him so oill make me bluff i do not believe colonel vallier will meet any one but professor scotch but the professor will be too ill to meet him so he will

go to the place where the krewe of proteus holds its ball lade on as both were strangers in new orleans they did not know how to make the shortest cut to the ballroom and frank found it impossible to obtain a carriage they were delayed most exasperatingly and when they arrived at the place where the ball was to be held the procession had broken up and the queen of flowers was within the ballroom this is most unfortunate cried frank in dismay i meant to get here ahead of the procession so that i could speak to her before she got inside well lets go in an spake to her now we cant whoy not this is a very exclusive affair an were very ixclusive paple only those having invitations can enter the ballroom is thot so thin its outsoide were lift what can we do about thot nothing is it too late to git invoitations they cant be bought like tickets well what koind av a shindig do ye call this oi dunno barney was thoroughly disgusted frank explained that professor scotch had been able to procure invitations but neither of them had fancied they would care to attend the ball so the opportunity had been neglected whinever oi can get something fer nothing oi take it said barney its a use oi can make fer most things oi get the two boys lingered outside the building frank hoped the flower queen would come out and he would be able to speak to her before she entered a carriage and was carried away sweet strains of music floated down to the ears of the restless lads and with each passing moment frank grew more and more disgusted with himself to think that i might be in there might be waltzing with the queen of flowers at this moment if i had asked the professor to obtain the invitations he cried its harrud luck said barney but yell know betther next toime next time will be too late in some way i must meet this girl and speak to her i must and i will thats th shtuff me by whiniver ye say anything loike thot ye always git there wid both fate oill risk yez two men in dress suits came out to smoke and get a breath of air they stood conversing within a short distance of the boys she has been the sensation of the day said one the whole city is wondering who she is she seems determined to remain a mystery yes for she has vanished from the ballroom in a most unaccountable manner no one saw her take her departure not even rolf raymond no he is as much mystified as anybody the fellow knows her but he positively refuses to disclose her identity franks hand had fallen on barneys arm with a grip of iron and the fingers were sinking deeper and deeper into the irish lads flesh as these words fell on their ears it is said that the young fellow who saved her from the steer today does not know her no she saw him in the crowd tonight and flung him her crown calling him a hero he was nearly mobbed by the crowd that was determined to know his name but he escaped in some way and has not been seen since that settles it frank hissed in barneys ear they are speaking of the flower queen sure returned the irish lad an av yersilf frankie by she is no longer in the ballroom no we are wasting our time waiting here roight ye are then we will wait no longer come well go to the hotel chapter xix a humble apology barely were they in their apartments at the hotel when there came a knock on the door and a boy entered bearing a salver on which were two cards colonel la salle vallier and mr rolf raymond read frank bring them up whats that roared professor scotch from the bed are you crazy frank hustled the boy out of the room whispering bring them up and admit them without knocking he slipped a quarter into the boys hand and the little fellow grinned and hurried away frank turned back to find professor scotch in his night robe standing square in the middle of the bed wildly waving his arms and roaring lock the door barricade it keep them out if those desperadoes are admitted here this room will run red with gore thats right professor agreed frank well settle their hash right here and at once well cook em whoop shouted the little professor in his big hoarse voice this is murder assassination lock the door i say i am in no condition to receive visitors be calm professor chirped frank soothingly be calm profissor echoed barney serenely be calm bellowed the excited little man how can i be calm on the eve of murder and assassination i am an unarmed man and i am not even dressed niver moind a little thing loike thot purred the irish lad its of no consequence declared frank placidly no consequence shouted scotch oh youll drive me crazy you want me to be killed it is a plot to have me murdered i see through the vile scheme ill call the police he rushed into the front room and flung up a window from which he howled fire police he would have shrieked murder and several other things but frank and barney dragged him back and closed the window great scott gasped frank itll be a wonder if the whole police force of the city does not come rushing up here perhaps theyll not be able to locate th spot from which th croy came said barney let us hope not yes let us hope not the professor squirmed out of the grasp of the two boys and made a wild dash for the door just before he reached it the door was flung open and colonel vallier followed by rolf raymond strode into the room the colonel and the professor met just within the doorway the collision was violent and both men recoiled and sat down heavily upon the floor while rolf raymond barely saved himself from falling astride the colonels neck sitting thus the two men glared at each other the colonel being in a dress suit while the professor wore a night robe frank and barney could not restrain their laughter then a most remarkable thing happened professor scotch became so angry at what he considered the unwarranted intrusion of the visitors that he forgot how he was dressed forgot to be scared and grew fierce as a raging lion without rising he leaned forward and shook his fist under colonel valliers nose literally roaring what do you mean by entering this room without knocking you miserable old blowhard you ought to have your face thumped and by thunder i believe i can do it sah gasped the colonel in the greatest amazement and dismay dont sah me you measly old fraud howled scotch waving his fists in the air i dont believe in fighting but this is about my time to scrap if you dont apologize for the intrusion may i be blown to ten thousand fragments if i dont give you a pair of beautiful black eyes sah there seems to be some mistake sah fluttered colonel vallier turning pale you made the mistake thundered scotch leaping to his feet like a jumping jack get up here and let me knock you down i decline to be struck sah you dont dare to get up howled the excited little man growing still worse as the colonel seemed to shrink and falter why i can lick you in a fraction of no time youve been making lots of fighting talk and now its my turn get up and put up your fists will somebody kindly hold this lunatic palpitated colonel vallier i am no prizefightah gentlemen that isnt my lookout said the professor who was forcing things while they ran his way get up and take off your coat well settle this affair without delay with pistols sah yes with pistols if you want to cried the professor to the amazement of the boys i am ready sir we will settle it with pistols at once in this room but this is no place foh a duel sah yo should know that sah this is just the place the one who survives will be arrested sah there wont be a survivor so you neednt fear arrest no survivah sah no how is that ill tell you how it is you are such a blamed coward that you wont fight me with your fists for fear i will give you the thumping you deserve but you know you are a good pistol shot and you think i am not so you hope to shoot me and escape without harm to yourself well i am no pistol shot but i am not going to miss you well shoot across that center table and the width of the table is the distance that will divide us in that way ill stand as good a show as you do and ill agree to shoot you through the body very near to the heart so youll not linger long in agony come sir get ready colonel vallier actually staggered sah sah he fluttered youre shorely crazy not a bit of it come get ready this is murder sah it is a square deal one has as good show as the other but i i never heard of such a duel never there are many things you have never heard about colonel vallier but sah i cant fight that way youll have to excuse me sah whats that howled the little professor dancing about in his night robe do you refuse to give me satisfaction i refuse to be murdered then youll apologize the colonel gasped apologize why i cant then im going to give you those black eyes just as sure as my name is scotch put up your fists the colonel retreated holding up his hands helplessly while the professor pranced after him like a fighting cock this is disgraceful snapped rolf raymond taking a step as if to interfere it must be stopped at once hold on came sternly from frank dont chip in where youre not wanted mr raymond let them settle this matter themselves thots roight me laddybuck said barney mulloy if you bother thim its a pair av black oies ye may own yersilf we did not come here to be bullied no said frank you came to play the bullies and the tables have been turned on you take it easy the two boys placed themselves in such a position that they could prevent raymond from interfering between the colonel and the professor dont strike me sah gasped vallier holding up his open hands with the palms toward the bantamlike professor then do you apologize you will strike me if i do not apologize you may bet your life that i will colonel then i ah ill have to apologize sah and this settles the entire affair between us eh i dont know about that well you had better know does this settle the entire affair i suppose so sah you apologize most humbly i do and you state of your own free will that this settles all trouble between us the colonel hesitated and scotch lifted his fists menacingly i do sah i do vallier hastened to say then thats right said professor scotch airily you have escaped the worst thumping you ever received in all your life and you should congratulate yourself frank felt like cheering with delight surely professor scotch had done himself proud and the termination of the affair had been quite unexpected by the boys chapter xx the professors courage colonel vallier seemed utterly crestfallen and subdued but rolf raymonds face was dark with anger as he harshly said now that this foolishness is over we will proceed to business thats right bowed frank the quicker you proceed the better satisfied we will be go ahead rolf turned fiercely on frank almost snarling you must have been at the bottom of it all where is she frank was astonished as his face plainly showed where is she he repeated whom do you mean sir it is useless to pretend that you do not know you must have found an opportunity to communicate with her somehow although how you accomplished it is more than i understand you are speaking in riddles say what you mean man i will if you do not immediately tell us where she is you will find yourself in serious trouble is that plain enough a light came to frank do you mean the queen of flowers he eagerly asked you know i mean the queen of flowers and you do not know what has become of her how can we she disappeared mysteriously from the ballroom no one saw her leave but she went she must have returned to her home that will not go with us merriwell for we hastened to the place where she is stopping with her father and she was not there nor had he seen her he cannot live long and this blow will hasten the end you will be responsible take my advice and give her up at once unless you wish to get into trouble of a most serious nature frank saw that raymond actually believed he knew what had become of the flower queen look here came swiftly from the boys lips it is plain this is no time to waste words i do not know what has become of the flower queen that is straight i did know she had disappeared from the ballroom but i supposed she had returned to her home i do not know her name as yet although she knows mine if anything has happened to her i am not responsible but i take a great interest in her and i am ready and eager to be of assistance to her tell me her name as that will aid me rolf raymond could not doubt franks words for honesty was written on the boys face her name he said her name is for you to learn his taunting laugh brought the warm blood to franks face all right cried the boy from the north ill learn it no thanks to you more than that if she needs my aid she shall have it it strikes me that she may have fled of her own accord to escape being persecuted by you if so what then well meet again that we will colonel vallier may have settled his trouble with professor scotch but mine is not settled with you you are right we may yet meet on the field of honor i shall be pleased to accommodate you flashed frank and the sooner the better it will satisfy me thots th talk cried barney mulloy admiringly you can do th spalpane frankie at any old thing hell name the disappearance of miss the flower queen prevents the setting of a time and place said raymond passionately but you shall be waited on as soon as she is found until then i must let nothing interfere with my search for her very good that is satisfactory to me and i will do my best to help find her for you now if your business is quite over gentlemen your room would give us much more pleasure than your company not another word did raymond or vallier say but they strode stiffly to the door and bowed themselves out barney closed the door after them then both the boys turned on professor scotch to find he had collapsed into a chair and seemed on the point of swooning professor cried frank i want to congratulate you that was the best piece of work you ever did in all your life profissor exclaimed barney yere a jewil av inny wan iver says you lack nerve may oi be bitten by th wurrust shnake in oireland av oi dont break his head boys gasped the professor fan me i cant seem to get my breath how did i do it it scares me to think of it you were a man professor and you showed colonel vallier that you were utterly reckless you seemed eager for a fight fight groaned the little man i couldnt fight a child i never fought in my life i dont know how to fight colonel vallier didnt know that it was plain he believed you a desperate slugger and he wilted immediately but i cant understand how i came to do such a thing till their unwarranted intrusion till i collided with the colonel i was in terror for my life the moment we collided i seemed to forget that i was scared and i remembered only that i was mad and you seemed more than eager for a scrap ye samed doying fer a bit av a row profissor what if he had struck me palpitated the little man oh gracious it would have been terrible for him if hed struck you youd been so mad that nothing could have stopped you you would have waded into him and given him the worst thrashing he ever received thots pwhat ye would profissor sure as fate scotch began to revive and the words of the boys convinced him that he was really a very brave man and had done a most daring thing little by little he began to swell like a toad i dont know but youre right he said stiffening up i was utterly reckless and desperate at the time thats right professor profissor yere a bad mon ter buck against that is a fact that has not been generally known but having cowed one of the most desperate duelists in the south and forced him to apologize i presume i have a right to make some pretensions thats a fact yeve made a riccord fer yersilf and a record to be proud of crowed the little man getting on his feet and beginning to strut forgetful of the fact that he was in his night robe and presented a most ludicrous appearance the events of this evening shall become a part of history future generations shall regard me as one of the most nervy and daring men of my age and really i dont know but i am whats the use of being a coward when you can be a hero just as well boys this adventure has made a different man of me hereafter you will see that ill not quail in the face of the most deadly dangers ill even dare to walk up to the mouth of a cannon if i know it isnt loaded the boys were forced to laugh at his bantamlike appearance but for all of the queer twist he had given his last expression the professor seemed very serious and it was plain that he had begun to regard himself with admiration think boys he cried think of my offer to fight him with pistols across yonder narrow table that was a stroke of genius professor declared frank that broke colonel vallier up more than anything else he wilted at that of course you did not mean to actually fight him that way well i dont know swelled the little man i was reckless then and i didnt care for anything suddenly frank grew grave this other matter they spoke of worries me he said i cant understand what has happened to the queen of flowers ye mustnt let thot worry yez me by i cant help it she may be home by this toime and she may be in desperate need of a helping hand av she is oi dunno how ye can hilp her frankie nor do i know of any way why should any one kidnap her oi dunno it would be a most daring thing to do as she is so well known but there are daring and desperate ruffians in new orleans oi think yere roight me by it may be that she has been persecuted so that she fled of her own accord and yet i hardly think that is true no more do oi frankie if it is not true surely she is in trouble well oh i cant remain quietly here knowing she may need aid pwhat will yez do i am going out where somewhere anywhere will you come along sure me by oim wid yez firrust larrust an all th toime chapter xxi franks bold move the professor declined to go out he returned to bed and the boys left the hotel where away frankie asked barney i dont know replied frank helplessly there is not one chance in millions of finding the lost flower queen but i feel that i must move about well visit the old french quarter by night i have been there in the daytime and id like to see how it looks at night come on and so they made their way to the french quarter crossing canal street and turning into a quiet narrow way that soon brought them to a region of architectural decrepitude the streets of this section were not overlighted and seemed very silent and lonely as at this particular time the greater part of the inhabitants of the quarter were away to the scenes of pleasure the streets echoed to the boys feet there were queer balconies on every hand the stores were mere shops all of them now closed and many windows were nailed up rust and decay were on all sides and yet there was something impressive in the almost oriental squalor of the place it sames loike wed left th city intoirely for another place so it does muttered barney that is true admitted frank new orleans seems like a human being with two personalities for me this is the most interesting part of the city but commerce is beginning to crowd in here and the time is coming when the french quarter will cease to be an attraction for new orleans dye think not frankie it is a certain thing well well get our look at it before it is gone intoirely a few dark figures were moving silently along the streets the night was warm and the shutters of the balcony windows were opened to admit air at a corner they halted and of a sudden frank clutched the arm of his companion whispering look see that man yes me by did you see his face nivver a bit well i did and i do not believe i am mistaken in thinking i have seen it before whin tonight pwhere in the alley where i was trapped by manuel mazaro and his gang it wur darruk in there frankie but i fired my revolver and by the flash i saw a face so ye soay it was the face of the man who just passed beneath this light an pwhat av thot frankie he might lead me to manuel mazaro pwhat do yez want to see thot spalpane fer mazaro knows a good deal fer instance pwhat why i was attacked and the object of the attack he might be induced to tell it sure wur a case av intinded robbery me by perhaps so perhaps not but he knows more he knows all about rolf raymond and colonel vallier well rolf raymond and colonel vallier know a great deal about the lost flower queen it is possible mazaro knows something of her come on barney well follow that man jist as ye say me lad take the other side of the street and keep him in sight but do not seem to be following him they separated and both kept in sight of the man who did not seem to fear pursuit or dream any one was shadowing him he led them straight to an antiquated story and a half creole cottage shaded by a large willow tree the branches of which touched the sides and swept the round tiles of the roof the foliage of the old tree half concealed the discolored stucco which was dropping off in many places over the door was a sign which announced that it was a cafй the door was open and in the first room could be seen some men who were eating and drinking at a table there was another room beyond the man the boys had followed entered the cottage passed through the first room speaking to the men at the table and disappeared into the room beyond frank and barney paused outside are yez goin to folly him frankie by asked the irish lad to be sure i am theres no tellin pwhat koind av a nest ye will get inther ill have to take my chances on that thin oim wid yez no i want you to remain outside so you will be on hand in case i need air howll i know ye nade it youll hear me cry or shoot av oi do youll see barney mulloy comin loike a cyclone i know i may depend on you and i know this may be a nest of assassins these spaniards are hotblooded fellows and they make dangerous rascals frank looked at his revolver to make sure it was in perfect working order dropped it into the side pocket of his coat and walked boldly into the cottage cafй the men in the front room stared at him in surprise but he did not seem to give them a glance walking straight through into the next room there he saw two spanishlooking fellows talking in low tones over a table on which drinks were setting one of them was the man he had followed they were surprised to see the boy coolly walk into the room and advance without hesitation to their table the one frank had followed seemed to recognize the lad and he appeared startled and somewhat alarmed with the greatest politeness frank touched his cap asking seсor do you know manuel mazaro the fellow scowled and hesitated and then retorted what if i do i want to see him and you have come here for that yes i will see if he be here wait at one side of the room was a door opening on a dark flight of stairs through this doorway and up the stairs the fellow disappeared frank sat down at the table feeling the revolver in the side pocket of his coat the other man did not attempt to make any conversation in a few minutes the one who had ascended the stairs reappeared seсor mazaro will soon be down he announced then he sat at the table and resumed conversation with his companion speaking in spanish and not even seeming to hear the thank you from frank it was not long before mazaro appeared and he came forward without hesitation smiling serenely as if delighted to see the boy oh seсor he cried yo be not harm in de scrape what we run into i was not harmed no thanks to you mazaro said the boy coolly it is a wonder that i came out with a whole skin seсor you do not blame me fo dat i deed not knowa it i deed not knowa de robbares were there mazaro you are a very good liar but it will not work with me the spaniard showed his teeth and fell back a step de young seсor speaka ver plain he said it is my way mazaro we may as well understand each other first as last you are a scoundrel and youre out for the dollars now it is possible you can make more money by serving me than in any other way if you can help me i will pay you well mazaro looked ready to sink a knife into franks heart a moment before but he suddenly thawed with the utmost politeness he said i do not thinka i know what de seсor mean if he speaka littl plainer mebbe i ondarstan sit down mazaro the spaniard took a seat at the table now said frank quietly order what you wish to drink and i will pay for it i never drink myself and i never carry much money with me nights but i have enough to pay for your drink de seсor is ver kind bowed manuel and he ordered a drink which was brought by a villainouslooking old woman frank paid and when mazaro was sipping the liquid he leaned forward and said seсor mazaro you know rolf raymond si seсor and colonel vallier si seсor and the queen of flowers i know of her seсor i see her today you know more she has disappeared and you know what has become of her it was a chance shot but frank saw it went home chapter xxii the queen is found mazaro changed color and then he regained his composure seсor he said smoothly i knowa not what made you tink dat i do not think i know wondareful ver wondareful purred the spaniard in mock admiration you givea me great sprise frank was angry but he held himself in restraint appearing cool your face betrayed it ah dat show yo havea ver gret eye seсor you do not deny it why should i do dat when you knowa so much you dare not deny it dare seсor i dare ver many thing you do not know mazaro was exasperatingly cool look here man said frank leaning toward the spaniard are you aware that you may get yourself into serious trouble are you aware that kidnaping is an offense that makes you a criminal of the worst sort and for which you might be sent up for twenty years at least the spaniard smiled it is eeze to talk but dat is not proof he said you scoundrel exclaimed the boy his anger getting the better of him for the moment i have a mind to convey my suspicions to the police and then an den what seсor ah you talk ver bol fo boy like you do you knowa what well see if i snappa my fingare quick like a flash you get a knife tween your shouldares den you not tella the police frank could not repress a shiver he looked swiftly around and saw the black eyes of the other two men were fastened upon him and he knew they were ready to obey mazaros signal wat yo tinka seсor smiled manuel insolently that is very well came calmly from franks lips if i were to give the signal my friends would rush in here to my aid if you stab me make sure the knife goes through my heart with the first stroke so there will be little chance that ill cry out den you havea friends near ha i tink so mebbe calla dem in no thank you they will remain

she is a hundred dollars mazaro smiled scornfully dat notting yo don talk de biz yo don havea de mon enough wait urged frank i am a yankee from the north and i will make a trade with you alla right but i dont admit i know anyting manuel leaned back in his chair lazily and deftly rolling a cigarette which he lighted frank watched this piece of business thinking of the best manner of approaching the fellow and then something happened that electrified every one within the cafй somewhere above there came the sound of blows and a crashing splintering sound as of breaking wood then a shriek ran through the building help help save me it was the voice of a female in great terror and distress mazaro ground a curse through his white teeth and leaped to his feet but frank was on his feet quite as quickly smack franks arm had shot out and his hard fist struck the spaniard under the ear sending the fellow flying through the air and up against the wall with terrible force from the wall mazaro dropped limp and groaning to the floor like a flash the nervy youth flung the table against the downcast wretchs companions making them reel then frank leaped toward the stairs up which he bounded like a deer where are you he cried i am here to help you call again no answer near the head of the stairs a light shone out through a broken panel in a door and on this door frank knew the blows he had heard must have fallen within this room the boy fancied he could hear sounds of a desperate struggle behind him the desperadoes were rallying cursing hoarsely and crying to each other they were coming and the lad on the stairs knew they would come armed to the teeth all the chivalry in his nature was aroused his blood was leaping and tingling in his veins and he felt able to cope with a hundred foes straight toward the broken door he leaped and his hand found the knob but it refused to yield at his touch fast he panted well ill try this he hurled himself against the door but it remained firm there were feet on the stairs the desperadoes were coming at that moment he looked into the room through the break in the panel and he saw a girl struggling with all her strength in the hands of a man the man was trying to hold a hand over her mouth to keep her from crying out again while a torrent of angry spanish words poured in a hissing sound from his bearded lips as frank looked the girl tore the fellows hand from her lips and her cry for help again rang out the wretch lifted his fist to strike her senseless but the blow did not fall frank was a remarkably good shot and his revolver was in his hand that hand was flung upward to the opening in the panel and he fired into the room the burst of smoke kept him from seeing the result of the shot but he heard a hoarse roar of pain from the man and he knew he had not missed he had fired at the fellows wrist and the bullet had shattered it but now the ruffians who were coming furiously up the stairs demanded his attention halt he shouted stop where you are or i shall open fire on you he could see them and he saw the foremost lift his hand then there was a burst of flame before franks eyes and he staggered backward feeling a bullet near his cheek not till that moment did he realize what a trap he was in and how desperate was his situation it is a fight for life he muttered as he lifted his revolver the smell of burned powder was in his nostrils the fire of battle gleamed from his eyes the weapon in franks hand spoke again and once more he found his game for the leading ruffian having almost reached the head of the stairs flung up his arms with a gurgling sound and toppled backward upon those who were following down the stairs they all tumbled falling in a heap at the bottom where they struggled squirmed and shouted so far everything is very serene half laughed the daring boy this has turned out to be a real lively night frank was a lad who never deliberately sought danger for dangers sake but when his blood was aroused he entirely forgot to be afraid and he felt a wild thrill of joy when in the greatest peril for the time he had entirely forgotten the existence of barney mulloy but now he remembered that the irish lad had waited outside the cottage cafй he has heard the rumpus said frank aloud i wonder where barney can be whist be aisy me lad retorted the familiar voice of the irish youth oim wid yez to th ind barney was close behind frank how in the world did you get here cried our hero in great astonishment oi climbed the tray me by the tree what tree th willey tray as shtands forninst th corner av th house frankie but that does not explain how you came here at my side there was a windy open an oi shlipped in by th windy well youre a dandy barney an yere a birrud frankie what koind av a muss hiv ye dhropped into now oid loike ter know a regular ruction i heard a girl shout for help and i knocked over two or three chaps mazaro included on my way to her aid where is she now by in here said frank pointing through the broken panel she is the missing queen of flowers there she is barney see here then frank obtained a fair look at the girls face staggered clutched barney and shouted look by heavens it is not strange she knew me for we both know her she is inza burrage chapter xxiii fighting lads while attending school at fardale military academy frank had met and become acquainted with a charming girl by the name of inza burrage they had been very friendly more than friendly in a boy and girl way they were lovers after leaving fardale and starting to travel frank had written to inza and she had answered for a time the correspondence had continued but at last frank had failed to receive any answers to his letters he wrote again and again but never a line came from inza and he finally decided she had grown tired of him and had taken this method of dropping him frank was proud and sensitive and he resolved to forget inza this was not easy but he thought of her as little as possible and never spoke of her to any one and now he had met her in this remarkable manner some fellow had written him from fardale that mr burrage had moved from the place but no one seemed to know whither he had gone frank had not dreamed of seeing inza in new orleans but she was the mysterious queen of flowers and for some reason she was in trouble and peril although dazed by his astonishing discovery the boy quickly recovered and he felt that he could battle with a hundred ruffians in the defense of the girl beyond the broken door barney mulloy seemed no less astonished than frank be me soul it is thot lassie he cried inza inza shouted frank through the broken panel she heard him frank frank save me i will the promise was given with the utmost confidence at that moment however the ruffian whose wrist frank had broken leaped upon the girl and grasped her with his uninjured arm carramba he snarled you savea her bah fool you never gita out with whole skin drop her you dog cried frank pointing his revolver at the fellow drop her or ill put a bullet through your head instead of your wrist bah shoot you killa her he held the struggling girl before him as a shield like a raging lion frank tore at the panel the man with the girl swiftly moved back to a door at the farther side of the room this door he had already unfastened and flung open adios he cried derisively some time i square wid you for my handa adios th spalpanes are comin up th shtairs again frankie cried barney in the ear of the desperate boy at the door frank did not seem to hear he was striving to break the stout panel so that he could force his way through the opening frank frank theyre coming up th shtairs let them come theyll make mince mate av us i must follow her well folly av ye want to shouted the irish lad oim goin to shtop th gang crack the panel gave crack splinter smash out came a long strip which frank flung upon the floor barney caught it up and whirled toward the stairs the desperadoes were coming with a rush they were well up the stairs in another moment the leading ruffian would have reached the second floor get back ye gossoons down ye haythen take thot ye bloody pirates the strip of heavy wood in barneys hands whirled through the air and came down with a resounding crack on the head of the leader the fellows had not learned caution by the fate of the first man to climb the stairs and they were following their second leader as close as possible barney had a strong arm and he struck the fellow with all his power well it was for the ruffian that the heavy wood was not very thick else he would have had a broken head back he toppled upon the one behind and that one made a vain attempt to support him the dead weight was too much and the second fell again sweeping the whole lot to the foot of the stairs hurro shouted the irish boy in wild delight this is th koind av a picnic pwhat oi admire come on ye nagurs its barney mulloy yere runnin up against an begobs hes good fer th whole crowd av yez at the foot of the stairs there was a writhing wrangling snarling mass of human beings at the head of the stairs was a young irishman who laughed and crowed and flourished the cudgel of wood in his hands barney feeling his blood leaping joyously in his veins felt like singing and so he began to warble a fighting song over and over inviting his enemies to come on in the meantime frank had made an opening large enough to force his body through come on barney he cried attracting the other boys attention by a sharp blow pwhere in here somewhere frankie yere muddled an oi nivver saw yez so before what do you mean nivver a bit would it do for us both to go in there fer th craythers moight hiv us in a thrap youre right barney i

oi worry about thot frankie gwan through the panel frank forced his way as soon as he was within the room he ran for the door through which the ruffian had dragged inza frank knew that the fellow might be waiting just beyond the door knife in hand and he sprang through with his revolver held ready for instant use there was no light in the room but the light from the lamp in the adjoining room shone in at the doorway frank looked around and to his dismay he could see no one are they gone he asked himself if so whither it was not long before he was convinced that the room was empty of any living being save himself the spanish ruffian and the unfortunate girl had disappeared oh confound the infernal luck raved the boy he has escaped with her but i did my best and i followed as soon as possible then he remembered that he had promised inza he would save her and it wrung a groan from his lips which way have they gone he cried beginning to look for a door that led from the room by this time he was accustomed to the dim light and he saw a door in a twinkling he had tried it but found it was locked or bolted on the farther side the fellow had little time and no hands to lock a door he may not have gone this way he must for this is the only door to the room save the one by which i entered he went out this way and i will follow retreating to the farther side of the room frank made a run and plunged against the door it was bolted on the farther side and the shock snapped the iron bolt as if it had been a pipe stem bang open flew the door and frank went reeling through revolver in hand somewhat dazed but still determined and fierce as a young tiger at a glance he saw he was in a small room with two doors standing open the one he had just broken down and another through this other he leaped and found himself in a long passage at the farther end of which barney mulloy was still guarding the head of the stairs once more singing the wild fighting song not a trace of the ruffian or the kidnaped girl could frank see gone he palpitated mystified and awestricken gone where that was a question he could not answer for a moment and then the window in that room it is the one by which barney entered it must be the one by which the wretch fled with inza back into the room he had just left he leaped two bounds carried him to the window against which brushed the branch of the old willow tree he looked out there they are the exultant words came in a panting whisper from his lips as he saw some dark figures on the ground beneath the tree he was sure he saw a female form among them and his ears did not deceive him for he heard at last a smothered appeal for help then two other forms rushed out of the shadows and fell upon the men beneath the tree striking right and left there was a short fierce struggle a womans shriek the death groan of a stricken man a pistol shot and scattering forms without pausing to measure the distance to the ground frank sprang over the window sill and dropped chapter xxiv end of the search like a cat frank alighted on his feet and he was ready for anything the moment he struck the ground there was no longer any fighting beneath the tree the struggling mass had melted to two dark figures one of which was stretched on the ground while the other bent over it frank sprang forward and caught the kneeling one by the shoulder what has become of her he demanded fiercely the man looked up astonished it was colonel la salle vallier yo sah he exclaimed you cried frank then the boy recovered again demanding what has become of miss burrage she was here a moment ago the colonel looked around in a dazed way slowly saying yes sah she was here fo mistah raymon heard her voice and he rushed in to save her raymond where is he here sah the colonel motioned toward the silent form on the ground and frank bent forward to peer into the white ghastly face it was indeed rolf raymond dead fluttered frank dead replied colonel vallier he was killed in the struggle he was stabbed at the ver start sah the knife must have struck his heart merciful goodness gasped the boy horrified and how came he here we were searching fo manuel mazaro sah mistah raymon did not trus the rascal and he believed mazaro might know something about miss burrage mazaro is ready fo anything and he knew big money would be offered fo the recovery of the young lady so he must have kidnaped her we knew where to find mazaro though he did not suppose so and we came here as we approached we saw some figures beneath this tree then we heard a feminine cry fo help and we rushed in here sah thats all except that mistah raymon rushed to his death and the rascals have escaped they have escaped with the girl carried her away but they will not dare keep her now sah why not because they are known and the entire police of the city will be after them what will they do with her i dont know but i do not think they will harm her sah what was she to rolf raymond his affianced bride sah well she will not marry him now said frank but i am truly sorry that the fellow was killed in such a dastardly manner so am i sah confessed the queer colonel he has been ver valuable to me it will be a long time before i find another like him frank did not understand that remark then but he did afterward when he was told that colonel vallier was a professional card sharp and had bled rolf raymond for many thousands of dollars this explained the singular friendship between the sharp old rascal and the young man more than that frank afterward learned that colonel vallier was not a commissioned officer had never been such but had assumed the title in many ways the man tried to imitate the southern gentleman of the old school but as he was not a gentleman at heart he was a sad failure all at once frank remembered barney and that he had promised to stand by the irish lad great scott he cried barney mulloy is in there with that gang of raging wolves nivver a bit av it frankie chirped a cheerful voice oi am here down from the tree swung the fighting irish lad dropping beside his comrade th craythers didnt feel loike comin up th shtairs inny more barney explained they seemed to hiv enough sport fer wan avenin somebody shouted somethin to thim an away they wint out doors so i took to lookin fer yez me by and you found me oi looked out av th windy an

slipped away leaving colonel vallier with the dead youth frank was feeling disgusted and desperate and he expressed himself freely as they made their way along the streets it is voile luck admitted barney but we did our bist an its a jolly good foight we had frankie we make a whole tame wid a litthle yaller dog under th waggin oh i cant think of anything but inza inza inza she frank out of a dark shadow timidly came a female figure with a cry of joy frank sprang forward and clasped her in his arms lifting her off her feet and covering her face eyes and mouth with kisses while he cried inza girl at last at last we fought like fiends to save you and we thought we had failed but now you did your best frank but that dreadful wretch dragged me to the window and dropped me into the arms of a monster who was waiting below i did not faint i would not i made up my mind that i would keep my senses and try to escape the man jumped after me and then a signal was given that brought the others from the building they were going to wrap something about my head when i got my mouth free and cried out after that i scarcely know what happened there was fighting and i caught a glimpse of the face of rolf raymond how he came there i do not know i felt myself free and i ran ran ran till i fell here from exhaustion and here i lay till i heard your voice i knew it and i replied frankie me by cried barney its a bit ago we were ravin at our luck its givin thanks we should be this minute true barney true it is all right at last inza is safe rolf raymond is dead and a cry broke from the lips of the girl rolf raymond dead she exclaimed wildly are you sure sure replied frank coldly you will not marry him now i should not have married him anyway but you were affianced to him by my father yes my father and roderick raymond who is a cripple and has not many more years to live were schoolmates and friends in their younger days roderick raymond has made a vast fortune and in his old age he set his heart upon having his son marry the daughter of his former friend and partner it seems that when they first got married father and raymond declared in case the child of one was a boy and that of the other was a girl that their children should marry rolf was mr raymonds only son as i am an only daughter believing himself ready to die roderick raymond sent to my father and reminded him of their agreement as you know father is not very wealthy and he is now an invalid his mind is not strong and he became convinced that it was his duty to see that i married rolf raymond he set his mind on it and all my pleadings were in vain he brought me here to the south and i saw rolf i disliked him violently the moment my eyes rested on him but he seemed to fall madly in love with me he was fiercely jealous of me and watched me as a dog watches its mistress i could not escape him and i was becoming entangled deeper and deeper when you appeared i knew you and i was determined to see you again to ask you to save me i took part in the parade tonight and went to the ballroom rolf followed me about so that i became disgusted and slipped from the room intending to return home alone barely had i left the room when a fellow whispered in my ear that he had been sent there by you that i was to go with him and he would take me to you i entered a closed carriage and i was brought to the place where you found me a captive in the hands of those ruffians frank had listened with eager interest to this explanation and it made everything clear it was ordained by fate that we should find you there he declared it was known the queen of flowers had disappeared and we were searching for you something led us straight to that place rolf raymond came there also and he came to his death but inza explain one thing why didnt you answer my letters i answered every one i received you stopped writing i did not but i received no answers then cried the girl your letters must have been intercepted you were constantly changing about i did not know your address so i could not ask for an explanation well it has come out right at last well find a carriage and take you home tomorrow i will see you they reached canal street and found a carriage inzas invalid father was astounded when he saw frank and barney mulloy appear with his daughter and he was more than ever astounded and agitated when he knew what had happened but inza was safe and rolf raymond was dead it was a lively tale the boys related to professor scotch that night the little man fairly gasped for breath as he listened well well well was all he could say in the morning the police had taken hold of the affair and they were hot after the fellows who had killed rolf raymond frank and barney were called on to tell their story and were placed under surveillance but the cottage cafй was deserted and the spanish rascals were not captured they disappeared from new orleans and to this day the law has never avenged the death of roderick raymonds only son the murder of his boy was too much for raymond to endure and he died of a broken heart on the day of the sons funeral knowing he was dying he had a new will swiftly made and all his wealth was left to his old friend burrage frank and barney thoroughly enjoyed the rest of their stay in new orleans in the open carriage with them at franks side rode the queen of flowers as they went sightseeing in the throng of spectators with two detectives near at hand they saw colonel la salle vallier he lifted his hat and bowed with the utmost courtesy the auld chap is something of a daisy after all frankie laughed barney oi kinder admire th spalpane ha hum coughed professor scotch at barneys side he is a great duelist a great duelist but he quailed before my terrible eye he was forced to apologize hum ha frank leaned toward inza if anything happens when we are again separated that you should fail to receive my letters you will not doubt me will you he asked in a whisper and she softly replied no frank but but what you you must not forget elsie bellwood i havent heard from her in a long time said frank and there the talk ended but frank was to hear from his other girl friend soon and in a most unexpected manner chapter xxv the mysterious canoe from new orleans frank barney and the professor journeyed to florida frank was anxious to see the everglades and do some hunting our hero was particularly anxious to shoot a golden heron of which he had heard not a little one day a start was made in a canoe from a small settlement on the edge of the great dismal swamp and on went our three friends deeper and deeper into the wilds at last the professor grew tired of the sameness of the journey how much further into this wild swamp do you intend to go frank he asked i am going till i get a shot at a golden heron nonsense there is no golden heron you think so i know it the golden heron is a myth white hunters have searched the remote fastnesses of the florida swamps for a golden heron but no such bird have they ever found the indians are the only ones to see golden herons if the indians can see them white men may find them i shall not be satisfied till i have shot one then youll never be satisfied oh i dont know about that professor i am something of an indian myself you know the seminoles are honest and peaceable and all indians are liars i would not take the word of a seminole under any condition come frank dont be foolish lets turn round and go back we may get bewildered on these winding waterways which twist here and there through swamps of cypress and rushes we were foolish to come without a guide but we could not obtain one until tomorrow and i wished to come today you may be sorry you did not wait now you are getting scared professor laughed frank lifting his paddle from the water and laying it across the bow of the canoe ill tell you what well do all right well leave it to barney who has not had a word to say on the matter if he says go back well go back professor scotch hesitated scratched his fingers into his fiery beard and then said well ill have to do as you boys say anyway so well leave it to barney all right laughed frank once more what do you say barney my boy barney mulloy was in the stern of the canoe that had been creeping along one of the sluggish water courses that led through the cypress swamp and into the heart of the everglades well gintlemin he said oive been so busy thrying to kape thrack av th twists an turruns we have been makin thot oi didnt moind mutch pwhat ye wur soaying it wur something about turning back plaze repate it again so the matter was laid before him and when he had heard what frank and the professor had to say he declared fer mesilf its nivver a bit do oi care where we go ur pwhat we do but as long as we hiv come so fur an frankie wants to go furder oid soay go on till he is sick av it an reddy to turn back there professor cried frank that settles it as i knew it would be settled growled professor scotch sulkily you boys combine against me every time well i suppose ill have to submit so the trio pushed on still farther into the great dismal swamp a weird section of strange vegetable and animal life where great black trees stood silent and grim with spanish moss dangling from their branches brightplumaged birds flashed across the opens ugly snakes glided sinuously over the boggy land and sleepy alligators slid from muddy banks and disappeared beneath the surface of the dead water the professor continued to grumble if we should come upon one of these wonderful golden herons frank could not come within a hundred yards of it with that old bow and arrow he said couldnt i retorted frank perhaps not but i could make a bluff at it i dont see why you wont use a gun well there are two reasons in the first place in order to be sure of killing a heron with a shotgun id have to use fairly large shot and that might injure the bird badly in the second place there might be two and id not be able to bag more than one of them with a gun as the report would scare the other then there is the possibility that i would miss with the first shot and the heron would escape entirely if i miss with an arrow it is not likely the bird will be alarmed and take to flight so ill have another chance at it oh there are some advantages in using the primitive bow and arrow bosh exploded scotch you have a way of always making out a good case for yourself you wont be beaten begobs he is a hard by to bate profissor grinned barney av he wurnt its dead hed been long ago thats right thats right agreed scotch who admired frank more than he wished to acknowledge hes lucky its not all luck profissor assured the irish boy in minny cases its pure nerve thot pulls him through well theres a great deal of luck in it of course there is oh humor the professor barney laughed frank perhaps hell become better natured if you do they now came to a region of wild cypress woods where the treetops were literally packed with old nests made in the peculiar heron style they were constructed of huge bristling piles of crosslaid sticks not unlike brush heaps of a western clearing here for years almost ages different species of herons had built their nests in perfect safety as the canoe slowly and silently glided toward the rookeries white and blue herons were seen to rise from the reedgrass and fly across the opens in a stately manner with their long necks folded against their breasts and their legs projecting stiffly behind them pwoy dont yez be satisfoied wid a few av th whoite wans frankie asked barney softly shure theyre handsome enough theyre handsome admitted frank but a golden heron is worth a large sum as a curiosity and i mean to have one all roight me by have yer own way lad hell do that anyhow mumbled professor scotch gruffly they could now see long soldierlike lines of herons stretched out along the reedy swales standing still and solemn like pickets on duty they were not particularly wary or wild for they had not been hunted very much in the wild region which they inhabited little green herons were plentiful and they kept flying up before the canoe constantly scaring the others till frank grew very impatient declaring those little rascals will scare away a golden heron if we are fortunate enough to come upon one confound them let me shoot a few of th varmints urged barney reaching for one of the guns in the bottom of the canoe not much returned frank quickly think what the report of a gun would do here keep still barney all roight muttered the irish lad reluctantly relinquishing his hold on the gun av ye soay kape still kape still it is frank instructed the professor to take in his paddle and barney was directed to hold the canoe close to the edge of the rushes in this manner with frank kneeling in the prow an arrow ready notched on the string he could shoot with very little delay beyond the heron rookery the waterway wound into the depths of a dark forbidding region where the spanish moss hung thick and the great trees leaned over the water they had glided past one side of the rookery and were near this dark opening when an exclamation of surprise came from frank merriwells lips phat is it me by asked barney quickly a canoe phere see it yonder yes oi see it now its white there must be other hunters near at hand said the professor the canoe is not drawn up to the bank said frank in a puzzled way it seems to be floating at some distance from the shore perhaps it is moored out there why should it be moored in such a place there are no tides here and alligators are not liable to steal canoes do ye see inny soign av a camp frankie not a sign of a camp or a human being this is rather strange a strange feeling of wonder that swiftly changed to awe was creeping over them the canoe was snowy white and lay perfectly motionless on the still surface of the water it was in the dark shadow beneath the trees perhaps the owner of the canoe is lying in the bottom suggested the professor well see about that said frank putting down the bow and arrow and taking up a paddle head straight for her barney with the very first stroke in that direction a most astonishing thing happened the white canoe seemed to swing slightly about and then with no visible occupant and no apparent motive power it glided smoothly and gently toward the dark depths of the black forest shes floating away from us cried the professor there must be a strong current there nivver a bit is she floating gasped barney mulloy will ye look at her go begobs oi fale me hair shtandin on me head she is not floating frank said see she gains speed look at the ripple that spreads from her prow but but spluttered professor scotch what is making her move what is propelling her thats a mystery came from frank but its a mystery i mean to solve get out your paddle professor keep straight after that canoe barney well run her down and look her over then a strange race began canoe against canoe the one in the lead apparently empty the one pursuing containing three persons who were using all their strength and skill to overtake the empty craft illustration the white canoe had stopped and was lying calmly on the inky surface of the shadowed water see page chapter xxvi still more mysterious pull panted frank pull mumbled the professor pull snorted barney in disgust great drops of perspiration rolling down his face as if we wurnt pullin were not gaining the white canoe keeps just so far ahead begobs its not our fault at all at all indeed no matter how hard they worked no matter how fast they made the canoe fly through the water they could not gain on the mysterious white canoe the distance between the two canoes seemed to remain just the same and the one in advance slipped through the water without a sound following the winding water course beneath the dark trees and going deeper and deeper into the heart of the swamp other water courses were passed running away into unknown and unexplorable wilds it grew darker and darker and the feeling of awe and fear fell more heavily upon them at last exhausted and discouraged the professor stopped paddling crying to his companions in a husky voice stop boys stop there is something supernatural about that fiendish boat it is luring us to some frightful fate nonsense professor retorted frank you are not superstitious you have said so at least a score of times thats all right returned scotch shaking his head i do not take any stock in rappings table tippings and that kind of stuff but i will confess this is too much for me begobs oi dont wonder at thot gurgled barney mulloy wiping the great drops of perspiration from his forehead its the divvils own canoe thot is sure oh its simple enough declared frank nettled thin ixplain it fer me me by ixplain it oh i wont say that i can explain it for i do not pretend to understand it but ill wager that the mystery would be readily solved if we could overtake and examine that canoe mebbe so but i think it nades a stameboat to overtake it professor scotch shook his head in a most solemn manner boys he said in all my career i have never seen anything like this and i shall never dare tell this adventure for people in general would not believe it theyd think i was lying without doubt admitted frank and still i will wager that the explanation of the whole matter would seem very simple if we could overtake that canoe and examine it perhaps so you speak as if you doubted it possibly i do i am surprised at you professor i am more than surprised i cant help it if you are my boy i am afraid your mind is beginning to weaken soay frankie broke in barney oi loike fun as well as th nixt wan but be jabbers its nivver a bit av it can oi see in this see that infernal canoe cried the professor pointing at the mystic craft it has stopped out there in the shadows and seems to be waiting for us to pursue again thats what its doing im ready exclaimed frank i am not decisively declared professor scotch nayther am oi almost shouted the irish youth its enough av this koind av business oive been in well turn about said scotch grimly that canoe will lure us into this dismal swamp so far that well never find our way out well turn about at once frank laughed all right he said i suppose ill have to give up but i do dislike to leave without solving the mystery of that canoe it may be thot were so far in thot we cant foind our way out at all at all said the irish lad im afraid well not be able to get out before nightfall confessed the professor i have no fancy for spending a night in this swamp barney promptly expressed his dislike for such an adventure but frank was silent the canoe turned about and they set about the task of retracing the water courses by which they had come far into the swamp it was not long before they came to a place where the courses divided frank was for following one while both barney and the professor insisted that the other was the right way finally frank gave in to them although it was against his better judgment and he felt that he should not submit they had not proceeded far before as they were passing round a bend a cry of astonishment fell from barneys lips howly shmoke he shouted thot bates th band whats the matter asked frank and the professor together thot whoite canoe what of it look back th thing is afther follying av us they looked back and sure enough there was the mysterious canoe gliding after them like a most uncanny thing well i like that said frank in a tone that plainly indicated he did not like it this is very pleasant pull pull throbbed the professor splashing his paddle into the water and very nearly upsetting them all dont let the thing overtake us pull pull oi think its a foine plan to be gettin out av this muttered barney in an agitated tone of voice steady there professor called frank sharply what do you want to do drown us all keep cool its coming fluttered the little man wildly let it come as long as we could not overtake it let it overtake us that is a very good scheme th skame wont worruck me by th ould things shtopped it was true the white canoe had stopped and was lying calmly on the inky surface of the shadowed water well i cant say that i like this said frank and i scarcely think i like it more than you do came from the professor an th both av yez loike it as well as mesilf put in the irish youth what are we to do go on go on they did but the white canoe still followed keeping at a distance i cant stand this declared frank as he picked up a rifle from the bottom of the canoe i wonder how lead will work on her pwhat are yez goin to do me by cried barney in alarm shoot a few holes in that craft was the deliberate answer swing to the left so that i may have a good chance dont shoot palpitated the professor dont shoot gurgled barney what is the matter with you demanded frank sharply you both appear like frightened children no telling whatll come of it if you shoot ill simply put a few holes through that canoe it may be the destruction of us it may sind us all to glory by th farrust express nonsense dont be foolish swing her to the left i say i am going to shoot and that settles it it was useless for them to urge him not to fire he was determined and nothing they could say would change his mind the canoe drifted round to the left and the rifle rose to franks shoulder spang the clear report rang out and echoed through the cypress forest the bullet tore through the white canoe and the weird craft seemed to give a leap like a wounded creature hit it cried frank triumphantly hit it echoed the professor quivering with terror hit it groaned barney mulloy his face white and his eyes staring may all the saints defind us look shouted frank she is turning about she is going to leave us but ill put another bullet through her up the rifle came but just as he pressed the trigger professor scotch pushed the weapon to one side so the bullet did not pass within twenty feet of the white canoe why did you do that demanded frank angrily i couldnt see you shoot into that canoe again faltered the agitated professor it was too much too much what do you mean by that professor scotch shook his head he could not explain and he was ashamed of his agitation and fears well you fellows lay over anything i ever went up against said frank in disgust i didnt suppose you could be so thoroughly childish all right frank came humbly from the professors lips i cant help it and i havent a word to say but i will take one more shot at that canoe vowed frank not this day chuckled barney mulloy shes gone it was true the mysterious canoe had vanished from view while they were speaking chapter xxvii in the everglades gone disappeared the exclamations came from frank and professor scotch barneys chuckle changed to a shiver and his teeth chattered th ould bys in it he chatteringly declared the old boy must have been in that canoe agreed the professor frank was puzzled and disappointed he still refused to believe there was anything supernatural about the mysterious white canoe but he was forced to acknowledge to himself that the craft had done most amazing things it simply slipped into some branch waterway while we were not looking he said speaking calmly as if it were the most commonplace thing imaginable well its gone said scotch as if greatly relieved now lets get out of this in a great hurry i am for going back to see what has become of the white canoe said frank with deliberate intent to make his companions squirm barney and the professor raised a perfect howl of protest never shouted scotch nearly upsetting the boat in his excitement and wildly flourishing his arms in the air nivver squealed the irish lad oill joomp overboard an swim out av this before oill go back frank laughed you are most amusing he declared i suppose ill have to give in to you as you are two to one come on fluttered the professor lets be moving so frank put down the rifle and picked up his paddle and they resumed their effort to get out of the swamp before nightfall but the afternoon was well advanced and night was much nearer than they had thought as they were soon to discover at last barney cried oi see loight enough ahead we must be near out av th woods frank said nothing for a long time he had been certain they were on the wrong course but he hoped it would bring them out somewhere he had noted the light that indicated they were soon to reach the termination of the cypress swamp but he held his enthusiasm in check till he could be sure they had come out somewhere near where they had entered the dismal region professor scotch grew enthusiastic immediately ha he cried punching frank in the back what do you think now young man do you mean to say that we dont know our business what if we had accepted your way of getting out of the swamp wed been in there now sir dont crow till youre out of the woods advised frank begobs oi belave hed be plazed av we didnt get out at all at all exclaimed barney somewhat touched in a short time they came to the termination of the cypress woods but to the surprise of barney and the professor the swamp overgrown with tall rushes and reedgrass continued with the water course winding away through it pwhat th ould boy does this mane cried the irish lad it means said frank coolly that we have reached the everglades th ivirglades well pwhat do we want iv thim oi dunno they are one of the sights of florida barney its soights enough ive seen alreddy oid loike ter git out av this i knew you wouldnt get out this way for we have not passed the rookeries of the herons as you must remember thats true sighed the professor dejectedly i hadnt thought of that what can we do boys turn about and retrace our steps said frank but barney and the professor raised a vigorous protest nivver a bit will yez get me inther thot swamp again th doay shouted the irish lad in a most decisive manner if we go back well not be able to get out before darkness comes on and well have to spend the night in the swamp said scotch excitedly i cant do that well what do you propose to do asked frank quietly i dont seem to have anything to say in this matter you are running it to suit yourselves they were undecided but one thing was certain they would not go back into the swamp the white canoe was there and the professor and the irish lad did not care to see that again whoy not go on frankie asked barney were out av th woods an by follyin this strame we ought to get out av th iverglades what do you say professor asked frank who was rather enjoying the adventure although he did not fancy the idea of spending a night on the marsh go on by all means go on roared the little man go on it is then well proceed to explore the everglades in company with professor scotch the noted scientist and daring adventurer go ahead so they pushed onward into the everglades while the sun sank lower and lower finally dropping beneath the horizon night was coming on and they were in the heart of the florida everglades the situation was far from pleasant barney and the professor fell to growling at each other and they kept it up while frank smiled and remained silent at length scotch took in his paddle in disgust groaning were lost i am inclined to think so myself admitted frank cheerfully well whos to blame oid loike to know cried the irish lad you are roared the professor like a wounded lion gwan wid yez exploded barney its yersilf thot is to blame frankie wanted to go the other woay but ye said no me me me howled the professor did i you were the one you insisted that this was the proper course to pursue you are to blame for it all profissor yere a little oulder thin oi be but av ye wur nigh me age oid inform ye thot ye didnt know how to spake th truth do you mean to call me a

well thot would be more av a male thin the rist av ye are loikely to get th noight so it is come come laughed frank this is no time nor place to quarrel youre right frank but this ungrateful young villain makes me very tired careful professor slang excuse me but you know human beings are influenced by their surroundings and associates if i have professor cried frank reproachfully you would not accuse me of having taught you to use slang ah ha ahem no no that is you see er well er that dutch boy was always saying something slangy hans yes professor professor hes not here to defend himself oh well oh well ha ha ha quite a joke quite a little joke you know you always appreciate a joke frank you are full of fun yourself as under the circumstances there was nothing else to do they finally paddled slowly forward looking for a piece of dry land where they could stop and camp for the night they approached a small cluster of trees which rose above the rushes and it was seen that they seemed to be growing on land that was fairly high and dry well stop there decided frank its not likely well find another place like that anywhere in the everglades as they came nearer they saw the trees seemed to be growing on an island for the water course divided and ran on either side of them just the place for a camp cried frank delightedly this is really a very interesting and amusing adventure it may be for you groaned the professor but you forget that it is said to be possible for persons to lose themselves in the everglades and never find their way out on the contrary i remember it quite well in fact it is said that without a guide the chances of finding a way out of the everglades is small indeed well what do you feel so exuberant about why the possibility that well all perish in the everglades adds zest to this adventure makes it really interesting frank youre a puzzle to me you are cautious about running into danger of any sort but once in it you seem to take a strange and unaccountable delight in the peril the greater the danger the happier you seem to feel thots roight nodded barney when i am not in danger my good judgment tells me to take no chances but when i get into it fairly i know the only thing to be done is to make the best of it i delight in adventure i was born for it a dismal sound came from the professors throat when your uncle died said scotch i thought him my friend although we had quarreled i fancied the hatchet was buried he made me your guardian and i still believed he had died with nothing but friendly feelings toward me but he knew you and now i believe it was an act of malice toward me when he made me your guardian and to add to my sufferings he decreed that i should travel with you asher dow merriwell deliberately plotted against my life he knew the sort of a career you would lead me and he died chuckling in contemplation of the misery and suffering you would inflict upon me that man was a monster an inhuman wretch look there cried barney pointing toward the small timbered island what is it may ould nick floy away wid me av it aint a house chapter xxviii the hut on the island a house a cabin a hut amid the trays in a little clearing on some rising ground amid the trees they could see the hut is it possible any one lives here exclaimed the professor it looks as if some one stops here at times at least said frank av this aint a clear case av luck oi dunno mesilf well get the man who lives there to guide us out of the everglades shouted the professor in a relieved tone then frank cast a gloom over their spirits by saying this may be a hunters cabin inhabited only at certain seasons of the year ten to one theres no one living in it now youd be pleased if there wasnt almost snarled professor scotch youre a boy without a heart frank laughed softly well soon find out if theres any one at home he said as the canoe ran up to the bank and he took care to get out first as soon as frank was out the professor made a scramble to follow him he rose to his feet despite barneys warning cry and a moment later the cranky craft flipped bottom upward with the swiftness of a flash of lightning the professor and the irish lad disappeared beneath the surface of the water barneys head popped up in a moment and he stood upon his feet with the water to his waist uttering some very vigorous words up came the professor open flew his mouth out spurted a stream of water and then he wildly roared help save me i cant swim im drowning before either of the boys could say a word he went under again this is th firrust toime oi iver saw a man thot wanted to drown in thray fate av wather said barney frank sat down on the dry ground and shouted with laughter up popped the professor a second time help he bellowed after he had spurted another big stream of water from his mouth will you see me perish before your very eyes save me frank but frank was laughing so heartily that he could not say a word and the little man went down once more hivins he really manes to drown said barney in disgust grab him gasped frank dont let him go down again oh my what a scrape this beats our record for the third time the professors head appeared above the surface and the professors voice weakly called will no one save me this is a plot to get me out of the way oh frank frank i never thought this of you farewell may you be happy when i am gone stand up shouted frank seeing that the little man had actually resigned himself to drown get your feet under you the water is shallow there the professor stood up and an expression of pain surprise and disgust settled on his face as he thickly muttered may i be kicked and ive been under the water twothirds of the time for the last hour ive swallowed more than two barrels of this swampwater including in all probability a few dozen pollywogs lizards young alligators and other delightful things if the water wasnt so blamed dirty here and i wasnt afraid of swallowing enough creatures to start an aquarium id just lie down and refuse to make another effort to get up then he waded out the look on his face causing frank to double up with merriment while even the wretched barney smiled barney would have waded out but frank said dont attempt to land without those guns old man theyre somewhere on the bottom and we want them so barney was forced to plunge under the surface and feel around till he had fished up the rifles and the shotgun frank had taken care of his bow and arrows the latter being in a quiver at his back and the paddles had not floated away after a time everything was recovered the canoe was drawn out and tipped bottom upward and the trio moved toward the cabin frank leading and the professor staggering along behind reaching the cabin frank rapped loudly on the door no answer once more he knocked and then as there was no reply he pushed the door open and entered the cabin was not occupied by any living being but a glance showed the trio that some one had been there not many hours before for the embers of a fire still glowed dimly on the open hearth of flat stones there were two rooms the door between them being open so the little party could look into the second the first room seemed to be the principal room of the hut while the other was a bedroom they could see the bed through the open doorway there were chairs a table a couch and other things for the most part rude homemade stuff and still every piece showed that the person who constructed it had skill and taste around the walls were hung various tin pans and dishes all polished bright and clean what surprised them the most was the wire screens in the windows a screen door that swung inward and a mosquitobar canopy over the bed and the couch by jove cried frank the person who lives here is prepared to protect himself against mosquitoes and black flies it would be impossible to live here in the summer gravely declared professor scotch forgetting his own misery for the moment the pests would drive a man crazy oh i dont know about that returned frank if a man knew how to defend himself against them he might get along all right they cant be worse than the mosquitoes of alaska in the warm months up there the indians get along all right even though mosquitoes have been known to kill a bear pwhats thot gurgled barney kill a bear oh frankie me by oi nivver thought that av you its true affirmed professor scotch sometimes bears lured by hunger will come down into the lowlands where mosquitoes will attack them they will stand up on their hind legs and strike at the little pests with their forward paws sometimes a bear will do this till he is exhausted and falls then the mosquitoes finish him thots a harrud yarn to belave profissor but it goes av you soay so said barney thinking it best to smooth over the late unpleasantness up there said frank the indians smear their faces and hands with some kind of sticky stuff that keeps the mosquitoes from reaching their flesh in that way they get along very well but they had something to talk about besides the indians of alaska for the surprises around them furnished topics for conversation exploring the place they found it well stocked with provisions which caused them all to feel delighted im actually glad we came laughed frank this is fun galore it will be all right if we are able to get out of the scrape said scotch barney built a fire while frank prepared to make bread and cook supper having found everything necessary for the accomplishment of the task the professor stripped off his outer garments wrung the water out of them and hung them up before the fire to dry his example was followed by the irish boy they made themselves as comfortable as possible and night came on finding them in a much better frame of mind than they had expected to be frank succeeded in baking some bread in the stone oven he found coffee and a pot bubbled on the coals sending out an odor that made the trio feel ravenous there were candles in abundance and two of them were lighted then when everything was ready they sat down to the table and enjoyed a supper that put them in the best of moods the door of the hut was left open and the light shone out upon the overturned canoe and the dark water beyond after supper they cleaned and dried the rifles and shotgun by jingoes laughed frank this is a regular picnic im glad we took the wrong course and came here you may change your tune before we get out said the professor whose trousers were dry and who was now feeling of his coat to see how that was coming on dont croak profissor advised barney youre th firrust mon oi iver saw thot wuz bound ter drown himsilf in thray fate av wather ha ha ha oh laugh laugh snapped the little man fiercely ill get even with you for that some time what fools boys are after supper they lay around and took things easy barney and frank told stories till it was time to go to bed and they finally turned in first having barred the door and made sure the windows were securely fastened they soon slept but they were not to rest quietly through the night other mysterious things were soon to follow those of the day chapter xxix a wild night in the swamp clang clang clang fire turn out the boys leaped to their feet and the professor came tearing out of the bedroom ran into the table which he overturned with a great clatter of dishes reeled backward and sat down heavily on the floor where he rubbed his eyes and muttered i thought that fire engine was going to run me down before i could get out of the way fire engine cried frank merriwell who ever heard of a fire engine in the heart of the florida everglades oi herrud th gong declared barney so did i asserted the professor i heard something that sounded like a fire gong admitted frank pwhat was it oi dunno it seemed to come from beneath the head of the bed in there said scotch an oi thought i herrud it under me couch out here gurgled barney we will light a candle and look around said frank a candle was lighted and they looked for the cause of the midnight alarm but they found nothing that explained the mystery whist hissed the irish boy its afther gettin away from here wed better be mark me worrud what makes you think that demanded frank sharply its spooks there be around this place ur oim mistaken oh ive heard enough about spooks its getting tiresome the professor was silent but he shook his head in a very mysterious manner as if he thought a great many things he did not care to speak about they had been thoroughly awakened but after a time failing to discover what had aroused them they decided to return to bed five minutes after they lay down frank and the professor were brought to their feet by a wild howl and a thud they rushed out of the bedroom and nearly fell over barney who was lying in the middle of the floor at least eight feet from the couch what is the matter with you cried frank astonished oi was touched palpitated the irish lad thickly touched thots pwhat what do you mean by that oi wur jist beginning to get slapy whin something grabbed me an threw me clan out here in th middle av th room oh say what are you trying to make us believe oill swear to it frankie oill swear on a stack av boibles you dreamed it barney thats whats the matter nivver a drame me by fer oi wasnt aslape at all at all but you may have been asleep for you say you were beginning to get sleepy there isnt anything here to grab you oi dunno about thot frankie oim incloined to belave th ould bys around so oi am oh this is tiresome go back to bed and keep still nivver a bit will oi troy to slape on thot couch again th noight me by oill shtay roight here on th flure sleep where you like but keep still thats all frank was somewhat nettled by these frequent interruptions of his rest and he was more than tempted to give barney cause to believe the hut was really haunted for he was an expert ventriloquist and he could have indulged in a great deal of sport with the irish boy but other things were soon to take up their attention while they were talking a strange humming arose on every side and seemed to fill the entire hut at first it was like a swarm of bees but it grew louder and louder till it threatened to swell into a roar professor scotch was nearly frightened out of his wits it is the end of everything he shrieked making a wild dash for the door which he flung wide open but the professor did not rush out of the cabin instead he flung up his hands staggered backward and nearly fell to the floor the white canoe he faintly gasped clutching at empty air for support frank sprang forward catching and steadying the professor the white canoe where out there sure enough on the dark surface of the water directly in front of the hut lay the mysterious canoe and now this singular craft was illuminated from stem to stern by a soft white light that showed its outlines plainly sint patherick presarve us panted barney mulloy i am getting tired of being chased around by a canoe said frank in disgust as he hastily sought one of the rifles dont shoot entreated the professor in great alarm av yer do our goose is cooked fluttered barney frank threw a fresh cartridge into the rifle and turned toward the open door his mind fully made up and then to the profound amazement of all three seated in the canoe there seemed to be an old man with white hair and long white beard the soft white light seemed to come from every part of his person as it came from the canoe frank merriwell paused with the rifle partly lifted its th spook himsilf gasped barney covering his face with his hands and clinging to the professor thats right faintly said scotch for mercys sake dont shoot frank were lost if you do frank was startled and astonished but he was determined not to lose his nerve no matter what happened the man in the canoe seemed to be looking directly toward the cabin he slowly lifted one hand and pointed away across the everglades at the same time motioning with the other hand as if for them to go in that direction ill just send a bullet over his head to see what he thinks of it said frank softly lifting the rifle then another startling thing happened canoe and man disappeared in the twinkling of an eye the trio in the hut gasped and rubbed their eyes gone cried frank vanished panted the professor an now oi suppose yell say it wur no ghost gurgled barney it was extremely dark beneath the shadow of the cypress trees and not a sign of the mysterious canoe could they see it is evident he did not care to have me send a bullet whizzing past his ears laughed frank who did not seem in the least disturbed what are your nerves made of demanded professor scotch in a shaking tone of voice they must be iron hark franks hand fell on the professors arm and the three listened intently hearing something that gave them no little surprise from far away through the night came the sound of hoarse voices singing a wild doleful song hamlets ghost ejaculated the professor pwhat the ould nick does thot mane cried barney hark frank again cautioned lets see if we can understand the words they are singing be still we sailed away from gloucester bay and the wind was in the west yo ho and her cargo was some new england rum our grog it was made of the best yo ho a sailors song decided frank and those are sailors who are singing we are not alone in the everglades theyre all drunk declared the professor you can tell that by the sound of their voices drunken men are dangerous theyre a blamed soight betther than none fer its loikely they know th way out av this blissed swamp said barney they may bubbubbe puppuppuppirates chattered the professor what sticks me said frank is how a party of sailors ever made their way in here for we are miles upon miles from the coast here is another mystery are ye fer takin a look at th loikes av thim frankie certainly and that without delay come professor never what do you mean i am not going near those ruffianly and bloodthirsty pirates then you may stay here with the spooks while barney and i go this was altogether too much for the professor and when he found they really intended to go he gave in frank loaded the rifles and the shotgun and took along his bow and arrows even though barney made sport of him for bothering with the last they slipped the canoe into the water and directed by frank the professor succeeded in getting in without upsetting the frail affair oi hope we wont run inther the ghost uttered the irish boy the sound of that singing comes from the direction in which the old man seemed to point said frank this was true as they all remembered the singing continued sometimes sinking to a low droning sound sometimes rising to a wild wail that sounded weirdly over the marshland ready said frank and the canoe slipped silently over the dark surface of the water course the singing ceased after a time but they were still guided by the sound of wrangling voices they are quarreling exclaimed frank softly this is tuttutterrible stuttered the professor suddenly the sound of a pistol shot came over the rushes followed by a feminine shriek of pain or terror chapter xxx franks shot frank and his two companions were profoundly astonished as soon as he could recover frank asked did you hear that av course we hearrud it returned barney excitedly it sounded very much like the voice of a woman or girl said professor scotch who was so amazed that he forgot for the moment that he was scared thats what it was declared frank and it means that our aid is needed in that quarter at once be careful be cautious warned the professor theres no telling what kind of a gang we may run into to thunder with thot grated barney mulloy quivering with eagerness theres a female in nade av hilp go ahead directed frank giving utterance to his old maxim the professor was too agitated to handle a paddle so the task of propelling the canoe fell to the boys who sent it skimming over the water frank watching out for snags in a moment the water course swept round to the left and they soon saw the light of a fire gleaming through the rushes the sounds of a conflict continued telling them that the quarrel was still on and aiding them in forming their course in a moment they came in full view of the campfire by the light of which they saw several struggling swaying figures franks keen eyes seemed to take in everything at one sweeping glance six men and a girl were revealed by the light of the fire five of the men were engaged in a fierce battle while the sixth was bound in a standing position to the trunk of a tree the girl with her hands bound behind her back was standing near the man who was tied to the tree and the firelight fell fairly on the faces of man and girl a low exclamation of the utmost astonishment broke from franks lips it cant be it is an impossibility he said pwhat is it me by quickly demanded barney the man the girl look barney do you know them oi dunno well i know there is no mistake that is captain justin bellwood whose vessel was lost in the storm off fardale coast i am certain of it an th girrul is elsie bellwood his daughter th wan you saved from th foire frankie as sure as fate it cant be possible fluttered professor scotch captain bellwood has a new vessel and he would not be here you must be mistaken frank not on your life that is captain bellwood and his daughter there is no mistake professor but how there has been some kind of trouble and they are captives that is plain enough those men are sailors captain bellwoods sailors its likely there has been a mutiny we must save them how can it be done we must land while those ruffians are fighting we are well armed if we can get ashore well set the captain free and i fancy well be able to hold our own with those ruffians desperate wretches though they are wait advised the timid professor perhaps they will kill each other and then our part will be easy frank was not for waiting but at that moment something happened that caused him to change his plan immediately the fighting ruffians were using knives in a deadly way and one man bleeding from many wounds fell exhausted to the ground another who seemed to be this ones comrade tore himself from the other three leaped to the girl caught her in his arms and held her in front of him so that her body shielded his then pointing a revolver over her shoulder he snarled come on and ill bore the three of ye you cant shoot me gage unless you kill ther gal the youngest one of the party a mere boy but a fellow with the air of a desperado stepped to the front saying swiftly if you dont drop that girl jaggers youll leave your carcass in this swamp that is business my hearty frank clapped a hand over his mouth to keep from uttering a great shout of amazement the next moment he panted this is fate look barney by the eternal skies that is leslie gage my worst enemy at fardale academy and the fellow who ran away to keep from being expelled it was reported that he had gone to sea yere roight frankie agreed the no less excited irish lad its thot skunk an no mistake it is leslie gage agreed the professor he was ever a bad boy but i did not think he would come to this an oi always thought he would come to some bad ind it wur thot spalpane thot troied to run frank through with a sharpened foil wan toime whin they wur fencing he had black murder in his hearrut thin an its not loikely th whilp has grown inny betther since keep still whispered frank lets hear what is said the man with the girl laughed defiantly retorting you talk big gage but it wont work with me i hold the best hand just at present and youll have to come to terms keep back you dont dare shoot returned the young desperado as he took still another step toward the sailor in a moment the man placed the muzzle of the revolver against the temple of the helpless girl fiercely declaring if you come another inch ill blow her brains out the dastard grated frank oh the wretch wait i will fix him or my name is not merriwell he drew an arrow from the quiver and fitted the notch to the bowstring his nerves were steady and he was determined he waited till the man had removed the muzzle of the weapon from the girls temple and then he lifted the bow barney and the professor caught their breath they longed to check frank but dared not speak for fear of causing him to waver and send the arrow at the girl the bow was bent the line was taut the arrow was drawn to the head and then twang the arrow sped through the air but it was too dark for them to follow its flight with their eyes with their hearts in their mouths they awaited the result of a sudden the ruffian uttered a cry of pain released his hold on the girl and fell heavily to the ground the firelight showed the arrow sticking in his shoulder ugh grunted a voice close beside the canoe very good shot for a white boy not many could do that the trio turned in amazement and alarm and within three feet of them they saw a shadowy canoe that contained a shadowy figure there was but one person in the strange canoe and he immediately added there is no need to fear socato the seminole for he will not harm you he is the friend of all good white men it was an indian a seminole belonging to the remnant of the once great nation that peopled the florida peninsula frank realized this in a moment and knowing the seminoles were harmless when well treated felt no further alarm the indian had paddled with the utmost silence to their side while they were watching what was taking place on shore the arrow had produced consternation in the camp the fellow who was wounded tried to draw it from his shoulder groaning this is not a fair deal give me a fair show and ill fight you all where did it come from asked gage in dismay the two canoes were beyond the circle of firelight so they could not be seen from the shore gages two companions were overcome with terror this swamp is full of indians one of them cried weve been attacked by a band of savages gage spoke a few words in a low tone and then sprang over the prostrate form of the man who had been stricken down by the arrow grasped the girl and retreated into the darkness his companions also scudded swiftly beyond the firelight leaving captain bellwood still bound to the tree while one man lay dead on the ground and another had an arrow in his shoulder close to franks ear the voice of socato the seminole sounded light bother them they git in the dark and see us from the shore then they shoot this way some jupiter and mars gasped professor scotch i dont care to stay here and have them shoot at me white boys want to save girl asked socato swiftly they pay to get her free what say of course we will pay hastily answered frank can you aid us in saving her if you can you shall be socato save her white man and two boys go back to cabin of great white phantom stay there and socato come with the girl begorra oi dont loike thot declared barney oid loike to take a hand in th rescue mesilf socato can do better alone asserted the seminole trust me but frank was not inclined to desert elsie bellwood in her hour of trouble and he said socato you must take me with you professor you and barney go back to the hut and stay there till we come the indian hesitated and then said if white boy can shoot so well with the bow and arrow he may not be in the way i will take him if he can step from one canoe to the other without upsetting either thats easy said frank as he deliberately and safely accomplished the feat chapter xxxi young in years only well done white boy complimented the strange indian pass me one of those rifles requested frank white boy better leave rifle take bow and arrows advised socato rifle make noise bow and arrow make no noise all right what you say goes return to the hut barney and stay there till we show up but th spook hang the spook well know where to find you if you go there the great white phantom will not harm those who offer him no harm declared the indian i am not so afraid of spooks as i am of jumping jupiter there was a flash of fire from the darkness on shore the report of a gun and a bullet whirred through the air cutting the professors speech short and causing him to duck down into the canoe those fellows have located us said frank swiftly we must get away immediately remember wait at the hut socatos paddle dropped without a sound into the water and the canoe slid away into the night the professor and barney lost no time in moving and it was well they did so for a few seconds later another shot came from the shore and the bullet skipped along the water just where the canoes had been frank trusted everything to socato even though he had never seen or heard of the seminole before something about the voice of the indian convinced the boy that he was honest for all that his darkness was such that frank could not see his face and did not know how he looked the indian sent the canoe through the water with a speed and silence that was a revelation to frank merriwell the paddle made no sound and it seemed that the prow of the canoe scarcely raised a ripple for all that they were gliding along so swiftly where are you going whispered frank observing that they were leaving the campfire astern white boy trust socato if i didnt i shouldnt be here of course i do then keep cool socato take him round to place where we can come up behind bad white men we try to fool um good the light of the campfire died out and then a few moments later another campfire seemed to glow across a strip of low land see it whispered the indian with caution yes what party is camped there friends of yours socato not much who then that same fire same fire as which one bad white men build frank was astonished oh say how is that we left that fire behind us socato and we have come round by the water till it is before us again this was true but the darkness had been so intense that frank did not see how their course was changing i see how you mean to come up behind them said the boy you are going to land and cross to their camp that right they wont look for us that way i reckon not soon the rushes closed in on either side and the indian sent the canoe twisting in and out amid their tall stalks like a creeping panther he seemed to know every inch of the way and followed it as well as if it were broad noonday franks admiration for the fellow grew with each moment and he felt that he could indeed trust socato if we save that girl and the old man you shall be well paid for the job declared the boy feeling that it was well to dangle a reward before the indians mental vision it is good was the whispered retort socato is poor in a few moments they crept through the rushes till the canoe lay close to a bank and the indian directed frank to get out the campfire could not be seen from that position but the boy well knew it was not far away taking his bow with the quiver of arrows slung to his back the lad left the canoe being followed immediately by the seminole who lifted the prow of the frail craft out upon the bank and then led the way passing round a thick mass of reeds they soon reached a position where they could see the campfire and the moving forms of the sailors just as they reached this position leslie gage was seen to dash up to the fire and kick the burning brands in various directions he has done that so that the firelight might not reveal them to us thought frank they still believe us near although they know not where we are crouching and creeping socato led the way and frank followed closely wondering what scheme the indian could have in his head yet trusting everything to his sagacity in a short time they were near enough to hear the conversation of the bewildered and alarmed sailors the men were certain a band of savages were close at hand for they did not dream that the arrow which had dropped jaggers was fired by the hand of a white person the sooner we get away from here the better it will be for us declared leslie gage well have to get away in the boats said a grizzled villainouslooking oneeyed old sailor who was known as ben bowsprit fo de lawds sake gasped the third sailor who was a negro called black tom hows we gwine to run right out dar whar de critter am dat fired de arrer inter jack jaggers the critter doesnt seem to be there any longer assured gage those two shots must have frightened him away thats right agreed bowsprit this has been an unlucky stop fer us mates tomlinson is dead an jaggers i aint dead but im bleedin bleedin bleedin moaned the fellow who had been hit by franks arrow theres a big tear in my shoulder an im afeared ive made my last cruise it serves you right came harshly from the boy leader of the ruffianly crew tomlinson attempted to set himself up as head of this crew as captain over me you backed him all the time you knew i was the leader in every move we have made and a pretty pass you have led us to whined the wounded wretch wheres the money you said the captain had stored away wheres the reward wed receive for the captain alive and well we turned mutineers at your instigation and what have we made of it weve set the law agin us an here we are the bonny elsie has gone up in smoke through the carelessness of a lot of drunken fools snarled gage she should not have been burned but for that we wouldnt be here now hiding from officers of the law well here we are growled ben bowsprit an shiver my timbers if we seem able to get out of this howlin swamp the more we try the more we seem ter git lost fo goodness be yo gwine to stan roun an chin an chin an chin demanded black tom the fires out and we cant be seen spoke gage swiftly in a low tone get the boats ready you two are to take the old man in one ill take the girl in the other its the gal youve cared fer all the time cried jaggers madly it was for her you led us into this scrape shut up i wont you cant make me shut up gage well youll have a chance to talk to yourself and tomlinson before long tomlinson will be jolly company youve killed him accused the wounded man i saw you strike the blow and ill swear to that my hearty its not likely youll be given a chance to swear to it jaggers i may have killed him but it was in selfdefense he was doing his best to get his knife into me yes we was tryin to finish you admitted jaggers with you out of the way tomlinson would have been capn and i first mate youve kept your eyes on the gal all the time i dont believe you thought the capn had money at all it was to get the gal you led

more time talking to you get the boats ready boys i will take the smaller put capn bellwood in the larger and look out for him the two sailors obeyed his orders boy though he was gage had resolved to become a leader of men and he had succeeded the girl quite overcome was prostrate at the feet of her father who was bound to the cypress tree there was a look of pain and despair on the face of the old captain his heart bled as he looked down at his wretched daughter and he groaned merciful heaven what will become of her it were better that she should die than remain in the power of that young villain what are you muttering about old man coarsely demanded gage as he bent to lift the girl you seem to be muttering to yourself the greater part of the time you wretch you young monster grated the old shipmaster do you think you can escape the retribution that pursues all such dastardly creatures as you oh you make me tired i have found out that the goodygood people do not always come out on top in this world besides that its too late for me to turn back now i started wrong at school and i have been going wrong ever since its natural for me i cant help it spare my child oh dont worry about her ill take care of her if you harm her may the wrath of heaven fall on your head let it go at that i will be very tender and considerate with her come elsie he attempted to lift her to her feet but she drew from him shuddering and screaming wildly dont touch me now dont be a little fool he said harshly you make me sick with your tantrums come on now but she screamed the louder seeming to stand in the utmost terror of him with a savage exclamation gage tore off his coat and wrapped it about the girls head so that her cries were smothered perhaps that will keep you still a bit he snapped catching her up in his arms and bearing her to the smaller boat in which he carefully placed her she did not faint as her hands were bound behind her she could not remove the coat from about her head and she sat as he placed her with it enveloping her nearly to the waist is everything ready asked gage where are all the guns somebody take tomlinsons weapons let jaggers have his he may need them when we are gone dont leave me here to die alone piteously pleaded the wounded sailor im pretty well gone now but i dont want to be left here alone gage left the small boat for a moment and approached the spot where the pleading wretch lay jaggers he said its the fate you deserve you agreed to stand by me but you went back on your oath and tried to kill me and now youre going to leave me here to bleed to death or starve why shouldnt i the tables are turned on you my fine fellow well im sure you wont leave me you are yes why wont i this is why jaggers flung up his hand from which a spout of flame seemed to leap and the report of a pistol sounded over the marsh leslie gage fell in a heap to the ground chapter xxxii a mysterious transformation ha ha ha wildly laughed the wounded sailor that time he did not escape leave me to die would he well he is dead already for i shot him through the brain thats where you are mistaken jaggers said the cool voice of the boyish leader of the mutineers i saw your move saw the revolver and dropped in time to avoid the bullet gage sprang to his feet a snarl of baffled fury came from the lips of the wounded sailor the foul fiend protects you he cried see if you can dodge this bullet he would have fired again but gage leaped forward in the darkness kicked swiftly and accurately and sent the revolver spinning from the mans hand you have settled your fate hissed the boy madly i did mean to have you taken away and i was talking to torment you now you will stay here and die like a dog he turned from jaggers and hurried back to the boat in which that muffled figure silently sat are you ready boys he called captain bellwood had been released from the tree and marched to the other boat in which he now sat bound and helpless all ready was the answer all right go ahead they pushed off settled into their seats and began rowing gage was not long in following but he wondered at the silence of the girl who sat in the stern it could not be that she had fainted for she remained in an upright position which way cap asked one of the men any way to get out of this was the answer we will find another place to camp but i want to get away from this spot not a sound came from beneath the muffled coat it must be close thought gage i wonder if she can breathe all right i wish she would do something at last finding he could keep up with his companions without trouble and knowing he would have very little difficulty in overtaking them gage drew in his oars and slipped back toward the muffled figure in the stern elsie he said softly no answer no move miss bellwood still no answer you must not think too hard of me miss bellwood he said pleadingly i would not harm you for anything i love you far too much for that elsie he could have sworn that the sound which came from the muffling folds of the coat was like a smothered laugh but he knew she was not laughing at him i have been wicked and desperate he went on but i was driven to the life i have led fate has been against me all along when i shipped on your fathers vessel it was because i had seen you and knew you were to be along on the cruise i loved you at first sight and i vowed that i would reform and do better if you loved me in return elsie he was speaking swiftly in a low tone and his voice betrayed his earnestness he passed an arm around the muffled figure feeling it quiver within his grasp and then he continued you did not take kindly to me but i persisted then you repulsed me told me you despised me and that made me desperate i swore i would have you elsie then came the mutiny and the burning of the vessel now we are here and you are with me elsie you know not how i love you i have become an outcast an outlaw all for your sake elsie dear elsie cant you learn to love me i will do anything for you anything again a sound came from beneath the coat he was sure she was sobbing it must be that he was beginning to break down that icy barrier she realized her position and she would be reasonable elsie little sweetheart he began to remove the muffling coat do not scream elsie do not draw away darling say that you will love me a little just a little he pulled the coat away and something came out of the folds and touched cold and chilling against his forehead it was the muzzle of a revolver keep still commanded a voice that was full of chuckling laughter if you chirp ill have to blow the roof of your head off gage leslie gage caught his breath and nearly collapsed into the bottom of the boat indeed he would have fallen had not a strong hand fastened on his collar and held him it was not elsie bellwood i dont want to shoot you gage whispered the cool voice i dont feel like that even though you did attempt to take my life once or twice in the past you have made me very good natured within the past few moments how you did love me how gently you murmured do not draw away darling say that you love me a little just a little ha ha ha really gage you gave me such amusement that i am more than satisfied with this little adventure that voice i know it grated gage through set teeth still i cant place you indeed you are forgetful gage but it is rather dark and i dont suppose you expected to see me here we last met at fardale fardale yes and you are frank merriwell gage would have shouted the name in his amazement but franks fingers suddenly closed on the fellows throat and held back the sound in a great measure now you have guessed it chuckled frank oh gage i can forgive you for the past since you have provided me with so much amusement tonight how you urged me to learn to love you but thats too much gage i can never learn to do that leslie ground his teeth but he was still overcome with unutterable amazement and wonder that frank merriwell whom he hated should appear there at night in the wilds of the florida everglades was like a miracle what had become of elsie bellwood had some magic of that wild and dreary region changed her into frank merriwell little wonder that gage was dazed and helpless how in the name of the evil one did you come here he finally asked recovering slightly from his stupor frank laughed softly once more it was the same old merry boyish laugh that gage had heard so often at fardale and it filled him with intense anger as it had in the days of old i know you did not expect to see me murmured frank still laughing i assure you that the evil one had nothing to do with my appearance here it was trickery magic i left her in the boat a few moments what became of her how did you take her place i will let you speculate over that question for a while my fine fellow in the meantime i fancy it will be a good idea to tie you up so you will not make any trouble remember i have a revolver handy and i promise that ill use it if you kick up a row at this moment one of the sailors in the other boat called hello there mr gage where are you chapter xxxiii gage takes a turn gage was tempted to shout for help but the muzzle of the cold weapon that touched his forehead froze his tongue to silence hello ahoy there capn where are you ben bowsprit was growing impatient and wondering why leslie did not answer it had occurred to the old tar that it was possible the boy had deserted them the voice of black tom was heard to say he oughter be right near by us ben smighty strange dat feller don seem to answer nohow shiver my timbers roared bowsprit well pull back my hearty and take a look for our gay capn they were coming back and gage was still unbound although a captive in frank merriwells clutch frank thought swiftly there would not be enough time to bind gage and get away something must be done to prevent the two sailors from turning about and rowing back gage whispered frank swiftly you must answer them say its all right boys im coming right along gage hesitated the longing to shout for help again grasping him do as i told you hissed frank and the muzzle of the revolver seemed to bore into gages forehead as if the bullet longed to seek his brain with a mental curse on the black luck gage uttered the words as his captor had ordered although they seemed to come chokingly from his throat well what are ye doing back there so long demanded bowsprit tell them youre making love chuckled frank who seemed to be hugely enjoying the affair to the unspeakable rage of his captive ask them if they dont intend to give you a show at all gage did as directed causing bowsprit to laugh hoarsely oh youre a sly dog cackled the old sailor in the darkness but this is a poor time to spend in lovemakin capn wait till we git settled down agin tom an mell agree not ter watch ye say all right go on instructed frank and gage did so in a few seconds the sound of oars were heard indicating that the sailors were obeying instructions at that moment while frank was listening to this sound gage believed his opportunity had arrived and being utterly desperate the young rascal knocked aside franks hand gave a wild shout leaped to his feet and plunged headlong into the water it was done swiftly too swiftly for frank to shoot if he had intended such a thing but frank merriwell had no desire to shoot his former schoolmate even though leslie gage had become a hardened and desperate criminal and so having broken away the youthful leader of the mutineers stood in no danger of being harmed frank and socato had been close at hand when gage placed elsie bellwood in the boat and barely was the girl left alone before she was removed by the seminole in whose arms she lay limp and unconscious having swooned at last then it was that a desire to capture gage and a wild longing to give the fellow a paralyzing surprise seized upon frank socato he whispered i am going to trust you to take that girl to the hut where my friends are to be found remember that you shall be well paid i give you my word of honor as to that see that no harm comes to her all right returned the indian what white boy mean to do have a little racket on my own hook was the reply if i lose my bearings and cant find the hut i will fire five shots into the air from my revolver have one of my friends answer in a similar manner it shall be done give me that coat all right now skip with the girl frank took the coat stepped into the boat watched till gage was approaching and then muffled his head sitting in the place where elsie had been left in the meantime the seminole was bearing the girl swiftly and silently away thus it came about that gage made love to frank merriwell instead of the fair captive he believed was muffled by the coat when gage plunged into the water the small boat rocked and came near upsetting but did not go over but the fellows cry and the splash had brought the sailors to a halt and they soon called back whats the matter what has happened i rather fancy it will be a good plan to make myself scarce in this particular locality muttered frank gage swam under water for some distance and then coming to the surface he shouted to the men in the leading boat bowsprit black tom help turn back quickly there is an enemy here but he is alone we can capture him boys be lively about it ha ha ha laughed frank merrily you will have a fine time catching me you have given me great amusement gage i assure you that i have been highly entertained by your company and hereafter i shall consider you an adept in the gentle art of making love laugh fiercely shouted gage from the water you are having your turn now but mine will soon come i have heard you talk like that before gage it does not seem that you have yet learned the way of the transgressor is hard youll learn better than to meddle with me i have longed to meet you again frank merriwell and i tell you now that one of us will not leave this swamp alive this is not the first time you have made a promise that you were not able to keep before i leave you i have this to say if captain bellwood is harmed in the least if he is not set at liberty with very little delay ill never rest till you have received the punishment which your crimes merit frank could hear the sailors rowing back and he felt for the oars having no doubt that he would be able to escape them with ease aided by the darkness then came a surprise for him when gage stopped rowing to make love to the supposed elsie he had left the oars in the rowlocks drawing them in and laying them across the boat in the violent rocking of the boat when the fellow leaped overboard one of the oars had been lost frank was left with a single oar and his enemies were bearing down upon him with great swiftness i wonder if theres a chance to scull this boat he coolly speculated as he hastened to the stern and made a swift examination to his satisfaction and relief he found there was and the remaining oar was quickly put to use even then frank felt confident that he would be able to avoid his enemies in the darkness that lay deep and dense upon the great swamp he could hear them rowing and he managed to skull the light boat along without making much noise he did not mind that gage had escaped in fact he was relieved to get rid of the fellow although it had been his intention to hold him as hostage for captain bellwood it was the desire for adventure that had led frank into the affair and now that it was over so far as surprising gage was concerned he was satisfied to get away quietly he could hear the sailors calling gage who answered from the water and he knew they would stop to pick the fellow up which would give our hero a still better show of getting away all this took place and frank was so well hidden by the darkness that there was not one chance in a thousand of being troubled by the ruffianly crew when another astonishing thing happened from a point amid the tall rushes a powerful white light gleamed out and fell full and fair upon the small boat and its single occupant revealing frank as plainly as if by the glare of midday sunlight great scott gasped the astonished boy what is the meaning of this i would like to know he was so astonished that he nearly dropped the oar the sailors were astonished but the light showed them distinctly and gage snarled give me your pistol bowsprit be lively he snatched the weapon from the old tars hand took hasty aim and fired frank merriwell was seen to fling up his arms and fall heavily into the bottom of the boat chapter xxxiv a fearful fate got him grated the triumphant young rascal flourishing the revolver thats the time i fixed him the mysterious light vanished in the twinkling of an eye but it had shone long enough for gage to do his dastardly work the sailors were alarmed by the light and wished to row away but gage raved at them ordering them to pull down toward the spot where the other boat lay after a time the men recovered enough to do as directed and the smaller boat was soon found rocking lightly on the surface running alongside gage reached over into the small boat and his hand found the boy who was stretched in the bottom here he is cried the young rascal gleefully ill bet anything i put the bullet straight through his heart and then as if his own words had brought a sense of it all to him he suddenly shuddered with horror faintly muttering that was murder the horror grew upon him rapidly and he began to wonder that he had felt delight when he saw frank merriwell fall the shooting had been the impulse of the moment and now that it was done and he realized what it meant he would have given much to recall that bullet never mind he thought i swore that one of us should not leave this swamp alive and my oath will not be broken i hated frank merriwell the first time i saw him and i have hated him ever since now he is out of my way and he will never cross my path again there was a slight stir in the small boat followed by something like a gasping moan he dont seem to be dead yet capn said ben bowsprit i guess your aim wasnt as good as you thought that nettled gage oh i dont think hell recover very fast said the youthful rascal harshly he rose and stepped over into the smaller boat give me some matches he ordered i want to take a look at the chap he must make a beautiful corpse youll find im not dead yet returned a weak voice and frank merriwell sat up and grappled with gage a snarl of fury came from the lips of the boy desperado so i didnt finish you well youll not get away youll have to fight before you finish me panted frank but merriwell seemed weak and gage did not find it difficult to handle the lad at whom he had shot he forced frank down into the bottom of the boat and then called to his companions give me some of that line ill make him fast a piece of rope was handed to him and black tom stepped into the boat to aid him between them they succeeded in making frank fast for the boys struggles were weak at best now it is my turn cried leslie gloatingly at fardale frank merriwell triumphed he disgraced me and i was forced to fly from the school you disgraced yourself declared the defiant captive you cheated at cards you fleeced your schoolmates and you exposed the trick oh yes i was rather flip with the papers and i should not have been detected but for you merriwell when i was exposed i knew i would be shunned by all the fellows in school and so i ran away but i did not forget who brought the disgrace about and i knew we should meet some time merriwell we did meet how you came here i do not know and why my bullet did not kill you is more than i can understand it would have killed me but for a locket and picture in my pocket returned frank it struck the locket and that saved me but the shock robbed me of strength it must have robbed me of consciousness for a moment it would have been just as well for you if the locket had not stopped the bullet declared gage fiercely by that i presume you mean that you intend to murder me anyway i have sworn that one of us shall never leave this swamp alive go ahead gage came coolly from the lips of the captive luck seems to have turned your way make the most of it while you have an opportunity we cant spend time in gabbing here came nervously from bowsprit lets get away immediately yes put in black tom fo de lawds sake les get away before dat light shine some mo thats right said the old tar some things happen in this swamp that no human being can account for gage was ready enough to get away and they were soon pulling onward again with frank merriwell bound and helpless in the bottom of the smaller boat for nearly an hour they rowed and then they succeeded in finding some dry solid land where they could camp beneath the tall black trees they were so overcome with alarm that they did not venture to build a fire for all that gage was shivering in his wet clothes leslie was still puzzling over frank merriwells astonishing appearance and he tried to question frank concerning it but he could obtain but little satisfaction from the boy he hated the night passed and morning came away to the west stretched the everglades while to the north and the east lay the dismal cypress swamps the party seemed quite alone in the heart of the desolate region leslie started out to explore the strip of elevated land upon which they had passed the night and he found it stretched back into the woods where lay great stagnant pools of water and where grew all kinds of strange plants and vines gage had been from the camp about thirty minutes when he came running back his face pale and a fierce look in his eyes i have heard of it he kept muttering i have heard of it i have heard of it avast there cried bowsprit with an attempt at cheerfulness what are you muttering over what is it you have heard about my hearty the serpent vine answered gage wildly what is the serpent vine you shall see i did not believe there was such a thing but it tangled my feet it tried to twine about my legs and i saw the little red flowers opening and shutting like the lips of devils fo de lawds sake de boss hab gone stark starin mad cried black tom staring at leslie with bulging eyes not much shouted leslie hoarsely but i have thought of a way to dispose of frank merriwell i will feed him to the serpent vine ah that will be revenge frank had listened to all this and he noted that gage actually seemed like a maniac captain bellwood securely bound was near frank to whom he now spoke god pity you my lad he was bad enough before but he seems to have gone mad he will murder you well if thats to be the end of me ill have to take my medicine came grimly from the lips of the undaunted boy captive my child entreated the captain anxiously what became of her can you tell me where is she now she is safe i believe she is with friends of mine and they will fight for her as long as they are able to draw a breath thank heaven now i care not if these wretches murder me i scarcely think they will murder you captain they have nothing in particular against you but gage hates me most bitterly thats right snarled leslie who had overheard franks last words i do hate you and my hatred seems to have increased tenfold since last night i have been thinking thinking how you have baffled me at every turn whenever we have come together i have decided that you are my evil genius and that i shall never have any luck as long as you live i shall keep my oath one of us will not leave this swamp alive and you will be that one go ahead with the funeral said frank stoutly if you have made up your mind to murder me i cant help myself but one thing is sure youll not hear me beg wait till you know what your fate is to be boys set his feet free and then follow me with him between you the cords which held franks feet were released and he was lifted to a standing position then he was marched along after gage who led the way goodby frank called back into the woods he was marched and finally gage came to a halt motioning for the others to stop look he cried pointing there is the serpent vine on the ground before them lay a mass of greenish vines blossoming over with a dark red flower harmless enough they looked but as gage drew a little nearer they suddenly seemed to come to life and they began reaching toward his feet twisting squirming undulating like a mass of serpents there shouted leslie there is the vine that feeds on flesh and blood see see how it reached for my feet it longs to grasp me to draw me into its folds to twine about my body my neck to strangle me the sailors shuddered and drew back while frank merriwells face was very pale it did fasten upon me gage continued if i had not been ready and quick with my knife it would have drawn me into its deadly embrace i managed to cut myself free and escape then he turned to frank and the dancing light in his eyes was not a light of sanity merriwell he said the serpent vine will end your life and youll never bother me any more he leaped forward and clutched the helpless captive screaming thus i keep my promise and he flung frank headlong into the clutch of the writhing vine chapter xxxv the serpent vine with his hands bound behind his back unable to help himself frank reeled forward into the embrace of the deadly vine each branch of which was twisting curling squirming like the arms of an octopus he nearly plunged forward upon his face but managed to recover and keep on his feet he felt the vine whip about his legs and fasten there tenaciously felt it twist and twine and crawl like a mass of serpents and he knew he was in the grasp of the frightful plant which till that hour he had ever believed a creation of some romancers feverish fancy frank did not cry out a great horror seemed to come upon him and benumb his body and his senses he could feel the horrid vines climbing and coiling about him and he was helpless to struggle and tear them away he knew they were mounting to his neck where they would curl about his throat and choke the breath of life from his body it was a fearful fate a terrible death and there seemed no possible way of escaping higher and higher climbed the vine swaying and squirming the bloodred flowers opening and closing like lips of a vampire that thirsted for his blood a look of horror was frozen on franks face his eyes bulged from his head and his lips were drawn back from his teeth he did not cry out he did not seem to breathe but he appeared to be turned to stone in the grasp of the deadly plant it was a dreadful sight and the two sailors rough and wicked men though they were were overcome by the spectacle shuddering and gasping they turned away for the first time gage seemed to fully realize what he had done he covered his eyes with his hand and staggered backward uttering a low groaning sound merriwells staring eyes seemed fastened straight upon him with that fearful stare and the thought flashed through the mind of the wretched boy that he should never forget those eyes they will haunt me as long as i live he panted why did i do it why did i do it already he was seized by the pangs of remorse once more he looked at frank and once more those staring eyes turned his blood to ice water then uttering shriek after shriek gage turned and fled through the swamp plunging through marshy places and jungles falling scrambling up leaping staggering gasping for breath feeling those staring eyes at his back feeling that they would pursue him to his doom scarcely less agitated and overcome bowsprit and the negro followed and frank merriwell was abandoned to his fate frank longed for the use of his hands to tear away those fiendish vines it was a horrible thing to stand and let them creep up up up till they encircled his throat and strangled him to death through his mind flashed a picture of himself as he would stand there with the vines drawing tighter and tighter about his throat and his face growing blacker and blacker his tongue hanging out his eyes starting from their sockets he came near shrieking for help but the thought that the cry must reach the ears of leslie gage kept it back enabled him to choke it down he had declared that gage should not hear him beg for mercy or aid not even the serpent vine and all its horrors could make him forget that vow the little red flowers were getting nearer and nearer to his face and they were fluttering with eagerness he felt a sucking drawing stinging sensation on one of his wrists and he believed one of those fiendish vampire mouths had fastened there he swayed his body he tried to move his feet but he seemed rooted to the ground he did not have the strength to drag himself from that fatal spot and from the grasp of the vine it seemed that hours passed his senses were in a maze and the whole world was reeling and romping around him the trees became a band of giant demons winking blinking grinning at him flourishing their arms in the air and dancing gleefully on every side to the sound of wild music that came from far away in the sky then a smaller demon darted out from amid the trees rushed at him clutched him slashed slashed slashed on every side of him dragged at his collar and panted in his ear white boy fight try to git away his hands are free was it a dream was it an hallucination no his hands were free he tore at the clinging vines he fought with all his remaining strength he struggled to get away from those clinging things all the while that other figure was slashing and cutting with something bright while the vine writhed and hissed like serpents in agony how it was accomplished frank could never tell but he felt himself dragged free of the serpent vine dragged beyond its deadly touch and he knew it was no dream that he was free a black mist hung before his eyes but he looked through it and faintly murmured socato you have saved me yes white boy replied the voice of the seminole i found you just in time a few moments more and you be a dead one that is true socato that is true i owe you my very life i can never pay you for what you have done in truth the indian had appeared barely in time to rescue frank from the vine and it had been a desperate and exhausting battle in another minute the vine would have accomplished its work i hear white boy cry out and i see him run from this way explained the seminole he look scared very much sailor men follow and then i come to see what scare them so i find you it was providence socato you knew how to fight the vine how to cut it with your knife and so you saved me we must git way from here soon as can declared the indian bad white men may not come back and they may come back they may want to see what has happen to white boy frank knew this was true but for some time he was not able to get upon his feet and walk at length the indian assisted him and leaning on socatos shoulder he made his way along avoiding the place where the sailors were camped the seminole proceeded directly to the spot where his canoe was hidden frank got in and socato took the paddle sending the light craft skimming over the water straight to the strange hut where frank and his companions had stopped the previous night they made their way the sun was shining into the heart of the great dismal swamp and elsie bellwood was at the door to greet frank merriwell chapter xxxvi right or wrong elsie held out both hands and there was a welcome light in her eyes it seemed to frank that she was far prettier than when he had last seen her in fardale frank i am so glad to see you he caught her hands and held them looking into her eyes the color came into her cheeks and then she noted his rumpled appearance saw that he was very pale and cried what is it frank you are hurt you are so pale socato grunted in a knowing way but said nothing it is nothing miss bellwood assured the boy i have been through a little adventure thats all i am not harmed he felt her fingers trembling in his clasp and an electric thrill ran over him he remembered that at their last parting she had said it were far better they should never meet again but fate had thrown them together and now what he longed to draw her to him to kiss her to tell her how happy he was at finding her but he restrained the impulse then the voice of barney mulloy called from within the hut phwat ye goin to do me by shtand out there th rist av th doay whoy dont yez come in oi dunno come in frank come in cried professor scotch we have been worried to death over you thought you were lost in the everglades or had fallen into the hands of the enemy your second thought was correct smiled frank as he entered the hut with elsie at his side phwats thot shouted the irish boy in astonishment ye dont mane to say thim spalpanes caught yez thats what they did and they came near cooking me too frank then related the adventures that had befallen him since he started out on his own hook to give leslie gage a surprise he told how gage had made love to him in the boat and barney shrieked with laughter then he related what followed and how his life had been saved by the locket he carried and the professor groaned with dismay following this he related his capture by gage and how the young desperado flung him with his hands bound into the clutch of the serpent vine the narrative first amused and then thrilled his listeners finally they were horrified and appalled by the peril through which he had passed its satans own scum thot gage is grated barney fiercely iver let me get a crack at th loike av him and see phwat will happen to th whilp i hate and despise him declared elsie he is a monster then frank explained how he had been saved by socato and the seminole found himself the hero of the hour soc ould by cried barney thot wur th bist job ye iver did an oim proud av yez yell niver lose anything by thot thrick ayther not much roared the little professor wiping his eyes man give me your hand then the seminole had his hand shaken in a manner and with a heartiness that astonished him greatly that was nothing he declared socato hates the snake vine fight it any time dont make so much row when all had been told and the party had recovered from the excitement into which they had been thrown barney announced that breakfast was waiting elsie for all of her happiness at meeting frank was so troubled about her father that she could eat very little socato ate hastily and then announced that he would go out and see what he could do about rescuing captain bellwood barney wished to go with the seminole but socato declared that he could do much better alone and hurriedly departed then frank did his best to cheer elsie telling her that everything was sure to come out all right as the indian could be trusted to outwit the desperadoes and rescue the captain seeing frank and elsie much together barney drew the professor aside and whispered its a bit av a walk wed better take in th open air oi think but i dont need a walk protested the little man yis ye do profissor declared the irish boy soberly a man av your studious habits nivver takes ixercoise enough but i do not care to expose myself outdoors phwats th matther wid out dures oi dunno its dangerous how theres danger that gage and his gang will appear phwat av they do we can get back here aheed av thim fer we wont go

pretty swate girrul profissor come on now before oi pick ye up an lug ye out so barney finally induced the professor to leave the hut but the little man remained close at hand ready to bolt in through the wide open door the instant there was the least sign of danger left to themselves frank and elsie chatted talking over many things of mutual interest they sat very near together and more and more frank felt the magnetism of the girls winning ways and tender eyes he drew nearer and nearer and finally although neither knew how it happened their hands met their fingers interlocked and then he was saying swiftly earnestly elsie you cannot know how often i have thought of you since you left me at fardale there was something wrong about that parting elsie for you refused to let me know where you were going refused to write to me expressed a wish that we might never meet again she caught her breath her head was bowed and her cheeks were very pale all the while she softly said away down in my heart was a hope i could not kill a hope that we might meet again some day frank and we have met he cried exultantly when we have to part again elsie you will not leave me as you did before you will let me write to you you will write to me occasionally would it be right she was looking straight into his eyes now her face was near his and the temptation was too great for his impulsive nature to resist in a moment his arm was about her neck and he had kissed her right he cried i do not know oh we cannot always be right she quickly released herself from his hold and sprang to her feet the warm blood flushing her cheeks we cannot always be right she admitted but we should be right when we can frank inza burrage befriended me she thinks more of you than any one else in the wide world do not forget inza he lifted his hand to a round hole in his coat where a bullet from leslie gages revolver had cut through and beneath it he felt the ruined and shattered locket that held inzas picture i will not forget he said his voice far from steady chapter xxxvii franks mercy the forenoon passed and the afternoon was well advanced but still socato the seminole did not return but late in the afternoon a boat and a number of canoes appeared in the boat was leslie gage and the two sailors black tom and bowsprit the canoes were filled with indians great shnakes av ireland cried barney mulloy amazed phwat th dickens does this mane oi dunno it means trouble said frank quickly have the rifles ready and be prepared for hot work indians gurgled professor scotch were all dead and scalped those must be seminoles said frank it is scarcely likely that they are very dangerous the boat containing the three white persons ran boldly up to the shore and leslie gage landed advancing a short distance toward the hut the door of which was securely closed he cried hello in there talk with him barney frank swiftly directed the fellow does not know i am alive and i do not wish him to know it just now so barney returned hello yersilf an see how ye loike it you people are in a bad trap declared gage with a threatening air look and he motioned toward the water where the canoes containing the indians were lying these are my backers there are twenty of them and i have but to say the word to have them attack this hut and tear it to the ground well oi dunno about thot coolly retorted the irish lad we moight have something to say in thot case its arrumed we are an we know how to use our goons me foine birrud if you were to fire a shot at one of these indians it would mean the death of you all is thot so well we are arrumed with winchester repeaters an it moight make the death av thim all av we began shootin they do not look very dangerous said frank ill wager something gage has hired the fellows to come here and make a show in order to scare us into submitting the chances are the indians will not fight at all youre not fools said gage and you will not do anything that means the same as signing your death warrant if you will come to reason well have no trouble we want that girl miss bellwood and we will have her if you do not he stopped suddenly for there was a great shouting from the indians the phantom the phantom they cried in tones that betokened the greatest terror then they took to flight paddling as if their very lives depended on it at the same time the mysterious white canoe still apparently without an occupant was seen coming swiftly toward them gliding lightly over the water in a most unaccountable manner exclamations of astonishment broke from the two sailors and leslie gage stared at the singular craft in profound astonishment when the attention of the crowd was on the remarkable sight frank unfastened the door and before gage was aware of it our hero was right upon him you are my prisoner gage frank shouted pointing a revolver at the fellow surrender gage saw the boy he believed he had destroyed uttered a wild shriek threw up his hands and fell in a senseless heap to the ground frank swiftly lifted the fellow and then ran into the cabin with him placing him on the couch the two sailors did not pursue in fact they seemed almost as badly scared as the indians and they got away in their boat rowing as if for their very lives soon passing from sight well begobs exclaimed barney mulloy this is phwat oi call a ragion av wonders its ivery doay and almost ivery hour something happens to astonish ye gage was made secure so he could not get away when he recovered from the swoon into which he seemed to have fallen a short time after socato was seen returning but he was alone in his canoe he has not found my father my poor father cried elsie in distress those terrible men will kill my father wait advised frank lets hear what he has to say i have great confidence in socato the bad white men leave their captive alone said socato and i should have set him free but the great white phantom came and then the white captive disappeared whats that cried frank in astonishment make it plain socato whom do you mean by the great white phantom the one who owns the canoe that goes alone the one who built this house and lives here sometimes every one fears him my people say he is a phantom for he can appear and disappear as he likes and he commands the powers of light and darkness socato knew that the bad white man had hired a hunting party of my people to come here and appear before the house to frighten you but he knew you would not be frightened and the bad men could not get my people to aid them in a fight socato also knew that the great white phantom sent his canoe to scare my people away but he does not know what the great white phantom has done with the man who was a prisoner well it is possible the great white phantom will explain a few things we do not understand said frank for here he comes in his canoe and father my father is with him in the canoe screamed elsie bellwood in delight it was true the white canoe was approaching still gliding noiselessly over the water without any apparent power of propulsion and in it were seated two men one had a long white beard and a profusion of white hair he was dressed entirely in white and sat in the stern of the canoe the other was captain justin bellwood quite unharmed and looking very much at his ease the little party flocked to the shore to greet the captain who waved his hand and called reassuringly to elsie as soon as the canoe touched and came to a rest he stepped out and clasped his daughter in his arms saying fervently heaven be thanked we have come through many dangers and we are free at last neither of us has been harmed and we will soon be out of this fearful swamp the man with the white hair and beard stepped ashore and stood regarding the girl intently paying no heed to the others captain bellwood turned to him saying william this is my daughter of whom i told you elsie this is your uncle william who disappeared many years ago and has never been heard from since till he set me free today after i was abandoned by those wretches who dragged us here my uncle cried the girl wonderingly how can that be you said uncle william was dead and so i believed but he still lives professor scotch i think we had the pleasure of meeting in fardale permit me to introduce you to william bellwood one of the most celebrated electricians living today as he said this captain bellwood made a swift motion which his brother did not see he touched his forehead and the signal signified that william bellwood was not right in his mind this the professor saw was true when he shook hands with the man for there was the light of madness in the eyes of the hermit my brother continued captain bellwood has explained that he came here to these wilds to continue his study of electricity alone and undisturbed he took means to keep other people from bothering him this canoe which contains a lower compartment and a hidden propeller driven by electricity was his invention he has arrangements whereby he can use a powerful searchlight at night and that searchlight came near being the death of me said frank he turned it on me last night just in time to show me to my enemy he has many other contrivances captain bellwood went on he has explained that by means of electricity he can make his canoe or himself glow with a white light in the darkest night begorra weve seen him glow shouted barney and he also states that he has wires connecting various batteries in yonder hut so that he can frighten away superstitious hunters who otherwise might take possession of the hut and give him trouble whoop shouted barney thot ixplains th foireallarum an th power thot throwed me inther th middle av th flure oi nivver hearrud th bate av it it is wonderful wonderful gasped professor scotch at this moment a series of wild shrieks came from the hut startling them all it is gage said frank he seems to be badly frightened they hurried toward the hut frank leading gage was still on the couch and he shrieked still louder when he saw frank an expression of the greatest terror coming to his face take him away take him away screamed the wretched fellow he is dead i killed him dont let him touch me then he began to rave incoherently sometimes frothing at the mouth he is mad cried professor scotch it is retribution came solemnly from franks lips two days later a party of eight persons emerged from the wilds of the great dismal swamp and reached a small settlement they were frank merriwell barney mulloy professor scotch leslie gage captain bellwood and his brother william socato the seminole and last but far from least elsie bellwood what shall be done with gage asked professor scotch he shall be given shelter and medical treatment declared frank and i will see that all the bills are paid thots the only thing oi have against ye me by ye wur always letting up on yer inemies at fardale an ye shtill kape on doin av it if i continue to do so i shall have nothing to trouble my conscience frank did take care of gage and see that he was given the best medical aid that money could procure and as a result the fellow was saved from a madhouse for he finally recovered he seemed to appreciate the mercy shown him by his enemy for he wrote a letter to frank that was filled with entreaties for forgiveness and promised to try to lead a different life in the future that said frank is my reward for being merciful to an enemy if jack jaggers did not perish in the everglades he disappeared ben bowsprit and black tom also vanished and it is possible that they left their bones in the great dismal swamp william bellwood so long a hermit in the wilds of florida seemed glad to leave that region chapter xxxviii in the mountains again leaving their friends in florida frank barney and the professor next moved northward toward tennessee frank wishing to see some of the battlegrounds of the civil war the boys planned a brief tour afoot and were soon on their way among the great smoky mountains professor scotch had no heart for a tour afoot through the mountains and so he had stopped at knoxville where the boys were to join him again in two or three weeks by the end of which period he was quite sure they would have enough of tramping frank and barney were making the journey from gibsons gap to cranstons cove which was said to be a distance of twelve miles but they were willing to admit that those mountain miles were most disgustingly long they had paused to rest midway in the afternoon where the road curved around a spur of the mountain below them opened a vista of valleys and coves hemmed in by wild turbulentappearing masses of mountains some of which were barren and bleak seamed with black chasms above which threateningly hung grimly beetling crags and some of which were robed in dense wildernesses of pine veiling their faces keeping them thus forever a changeless mystery from their eyrie position it seemed that they could toss a pebble into lost creek which wound through the valley below meandered for miles amid the ranges tunneling an unknown channel beneath the rockribbed mountains and came out again where both boys had been silent and awestricken gazing wonderingly on the impressive scene and thinking of their adventures in new orleans and in florida when a faint cry seemed to float upward from the depths of the valley help they listened and some moments passed in silence save for the peeping cry of a bird in a thicket near at hand begorra oi belave it wur imagination frankie said the irish lad at last i do not think so declared frank with a shake of his head it was a human voice and if we were to shout it might be there it is again there could be no doubt this time for they both heard the cry distinctly it comes from below said frank quickly roight me lad nodded barney some wan is in difficulty down there and its mesilf thot dont moind givin thim a lift getting a firm hold on a scrub bush frank leaned out over the verge and looked down into the valley i can see her he cried look barney look down there amid those rocks just below the little waterfall oi see frankie see the flutter of a dress oi do she is waving something at us sure me by she has seen us and is signaling for us to come down and well go instanter as they say out west the boys were soon hurrying down the mountain road a bend of which quickly carried them beyond view of the person near the waterfall it was nearly an hour later when frank and barney approached the little waterfall having left the road and followed the course of the stream is she there frankie anxiously asked barney who was behind cant tell yet was the reply will be able to see in a minute and then she is there sure as fate in another moment they came out in full view of a girl of eighteen or nineteen who was standing facing the waterfall her back toward a great rock a homemade fishing pole at her feet the girl was dressed in homespun the skirt being short and reaching but a little below the knees and a calico sunbonnet was thrust half off her head frank paused with a low exclamation of admiration for the girl made a most strikingly beautiful picture and frank had an eye for beauty nearly all the mountain girls the boys had seen were stolid and flatappearing some were tall and lank but this girl possessed a figure that seemed perfect in every detail her hair was bright auburn brilliant and rich in tint the shade that is highly esteemed in civilization but is considered a defect by the mountain folk frank thought it the most beautiful hair he had ever seen her eyes were brown and luminous and the color of health showed through the tan upon her cheeks her parted lips showed white even teeth and the mouth was most delicately shaped hivvins gasped barney at franks shoulder phwat have we struck oi dunno then the girl cried her voice full of impatience youuns has shorely been long enough in gittin har frank staggered a bit for he had scarcely expected to hear the uncouth mountain dialect from such lips as those but he quickly recovered lifted his hat with the greatest gallantry and said i assure you miss that we came as swiftly as we could yere strangers ef youuns had been maounting boys youd been har in lessn half ther time i presume that is true but you see we did not know the shortest way and we were not sure you wanted us wal what did you low i whooped at ye fur ef i didnt want ye i nighly split my throat ahollerin at ye before ye hard me at all frank was growing more and more dismayed for he had never before met a strange girl who was quite like this and he knew not what to say now that we have arrived he bowed we shall be happy to be of any possible service to you dunno ez i want ye now she returned with a toss of her head howly shmoke gurgled barney at franks ear its a doaisy she is me by frank resolved to take another tack and so he advanced saying boldly and resolutely now that you have called us down here i dont see how you are going to get rid of us you want something of us and well not leave you till we find out what it is the girl did not appear in the least alarmed instead of that she laughed and that laugh was like the ripple of falling water wal now youre talkin she cried with something like a flash of admiration mebbe youuns has got some backbone arter all i like backbone i have not looked at mine for so long that i am not sure what condition it is in but i know i have one an muscle a little then move this rock har that hez caught my foot an holds it thats what i wanted o youuns she lifted her skirt a bit and for the first time they saw that her ankle had been caught between two large rocks where she was held fast kinder slomped in thar when i war fishin she explained an ther big rock dropped over thar an cotched me fast when i tried ter pull out that war nigh two hour ago cordin ter ther sun and you have been standing like that ever since cried frank in dismay lively barney get hold here great scott we must have her out of that in a hurry thots phwat we will ur well turrun th ould mountain over shouted the irish lad as he flew to the aid of his friend the girl looked surprised and pleased and then she said youuns aint goin ter move that rock so easy fer its hefty but your ankle it must have crushed your ankle i low not ye see it couldnt pinch harder ef it tried fer them rocks aint built so they kin git nigher together but its jest made a regler trap so i cant pull my foot out it was no easy thing for the boys to get hold of the rock in a way to exert their strength but they finally succeeded and then frank gave the word and they strained to move it it started reluctantly as if loath to give up its fair captive but they moved it more and more and she was able to draw her foot out then when she was free they let go and the rock fell back with a grating crash against the other youuns have done purty fair fer boys said the girl with a saucy twinkle in her brown eyes spose ill have ter thank ye fer i mought a stood har considerbul longer ef tadnt bin fer ye who be ye anyhow an whar be ye goin frank introduced himself and then presented barney after which he explained how they happened to be in the great smoky mountains she watched him closely as he spoke noting every expression as if a sudden suspicion had come upon her and she was trying to settle a doubt in her mind when frank had finished the girl said never heard o two boys from ther big cities way off yander comin har ter tromp through ther maountings jest fer ther fun o seein ther scenery an ther folks i spose were kinder curis pearin critters ter city folks an youuns may be har ter cotch one o us an put us in a cage fer exhibition she uttered the words in a way that brought a flush to franks cheeks and he hastened to protest halting in confusion when he tried to speak her name which he did not know as yet a ripple of sunshine seemed to break over her face and she laughed outright swiftly saying dont youuns mind me im pizen rough but i dont mean half i say i kin see you is honest an squar though somebody else mought think by yer way that ye warnt my names kate kenyon an i live down toward ther cove i dont feel like fishin arter this an ef youuns is goin that way ill go long with ye she picked up her pole hooked up the line and prepared to accompany them they were pleased to have her as a companion indeed frank was more than pleased for he saw in this girl a singular character illiterate though she seemed she was pretty vivacious and so bright that it was plain education and refinement would make her most fascinating and brilliant chapter xxxix frank and kate the boys did not get to cranstons cove that night for kate kenyon invited them to stop and take supper at her home and they did so kates home was much like the rough cabins of other mountain folks except that flowering vines had been trained to run up the sides and over the door while two large bushes were loaded with roses in front of the house kates mother was in the doorway as they approached she was a tall angular woman with a stolid expressionless face har mammy is some fellers i brung ter see ye said this girl this un is mr merriwell an that un is mr mulloy the boys lifted their hats and bowed to the woman as if she were a society queen she nodded and stared what be youuns doin round these parts she asked pointedly frank explained seeing a look of suspicion and distrust deepening in her face as he spoke huah she grunted when he had finished an what do youuns want o me your daughter invited us to call and take supper said frank coolly i aint uster cookin flipflaps fer city chaps an i dont blieve you kin eat the kind o fodder weuns is uster the boys hastened to assure her that they would be delighted to eat the plainest of food and their eagerness brought a merry laugh from the lips of the girl youuns is considble amusin she said you is powerful perlite i asked em to come mammy its no moren fair pay fer what they done fer me then she explained how she had been caught and held by the rocks and how the boys had seen her from the mountain road and come to her rescue the mothers face did not soften a bit as she listened but when kate had finished she said theyre yore compny ask em in so the boys were asked into the cabin and kate herself prepared supper it was a plain meal but frank noticed that everything looked neat and clean about the house and both lads relished the coarse food indeed barney afterward declared that the corn bread was better than the finest cake he had ever tasted frank was particularly happy at the table and the merry stories he told kept kate laughing and once or twice brought a grim smile to the face of the woman after supper they went out in front of the cabin where they could look up at the wild mass of mountains the peaks of which were illumined by the rays of the setting sun mrs kenyon filled and lighted a cob pipe she sat and puffed away staring straight ahead in a blank manner just how it happened frank himself could not have told but barney fell to talking to the woman in his whimsical way while frank and kate wandered away a short distance and sat on some stones which had been arranged as a bench in a little nook near lost creek from this position they could hear barneys rich brogue and jolly laugh as he recounted some amusing yarn and when the wind was right a smell of the black pipe would be wafted to them do you know said frank this spot is so wild and picturesque that it fascinates me i should like to stop here two or three days and rest better not said the girl shortly why asked the boy in surprise wal it mought not be healthy what do you mean you might be tooken fer revenue for revenue i do not understand i wonder ef you air so ignerent or be you jest makin it honestly and truly i do not understand you wal i kinder low youuns is all right but thars others might not think so spose you know what moonshine is yes it is illicitly distilled whiskey she nodded thats right wal ther revenues say thars moonshine made round these parts they come round evry little while to spy an cotch ther folks that makes it by revenues you mean the officers of the government wal they may be officers but theyre a difrrunt kind than jock hawkins who is jock hawkins hes ther sheriff down to ther cove jock hawkins knows bettern to come snoopin round an hes down on revenues ther same as ther rest o us is then you do not like the revenue officers like em cried the girl starting up her eyes seeming to blaze in the dusky twilight i hate em wussn pizen an ive got good cause fer hatin em the boy saw he had touched a tender spot and he would have turned the conversation in another channel but she was started and she went on swiftly what right has ther goverment to take away anybodys honest means o earnin a livin what right has ther goverment to send spies up har ter peek an pry an report on a man as is makin a little moonshine ter sell that he may be able ter git bread an drink fer his famly what right has ther goverment ter make outlaws an crimnals o men as wouldnt steal a cent that didnt blong ter them if they was starvin frank knew well enough the feeling of most mountain folks toward the revenue officers and he knew it was a useless task to attempt to show them where they were in the wrong kate went on passionately yes i has good right to hate ther revenues an i do didnt they pester my pore old daddy fer makin moonshine didnt they hunt him through ther maountings fer weeks an keep him hidin like a dog an didnt they git him cornered at last in bent coins old cabin an when he refused ter come out an surrender an kep em off with his gun didnt they shoot him so he died three days arter in my arms hate em wal ive got good reason ter hate em kate was wildly excited although she held her voice down as if she did not wish her mother to hear what she was saying frank was sitting so near that he felt her arm quivering against his hate em continued the girl i has more than that to hate em fer whar is my brother rufe ther best boy that ever drored a breath ther revenues come fer him an they got him thar war a trial an they proved ez hed been consarned in makin moonshine he war convicted an hes servin his time hate em wal

but i changed my mind later why wal yere young an youuns both has honest faces revenues is sneaks they show it in their faces i dont suppose they have been able to check the making of moonshine that is not to any extent she laughed harshly wal i judge not did ye ever hear o muriel who is he a moonshiner what of him he makes more whiskey in a week than all ther others in this region afore him made in a month he must be smarter than the others before him wal hes not afeared o ther revenues an hes a mystery to ther men ez works fer him right along a mystery yes how so none o them has seen his face an they dont know who he is they aint been able to find out and they have tried wal con bean war shot through ther shoulder fer follerin muriel an bink mower got it in ther leg fer ther same

ther way i might ef i liked him right thars something about him ez i dont edzacly like that makes it rather onesided and makes me think all the more that i should try to bother him if i lived near do

now youre makin fun o me an i dont like that she drew away as if offended and he leaned toward her eager to convince her of his sincerity indeed i am doing nothing of the sort he protested the moment i saw you today i was struck by the beauty of your hair but that is not the only beautiful feature about you miss kenyon your mouth is a perfect cupids bow and your teeth are like pearls while you have a figure that is graceful and exquisite she caught her breath never nobody talked to me like that afore she murmured round har they jes say kate youd be a rippin good looker ef it warnt fer that red hair o yourn an theyve said it so much that ive come to hate my hair wussn pizen your hair is your crowning beauty it is magnificent say she whispered drawing toward him what i kinder take to you her hand found his and they were sitting very near together i took to you up by ther fall terday she went on in a low tone now dont you git skeered fer im not goin to be foolish an i know im not booklearned an refined same ez your city gals we kin be friends cant we frank had begun to regret his openly expressed admiration but now he said to be sure we can be friends miss kenyon particler friends i am sure i shall esteem your friendship very highly wall particler friends dont call each other miss an mister ill agree ter call you frank ef youll call me kate frank hesitated i am going away tomorrow he thought it wont do any harm is it a go she asked it is a go he answered frank kate a fierce exclamation close at hand the cracking of a twig a heavy step and then a pantherlike figure leaped out of the dusk and flung itself upon frank illustration kate grasped the assailant by the collar and with astonishing strength pulled him off the prostrate lad see page chapter xl a jealous lover the attack was so sudden and fierce that the boy was hurled to the ground before he could make a move to protect himself you shall not have her hissed a voice in his ear a hand fastened on his throat pinning him fast the mans knee crushed into his stomach depriving him of breath the mans other hand snatched out something and lifted it aloft a knife was poised above franks heart and in another moment the blade would have been buried to the hilt in the lads bosom without uttering a sound kate kenyon grasped the wrist of the murderousminded man gave it a wrench with all her strength which was not slight and forced him to drop the knife you dont murder anybody wade miller she panted ill choke ther life outen him snarled the fellow as he tried to fasten both hands on franks throat by this time the boy had recovered from the surprise and shock and he was ready to fight for his life kate grasped the assailant by the collar and with astonishing strength pulled him off the prostrate lad in the twinkling of an eye frank came to his feet and he was ready for a new assault snarling and growling like a mad dog the man scrambled up and lunged toward the boy trying to grasp him frank was a skillful boxer and now his skill came into play for he dodged under the mans right arm whirled like a cat and struck the fellow behind the ear spat sounded the blow sending the assailant staggering and frank followed it up by leaping after him and striking him again the second blow having the force of the lads strength and the weight of his body it seemed that the man was literally knocked spinning and he did not stop till he landed in the creek wal exclaimed the girl i low you kin take keer o yerself now i rather think so came coolly from the boy he caught me foul and i did not have a show at first look out fer his gun i will who is he wade miller frank whistled it was a case of jealousy and he had aroused the worst passions of the man who admired kate kenyon miller came scrambling and snorting from the water and barney mulloy rushed toward the spot crying pwhats th row frankie me by do ye nade inny av me hilp i think not so far i am all right thanks to miss kenyon an you kin fight breathed the mountain maid in sincere admiration i didnt spose city chaps knowed how ter fight some do laughed frank keeping his eyes on miller ill have his life panted the man springing toward frank and then halting suddenly and throwing up his hand look out screamed the girl hes got a pistol frank knew this well enough and he was expecting just such a move so it happened that the words had scarcely left the girls lips when the revolver was sent flying from wade millers hand the boy had leaped forward and with one skillful kick disarmed his foe by knocking the weapon out of his hand miller seemed dazed for a moment and then he started for frank once more grinding his teeth oh let me take a hand in this cried barney mulloy who was eager for a fight me blud is gittin shtagnant keep away ordered frank i can look out for myself ill kill ye ill kill ye snarled the infuriated man well you have tried that trick twice but i do not see that you have succeeded to any great extent ill hammer yer life out o yer carcass with my bare hands possibly that will not be such a very easy trick to do the boys coolness seemed to add to the fury of his assailant and the man made another rush which was easily avoided by frank who struck miller a stinging blow youd better stop wade advised the girl heuns is too much fer youuns an thats plain enough oh ill show ye ill show ye there was no longer any reason in the mans head and frank saw that he must subdue the fellow some way miller was determined to grapple with the boy and frank felt that he would find the mountaineer had the strength of an ox for which reason he must keep clear of those grasping hands for some moments frank had all he could do to avoid miller who seemed to have grown stolid to the lads blows at last frank darted in caught the man behind lifted him over one hip and dashed him headlong to the ground miller lay still stunned wal thats the beatenest i ever saw cried kate kenyon whose admiration for frank now knew no bounds youuns is jes a terror barney laughed whoy thots fun fer frankie he declared miller groaned and sat up lifting his hands to his head and looking about him in a dazed way whats happened ter me he asked speaking thickly ye run agin a fighter this time wade said the girl he done ye an youuns is ther bully o these parts it was an accident mumbled the man i couldnt see ther critter well an so he kinder got that wont go wade half laughed the girl he done you far an squar an its no us ter squawk an yere laffin bout it be ye kate wal i aint done with him

before them ef i cant hev ye i swar no other critter shall be keerful wade miller ive stood all i kin from you an from now on i dont stan no more arter this youuns an meuns aint even friends he fell back a step as if he had been struck a blow and then he hoarsely returned all right kate but ill stick ter my oath i aint ter be thrown aside so easy as fer them city chaps ther maountings aint big enough ter hold them an me wade miller has some power an i wouldnt give a snap for their lives the black caps dont take ter strangers much an they know them critters is hyar im goin now but that dont need ter mean that ill stay away fer long he turned and having picked up his revolver strode away into the darkness quickly disappearing kates trembling hand fell on franks arm and she panted into his ear youuns must git out o ther maountings quick as you kin fer wade miller means what he says an hell kill ye ef you stay hyar chapter xli facing death frank merriwells blood was aroused and he did not feel like letting wade miller drive him like a hunted dog from the mountains by this time i should think you would have confidence in my ability to take care of myself against this man miller he said somewhat testily yore ther best fighter i ever saw but that wont mount ter anything agin ther power miller will set on yer hes popler is wade miller an hell have ther hull maountings ter back him i shall not run for miller and all his friends right is right and i have as good right here as he hang me cried kate admiringly hang me ef i dont like youuns pluck you may find that youll need a friend afore yore done with wade ef ye do wal mebbe kate kenyon wont be fur off thank you said frank it is a good thing to know i shall have one friend in the mountains huah grunted a voice and mrs kenyon was seen stolidly standing in the dusk mebbe youuns will find my kate ther best friend ye could have come gal its time ter gwin so they entered the cabin and barney found an opportunity to whisper to frank shes a corker me by an oi think shes shtuck on yez betther be careful lad its dangerous dont worry returned frank shortly after entering the house mrs kenyon declared she was tired and intended to go to bed she apologized for the bed she had to give the boys but they assured her that they were accustomed to sleeping anywhere and that the bed would be a positive luxury such slicktongued chaps i never did see before declared the old woman they dont seem stuck up an lofty like most city fellers really they make me feel right to home in my own house she said this in a whimsical way that surprised frank who fancied mrs kenyon had no sense of humor kate bade them goodnight and they retired which they were glad to do as they were tired from the tramp of the day frank was awakened by a sharp shake and his first thought was of danger but his hand did not reach the revolver he had placed beneath the pillow for he felt something cold against his temple and heard a voice hiss be easy youuns ef ye make a jowl yore ter be shot barney was awakened at the same time and the boys found they were in the clutches of strong men the little room seemed filled with men and the lads instantly realized they were in a bad scrape through the small window sifted the white moonlight showing that every man wore a black pointed cap and hood which reached to his shoulders in this hood arrangement great holes were cut for the eyes and some had slits cut for their mouths the black caps was the thought that flashed through franks mind the revolvers pressed against the heads of the boys kept them from defending themselves or making an outcry they were forced to get up and dress after which they were passed through the open window like bundles their hands having been tied behind them other blackhooded men were outside and horses were near at hand great scott thought frank merriwell we are in for it we should have been ready for them but when he thought how tired they had been he did not wonder that both had slept soundly while the men slipped into the house by the window which had been readily and noiselessly removed it did not take the men long to get out as they had entered then frank and barney were placed on horses being tied there securely and the party was soon ready to move they rode away and the horses feet gave out no sound which explained why they had not aroused anybody within the cabin the hoofs of the animals were muffled frank wondered what kate kenyon would think when morning came and she found her guests gone she will believe we rose in the night and ran away i hate to have her believe me a coward then he fell to wondering what the men would do with himself and barney we are harmless travelers they will not dare to do anything more than run us out of this part of the country although he told himself this he was far from feeling sure that the men would do nothing else he had heard of the desperate deeds perpetrated by the widely known white caps and it was not likely that the black caps were any less desperate and reckless as they were leaving the vicinity of the cabin one of the horses neighed loudly causing the leader of the party to utter an exclamation of anger ef that rousts ther gal shes libul ter be arter us in a hurry one of the men observed the party hurried forward soon passing from view of the cabin and entering the shadow that lay blackly in the depths of the valley they rode about a mile and then they came to a halt at a command from the leader and frank noticed with alarm that they had stopped beneath a large tree with widespreading branches this looks bad for us old man he whispered to barney thots pwhat it does frankie admitted the irish lad oi fale throuble coming this way the horsemen formed a circle about the captives moving at a signal from the leader who did not seem inclined to waste words brothers o ther black caps said the leader what is ther fate weuns gives ter revenues death every man in the circle uttered the word and they spoke all together it sounded dismal and bloodchilling right bowed the leader now why are we assembled ternight ter dispose o spies chorused the black caps where are they thar each one of the blackhooded band extended a hand and pointed straight at the captive boys how shall they be disposed uv asked the leader they shall be hanged solemnly said the men good cried the leader as if well satisfied produce ther rope in a moment one of the men brought forth a rope this was long enough to serve for both boys and it was quickly cut in two pieces while skillful hands proceeded to form nooses frankie said barney mulloy sadly were done for it looks that way frank was forced to admit oi wouldnt moind so much said the irish lad ruefully av we could kick th booket foighting fer our loives but it is a bit harrud ter go under widout a chance to lift a hand thats right cried frank as he strained fiercely at the cords which held his hands behind his back it is the death of a criminal and i object to it the leader of the black caps rode close to the boys leaned forward in his saddle and hissed in franks ear its my turn now and you mean to murder us demanded frank passionately not murder answered the man weuns is goin ter put two revenues out o ther way thats all its murder cried frank in a ringing tone you know we are not revenue spies men we appeal to you we can prove that we are what we claim to be two boys who are tramping through the mountains for pleasure will you kill us without giving us a chance to prove our innocence the leader laughed harshly its ther same ol whine he said ther revenues alwus cry baby when theyre caught youuns cant fool us an we aint got time ter waste with ye git reddy boys about the boys necks the fatal ropes were quickly adjusted stop frank commanded if you murder us you will find you have not killed two friendless boys we have friends powerful friends who will follow this matter up who will investigate it you will be hunted down and punished for the crime you will not be allowed to escape again the leader laughed pore fool he sneered do youuns think yere stronger an more poerful than ther united states goverment huah ther united states loses her spies an she cant tell who disposed o em we wont be worried by all yore friends he made another movement and the rope ends were flung over a limb that was strong enough to bear both lads hope was dying within frank merriwells breast at last he had reached the end of his adventurous life which had been short and turbulent he must die here amid these wild mountains which flung themselves up against the moonlit sky and the only friend to be with him at the end was the faithful friend who must die at his side franks blood ran cold and sluggish in his veins the spring night had seemed warm and sweet filled with the droning of insects but now there was a bitter chill in the air and the white moonlight seemed to take on a crimson tinge as of blood the boys nature rebelled against the thought of meeting death in such a manner it was springtime amid the mountains with him it was the springtime of life he had enjoyed the beautiful world and felt strong and brave to face anything that might come but this he had not reckoned on and it was something to cause the stoutest heart to shake over the eastern mountains craggy wild barren or pineclad the gibbous moon swung higher and higher the heavens were full of stars and every star seemed to be an eye that was watching to witness the consummation of the tragedy down there in that little valley through which lost creek flowed on to its unknown destination how still it was the silence was broken by a sound that made every blackhooded man start and listen sweet and mellow and musical from afar through the peaceful night came the clear notes of a bugle taratarataratar taratarataratar a fierce exclamation broke from the lips of the leader of the black caps and he grated muriel by ther livin gods hes comin hyar quick boys finish this job an git stop wade miller cried frank commandingly if that is muriel wait for him let him pronounce our fate he is the chief of you all and he shall say if we are revenue spies bah youuns know too much fer yeve called my name that settles ye ye must hang anyway now taratarataratar from much nearer came the sound of the bugle awakening hundreds of mellow echoes which were flung from crag to crag till it seemed that the mountains were alive with buglers the clatter of a horses ironshod feet could be heard telling that the rider was coming like the wind down the valley cut free ther feet o ther prisners panted the leader of the black caps work quick muriel will be here in a few shakes an weuns must be done all ready thar up with em the fatal moment had arrived chapter xlii muriel taratar taratarataratar through the misty moonlight a coalblack horse bearing a rider who once more awakens the clamoring echoes with his bugle comes tearing at a mad gallop up with em repeats wade miller fiercely as the blackhooded men seem to hesitate the ropes tighten stop one of the men utters the command and his companions hesitate muriel is death on revernues says the one who had spoken an thar aint any reason why weuns shouldnt wait fer him thats so more than half the men agree with the one who has interrupted the execution filling wade miller with unutterable rage fools snarled the chief ruffian of the party i am leadin youuns now an yeve gotter do ez i say i order ye ter string them critters up nearer and nearer came the clattering hoofbeats av we can have wan minute more breathed barney mulloy half a minute will do returned frank we refuse ter obey ye now boldly spoke the man who had commanded his companions to stop muriel has signaled ter us an he means fer us ter wait till heuns arrives wait howled miller they shant escape he snatched out a revolver pointed it straight at franks breast and fired just as the desperate ruffian was pulling the trigger the man nearest him struck up his hand and the bullet passed through franks hat knocking it to the ground miller was furious as a maniac but at this moment the black horse and the dashing rider burst in upon the scene plunged straight through the circle halting at the side of the imperiled lads the horse being flung upon its haunches wal what be youuns doin demands a clear ringing voice what work is this that i dont know erbout the men were silent wade miller cowered before the chief of the moonshiners trying to hide the revolver muriels eyes gleaming through the twin holes of the mask he wore found miller and the clear voice cried youuns has been lettin this critter lead ye inter somethin an its fair warnin i gave him ter keep clear o meddlin with my business the boys gazed at the moonshiner chief in amazement for muriel looked no more than a boy as he sat there on his black horse and his voice seemed the voice of a boy instead of that of a man yet it was plain that he governed these desperate ruffians of the mountains with a hand of iron and they feared him weuns war bout ter hang two revernues explained miller muriel looked at the boys revernues he said doubtfully how long sence ther goverment has been sendin boys hyar ter spy on us they know what happens ter ther men they send muttered miller wal taint like theyd be sendin boys arter men failed thats ther way they hope ter fool us an how do you know themuns is revernues we jest spicions it an youuns war hangin em on spicion thout lettin me know we never knows whar ter find ye muriel that is nary excuse fer ef youuns had held themuns a day id knowed it it looks like youuns war in a monstrus hurry it war heuns declared one of the black hoods pointing to miller heuns war in ther hurry we dont generly waste much time in dinkerin roun with anybody weuns thinks is revernues said miller wal we aint got ther record o killin innercent boys an we dont begin now take ther ropes off their necks two men hastened to obey the order while miller sat and grated his teeth as this was being done muriel asked what war youuns doin with that revolver when i come i heard ye shoot an i saw ther flash who did youuns shoot at miller stammered and stuttered till muriel repeated the question his voice cold and hard despite its boyish caliber wal said wade reluctantly ill have ter tell yer i shot at heuns and he pointed at frank i thought so was all muriel said when the ropes were removed from the necks of the boys muriel directed that their feet be tied again and their eyes blindfolded these orders were attended to with great swiftness and then the moonshiner chief said follow out they rode from beneath the tree and away through the misty moonlight frank and barney could not see but they felt well satisfied with their lot for they had been saved from death for the time being and somehow they felt that muriel did not mean to harm them frank whispered barney are yez there here replied frank close at hand its dead lucky we are to be livin me by you are quite correct barney i feel like singing a song of praise and thanksgiving but were not out of the woods yet thot muriel is a dandy frankie oim shtuck on his stoyle he is no more than a boy i wonder how he happened to appear at such an opportune moment nivver a bit do oi know but its moighty lucky fer us thot he did frank fell to speculating over the providential appearance of the moonshiner chief it was plain that muriel must have known that something was happening and he had signaled with the bugle to the black caps in all probability other executions had taken place beneath that very tree for the young chief came there direct without hesitation for nearly an hour they seemed to ride through the night and then they halted the boys were removed from the horses and compelled to march into some kind of a building after some moments their hands were freed and tearing away the blindfolds they found themselves in a low square room with no windows and a single door with his back to the door stood muriel the light of a swinging oil lamp illumined the room muriel leaned gracefully against the door his arms folded and his eyes gleaming where the lamplight shone on them through the twin holes in the sable mask the other moonshiners had disappeared and the boys were alone in that room with the chief of the mountain desperadoes there was something strikingly cool and selfreliant in muriels manner something that caused frank to think that the fellow young as he was feared nothing on the face of the earth at the same time there was no air of bravado or insolence about that graceful pose and the quiet manner in which he was regarding them instead of that the moonshiner was a living interrogation point everything about him seeming to speak the question that fell from his lips are youuns revernues why do you ask us frank quickly counter questioned you must know that we will lie if we are and so you will hear our denial anyway that can give you little satisfaction look hyar she tol me fair an squar that youuns warnt revernues but i dunno how she could tell of whom are you speaking frank fancied that he knew but he put the question and muriel answered ther gal that saved yore lives by comin ter me an tellin me ther boys had taken you outer her mammys house kate kenyon yes god bless her she did save our lives for if you had been one minute later you would not have arrived in time dear girl ill not forget her muriel moved uneasily and he did not seem pleased by franks words although his face could not be seen it was some moments before he spoke but his voice was strangely cold and hard when he did so its well ernough fer youuns ter remember her but yed best take car how ye speak o her shes got friends in ther maountings true friends frank was startled and he felt the hot blood rush to his face then in a moment he cried friends well she has no truer friends than the boys she saved tonight i hope you will not misconstrue our words mr muriel a sound like a smothered laugh came from behind that baffling mask and muriel said yore hotblooded i war simply warnin youuns in advance thats all i thought it war best it was quite unnecessary we esteem miss kenyon too highly to say anything that can give a friend of hers just cause to strike against us wal city chaps are light o tongue an theyre apt ter think that evry maounting girl is a fool ef she dont have book learnin some city chaps make their boast how easy they kin mash such gals anything like that would count agin youuns frank was holding himself in check with an effort it is plain you do not know us and you have greatly misjudged us we are not in the mountains to make mashes and we are not the kind to boast of our conquests thots right me jool growled barney whose temper was started a bit an its mesilf thot loikes to be suspected av such a thing it shtirs me foighting blud the irish lad clinched his fist and felt of his muscle moving his forearm up and down and scowling blackly at the cool chief of moonshiners as if longing to thump the fellow this seemed to amuse muriel but still he persisted in further arousing the lads by saying insinuatingly i war led ter blieve that kate war ruther interested in youuns by her manner thar dont no maounting gal take so much trouble over strangers fer nothin frank bit his lip and barney looked blacker than ever it seemed that muriel was trying to draw them into a trap of some sort and they were growing suspicious had this young leader of mountain ruffians rescued them that he might find just cause or good excuse to put them out of the way the boys were silent and muriel forced a laugh wal ye wont talk about that an so well go onter somethin else i judge youuns know yore in a poerful bad scrape we have good reasons to think so begorra we have thot exclaimed barney feeling of his neck and making a wry face as if troubled by an unpleasant recollection it is a scrape that youuns may not be able ter git out of easy muriel said i war able ter save yer from bein hung thout any show at all but yere not much better off now if you were powerful enough to save us in the first place you should be able to get us out of the scrape entirely youuns dont know all about it moonshiners have laws an regulations an even ther leader must stan by them frank was still troubled by the unpleasant suspicion that muriel was their enemy after all that had happened he felt that they must guard their tongues for there was no telling what expression the fellow might distort and turn against them seeing neither of the lads was going to speak muriel went on yes moonshiners have laws and regulations ther boys came nigh breakin one o ther laws by hangin youuns ternight thout givin ye a show then we are to have a fair deal eagerly cried frank ez fair ez anybody gits assured muriel tossing back a lock of his coalblack hair which he wore long enough to fall to the collar of his coat aint that all ye kin ask i dont know that depends on what kind of a deal it is wall yell be given yore choice we demand a fair trial if it is proven that we are revenue spies well have to take our medicine but if it is not proven we demand immediate release take my advice dont demand anything o ther black caps ther more ye demand ther less ye git we have a right to demand a fair deal right dont count in this case it is might that holds ther fort youuns stirred up a tiger agin ye when you made wade miller mad its a slim show that ye escape ef weuns lets yer go instanter hed foller yer an hed finish yer somewhar we will take our chances on that we have taken care of ourselves so far and we think we can continue to do so all we ask is that we be set at liberty and given our weapons an yed be found with yer throats cut within ten miles o hyar that would not be your fault wal cordin to our rules ye cant be released onless ther vote ur ther card sez so the vote or the cards what do you mean by that wal its like this ef its put ter vote one black bean condemns youuns ter death an evry man votes black ur white as he chooses i dont judge youuns care ter take yer chances that way howly sint patherick gurgled barney mulloy oi shud soay not ixchuse us from thot me hearty that would be as bad as murder exclaimed frank there would be one vote against us one black bean thrown at least muriel nodded i judge youuns is right pwhat av th carruds yes what of them two men will be chosen one ter hold a pack o cards and one to draw a card from them ef ther card is red it lets youuns off fer it means life ef it is black it cooks yer fer it means death the boys were silent dumfounded appalled it was a lottery of life and death muriel stood watching them and frank fancied that his eyes were gleaming with satisfaction the boy began to believe he had mistaken the character of this astonishing youth muriel might be even worse than his older companions for he might be one who delighted in torturing his victims frank threw back his head defiance and scorn written on his handsome face it is a clean case of murder at best he cried his voice ringing out clearly we deserve a fair trial we demand it wal drawled the boy moonshiner i warned youuns that ther more yer demanded ther less yer got ye seem ter fergit that were in fur it frankie me by groaned barney if we had our revolvers wed give them a stiff fight for it grated frank fiercely they would not murder us till a few of them had eaten lead muriel seemed to nod with satisfaction youuns has stuff an when i tell yer that yell have ter sta ter vote ur take chances with ther cards i dont judge youll hesitate its one ur tother then make it the cards said frank hoarsely that will give us an even show if the draw is a fair one ill see ter that assured muriel it shall be fair without another word he turned and swiftly slipped out of the room they heard him bar the door and then they stood looking into each others faces speechless for a few moments its a tossup barney frank finally observed thots pwhat it is an th woay our luck is runnin oi think its a case av heads they win an tails we lose it looks that way admitted frank but there is no way out of it well have to grin and bear it pwhat do yez think av thot muriel hes an enigma worse than thot me by hes a cats cradle toied in a hundred an sivintane knots it is impossible to tell whether he is friendly or whether he is the worst foe we have in these mountains oi wonder how kate kenyon knew where to foind him so quick i have thought of that she must have found him in a very short time after we were taken from the cabin an she diskivered thot we hed been taken away moighty soon afther we wur gone me by thot is sure remember one of the horses neighed it may have aroused kate and her mother and caused them to investigate loikely thot wur th case fer its not mesilf thot would think shed kape shtill an let ther spalpanes drag us away av she knew it no i believe her utterly fearless and it is plain that wade miller is not the only one in love with her who ilse muriel mebbe yere roight frankie it strikes me that way the fellow tried to lead me into a trap tried to get me to boast of a mash on her i could see his eyes gleam with jealousy in her eagerness to save us to have him aid her in the work she must have led him to suspect that one of us had been making love to her barney whistled a bit and then he shyly said oi wunder av wan of us didnt do a bit av thot not i protested frank we talked in a friendly manner in fact she promised to be a friend to me i may have expressed admiration for her hair or something of the sort but i vow i did not make love to her well me by ye have a thrick av gettin all th girruls shtuck on yez av ye look at thim so ye didnt nade ter make love its not my fault barney its nivver a fault at all at all me lad oi wish oi wur built th soame woay but its litthle oice i cut wid th girruls this south av oireland brogue thot oi foind mesilf unable to shake counts against me a bit oi belave i should think miller and muriel would clash its plain enough that miller is afraid av muriel and muriel intends to keep him thus i fancy it was a good thing for us that kate kenyon suspected wade miller of having a hand in our capture and told muriel that we had been carried off by him for i fancy that is exactly what happened muriel was angry with miller and he seized the opportunity to call the fellow down but for that he might not have made such a hustle to save us thin we should be thankful thot muriel an miller do not love ache ither the boys continued to discuss the situation for some time and then they fell to examining the room in which they were imprisoned it did not seem to have a window anywhere and the single door appeared to be the only means of entering or leaving the place theres little show of escaping from this room said frank roight ye are nodded barney this wur built to kape iverything safe thot came in here a few minutes later there was a sound at the door and muriel came in with two of the black caps at his heels ther boys have agreed ter give ye ther chance o ther cards said the boy moonshiner an yore goin ter have a fair an squar deal we will have to submit said frank quietly you will have ter let ther boys bind yer hands afore ye leave this room said muriel the men each held the end of a stout rope and the boys were forced to submit to the inconvenience of having their hands bound behind them barney protested but frank kept silent knowing it was useless to say anything when their hands were tied muriel said follow he led the way while frank came next with barney shuffling sulkily along at his heels the two men came last they passed through a dark room and entered another room which was lighted by three oil lamps the room was well filled with the blackhooded moonshiners who were standing in a grim and silent circle with their backs against the walls into the center of this circle the boys were marched the door closed and muriel addressed the black caps it is not often that weuns gives our captives ther choice uv ther cards or ther vote but we have agreed ter do so in this case with only one objectin an he war induced ter change his mind now we mean ter have this fair an squar an i call on evry man present ter watch out an see that it is ther men has been serlected one ter hold ther cards an one ter draw let them step forrud two of the black caps stepped out and frank started a bit for he believed one of them was wade miller a pack of cards was produced and muriel shuffled them with a skill that told of experience after which he handed them to one of the men miller was to draw frank watched every move determined to detect the fraud if possible should there be any fraud an awed hush seemed to settle over the room the men who wore the black hoods leaned forward a little every one of them watching to see what card should be drawn from the pack barney mulloy caught his breath with a gasping sound and then was silent standing stiff and straight muriel was as alert as a panther and his eyes gleamed through the holes in his mask like twin stars the man who received the pack from muriel stepped forward and miller reached out his hand to draw then frank suddenly cried wait that we may be satisfied we are having a fair show in this matter why not permit one of us to shuffle those cards quick as a flash of light muriels hand fell on the wrist of the man who held the cards and his clear voice rang out stop unbind his hands he shall shuffle franks hands were unbound and he was given the cards he shuffled them but he did not handle them with more skill than had muriel he shook them up thoroughly and then passed them back to the man who was to hold them bind him muriels order was swiftly obeyed and frank was again helpless draw the cards were extended wade miller reached out and quickly made the draw holding the fateful card up for all to see it was the ace of spades chapter xliii saved death from beneath the black hoods sounded the terrible word as the man beheld the black card which was exposed to view the boys were doomed franks heart dropped like a stone into the depths of his bosom but no sound came from his lips barney mulloy showed an equal amount of nerve indeed the irish lad laughed recklessly as he cried its nivver a show we had at all at all frankie th snakes had it fixed fer us all th toime hold on thar the words came from muriel and the boy chief of the moonshiners made a spring and a grab snatching the card from millers hand look hyar he cried this wont do lets give ther critters a fair show do you mean ter say they didnt have a fair show demanded wade miller fiercely do you say that i cheated not knowin it answered muriel but ther draw warnt fair jes ther same warnt fair snarled miller furiously why not because two cards war drawed rang out the voice of the masked youth look hyar they be one is ther ace o spades an ther other is ther nine o hearts exclamations of astonishment came from all sides and a ray of hope shot into frank merriwells heart did i draw two cards muttered miller as if surprised wal what o that ther black card war ther one exposed an that settles whatll be done with ther spies it dont settle it declared muriel promptly them boys is goin ter have a squar show it was with the greatest difficulty that miller held himself in check his hands were clinched and frank fancied that he longed to spring upon muriel the boy chief was very cool as he took the pack of cards from the hand of the man who had held them release one of the prisoners was his command the cards shall be shuffled again once more franks hands were freed and again the cards were given him to shuffle he mixed them deftly without saying a word and gave them back to muriel then his hands were tied and he awaited the second drawing be careful an not get two cards this time warned muriel as he faced miller this draw settles ther business fer themuns the cards were given to the man who was to hold them and miller stepped forward to draw again the suspense became great again the men leaned forward to see the card that should be pulled from the pack again the hearts of the captives stood still miller hesitated he seemed to feel that the tide had turned against him for a moment he was tempted to refuse to draw and then with a muttered exclamation he pulled a card from the pack and held it up to view then with a bitter cry of baffled rage he flung it madly to the floor it was the queen of hearts each man in the room seemed to draw a deep breath it was plain that some were disappointed and some were well satisfied that settles it said muriel calmly theyuns wont be put out o ther way ternight settles it snarled miller furious with disappointment it war settled afore i claim that ther first draw counts an i claim that it dont returned the youthful moonshiner without lifting his voice in the least youuns all agreed ter ther second draw an that lets them off oh you have worked it slick grated the disappointed black cap but them critters aint out o ther maountings yit by that yer mean jes what theyre not liable ter git out alive ef theyuns is killed ill know whar ter look fer ther one as war at ther bottom o ther job an ill look muriel did not bluster and he did not speak above an ordinary tone but it was plain that he meant every word wal muttered miller what do ye mean ter do with them critters turn em out an let em bring ther officers down on us no im goin ter keep em till they kin be escorted out o ther maountings thar aint time ternight fer its gittin toward mornin termorrer night it can be done miller said no more he seemed to know it was useless to make further talk but frank and barney knew that they were not yet out of danger the boys seemed as cool as any one in the room for all of the deadly peril they had passed through and muriel nodded in a satisfied way when he had looked them over come he said in a low tone youuns will have ter go back ter ther room whar ye war a bit ago they were willing to go back and it was with no small amount of relief that they allowed themselves to be escorted to the apartment muriel dismissed the two guards and then he set the hands of the boys free thar ye are he said yore all right fer now thanks to you bowed frank i want to make an apology fer what suspecting you of doubledealing youuns did suspect me yes why it looked that way once it seemed that you had saved us from being hanged but that you intended to finish us here ef that war my scheme why did i take ther trouble ter save ye at all it looked as if you did so to please miss kenyon you had saved us and then if the men disposed of us in the regular manner you would not be to blame muriel shook back his long black hair and his manner showed that he was angry he did not feel at all pleased to know his sincerity had been doubted wal he said slowly ef it hadnt been fer me youuns would be gone coons now begobs we know thot exclaimed barney youuns know i saved ye but ye dont know how i done it there was something of bitterness and reproach in the voice of the youthful moonshiner he continued i done that fer you i never done before fer no man i wouldnt a done it fer myself frank wondered what the strange youth could mean do youuns want ter know what i done asked muriel yes i cheated cheated yes how when i snatched ther first card drawn from ther hand o ther man what drawed it it war ther ace o spades an it condemned yer ter die but there were two cards drawn no thar war one card drawed an that war all but but you showed two muriel nodded that war whar i cheated he said simply i had ther red card in my hand ready ter do ther trick ef a black card war drawed in that way i knowed i could give yer two shows ter escape death the boys were astounded by this revelation but they did not doubt that muriel spoke the truth his manner showed that he was not telling a falsehood and this strange boy this remarkable leader of moonshiners had done such a thing to save them more than ever they marveled at the fellow once more muriels arms were folded over his breast and he was leaning gracefully against the door his eyes watching their faces for several moments both boys were stricken dumb with wonder and surprise frank was not a little confused thinking as he did how he had misunderstood this mysterious youth even now frank could not understand him it seemed most unaccountable that he should do such a thing for two lads who were utter strangers to him a sound like a bitter laugh came from behind the sable mask and muriel flung out one hand with an impatient gesture i know what youuns is thinkin of declared the young moonshiner ye wonder why i done so wal i dont jes know myself but i promised kate ter do my best fer ye you have kept your promise cried frank kept it nobly muriel you may be a moonshiner you may be the leader of the black caps but i am proud to know you i believe you are white all the way through thar exclaimed the youth with a show of satisfaction that makes me feel better but it war kate as done it an shes ther one ter thank but it aint likely youunsll ever see her agin then tell her said frank swiftly tell her for us that we are very thankful tell her we shall not forget her ill never forget her muriel moved uneasily he seemed about to speak and then checked himself you will tell her said frank appealingly ill tell her nodded muriel his voice sounding a bit strange is that all youuns want me ter tell her tell her i would give much to see her again came swiftly from franks lips shes promised to be my friend and right well has she kept that promise thats all questioned the boy moonshiner that is all then ill have ter leave youuns now take it as easy as yer kin breakfast will be brought ter ye and when another night comes a guard will go with yer out o ther maountings goodby he was going wait cried frank will you shake hands before you go he held out a hand and muriel seemed to hesitate after a few moments the masked lad shook his head and without another word left the room begorra cried barney scratching his head thot felly is worse than oi thought oi dont know so much about him now as oi did bafore oi met him at all at all the boys were given much food for conversation they made themselves as comfortable as possible and talked over the thrilling events of the night if kate kenyon had not told me that her brother was serving time as a convict i should think this muriel must be her brother said frank av hes not her brither its badly shtuck on her he must be oi dunno observed barney an av he be shtuck on her pwhoy dont he git onter th collar av thot miller that was a question frank could not answer finally when they had tired of talking the boys lay down and tried to sleep frank was beginning to doze when his ears seemed to detect a slight rustling in that very room and his eyes flew open in a twinkling he started up a cry of wonder surging to his lips and being smothered there kate kenyon stood within ten feet of him as frank started up the girl swiftly placed a finger on her lips warning him to be silent frank sprang to his feet and barney mulloy sat up rubbing his eyes and beginning to speak pwhats th matter now me by are yez howly shmoke barney clasped both hands over his mouth having caught the warning gestures from frank and the girl still the exclamation had escaped his lips although it was not uttered loudly swiftly kate kenyon flitted across the room listening with her ear to the door to hear any sound beyond after some moments she seemed satisfied that the moonshiners had not been aroused by anything that had happened within that room and she came back standing close to frank and whispering ef youuns will trust me i judge i kin git yer out o this scrape trust you exclaimed frank softly as he caught her hand we have you to thank for our lives kate your pardon miss kenyon how can we ever repay you dont stop ter talk bout that now she said with chilling roughness ef youuns want ter live an yer want ter git erway frum wade miller git reddy ter foller me we are ready begorra were waitin but how are we to leave this room how did you enter she silently pointed to a dark opening in the corner and they saw that a small trapdoor was standing open we kin git out that way she said the boys wondered why they had not discovered the door when they examined the place but there was no time for investigation kate kenyon flitted lightly toward the opening pausing beside it she pointed downward saying go ahead ill foller and close ther door the boys did not hesitate for they placed perfect confidence in the girl now barney dropped down in advance and his feet found some rude stone steps in a moment he had disappeared and then frank followed as lightly as a fairy kate kenyon dropped through the opening closing the door behind her the boys found themselves in absolute darkness in some sort of a narrow underground place and there they paused awaiting their guide she came in a moment her hand touched frank as she slipped past and he caught the perfume of wild flowers to him she was like a beautiful wild flower growing in a wilderness of weeds the touch of their hands was electric come the boys heard the word and they moved slowly forward through the darkness now and then feeling dank walls on either hand for a considerable distance they went on in this way and then the passage seemed to widen out and they felt that they had entered a cave keep close ter me directed the girl here give me your hands now youuns cant git astray at last a strange smell came to their nostrils seemingly on the wings of a light breath of air what is that asked frank ther mill whar ther moonshine is made oh now the boys recognized the smell still she led them on through the darkness never for a moment did she hesitate she seemed to have the eyes of an owl all at once they heard the sound of gently running water is there a stream near asked frank lost creek runs through har answered the girl lost creek why we are still underground an lost creek runs underground have ye fergot that so the mysterious stream flowed through this cavern and the cave was near one of the illicit distilleries frank cared to know no more for he did not believe it was healthy to know too much about the makers of moonshine it was not long before they approached the mouth of the cave they saw the opening before them and then of a sudden a dark figure arose there the figure of a man with a gun in his hands chapter xliv franks suspicion its all right kate uttered the words and the boys began to recover from their alarm as she did not hesitate in the least who is it asked frank dummy who is dummy a cousin o mine hell do anything fer me i put him thar ter watch out while i war in hyar they went forward of a sudden kate struck a match holding it so the light shone on her face and the figure at the mouth of the cave was seen to wave its hand and vanish ther coast is clear assured the girl but its gittin right nigh mornin an weuns must hustle away from hyar afore it is light we wont lose any time the boys were well satisfied to get away as quickly as possible they passed out of the dark cavern into the cool sweet air of a spring morning for the gray of dawn was beginning to dispel the darkness and the birds were twittering from the thickets the phantom of a moon was in the sky hanging low down and halfinverted as if spilling a spectral glamour over the ghostly mists which lay deep in lost creek valley the sweet breath of flowers and of the woods was in the morning air and from some cabin afar on the side of a distant mountain a wakeful watchdog barked till the crags reverberated with his clamoring thars somethin stirrin at bize wileys ur his dorg wouldnt be kickin up all that racket observed kate kenyon he lives by ther road that comes over from bildows crossroads folks comin inter ther maountings from down below travel that way the boys looked around for the mute who had been guarding the mouth of the cave but they saw nothing of him he had slipped away into the bushes which grew thick all around the opening come on said the girl after seeming strangely interested in the barking of the dog well git ter ther old mill as soon as we kin foller me an be ready ter scrouch ther instant anything is seen now that they could see her she led them forward at a swift pace which astonished them both she did not run but she seemed to skim over the ground and she took advantage of every bit of cover till they entered some deep lowland pines through this strip of woods she swiftly led them and they came near to lost creek where it flowed down in the dismal valley there they found the ruins of an old mill the mosscovered waterwheel forever silent the roof sagging and falling in the windows broken out by mischievous boys the whole presenting a most melancholy and deserted appearance the road that had led to the mill from the main highway was overgrown with weeds later it would be filled with thistles and burdocks wild sassafras grew along the roadside thats whar youuns must hide terday said kate motioning toward the mill why should we hide exclaimed frank we are not criminals nor are we revenue spies i do not fancy the idea of hiding like a hunted dog its better ter be a live dorg than a dead lion ef youunsll take my advice youll come inter ther mill thar an yell keep thar all day an keep mighty quiet i know yere nervy but thar aint no good in bein foolish itll be known that youuns have escaped an then wade miller will scour ther country ef he come on yer give us our arms and well be ready to meet mr miller but yer wouldnt meet him alone thard be others with him an youuns wouldnt have no sorter show kate finally succeeded in convincing the boys that she spoke the truth and they agreed to remain quietly in the old mill she led them into the mill which was dank and dismal the imperfect light failed to show all the pitfalls that lurked for their feet but she warned them and they escaped injury the miller had lived in the mill and the girl took them to the part of the old building that had served as a home har she said opening a closet door ive brung food fer youuns so yer wont starve an i knowed yed be hongry you are more than thoughtful miss kenyon yer seem ter have fergot what we agreed ter call each other frank she spoke the words in a tone of reproach kate barney turned away winking uselessly at nothing at all and kept his back toward them for some moments but frank merriwell had no thought of making love to this strange girl of the mountains she had promised to be his friend she had proved herself his friend and as no more than a friend did he propose to accept her that he had awakened something stronger than a friendly feeling in kate kenyons breast seemed evident and the girl was so artless that she could not conceal her true feelings toward him they stood there talking in a low tone while the morning light stole in at one broken window and grew stronger and stronger within that room frank was studying kates speech and voice as he did so a new thought came to him a thought that was at first a mere suspicion which he scarcely noted at all this suspicion grew and he found himself asking kate are you sure your brother is still wearing a convicts suit she started and looked at him closely sure o it she repeated no fer he may be dead you do not know that he is dead you have not heard of his death no is he bold and daring her eyes flashed and a look of pride swept across her face folks allus lowed rufe kenyon want afeard o ary twolegged critter livin an they war right perhaps he has escaped she clutched his arm beginning to pant as she asked what makes you say that i knowed hed try it some day but but have you heard anything do you know that he has tried it the suspicion leaped to a conviction in the twinkling of an eye if rufe kenyon was not at liberty then he must be right in what he thought i do not know that your brother has tried to escape i do not know anything about him i did think that he might be muriel the moonshiner kate laughed youuns war plumb mistooken thar she said positively rufe is not muriel then cried frank you are muriel yourself kate kenyon seemed astounded have youuns gone plumb dafty asked the girl in a dazed way me muriel wal that beats all but you are i am sure of it said frank swiftly the girl laughed well that beats me of course im not muriel but hes ther best friend ive got in these maountings frank was far from satisfied but he was too courteous to insist after this denial kate laughed the idea to scorn saying over and over that the boy must be dafty but still his mind was unchanged to be sure there were some things not easily explained one being how muriel concealed her luxurious red hair for muriels hair appeared to be coalblack another thing was that wade miller must know muriel and kate were one and the same and yet he preserved her secret and allowed her to snatch his victims from his maws barney mulloy had been more than astounded by franks words the irish youth was struck dumb when he could collect himself he softly muttered well av all th oideas thot takes th cake having seen them safely within the mill and shown them the food brought there kate said har is two revolvers fer youuns dont use em unless yer have ter but shoot ter kill ef youre forced begorra oim ready fer th spalpanes cried barney as he grasped one of the weapons let thim come on i feel better myself declared frank next time wade miller and his gang will not catch us napping roight me by well be sound awake frankie kate bade them goodby assuring them that she would return with the coming of another night and making them promise to await her and then she flitted away slipped out of the mill soon vanishing amid the pines its dead lucky we are ter be living frankie observed barney i quite agree with you laughed merriwell this night has been a black and tempestuous one but we have lived through it and i do not believe well find ourselves in such peril again while we are in the tennessee mountains they were hungry and they ate heartily of the plain food that had been provided for them when breakfast was over barney said frankie its off yer trolley ye git sometoimes what do you mean by that barney is it a new sell nivver a bit oi wur thinkin av pwhat yez said about kate kenyon being mooriel th moonshoiner i was not off my trolley so very much then gwan me by ye wur crazy as a bidbug you think so but i have made a study of muriel and of kate kenyon i am still inclined to believe the moonshiner is the girl in disguise an oi say yere crazy no girrul could iver do pwhat thot felly does an no band av min loike th moonshoiners would iver allow a girrul loike kate kenyon ter boss thim they do not know muriel is a girl that is i am sure the most of them do not know it do not dream it thot shows their common sinse fer oi dont belave it mesilf i may be wrong but i shall not give it up yet whoy think pwhat a divvil thot muriel is an th color av his hair is black whoile the girruls is red i have thought of those things and i have wondered how she concealed that mass of red hair still i am satisfied she does it well its no use to talk to you at all at all however they did discuss it for some time finally they fell to exploring the old mill and they wandered from one part to another till they finally came to the place where they had entered over a sagging plank they were standing there just within the deeper shadow of the mill when a man came panting and reeling from the woods his hat off his shirt torn open at the throat great drops of perspiration standing on his face a wild hunted look in his eyes and dashed to the end of the plank that led over the water into the old mill frank clutched barney and the boys fell back a step watching the man who was looking back over his shoulder and listening the perfect picture of a hunted thing theyre close arter me ther dogs came in a hoarse pant from the mans lips but i turned on em i doubled an i hope i fooled em its my last chance fer im dead played and im so nigh starved that its all i kin do ter drag one foot arter tother he listened again and then as if overcome by a sudden fear of being seen there he suddenly rushed across the plank and plunged into the mill he ran fairly upon frank merriwell in the twinkling of an eye man and boy were clasped in a close embrace struggling desperately caught cried the fugitive desperately trapped he tried to hurl frank to the floor and he would have succeeded had he been in his normal condition for he was a man of great natural strength but he was exhausted by flight and hunger and in his weakened condition the man found his supple antagonist too much for him a gasp came from the strangers lips as he felt the boy give him a wrestlers trip and fling him heavily to the floor the man was stunned for a moment when he opened his eyes frank and barney were bending over him wal i done my best he said huskily but youuns trapped me at last i dunno how yer knew i war comin har but ye war on hand ter meet me you have made a mistake said frank in a reassuring tone we are not your enemies at all whats that we are not your enemies you are not trapped the man seemed unable to believe what he heard why who be youuns he asked in a bewildered way fugitives like yourself assured frank with a smile he looked them over and shook his head not like me he said look at me im wore ter ther bone im a wreck oh its a cursed life ive led sence they dragged me away from har night an day hev i watched for a chance ter break away and i war quick ter grasp it when it came they shot at me an one o their bullets cut my shoulder har it war a close call but i got away then they follered an they put houns arter me twenty times hev they been right on me an twenty times hev i got erway but it kep wearin me weaker an thinner my last hope war ter find friends ter hide me an fight fer me an i came har back home i tried ter git inter bije wileys this mornin but his dorg didnt know me i war so changed an ther hunters war close arter me so i hed ter run fer it begorra exclaimed barney we hearrud th dog barruckin so we did agreed frank remembering how the creature had been clamoring on the mountainside at daybreak i kem har continued the man weakly i turned on ther devils but when i run in har an youuns tackled me i judged i had struck a trap it was no trap rufe kenyon said frank quietly the hunted man started up and slunk away you know me he gasped we do an still ye say youuns are not my enemies we are not then how do you know me i never saw yer afore no but we have heard of you how from your sister kate she tol yer she did then she must trust youuns she saved us from certain death last night and she brought us here to hide till she can help us get out of this part of the country rufe kenyon looked puzzled i judge youuns is givin it ter me straight he said slowly but i dont jes understan what did she save yer from moonshiners the man seemed filled with sudden suspicion what had moonshiners agin youuns be you revernues no do we look like revenue spies yer look too young well we are not spies but we were unfortunate enough to incur the enmity of wade miller and he has sworn to end our lives wade miller cried rufe showing his teeth in an ugly manner an i spose hes hangin roun kate same as he uster he is giving her more or less trouble wal he wont give her much trouble arter i git at him he is a snake look har im goin ter tell youuns somethin miller allus pretended ter be my friend but it war that critter as put ther revernues onter me an got me arrested he done it because i tol him kate war too good fer him i know it an one thing why i wanted ter git free war ter come har an fix ther critter so he wont ever bother kate no more i hev swore ter fix him an ill do it ef i live ter meet him face ter face he had grown wildly excited and he sat up with his back against a post his eyes gleaming redly and a white foam flecking his lips at that moment he reminded the boys of a mad dog woe to wade miller when they met when kenyon was calmer frank told the story of the adventures which had befallen the boys since entering lost creek valley the fugitive listened quietly watching them closely with his sunken eyes and having heard all said i judge youuns tells ther truth ef i kin keep hid till kate gits har till i see her ill fix things so you wont be bothered much wade millers day in lost creek valley is over the boys took him up to the living room of the old mill where they furnished him with the coarse food that remained from their breakfast he ate like a famished thing washing the dry bread down with great swallows of water when he had finished and his hunger was satisfied he was quite like another man thar he cried now i am reddy fer anything but i do need sleep take it advised frank we will watch and youll tell me ef thars danger you may depend on it youuns will watch close never fear about that so the hunted wretch was induced to lie down and sleep he slept soundly for some hours and when he opened his eyes his sister had her arms about his neck chapter xlv the greatest peril rufe kate he sat up and clasped her in his arms a look of joy on his face it is quite unnecessary to describe the joys of that meeting the boys had left brother and sister alone together and the two remained thus for nearly an hour at the end of which time rufe knew all that had happened since he was taken from lost creek valley and kate had also been made aware of the perfidy of wade miller i judge it is true that bread throwed on ther waters allus comes back said kate when the four were together now looker how i helped youuns an then see how it turned out ter be a right good thing fer rufe he found ye har an youuns hev fed him an watched while he slept an i hev tol kate all about wade miller said the fugitive that settles him declared the girl with a snap rufe explained kate says ther officers think i hev gone on over inter ther next cove an theyre arter me all ceptin two what have been left behind theyll be back though by night but you are all right now for your friends will be on hand by that time yes kate will take word ter muriel an hell hev ther boys ready ter fight fer me ther officers will find it kinder hot in these parts id better be goin now said the girl ther boys oughter know all about it soon as possible thats right agreed rufe this aint ther best place fer me ter hide no declared kate suddenly an yer mustnt hide har longer fer ther officers may come afore night ill take yer ter ther cave it wont do fer ther boys ter go thar but you kin all right ther boys is best off har fer ther officers wouldnt hurt em this seemed all right and it was decided on just as they were on the point of descending barney gave a cry caught frank by the arm and drew him toward a window look there me by exclaimed the irish lad phwat do yez think av it now a horseman was coming down the old road that led to the mill he bestrode a coalblack horse and a mask covered his face while his long black hair flowed down on the collar of the coat he wore he sat the horse jauntily riding with a reckless air that seemed to tell of a daring spirit great scott exclaimed frank merriwell amazed it is muriel thats pwhat chuckled barney an its your trate me lad i will treat said frank crestfallen i am not nearly so smart as i thought i was muriel cried kate dashing to the window where is he she did not hesitate to appear in the window and signal to the dashing young moonshiner who returned her salute and motioned for her to come out he wants ter see me in er hurry said the girl i sent word ter him by dummy that ther boys war har an thats how he happened ter turn up come rufe go out with me muriel will be glad to see yer and i shall be glad ter see him declared the escaped convict kate bade the boys remain there telling them she would call them if they were wanted and then with rufe following she hurried down the stairs and hastened to meet the boy moonshiner who had halted on the bank at some distance from the old mill watching from the window frank and barney saw her hasten up to muriel saw her speak swiftly although they could not hear her words saw muriel nod and seem to reply quite as swiftly and then saw the young leader of the black caps shake her hand in a manner that denoted pleasure and affection yere a daisy frankie me by snickered barney mulloy but fer wance ye wur badly mishtaken i was all of that confessed frank as if slightly ashamed i thought myself far shrewder than i am as they watched they saw rufe kenyon suddenly leap up behind muriel and then the doubly burdened horse swung around and went away at a hot pace while kate came flitting back into the mill the officers are returnin she explained muriel will take rufe whar thar aint no chance o their findin him youuns will have ter stay har i have brung ye more fodder an i judge youll git along all right so she left them hurriedly being greatly excited over the return of her brother and his danger the day passed and the officers failed to appear in the vicinity of the mill although the boys were expecting to see them nor did wade miller trouble them when night came frank and barney grew impatient for they were far from pleased with their lot but they could do nothing but wait two hours after nightfall a form suddenly appeared in the old mill rising before the boys like a phantom although they could not understand how the fellow came there in a flash frank snatched out a revolver and pointed it at the intruder crying sternly stand still and give an account of yourself who are you and what do you want the figure moved into the range of the window so that the boys could see him making strange gestures pointing to his ears and pressing his fingers to his lips steady you commanded frank if you dont keep still i shall shoot answer my question at once still the intruder continued to make those strange gestures pointing to his ears and touching his lips that he saw franks revolver glittering and feared the boy would shoot was evident but he still remained silent whoy dont th spalpane spake cried barney is it no tongue he has oi dunno that gave frank an idea perhaps he cannot speak in which case he is the one kate calls dummy i believe he is the fellow it happened that the sign language of mutes was one of franks accomplishments he having taken it up during his leisure moments he passed the revolver to barney saying keep the fellow covered while i see if i can talk with him frank moved up to the window held his hands close to the intruders face and spelled you from kate the man nodded joyfully he put up his hands and spelled back kate send me come horses ready frank interpreted for barneys benefit and the irish lad cried thin lets be movin its mesilf thats ready ter git out av thase parruts in a hurry oi think for a moment frank hesitated about trusting the mute and then he decided that it was the best thing to do and he signaled that they were ready dummy led the way from the mill crossing by the plank and plunging into the pine woods he sames to be takin us back th woay we came frankie said the irish lad in a low tone thats all right assured frank he said the horses were waiting for us probably kate is with them the mute flitted along with surprising silence and speed and they found it no easy task to follow and keep close enough to see him now and then he looked back to make sure they were close behind at last they came to the termination of the pines and there in the deep shadows they found three horses waiting kate kenyon was not there frank felt disappointed for he wished to see the girl before leaving the mountains forever he did not like to go away without touching her hand again and expressing his sense of gratitude for the last time it was his hope that she might join them before they left the mountains the horses were saddled and bridled and the boys were about to mount when a strange low cry broke from dummys lips there was a sudden stir and an uprising of dark forms on all sides frank tried to snatch out his revolver but it was too late he was seized disarmed and crushed to the earth ha ha ha laughed a hateful voice did youuns think ye war goin ter escape wal yer didnt know wade miller very well i knowed kated try ter git yer off an all i hed ter do war watch her i didnt waste my time runnin round elsewhar they were once more in millers clutches frank ground his teeth with impotent rage he blamed himself for falling into the trap and still he could not see how he was to blame surely he had been cautious but fate was against him he had escaped miller twice but this was the third time and he feared that it would prove disastrous barney had not a word to say the hands of the captured boys were tied behind their backs and then they were forced to march swiftly along in the midst of the black caps that surrounded them they were not taken to the cave but straight to one of the hidden stills a little hut that was built against what seemed to be a wall of solid rock a great bluff rising against the face of the mountain thick trees concealed the little hut down in the hollow into this hut the boys were marched some crude candles were lighted and they saw around them the outfit for making moonshine whiskey thar cried miller triumphantly youuns will never go out o this place ther revernues spotted this still terday but it wont be har termorrer he made a signal and the boys were thrown to the floor where they were held helpless while their feet were bound when this job was finished miller added no ther revernues wont find this still termorrer fer it will go up in smoke moonshine is good stuff ter burn an well see how youuns like it at a word a keg of whiskey was brought to the spot by two men let em try ther stuff directed miller begorra hes goin ter fill us up bafore he finishes us muttered barney mulloy but that was not the intention of the revengeful man a plug was knocked from a hole in the end of the keg and then the whiskey was poured over the clothing of the boys wetting them to the skin soak em directed miller the men did not stop pouring till the clothing of the boys was thoroughly saturated thar said miller with a fiendish chuckle i reckon youuns is ready fer touchin off an yell burn like pine knots ther way yell holler will make ye heard clean ter ther top o black maounting an ther fire will be seen but when anybody gits har youuns an this still will be ashes he knelt beside frank lighted a match and applied it to the boys whiskeysoaked clothing chapter xlvi the mystery of muriel not quite the flame almost touched franks clothing when the boy rolled over swiftly thus getting out of the way for the moment at the same instant the blast of a bugle was heard at the very front of the hut and the door fell with a crash while men poured in by the opening ther revernues shouted wade miller no not ther revernues rang out a clear voice but muriel the boy chief of the black caps was there an muriel is not erlone thundered another voice rufe kenyon is har out in front of muriel leaped the escaped criminal confronting the man who had betrayed him miller staggered his face turning pale as if struck a heavy blow and a bitter exclamation of fury came through his clinched teeth rufe he grated then its fight fer life yes its fight roared kate kenyons brother as a longbladed knife glittered in his hand and he thrust back the sleeve of his shirt till his arm was bared above the elbow i swore ter finish yer miller but ill give ye a squar show draw yer knife an may ther best man win with the snarl that might have come from the throat of a savage beast miller snatched out a revolver instead of drawing a knife ill not fight ye he screamed but ill shoot ye plumb through ther heart he fired and rufe kenyon ducked at the same time there was a scream of pain and muriel flung up both hands dropping into the arms of the man behind rufe kenyon had dodged the bullet but the boy chief of the black caps had suffered in his stead miller seemed dazed by the result of his shot the revolver fell from his hand and he staggered forward groaning kate ive killed her rufe kenyon forgot his foe dropping on one knee beside the prostrate figure of muriel and swiftly removing the mask the face of kate kenyon was revealed sister panted her brother be ye dead has that rascal killed ye her eyes opened and she faintly said not dead yit rufe then the brother shouted ketch wade miller dont let ther critter escape it seemed that every man in the hut leaped to obey miller struggled like a tiger but he was overpowered and dragged out of the hut while rufe still knelt and examined his sisters wound which was in her shoulder frank and barney were freed and they hastened to render such assistance as they could in dressing the wound and stanching the flow of blood youuns dont think thatll be fatal do yer asked rufe with breathless anxiety there is no reason why it should assured frank she must be taken home as soon as possible and a doctor called i think she will come through all right for all of millers bullet the men were trooping back into the hut miller roared rufe leaping to his feet whars ther critter he is out har under a tree answered one of the men quietly whos watchin him ter see that he dont git erway asked rufe nobodys watchin nobody why ther pizen dog will run fer it i dont think hell run fur weve tied him how wal ter make sure he wouldnt run we hitched a rope around his neck an tied it up ter ther limb o ther tree unless ther rope stretches he wont be able ter git his feet down onter ther ground by erbout eighteen inches then youuns hanged him wal we did some too bad muttered rufe with a sad shake of his head i wanted ter squar counts with ther skunk kate kenyon was taken home and the bullet was extracted from her shoulder the wound although painful did not prove at all serious and she began to recover in a short time frank and barney lingered until it seemed certain that she would recover and then they prepared to take their departure after all franks suspicion had proved true and it had been revealed that muriel was kate in disguise frank chaffed barney a great deal about it and the irish lad took the chaffing in a goodnatured manner rufe kenyon was hidden by his friends so that his pursuers were forced to give over the search for him and depart one still was raided but not one of the moonshiners was captured as they had received ample warning of their danger on the evening before frank and barney were to depart in the morning the boys carried kate out to the door in an easychair and they sat down near her mrs kenyon sat on the steps and smoked her black pipe looking as stolid and indifferent as ever kate said frank when did you have your hair cut short where is that profusion of beautiful hair you wore when we first saw you that she smiled why my har war cut moren a year ago i had it made inter a switch and i wore it so nobodyd know i had it cut you did that in order that you might wear the black wig when you personated muriel yes you could do that easily over your short hair yes well you played the part well and you made a dashing boy but how about the muriel who appeared while you were in the mill with us she laughed a bit youuns war so sharp that i judged id make yer think ye didnt know so much ez you thought an i fixed it up ter have another person show up in my place i see but who was this other person dummy he is no bigger than i an he is a good mimic he rode jes like me begorra he did thot nodded barney its mesilf thot wur chated an thots not aisy you are a shrewd little girl declared frank and you are dead lucky to escape with your life after getting millers bullet but miller wont trouble you more mrs kenyon rose and went into the hut while barney lazily strolled down to the creek leaving frank and kate alone half an hour later as he was coming back the irish lad heard kate saying i know im igerent an im not fitten fer any educated man still you an i is friends frank an friends well allus be friends we will always be said frank softly
