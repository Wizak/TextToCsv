enid blyton the adventurous four again chapter back with andy again three very excited children bumped along a rough country lane in a farmers cart the scottish carter sat in front saving nothing but listening with a little smile to the childrens happy voices we shall see andy again soon we havent seen him since our exciting adventures last summer said tom a redhaired boy of twelve it was bad luck getting measles in the christmas hols so that we couldnt come up here and stay in our little cottage said jill she and her sister mary were twins and were very like each other they each had long golden plaits and blue eyes and were younger than tom tom spoke to the carter jock did you hear about our adventures last year he asked jock nodded his head he hardly ever said a word the children with their friend andy had indeed had some thrilling adventures they had gone out in andys fathers fishingboat one day and had been caught by a storm they had been swept miles out of their course on to a lonely islandand had found a nest of enemy submarines in the waters there hiding to pounce on any ships that came within their reach and poor andy lost his fathers boat said jill remembering how afraid andy had been of what his father might say about the lost boat but it didnt matterbecause andy was given a much much better boat said mary and it was called andydo you remember it had his name painted on it wasnt andy pleased the fisherboy had been more than pleased he had been filled with the greatest delight the new fishing boat was a magnificent one with a lovely red sail andys father had been overjoyed too for a fishingboat meant his livelihood to him catching fish and selling them was his work and andysand now they had one of the finest boats on the coast the farmcart jolted along and soon the children came in sight of the sea the coast there was rocky and dangerous but the sea was a lovely blue and the children shouted in joy to see it the sea there it is and lookthere are the fishingboats out on it i bet i can see andys shouted tom lookthat one with the bright red sail isnt that andys jock jock nodded and the three children fixed their eyes on the redsailed boat andys boat andy was out there on the restless seaand soon they would go out with him what fun they would have their mother was already waiting for them in the cottage she had bought in the fishing village she had gone there two days ahead of the children to get things ready for them when they broke up from school it was the easter holiday and everywhere the trees were leafing the hedges were greening and the banks were starred with primroses violets and celandines a whole months holiday by the seawith andy and bis boat said tom i simply cant think of anything lovelier i dont expect well have any adventures this timebut that wont matter we had enough last summer to last us for years said jill i was frightened sometimesbut it all ended happily except for those hidden enemy submarines said tom they didnt have a very happy ending looktheres mother sure enough it was their mother standing at the next comer waving the children tumbled out of the cart and flung themselves on her mother its lovely to see you is everything all right is the cottage ready have you seen andy im awfully hungry mother is there anything nice to eat that was tom of course he was always hungry his mother laughed welcome back to our little village children yes theres plenty to eat tom and yes ive seen andy he was sorry he couldnt meet you but theres a good shoal of fish in and he had to go out to help his father in the boat does the boat go well asked tom eagerly it was marvellous last summer ive often thought of andy whilst we were at school and envied him there lie was sailing out in all weathers having a wonderful timeand i was writing latin exercises at school and being ticked off because i threw a rubber at someone oh tomdont tell me your report is a bad one said his mother as they all walked down a slope to the little fishing village below jock came behind carrying large trunks as easily as if they were empty boxes when will andy be back asked jill has he changed mother is he still the same old andy of course said her mother hes grown a bit tallerand a bit broaderbut hes almost fifteen now yotf know youre nearly thirteen tom youve grown too so have the girls youll see andy later in the evening when the fishingboats come back he promised to come straight up and see you well go down to the shore and wait for his boat to come in said tom after weve had something to eat i mean what is there mother ham eggs three kinds of scones two kinds of jam and a fishpie said his mother will that do for you i should think so said tom who felt as if he could eat the whole lot at once golly its good to be back again motherand to think of all the sailing well have welldont find enemy submarines this time said his mother as she swung open a little white gate that led through a tiny garden to the cottage i really couldnt bear it if you got lost on a lonely island again they all ran up the path to the wooden door it stood open a bright fire burned in the livingroom and the table was set with so many dishes of food that tom gave a whoop of delight golly must i wash my hands cant we begin now no wash first said his mother firmly you all look like sweeps would you like boiled eggs to begin with or fishpie both shouted tom and ran to wash in the little sink that was the only place where water ran from a tap they all made an enormous meal i can see i shall have my work cut out to satisfy your appetites these holidays said their mother noyou neednt help to clear away and wash up twins ive got mis maclntyre coming in to help you can put on your jerseys and shorts ana go down to meet andy i expect the boats will be putting in soon if theyve made a good catch the children hurriedly pulled off their schoolclothes and scrambled to find their jerseys and shorts the weather was fine and sunny almost like summer if only it would stay like that all the holidays they raced down to the shore fine soft sand lay between the rocks that jutted up all over the beach a little stone jetty ran a short distance into the water to this jetty the fishingboats came with their hauls andys boat was clearly to be seen a good way out but now they were all coming inthe seagull the maryarm the jessie the andy the starfish and the rest the breeze filled the sails and they billowed put prettily its a fine sight a fishingfleet coming home said tom running up the jetty and down so excited that he couldnt stand still i wish i had a boat of my own hi andy andy come in first show iw what your boat can dor almost as if andy had heard the redsailed boat surged forward in front of the others the wind swept down on her and she glided along like a redwinged bird on the water theres andy theres his father too shouted jill andy were here have you made a good catch ahoy there came andys voice ahoy then the beautiful boat came deftly to the stone jetty and andy leapt off he and tom shook hands both grinning widely in delight the twins flung themselves on the fisherboy and hugged him squealing in delight andy youve grown andy youre browner than ever oh andy were all back again isnt it lovely grand said andy as pleased as they were he repeated the word and rolled the r in it even more grrrrrand then his father jumped out to make the boat fast he smiled at the three children and shook hands gravely with them all he never had much to say and the children knew he was strict with andy and made him work bard but they liked him and trusted him youll help with the fish andy he said and the boy turned at once to bring in the great catch they had made the children helped too i do think the beginning bit of a holiday is lovely gaid mary i think i like it best of all yes the middle and end parts slip away so quickly said jill but you sort of feel the beginning bit will last for ever can we go sailing with you soon asked tom this evening andy nonot today said andy knowing that his father would not let his boat out again tomorrow perhaps if were allowed dad may not want the boat tomorrow weve had such a good catch today is it nice to see your own name painted on your boat said mary andydoesnt it look lovely its your boat as well said andy i always told you you could share it when you were here it ought to be called the andytomjillandmary all the other boats came in the children greeted the fishermen they knew them all and they knew the fine little fishingboats that bobbed gently up and down beside the jetty but they felt that andys boattheir own boatwas the very best of all its getting dark said tom with a sigh wed better go home we promised mother wed be in before darkand golly i do feel tired weve had a jolly long journey today and well feel better tomorrow i just feel now i want one thingto fall into bed and sleep whatdont you want any supper said jill you must be tired tom andy laughed he was happy to see the twins again and to have his friend tom four whole weeks together they would have some fun see you tomorrow said andy as the three said goodbye and turned away from the shore ill be along back they went to the cottage all feeling suddenly tired they could hardly eat any supperand then they undressed quickly washed and fell into their beds halfasleep before their heads touched the pillow tomorrowlots of tomorrows said jill but mary didnt answer she was asleep and dreaming of all the exciting tomorrows chapter off on a sailing trip the next few days were lovely andy took them sailing in his boat which he insisted belonged to them alla quarter each ill have the red sail for my quarter said jill i do love it so andy cant we go out with the rest of the boats when they go fishing oh yes said andy and out they went the next time the little fleet went out andy taught the children how to let down the nets they watched with excitement the jumping slithering silvery fish caught in the meshes of the great net the fisherboy taught them how to set lobsterpots too in the right places they took home enough fish and lobsters scallops and crabs to keep them in food for a week the sun shone they grew brown they climbed the rocky cliffs all about and had a wonderful time then tom grew restless and wanted to go off on a longer trip lets go somewhere exciting he said cant we take the andy and go on a trip somewhere dont you know anywhere thrilling andy you could take us to well said andy i promised your mother i wouldnt take vou right out to sea any more to visit any of our islandsin case a storm came up like last year and wrecked us so it would have to be somewhere along the coast do think of somewhere begged the twins somewhere that nobody goes to theres the cliff of birds said andy suddenly the others stared at him the cliff of birds said jill what a funny name its a good name said andy there are thousands of birds therei couldnt tell you how manyall lands gulls shags cormorants puffinsthey nest there and all round and abouton the cliffs in the cliffs over the cliffseverywhere they say you cant walk a step this season of the year without treading on a nestingbird theyre a sight to see all the three children were fond of birds their eyes shone lets go there said tom what a sight it would be ill take my camera were having a snapshot competition at my school next term and i could enter some bird pictures for it yes do lets go said jill it sounds exciting i wonder you never told us about the cliff of birds before andy well last time you were here it was full summer said andy the birds have left their nestingplaces on the cliffs by then and are out on the open sea theres not much to see but at nestingtime its different theyre all there well well go said tom how far is it can we get there and back in a day well have to said jill mother wont let us go off for a night im sure if we start early in the morning wed be back before dark said andy its a long wayand its a lonely part of the coast too well have to be careful because there are rocks all about but theres a passage between them that my father knows ill get him to tell me ive been twice with him when shall we go asked jill beginning to feel excited tomorrow no im wanted on the boat with my father said andy but maybe the next day youll have to do without me tomorrow you get out your book on birds and read it well then youll know the birds on the cliff when you see them so all the next day the children pored over their books on birds looking up each seabird studying it and learning its name tom got out his camera and put a new roll of films into it they told their mother where they were going it certainly sounds exciting she said i hope andy knows the way down the coast well its rather dangerous round here oh mother andy could sail a boat anywhere said tom hes been twice before anyway wont it be exciting to go somewhere that nobody ever goes to the cliff of birds said mary thousands of them mother youll see them if tom gets some good snaps i suppose we shall climb the cliff id better have a word with andy about that said her mother and she did but andy assured her that he wouldnt let anyone do anything they couldnt do safely and easily two days later the children awoke with a jump as the alarm clock went off it had been set for dawnhow early it was tom slipped into the girls room to make sure they were awake and not going off to sleep again the skys just turning silvery in the east he said hurry up weve got to be at the jetty in a few minutes i bet andys already there their mother appeared in her dressinggown looking sleepy i thought i would just see you off she said now you do promise to be careful dont you andys got lifebelts on board hasnt he oh mother you know we can all swim like fish said jill yesin calm or slightly rough water said her mother but if you fell overboard in stormy waters youd find things much more difficult youve packed the food on board havent you oh yes said tom who could always be trusted to look after the food side we put it on board yesterday eveningeverything you gave us mother it will last us nicely for a day it would last most families for a week said ms mother noware you ready take woollen coats with you because it isnt summer you know tom wheres your mack soon they were off the sky was much lighter now the children could see golden fingers coming up from the east the sun was just below the rim of the world there they raced down to the jetty feeling the wind quite cold on their faces and their bare legs andy was there of course waiting for them patiently he grinned when he saw their excited faces get on board he said everythings ready ill cast off the children tumbled on board the fishingboat they loved it was roomy but not too big for them to handle it had a small cosy cabin below au three children were good at helping andy now and could be trusted with anything the boat slid away from the jetty the breeze bfllowed out the red sail then quite suddenly it seemed the sun appeared above the skyline a dazzling rounded edge and at once the water flashed with golden lines and twinkled brilliantly as the boat plunged forward the suns rising said jill and caught her breath at the sudden beauty of it all the worlds all new again look at the sunit seems to be climbing out of the sea itself soon the children could no longer look at the sun it was so big and bright the boat went slipping along in waves that seemed made of golden light and blue shadows it was worth coming out so early just to see the enchanting beauty of the rising sun heaps of people have never seen the sun rise said jill as she leaned over the side of the boat to look at the goldflecked waves hardly any of the girls at my school have theyve missed something i think there ought to be a law that says everyone must watch a sunrise and everyone must see a bluebell wood and a buttercup field and look out for the sail yelled andy as the big red sail swung across jill ducked and forgot what she was saying andy was at the tiller looking browner than ever his dark hair blew straight upright in the wind and his eyes shone as blue as the sea i say began tom isnt if about time to everyone interrupted him to have something to eat they all chanted knowing toms ways very well indeed i wasnt going to say that said tom aggrieved i was going to sayoughtnt we to keep closer to the shore now were heading right out to sea got to said andy keeping a firm hold on the tiller as the boat swept into a strong current there are rocks farther in cant risk them in this boat we must keep out a fair bit then when i see the spot my father told me of til swing inland a bit andy had a rough chart with him he pushed it across to tom holding on to it till the boy had it safely because of the rushing wind look at that he said those dots are rocks see how the sea nearer in is peppered with them sly rocks they arejust below the surface theyll scratch a hole in the bottom of a boat in the twinkling of an eye it takes us longer to go out to sea and then turn in but its safer weve got to look out for three tall pinetrees on a cliff before we turn in theyre marked on the map everyone studied the map with interest what a long way down the coast the oiff of birds wast no wonder andy said they must start early what time shall we be there said mary we should be there about eleven with luck said andy maybe before well have our dinner then well be hungry tom looked really alarmed what are we to wait till then well be starved oh well have breakfast first said andy well have it at seven or halfpast maybe a few biscuits now would be nice what do you say girls everyone thought it was a very good idea biscuits and chocolate said jill they go so well together ill get them she disappeared into the little cabin below and came back again with four rations of biscuits and chocolate everyone was soon munching andy still at the tiller he said he was not going to let anyone else steer the boat that day it was too dangerous the sun was much higher in the sky now it was wanner though the strong seabreeze was cold everyone was glad of woollen jerseys cardigans and macks on top nowheres where we head inland said andy suddenly see those three pinetrees on the cliff far away over there youve got eyes like a hawk andy said tom screwing his up to try to see the pinetrees on the distant coast he could just make them out but neither of the girls could see them clearly andy swung the boat round a little the sail flapped hard the boat now ran even more quickly and the children felt thrilled with the speed and the upanddown swing of the fine little boat breakfasttime said andy were doing very wellwe deserve a jolly good breakfast we do said tom and scurried to get the food chapter the cliff of birds breakfast was a very welcome meal there were hardboiled eggs scones and butter and a tin of peaches jill heated some milk down in the little cabin and made cocoa which they all enjoyed now the boat was heading shorewards and the rocky cliffs could be clearly seen it was about eight oclock the sun was higher in the sky and its warmth was very welcome my wordwhat a lonely desolate coast said tom watching it as the boat sped along and look at those wicked rocks andy nearer the shore yesthere are some out here too so weve got to keep a lookout said andy the worst are marked on that chart i know them all in about an hours time we have to slip between an opening in a rocky ridge well come to and skim along in a kind of channel between two rows of rocks were all right if we get into the channel its like a sea pathway and so long as we keep in the middle of it were all right at about nine oclock the children saw ahead of them a very turbulent stretch of water the waves frothed and surged and sent spray high into the air look out said tom pointing ahead there must be rocks there yesjust about here is the opening i told you of said andy weve got to slip through it as soon as we come to it i think it lies beyond that big surge of water he cleverly skirted the bubbling frothing patch where the waves were torn into shreds on rocks that hardly showed above the surface then the children gave a shout heres the entrancelooka nice calm little bit andy steered the boat deftly through the little passage the opening through the outer ridge of rocks the boat careered along its sails full of wind and slid into a channel between the outer and inner rows of rocks fairly calm water ran there there are horrid rocks on each side of us said jill but here were safe how far does this queer calm channel go andy it flows to smugglers rock said andy but we swing landwards before we get there to the cliff of birds smugglers rock what an exciting name said tom and he looked at the map oh yesyour fathers put it inat least i suppose this dot with sr beside it means smugglers rock thats right said andy weve a good way to go still my arent these lonely waters we havent sighted a ship on the sea or seen a soul on land since we left our village behind its a wild bit of the coast said tom i wonder why smugglers rock was given that name andy were there smugglers there in the old days i dont know said andy ive only seen the rock from the distance its like a small steep island made entirely of rock nothing grows there i should thinkexcept seaweed round the foot maybe there are caves there that smugglers hid things in i dont know anything about it nobody goes there nowand maybe they never did maybe its just a name its halfpast ten said tom after a time shall we soon be there andyat the cliff of birds why are you getting hungry again asked andy with a grin welli am said tom but i wasnt thinking of that i was thinking of the time and how long wed have there well have to allow a good many hours for getting back well have a couple of hours at the cliffs and no more said andy but it will be enough youll be able to climb up the cliff and explore it a bit and have some dinner and maybe take some photographs then well have to go back is that smugglers rock look right over there suddenly shouted jill pointing westwards the others looked and saw a small rocky island rising above the waves a fair distance away almost at the same moment andy swung the boat to the left and headed for the shore yesthats smugglers rock he said and did you notice that the channel we were in went on towards it but ive swung away now because were coming to the cliff of birds see the birds on the water now and flying above it as they sailed nearer to the cliff of birds the children shouted in amazement at the amount of birds to be seen everywhere gulls called and the sound of their laughing voices which jill said reminded her of the mewing of cats echoed all round them birds bobbed up and down on the water skimmed the waves soared high and low in the air now when we round this rocky point youll see we come into a kind of shallow bay and the cliffs behind are the ones ive brought you to see said andy they are covered with the kind of little narrow ledges that seabirds love for their nests they must have used the cliff for hundreds of years the andy rounded the point and then swept into a shallow bay the children gazed at the towering cliffs behind too astonished to speak there were birds there by the thousand they lined every ledge they called from every point they launched themselves from the steep cliffs into the air and soared and glided on the currents of air crying and calling at the tops of their wild voices the sight of the redsailed ship startled them a hundred or so flew up from the cliffs and their flight startled hundreds more so that the rushing of wings sounded like a mighty wind tom gave a cry whats that falling down the clifflook its like a rain of white drops rumbling down eggs said andy these seabirds lay their eggs on the bare ledges of rock you knowand they are jolly careless with them when they fly off suddenly they often make their precious eggs roll offthen down they fall and smash on the rocks below what a waste said jill i wish we hadnt frightened them but what a sight andy ive never never to all my life seen or heard so many birds together before andy looktheres a river rushing out at the bottom of the cliff said tom excited is it a river it seems to be coming out of a cave right out of the depths of the cliff yes its a river said andy bringing the boat in gently it must flow right through the cliff and lookdo you see that waterfall splashing halfway down the cliff that comes out of a hole somewhere up there i suppose it couldnt find a way to seep down through the rock so it has forced itself out up there and made a waterfall its a very exciting place said jill i wish the birds wouldnt make quite so much noise though i can hardly hear myself speak where are we going to put the boat asked mary theres no jettyand no sand to drag her on to what shall we do ill guide her into the deep pool under that overhanging cliff said andy and let down the anchor shell be all right there we can jump across to the rocks nearby lets have dinner first said jill wellonly just a snack now said tom to everyones surprise im longing to explore that birdcliff its marvellous really marvellous we dont want to waste too much time eating if we had a snack now we could make a good meal on the way back right said andy so they hurriedly made some sandwiches of bread and butter and potted meat they ate them had a drink and then with the andy lying quietly at anchor looked to see which rock would be the best to jump to theres a rock just under water here said jill peering over the side of the boat well tread on that and then we can easily get to that big rock there and so to the rocky ledge at the bottom of the cliff they took off their shoes and tied them round their necks then they made their way across the rocks to the foot of the cliff not far off the river that came out of a cavern in the cliff surged into the sea frothing and seething where its current met the waves of the sea the waters there boiled and surged and made a great noise altogether it was a very deafening place for the seabirds never once stopped their loud clamouring and calling ill find the easiest path up the cliff said andy who was as good as a goat on hill or cliff you follow me carefully its a steep cliff but not dangerous to anyone like us thats used to climbing about look out for any slippery bit you go last tom in case one of the girls should slip with the clamour of the buds round them and a ceaseless swish of wings the four children began their steep climb there were plenty of good footholds and handholds but their parents would certainly not have liked to watch them going slowly upwards higher and higher soon they looked like specks against the towering cliffs they had their rubber shoes on again now and tom carried his camera slung over his shoulder soon they came to the nestingplaces high up beyond the reach of any stormy waves the frightened angry birds flew off their eggs there were no nests at all jill was grieved to see yet more eggs roll into the sea some of them dont fall off she called they just roll round and round look what a funny shape they areawfully pointed at one end eggs shaped like that dont roll away so easily said andy they are meant to roll round and round in exactly the same spot soon they came to a narrow ledge that seemed almost like a pathway round the cliffside it was about halfway up jill suddenly gave a cry andy ive just looked down and oh i dont like it a bit i might fall it makes me giddy dont be silly said andy who didnt mind heights at all youve never minded before follow me and ill take you round the cliff a bit where theres a wider place you can rest in youre tired trembling poor jill followed andy closely not daring to look down at the faraway sea again neither tom nor mary minded a bit they thought it was funny of jill to feel afraid the ledge was a favourite nestingplace for the birds and the children had to be careful not to tread on the eggs jill was glad when the rocky pathway widened out and became a fine restingplace at the back of this restingplace was a shallow cave the children crawled into it and lay there panting warm with their climb ill just go out and see if i can take a few snaps said tom at last but just as he was about to go he stopped he heard a noise that sounded most peculiar in that deserted seabirdhaunted placethe sound of somebody whistling a wellknown tune how very strange chapter a real puzzle the whistle sounded loud and clear the children listened in the utmost astonishment somebody on the cliff of birds who in the wide world could it be a wild clamouring of seabirds began again and the whistling was drowned in the noise the children looked at one another did you hear that said tom it was someone whistling well see who it was said andy and he halfstarted up jill pulled him back he might be cross if he knew we were here he might be a birdwatcher or photographer or somethingand if he thought we had disturbed the birds hed be angry wellits our cliff as much as his said andy shaking his shoulder free from jills hold the whistling sounded again very clear indeed and a scraping sound told the children that the whistler must be coming near hes just above us said jill in a startled whisper ohlook above the cave they were resting in was a narrow ledge on this ledge the whistler had sat himself down for dangling over the top edge of the cave suddenly appeared a pair of bare legs the children stared at these legs in silence they didnt like them a bit they were enormous legs and on the end of them were enormous feet very dirty indeed the legs were covered with thick black hairs almost like the fur of an animal somehow the children felt that the owner of these legs would be as horrid as his dangling feet they didnt say a word jills heart beat rather fast she stared at the swinging feet and wished they would go away the whistling went on and on then dropped deliberately down to the rocky ledge that lay in front ofthe cave came some seabirds eggs they were flung down to make a splash as they smashed the children felt indignant how horrid of anyone to break birds eggs on purpose like that but no one said a word there was something about those great legs that made them feel rather afraid whoever was up there didnt know there was anyone about but himselfand he would be the kind of fellow who wouldnt welcome children at all whatever could he be not a fisherman surely and how could he have come to the cliff of birds the children had seen no boat in the bay below they hoped that the man wouldnt spot their boat either at the moment they felt sure it couldnt be seen from where the man sat lets wriggle right to the back of the cave whispered tom in case that fellow comes down a bit lower and sees us they wriggled back they could still see the dangling legs with their big ugly feet and toes then they saw something else the man was swinging a pair of fieldglasses by their strap and the children could see them going to and fro by the mans feet the whistling stopped twelve oclock noon said a growling voice the glasses were swung up again and the children wondered if the man was using them what was he looking for something out to sea there was a low exclamation clearly the man had seen what he was looking for the children strained their eyes into the distance trying to see if any ship was on the horizonbut they could see nothing at all after a while the man got up his horrid legs were drawn up one by one and disappeared thank goodness the children imagined that a man with such enormous legs must be almost a giant there came a scrambling noise and a few bits and pieces fell from the ledge above the cave as the man walked off the whistling sounded again but stopped after a little then there was silence andy crawled out of the shallow cave and listened cautiously nothing to be heard he went out on to the wide ledge and peered up he came back to the children not a thing to be seen he said i say you know its a bit of a puzzlehow did that man get here he must have come overland if he hasnt got a boat said tom andy shook his head no theres no way overland at all never has been sometimes birdmen have come to this cliff to study the seabirds but they always had to come by boat the cliff is nndimbable the other side and very dangerous well but andyhe must have come by boat then said tom then where has he hidden his boat said andy we couldnt help seeing it down there in the water if it had been there could we its impossible to hide a boat la this shallow bay wheres he gone now asked jill up the cliffpath he must have said andy but i always thought the path stopped not far above where we are perhaps theres a cave where hes living ive a good mind to go and see no dont said jill i didnt like the look of his legs at all im sure he is a huge ugly hairy kind of manlike a big gorilla or something silly said tom he may be quite nice though i must say i dont feel as if he is somehow nasty growly sort of voice he had too wellim going to see if i can find out where hes gone said andy getting up after all even if he sees me what does it matter anyone can come here and watch the birds ill come too said tom ive had enough of resting you two girls stay here we wont be long the girls wanted a little more rest after their long climb and were quite content to be left they lay back and listened to the sound of the boys climbing up to the ledge above the cave entrance the ledge makes a kind of narrow path here again they heard tom say come onthis is the way that man must have gone the boys climbed up the rocky path they were glad the girls hadnt come for in places it was very narrownothing but a goatpath andy said there were no goats though in that part of the country for there was not enough for even a goat to eat very little grew on that rocky cliff except for a hardy cushion of seapinks here and there as they rounded a corner of the cliff they heard a rushing sound the waterfall said andy it must come out of the cliff just near here as far as i remember it quite bars the way they saw the waterfall the next moment it was a magnificent sight though the waterfall was not a very big one but the sight of the torrent of water suddenly flinging itself out of the cliff making a slight arch in the air and then falling headlong down the steep rocky cliff gleaming and glittering as it went made the two boys stop in wonder i wish the girls could see this said tom lets go back and get them theres not time said andy tom its queer we havent spotted that man yet isnt it theres been no place he could hide in at all on our way here not even a place where a rabbit could hide wheres he gone beyond the waterfall of course said tom he couldnt go beyond said andy cant you see how the water completely bars the way who could get through that terrific gush hed be swept down the cliff with the torrent the boys were now beside the waterfall it fell down the cliff with a clamour as loud as the gulls made it almost deafened them and they had to raise their voices to speak to one another tom gazed at the water gushing out from the hole in the cliff he imagined it rushing through the dark silent heart of that towering cliff hidden away in narrow channels and tunnelsto come out suddenly into the sunshine and leap downwards in joy to join the sparkling sea below he felt puzzled certainly it was very strange to think that the man whose legs they had seen was nowhere about had he fallen off the cliff horrid thought do you think hes fallen off said tom andy shook his head no he must be used to these cliffs or he wouldnt be on them hes somewhere here well wherel demanded tom feeling quite exasperated we havent overtaken himand you say no one could get across this waterfall without being jerked down the cliff with itand you dont think hes fallen down the cliff then where is he i dont know said andy frowning he looked to see if there was a way above the waterfall but the rocky cliff there was smooth and steep no one could climb over the waterfall that way he bent down and looked under the water that formed an arch asit jerked itself from the cliff no it would be too dangerous to try and creep under that he said and anyway there doesnt seem to be any ledge the other side golly its a puzzle they turned to go back quite baffled as they made their way along the ledge the noise of the waterfall suddenly seemed to lessen the boys looked back the torrent isnt so strong said tom theres less water coming out look i expect it varies said andy sometimes i suppose its a great gush of water other times it slackens and there wouldnt be much waterfall to see yes i bet after a heavy rainfall the waterfall gets enormous said andy and in a very dry spell in summer there would hardly be any water coming out at all it just depends on how much rain weve had its funnythe waterfall has almost stopped now said tom just a trickle coming out i wonder why come on said andy getting impatient the girls will be wondering whats become of us they rounded a comer and made their way back to the girls who were now waiting impatiently for them not a sign of that man said tom to their great astonishment hes simply vanished into thin air queer isnt it yes said the twins in surprise and demanded to know everything about the waterfall and what it was like well tell you when we get back to the boat said andy its getting a bit late and we ought to be starting also im hungry for my dinner we only had a snack you know they all started downand when they had gone just a little way they heard a sound that once more gave them a surprise that whistle again said andy well the man is somewhere about then where in the world does he hide how id like to know chapter a good trip back it was certainly astonishing to hear the man whistling again when they felt certain that he wasnt anywhere near andy stopped and looked back but he could see nothing we cant go back and have another look he said we havent time golly where could the man have been tom when we went all the way to the waterfall it beats me said tom but never mindwell give it up i want my dinner much more than i want to go and find out where that man hid so down they went and down it was much easier to go down than up jill was sensible and did not look at the sea at all this time in case she felt giddy again after a time they all stood safely on the rock at the bottom of the cliff not far off was the underground river sliding turbulently out of the cavern at the foot of the cliff soon they were in their boat again it was bobbing gently on the pool where they had anchored it they clambered aboard and the girls went down into the cabin to bring up some food cold ham hardboiled eggs again rolls and a big tin of sliced peaches what a lovely meal when you were terribly hungry chocolate to follow if anyones hungry still said jill mother seems to have put in dozens of bars theres some with fruit and nuts in top it looks gorgeous have we time to eat our dinner before we go or had we better set sail straight away asked tom who felt that he would like to have his meal then and there andy looked at the sun in the sky the suns a good way past noon he said i think wed better set off now and eat our dinner as we go the wind wont help us so much going back though its shifted a bit ill take the tiller again the two boys rowed the boat out of the pool and into the open sea soon they were speeding along again though not so fast as they had come it was very pleasant on deck in the warm afternoon sunshine the four children ploughed their way hungrily through the ham bread eggs and peaches only tom could manage the chocolate at the end and even he ate it lazily as though he didnt really want it well be back just before dark i think said andy look heres the channel between the rocksand thats where it goes off to smugglers rock see the children looked at the water that lay smoothly in the channel between the two ridges of rock and screwed up their eyes to have another look at the queer steep rocky island called smugglers rock yes there it was in the distance a desolate lonely rock where nobody ever went to nowadays it might be rather fun to explore it though shall we go there one day andy asked tom it might be rather fun we could hunt for the old caves the smugglers used all right said andy if you like its a nice sailing trip all the way here doesnt the boat go like a bird she did she was light and sweet to handle and seemed like a live thing to the children they loved the sapping of her sail and the creaking noise she made they liked the lapping of the water against her hull and the white wake that spread behind them like a feathery tail i think all children ought to have a boat of their own said tom i wish i had a boat and a horse and a dog and he stopped suddenly and looked so upset that the two girls felt alarmed whats the matter said jill do you know what ive done said tom tve left my camera behind im always doing that my best camera the one daddy gave me at christmas it cost an awful lot of money and i promised faithfully to be much more careful with it than i was with my old one and now ive gone and left it behind on the cliff of birds idiot said mary youre jolly careless mother will be awfully cross well one of you might have been clever enough to notice id left it behind said tom crossly havent got eyes i suppose dash andy can we turn back what turn back and climb all the way up that cliff again said andy dont be stupid we haven t got time you know that im not steering this boat home in the dark through these dangerous waters i didnt take any snaps and now ive left my camera lamented tom its such a beauty too i must have left it at the back of that shallow cave where we lay and rested gollyi hope that whistling man doesnt find it and take ft this was a really alarming thought everybody looked solemn at once a camera as fine as toms was very valuable and a treasured possession tom couldnt think how he had come to forget it but tom did do very foolish things at times how cross his parents would be tom looked so woebegone that andy was sorry for urn cheer up he said well go back for it one day this week if i can get my father to spare the boat well sail to the cliff of birds againand maybe visit smugglers rock everyone cheered up that would be lovely they would start off even earlieror would mother let them spend the night on board the boat then they could have a whole day on smugglers rock they began to talk about it their eyes shining dont be too hopeful said andy steering the boat deftly between the two dangerous ridges of rock you know what happened last time your mother gave you permission to spend a night or two on a sailing tripwe got wrecked and lived on an island for ages and found ourselves in a nest of enemy submarines and seaplanes well nothing like that could happen here said tom looking at the desolate lonely coast they were passing why there isnt a ship or a plane to be seen then i wonder what that man was looking for with his glasses said jill that made everyone remember the whistling man they began to talk again about the puzzle of how he could have disappeared between the place where the children sat and the waterfall i tell you there wasnt a hole big enough on the way to hide even a rabbit said tom he ought to have been somewhere along thereand he wasnt he had vanished into thin air i almost thought id dreamt him well he came back again from thin air all right said mary with a laugh we heard his whistle just as we were leaving his hidingplace cant be far away the puzzle of the mans hidingplace kept them interested for a long time it was jill who made the first sensible suggestion i know she said sitting upright on the deck i know where he went you dont said tom i bet he waited till the waterfall lessened its torrent a bitlike you said it did you rememberand then he shot into the opening the water pours from and made his way into the cliff from there said jill triumphantly but the others hardly took in what she said it seemed so queer whatdo you mean you think the man got into the cliff through the waterfall opening said tom at last what an idea hed never hide there hed be wet through wellwhere did he hide then said jill you cant think of anywhere better im sure i dare say theres a way into the heart of the cliff just there im sure there is jill was very pleased with her idea she went on talking about it and gradually she got the others excited jill may be right said andy his eyes fixed on the blue waters ahead of him its true that it might be possible to get in at the waterfall hole once the water had lessened and become a trickleas it did when we were walking away from it lets go and see when we go back for toms camera said mary we must i simply cant bear an unsolved mystery i cant bear not to know where that whistling man went toand what he is doing there too what horrid legs he had said jill id like to find out his hidingplace and who he isbut i dont want to have anything to do with him at all well keep out of his way all right said andy here tom would you like to take the tiller for a little while its easy going for a bit tom took the tiller eagerly the girls suddenly feeling sleepy lay down on rugs on the deck it was lovely to feel the not noonday sun the boat careered on joyously she always seemed to enjoy her trips so much shes a happy boat said jill drowsily she likes us coming out in her this is a day off for her golly i do feel sleepy wake me up at teatime somebody they had tea at five oclock when the sun was sliding down the western sky the wind whipped the sea into little waves and the andy dipped up and down joyfully the children were all very good sailors and it didnt even occur to them to feel seasick the sun went behind clouds and an evening chill crept over the sea everyone put on on extra coat and then a mackintosh after all it was only april well be home before its dark said tom looking at the sinking sun weve had a lovely day on the sea it was fun climbing up that cliff too and seeing all those birds and it will be fun to go back and see if there really is a hidingplace behind that waterfall said jill and i shall love going to smugglers rock when can we go andy i think the weathers changing a bit said andy looking at the sky therell be rain and squalls tomorrow and maybe for the rest of the week we must choose a fine day to go off again it would be a most uncomfortable trip in bad weather they got in before dark with big clouds sweeping overhead and heavy drops of rain falling their mother was most relieved to see them but she was very upset when she heard that tom had left his camera behind you will have to go and get it she said its much too good a one to leave lying about how careless you are tom its not a bit of good giving you anything nice im most awfully sorry mother said tom i promise you well go and get it the very first fine day we have andy says the weathers broken for a whilebut as soon as its fine again well go off and get my camera and find that hidingplace and see smugglers rock said jill under her breath mary dont you hope mother lets us stay away for a night then we can explore smugglers rock properly chapter sailing away again the next few days as andy had foretold were wet and squally but fishing was good and the children in macks rubber boots and souwesters had a lovely time helping with the fish andy worked hard the hauls were excellent and his father was pleased maybe hell give me two or three days off said andy when the fine weather comes back well take the andy and go off again i like that better than anything andys father came to supper one night the childrens mother liked the silent stemfaced man and gave him a very fine supper the children shared in it and chattered like magpies they must make your head ache their mother said to andys silent father och their chatter is no more than the calling of the gulls said the fisherman with a twinkle but were much more useful than the gulls said mary weve helped you a lot this week you said we had so you have said the fisherman andys taught you a bonny lot of things youre right good children you dont mess about and get into mischief like most silly little scallywags this was a long and handsome speech from andys father the children were delighted jill made the most of his good temper will you be able to let andy off for a day or two soon she asked we do so want to go out in the andy again all by ourselves ill give him a twodays holiday said the fisherman drawing out his pipe may i smoke maam thank you thanks dad said andy well go to smugglers rock then said tom hurrah wheres that asked his mother quickly oh its a place we saw the other day when we went to the cliff of birds said tom airily mother as andy will have two days off could we spend the whole time on the boat id like to go to the cliff of birds and have time to take some proper snapsif only i can find my camera againand we do want to sail to smugglers rock it looks exciting not a night away began his mother you know i dont like that but andy will be with us hell look after us wont he said tom turning to andys father who was now puffing out big clouds of thick smoke andys often out all night with you isnt he oh andys used to being on the boat for nights on end said the fisherman in a very good temper after his fine supper youll not come to any harm with andy there you can trust my boy maam oh i know i can said the childrens mother its only thatwellafter their adventure last year i just dont feel i want them to go travelling on their own again why maamyou dont suppose two adventures like that could happen do you said andys father theirs was an adventure that only happens once in a lifetime if that you let them gotheyll be all right with andy he can anchor the boat somewhere quiet and they can sleep on her in comfort if they take plenty of rugs it all seemed to be settled without any argument or difficulty at all how lovely the children glowed with pleasure and felt very grateful to andys father for making things easy for them he seemed to have conquered their mothers fears completely the next evening andy came up to the cottage weathers changing he said see that sky well set off tomorrow shall we get what food you can and ill bring some too knowing young toms appetite i reckon wed better lay in a good stock for two days and a night their mother always kept a fine stock of tinned food handy and she told the children to take what they wanted they took her at her word and soon the andy was well stocked with all kinds of things from sardines to tins of pineapple andy brought a few offerings too and stared in surprise at the store already in the cabin cupboards we shant want all that he said wellnever mindwe wont bother to take it back again now got some rugs well want plenty to sleep on the girls can sleep down in the cabin tomorrow nightand we boys will sleep up on deck i can rig up a tarpaulin round us to keep the wind off soon there were piles of rugs on board the andy too and some of the old cushions from the cottage it was almost dark before the children had finished stocking the little boat they felt as if they were going on a long long tripa night away from home made all the difference they set off at eight oclock in the morning and their mother came down to the jetty to wave goodbye have a lovely trip and take some fine pictures and find plenty of smugglers on smugglers rock she said tom and andy be sure you look after the twins well of course said the boys andy took the tiller and the little boat glided away with the morning sun on her tiny whitetopped waves curled against her smooth sides and she bobbed a little shes happy again said jill and so are we goodbye mother see you tomorrow evening soon the boat rounded the corner of the rocky bay and was out of sight the children settled down comfortably to enjoy the trip they all loved the sea and were at home on it they watched the seagulls soaring in the wind they saw them floating on the water bobbing over the curling waves now for a lovely trip the wind was strong and the andy galloped along mary who had lain awake from excitement the night before fell asleep spray splashed over her but she did not wake the others talked and jill once more aired her views about the hidingplace which she felt sure must be behind the waterfall what i really want to know said tom is where i left my camera im pretty certain i put it down in that shallow cave where we rested i hope to goodness its there now they were running along the channel between the ridges of rocks later they would sight smugglers rock in the distance but they would not go there today they would go tomorrow they turned into the shallow bay they had anchored in before and at once there came to their ears the terrific clamour of the thousands of nesting seabirds i shant look at the cliff and see their eggs falling this time said jill careless birds i wonder how they know their own eggsand what do they think when they fly back and see that they are gone just lay some more i suppose said tom mary wake up were there youve been asleep for ages well anchor in that deep pool again said andy and very soon the anchor was going down with a splash there was no one about the place seemed as deserted as before except for the noisy seabirds but perhaps the whistling man was in hiding somewhere or maybe he had gone lets take some food with us and go up to that place we rested in before said andy we could have a picnic there its a marvellous view right over the sea maybe we shall find your camera tom and you can take some photographs everyone thought this was a good idea and they collected what food they wanted and put it into kitbags which the two boys slung over their shoulders now dont look down at all this time jill said andy thats always a mistake when youre climbing look upwards all the time ready everyone yes they were ready they began their steep climb up following the catlike andy who seemed to know all the best handholds and footholds jill didnt look down once and was quite all right soon they were all panting and puffing for the day was warm they were glad when they reached the place where they had rested before jill threw herself down tired tom gave a delighted exclamation and picked up his camera which lay at the back of the shallow cave where he had put it a few days before look its here what a bit of luck i should think that whistling mans gone or hed have seen it and taken it golly i am pleased ive got it again they had a large and leisurely meal on the wide ledge marvelling at the great expanse of slowly moving blue sea below them gulls moved like white specks and their mewing voices came on the wind all the time you could easily take some photographs of the birds on their eggs said jill they come back to them very quickly im glad we havent got those horrid hairy legs to look at this time said mary lying down flat golly im sleepy again well dont go to sleep because we want to go and have a look at that waterfall rushing out of the cliff said jill giving her some little digs yes come on said andy getting up and be careful along this next path because its jolly narrow in places you come just behind me jill in case you get giddy they all went along the ledge that led round the rocky cliff to the left of their restingplace they looked out for the waterfall it was there all rightbut the torrent was not nearly so powerful as before it was a mere trickle compared with what it had been the other day funny said andy i should have thought that with all the rain weve had the waterfall would be pretty big come along we dont need to be afraid of being thrown off the cliff by that bit of water its no more than a gushing spring at the moment they made their way to the waterfall beyond it the cliffledge along which they were walking came to a sudden end there was no way the other side at all the water ran out of a hole in the cliff and fell headlong down andy made his way cautiously there and looked into the opening he gave a shout anyone could get in here now anyone i bet thats where the man went he waited till the torrent lessened then hopped up that was his hidingplace but whats he hiding for said jill puzzled theres nothing and no one to hide from here can we get in asked tom excitedly yes i bet we can no youre not to said andy suppose the water came out again in a sudden great rush youd be sent right off the cliff you idiot i cant allow anything like that tom looked sulky all right he said and turned back well that puzzles solved thats where the maa went but if youre not going to let us explore any farther we shant know what kind of a hideyhole he s got or anything about him youre a spoilsport cant help it said andy giving him a cross little shove im in charge go and take some pictures of the birds while the sun is so bright tom said nothing more but he made up his mind that as soon as the others were not looking he would go back to the waterfall and find out a bit more for himself hed climb right in if he wanted to hed show andy he would have his own way chapter tom is disobedient id like to climb down the cliff again and explore the rocks at the bottom said jill as they all turned back from the waterfall id like to go to where that underground river comes rushing out of the cliff too it looks exciting down there yes lets do that said mary it will be nice to get out of the wind a bit too its rather cold up here today right lets go down again then said andy coming tom but tom had other ideas he called back noi dont think ill come ill try and get some pictures of the birds now im up here and have found my camera again ill join you later id rather try to take snapshots alonethe birds may not settle quietly with us all about welldont be too long called back jill beginning to go down the cliffedge with andy just in front of her and for goodness sake dont forget your camera this time tom tom sat down and looked at the gulls and other seabirds soaring and gliding in the current of air that blew straight up the cliff they were magnificent and tom wished he too could spread great white wings and go gliding and circling on the strong breeze it must be a wonderful feeling he thought he could hear the voices of the others coming up to him on the wind as they climbed slowly down then the gulls began suddenly clamouring all together as they had a habit of doing and he could hear nothing else id better take a few pictures first before i try any exploring up that waterfall hole thought tom so he crept round the ledge and waited till the seabirds he had disturbed had come back again to their eggs there and were sitting on them he took a few pictures that he thought should be very good then he put his camera down at the back of the shallow cave where they had had their meal and made his way round the cliff to where the waterfall was his heart beat fast he knew that andy would be cross if he found out that he was going to disobey orders but after all im thirteen and quite able to look after myself thought tom im surprised andy hadnt the spunk to go into that waterfall hole himself golly wont the others stare when they find ive been into the hole and found out where that whistling man hid the other day he came to the waterfall it was still not much more than a gushing spring now there didnt seem any danger of a great torrent of water pouring out as there had been the other day tom peered cautiously into the opening out of which the water poured it flowed out of a rocky bed and had made quite a channel for itself there beyond as far as tom could see was a ledge above the water anyone getting up there should be safe and dry he felt in his pocket yes he had his torch there it was wrapped in a few layers of thin oilskin so that spray or splashes of seawater would not wet it he would need it once he got into that waterfall hole he climbed into the rocky hole it was high but narrow the water wetted him as he went in but he didnt mind that he dragged himself through the water and up on to the rocky ledge that lay above it now he was safe from the waterunless of course the torrent suddenly grew bigger for some reason and swept out of the hole filling the opening completely as it had done when the children had first seen it tom shivered a little as he thought of that it wouldnt be pleasant for him if that happened he had better get a bit farther inside then he would feel safer he switched on his torch and looked up the dark tunnel down which the water came it flowed in the rocky channel it had hollowed out for itself during the long years and beside it was the narrow rocky ledge a continuation of the one that tom lay on at the moment ill just explore a little way thought the boy feeling excited just to see if i can find that mans hidingplace i might find something there that would tell me what he isit seems so funny for a man to be living in this desolate place perhaps he is hiding from the police he began to wriggle along the narrow ledge the roof of the queer little tunnel was low and it wasnt very comfortable to wriggle along like that tom put his torch in his teeth so that he might have both hands to grasp the rock with and pull himself along the ledge ran for a few yards and then dipped a little so that the water ran over it bother couldnt he get any farther tom took his torch out of his mouth and flashed it beyond him he saw that not far in front the narrow rocky tunnel seemed to open outinto a cave perhaps he really must go and see even if it meant a wetting this time he had to wriggle through the water on the ledge and he got the front of himself very wet indeed but he was very excited now and didnt even feel the icy cold he wriggled along and found that quite suddenly the narrow tunnel stopped and beyond was a very large cave in the very heart of the cliff itself how extraordinary along the floor of the cave almost level with the rocky floor flowed the stream that entered the rocky tunnel and became the waterfall it was a strange sight to see the silent water flowing in the darkness coming from goodness knew where tom flashed his torch round the cave this would make a fine hidingplace this must surely be where that man had gone to but there didnt seem to be a sign of anyone at all it was silent there in the heart of the towering cliff no sound of calling seabirds came in through the long narrow entrance no rush of wind disturbed the still air it was like being in a curious dream i wish the others were here thought tom id like them to share this with me ill go and get them but first ill just flash my torch all round the cave to see if i can find even a small trace of that whistling mana cigarette end perhapsor a match he flashed his torch about the cave had a high rocky roof an uneven rocky floor and gleaming walls the water that flowed silently through it came from what looked like the entrance to a smaller cave at the backbut somehow tom didnt want to go any deeper into the black darkness something gleamed on the floor near the water toms torch shone on it and he wondered what it was he went to pick it up it was a small pearl button the kind that is sewn on to mens shirts but it was red not white tom looked at it eagerly ahthat was a sure sign that somebody used the waterfall hole and had come into this cave but it was plain that they didnt live here for there was no sign of any foodstores or bed whoever came here or made it his hidingplace must have gone farther into the cliff perhaps the whole cliff was honeycombed with caves and tunnels tom remembered the underground river that flowed out so turbulently at the foot that must come down winding channels of its own from somewhere he wished very much that andy was with him he couldnt make up his mind whether to go farther in or not he was afraid of being caught by the whistling manor anyone else the whistling man might not be the only person in the cliff there might be someone else too i dont knowi think ill go back to the others after all said tom to himself its a bit frightening being here in this cliff all by myselfand if i go farther in i might get lost ill go back he flashed his torch round the cave once moreand then suddenly noticed that the stream flowing in its channel across the floor of the cave had quietly risen higher it was now flowing over the rocky floor almost reaching to where tom stood look at that said tom in surprise and he stood watching the water why has it risen like that golly its flooding all the floor of this cave so it was the water rose higher and swept over the floor it began to make a noise tom felt alarmed gracious i know whats happening the torrent of water farther in must have suddenly been increased for some reasonand its pushing its way out hereand will make that waterfall simply enormous again if i dont go now ill be swept out with the torrent and go down the cliff in the waterfall this was not at all a pleasant thought tom ran over the flooding cavefloor back to the narrow tunnel into which the water flowed on its way to the open air but already the narrow little tunnel was filling with water the rocky ledge he had wriggled along could hardly be seen for the water had risen high above it in a few minutes the whole of the narrow opening would be blocked by the suddenly increased torrent of water i darent go along it now thought tom i simply darent id either be drowned or swept out and down the waterfall the water had now flooded the whole of the floor of the cave it was up to toms knees he felt frightened had he better go to the inner cave the one his torch had shown him when he had flashed it on the water at the farther side of his cave perhaps he had it wasnt safe in his cave now goodness knew how high the water would rise there and there was no place he could climb up to and sit until the water went down again i wish i hadnt explored in here he thought in dismay now i may be kept a prisoner for hours the others will get worried about me what an idiot i am he made his way to the farther side of the cave he was in through a fairly high tunnel there the water came from an inner cave tom stepped into the water it was up to his waist already he would have to wade along until he came to the inner cave it was not very far inonly a matter of a few yards water flooded over the floor of this cave toobut to toms surprise and delight he saw rough steps cut in the wall going upwards at the back of this inner cave he flashed his torch there yes those steps led to an opening in the caveroof if he got up there he would be quite safe from the rising water good wonder if the steps lead into another cave thought the boy this is ad very weird who would have guessed there were these caves leading one out of the other like this in the heart of that enormous cliff he went up the rough rocky steps there was a hole fa the roof and iron footholds had been driven into the rock there to act as a help in the climb tom put his torch between his teeth again and hauled himself up he came out into a dark and silent tunnel that twisted in front of him leading to he knew not where welli suppose id better go along thought tom trying to sound much braver than he felt it must lead somewhere chapter the hidden cave tom went down the winding passage it smelt funny and he didnt like it he hoped his torch wouldnt suddenly go out he was glad that it had a new battery in it would be horrid to wander about in the dark inside the cliff all by himself the tunnel twisted downwards it was narrow most of the tune and sometimes the roof went low so that tom had to bend his head or he would have bumped it sometimes the roof became so high that toms torch showed him nothing but darkness it was all very queer id be enjoying this more if only the others were here thought tom still trying to feel brave i do so hope this tunnel leads somewhere i almost wish i could meet that whistling man id at least have someone to talk to but he met nobody the tunnel went on and on always downwards and then stealing up it came a curious familiar smell tom sniffed tobacco smoke he thought gracious somebody must be near thensomebody smoking a cigarette or pipe id better go carefully he trod as quietly as he could shading the light of his torch with his hand then suddenly he switched it out he could see a light in the distance the tunnel must come out into a cave again he thoughtand there was a light in that cave which meant that people must be there he crept nearer he could hear voices nowmens voices one of them was the growly voice of the man with the hairy legs tom didnt know what he was like to look at of course because he had only seen his legs but he knew that growly voice again although he had only heard the man say a few words up on the cliff the boys heart began to thump he was very glad indeed to think that people were nearbut somehow he felt that they wouldnt welcome him at all could they be smugglers he tiptoed to the end of the tunnel and peeped cautiously into the cave two men were thereone of them plainly the hairylegged man for his legs were bare and tom could see his enormous feet the boy gazed at the men wondering if they would be angry at his sudden appearance or not he somehow thought they would not welcome him at all the hairylegged man was not the giant the children had imagined him to behe was a curiouslooking fellow with a strong stumpy body hairy bare arms a big head with hardly any neck and a flaming red beard the other man looked like an ordinary fisherman but wore something that fishermen rarely worea pair of spectacles they looked odd on his extremely brown face the men sat on boxes talking tom could not hear what they were saying he stared round the cave astonished for the sides of it were piled with wooden boxes and crates tom couldnt imagine what was in them this was clearly a storehouse of some kind but why and where did all the boxes come from there was a rough mattress in one corner of the cave one or both men slept there then what a curious place to live hi tom was completely puzzled by it all but he did feel certain of one thingthat these men would not welcome his presence there at all whatever they were doing was something secret and private something they wanted to be kept hidden i darent go in and ask them for help thought the boy desperately i simply darent i hate the look of that man with the hairy legs he looks as if hed think as little of hurling me down the cliff as of dropping and smashing those birds eggs he strained his ears to hear what they were saying but he couldnt make out a word perhaps they were talking in some foreign language certainly the man in the fishermans clothes the one wearing glasses looked like a foreigner it was all most extraordinary tom wondered if he could possibly be in some sort of very real dream then he got another whiff of tobacco smoke and knew he wasnt things never smelt as strong as that in dreams one of the men looked at his watch he got up and jerked his head at the other they made their way to a hole in the ground that tom could not see clearly from where he stood and seemed to drop right down at any rate they completely disappeared tom waited a few moments and then cautiously crossed the floor of the cave and looked down the hole there was nothing to be seen the men had gone tom didnt feel at all inclined to follow them for one thing he couldnt see how to get down the hole there were no steps or footholds of any sort that he could see he looked round the cave he could hardly see its walls they were stacked so high with boxes of all sizes what could be inside them the men had left a lantern burning on a box in the middle of the cave did that mean they were soon coming back perhaps it did tom felt that it would be a good thing if he were not there when they returned but where could he go he stood still in the cave thinkingand as he stood there he heard a muffled sound it seemed to come from somewhere to the left of the big cave its a kind of rushing watery sound thought tom whatever can it be there was a big stack of boxes on the left of the cave tom went to them and saw the wall of the cave behind them there was a hole in the wall almost round just about as high as toms waist the rushing noise came from there tom poked his head through the hole he switched his torch onand saw a strange sight an underground river flowed there swift and rushing whythat must be the river that comes out at the foot of the cliff thought tom gollyif i could follow it id soon be out of here he stood and gazed at the swiftlyflowing river by the light of his torch the dark strong torrent moved quickly tom wondered how far from the foot of the cliff it was after all the winding twisting tunnel he had followed had come down and down and downmaybe he was almost level with the base of the cliff now and this river would take him very quickly to the shallow bay outside and the sunshine he went back into the lamplit cave and looked round he hoped that he might see another torch that he could take with him he felt sure his own would not last much longer he didnt want to face another long journey without being sure he had plenty of light for it before he could see anything in the shape of a torch something startling happened there came the sound of someone scrambling up the hole in the cave floor down which the men had goneand before toms alarmed eyes the big bearded face of the man with the hairy legs popped up out of the hole tom stared at him petrifiedand he stared back at tom as if he really couldnt believe his eyes a boy a boy in his cave could he be dreaming tom swallowed hard and tried to say something but he couldnt think what to say the bearded face just above the hole opened its eyes wide and then the mouth opened too and a bellow came out what you doing here tom couldnt move his feet seemed to be growing into the ground he watched the stumpy shortnecked man heave himself out of the hole and come towards him he was frightened and backed away suddenly finding himself able to move he backed straight into the box on which the lamp was set the box went over and the lamp with it it smashed at once flared up and then went out the cave was instantly in black darkness the bearded man began to mutter something and to feel about as if he were looking for another lamp or a candle tom knew that this was his only chance of escape he ran softly behind the pile of boxes to the hole in the wall that looked out on to the underground river he was through the hole in a trice he had hoped there would be a ledge there or a rock of some kind he could hold to whilst he flashed his torch round to see what kind of a way of escape he had chosen but there was no rock and no ledgeonly the cold rushing river tom landed in the water with a splash he caught his breath with the coldness of it then he began to strike out with all his might fearing that the bearded man might come after him the current of the swiftlyflowing river bore him away rapidly tom let himself be taken along keeping himself afloat quite easily but shivering with the cold he thought of his torch gloomily it was in his pocket but not wrapped up in the oilskin it would be of no usfe at all now h this underground river landed him somewhere inside the cliff again he would be in complete darkness lost for ever said tom dolefully oh why did i disobey andy ill never get out of this mess never golly how cold the water is the river bore him along gurgling in a deep voice as it went it apparently ran in a deep channel of rock tom could not see if they were passing through caves or not nor could he see if there were any banks of rock or sand to the river he just had to go on with it trying to keep his balance and not be rolled over and over like a log of wood once his foot struck against a jutting rock and it was badly bruised but there was no one to hear his cry he bit his lip with the pain and after that was very much afraid of being bumped against a rock again he grew very tired and cold and then just as he felt he really could not go on one moment longer he saw a bright light in front of him a big wide dazzling patch of light that filled him with joy sunshine said tom thats sunshine i must be getting near the place where the river rushes out of the cliff ive escaped yesit was sunshine hurrah tom suddenly felt so weak with relief that he couldnt seem to keep his balance any more and the current took him and rolled him over and over he gasped and spluttered striking out as best he could to hold his face and shoulders out of the swiftrunning water he was taken to where sea and river met a big wave ran up and caught him as the river took him there luckily for him he was thrown sideways on to a rock and managed to pull himself up out of reach of the water he couldnt move he lay there on his back gasping for breath shivering and trembling whilst just below him river and sea fought their eternal battle as one met the other sending up spray and foam that fell pattering down on poor tiredout tom chapter wherever is tom meanwhile what were andy jill and mary doing they had been having quite a good time though not so exciting a time as poor tom they climbed steadily down the cliff to the great alarm of all the seabirds whose nests they passed once more dozens of eggs fell into the sea knocked in by the excited uprush of the sitting birds jill almost made up her mind she would never climb the cliff again she really couldnt bear to see so many eggs wasted they came at last to the foot of the cliff there were some glorious rockpools there full of the finest sea anemones that the children had ever seen lookheres a red anemone whose feelers are as big as a peonys petals said jill i should think he feeds on prawns and crabsnothing so small as a shrimp would do for aim the three explored the pools thoroughly and disturbed some enormous crabs look out said andy a nip from a big fellow like that wont be very pleasant it was warm down there at the foot of the cliff the wind was not strong there as it was up on the cliff and the sun felt hot mary glanced up at the steep towering cliff above i bet toms beginning to feel hungry again she said im hungry myselfbut i suppose wed better wait till tom comes down hell come as soon as he feels hungry it shouldnt take him very long to take a few snapshots said andy im surprised he isnt here by now maybe hes watching the birds theyre as good as a show sometimes lets go and sit near that river said mary well take some food there and wait for tom it would be rather a nice place to have a picnic look how the spray flies in the air where river and sea meet on the rocks yes lets go and get some food and eat it there said jill i really do feel very hungry we can give tom a call when we see him come down the cliff they went to where they had anchored the boat in the deep pool in the cabin were the plentiful stores of food they had brought with them they rummaged about finding it hard to choose what to take sardines bread and butter potted meat hardboiled eggsand tinned plums said jill notinned pears said mary those are nicest of all heres a big tin and wheres the gingerbeer mother gave us plenty this time oh here it is they took everything to a high rock overlooking the spot where river and sea met spray was sometimes flung as high as their rock but they didnt mind thatit was all part of the fun to dodge it when it came they set out the meal and then looked up at the side of the cliff to see if there was any sign of tom coming down but there wasnt what can he be doing said jill impatiently hes been ages wellwell wait five minutes more and then begin without him said mary and if theres nothing left hell jolly well have to go and get something else himself they waited for five minutes but still there was no tom andy looked a little worried but he said nothing they opened the sardines spread butter on their bread and began a delicious meal by the end of it there was not much leftand still no tom andyyou dont think toms in any difficulty up there do you said jill suddenly its so unlike him not to turn up long before a mealtime wellive been wondering about that myself said andy i think id better go up the cliff again and fetch him down he may have gone to sleep what a nuisance he is said mary poor andyhaving all that climb again oh i dont mind said andy now you girls stay here till we come its nice and sunny and youre not much bothered with the wind ill be as quick as i can off he went soon the girls could see him small and far off up the cliffside climbing steadily the seabirds flying wildly round his head i bet he gives tom a scolding said jill lying down on her back enjoying the feel of the sunwarmed rock behind her wont tom be famished when he comes back andy climbed steadily and at last came to the restingplace where they had had their dinner there was no one there of coursebut what was this at the back toms camera again so he was not photographing the birds after all well what was he doing thenand where was he andy began to feel frightened he left the camera where it was and went on round the cliff on the narrow ledge that led to the waterfall it was now no longer a trickle but was pouring out in a great cataract andy went right up to it an awful thought came to him could tom have been foolish enough to try and get into the cliff through the waterfall hole surely surely not i forbade him to anyway said andy but he couldnt help feeling that tom would have disobeyed him easily if he had wanted to badly enough had he gone inside and had the water suddenly grown in volume and closed his way out again andy stood looking at the waterfall knowing there was nothing to do for tom if he really had gone inside either the boy would have to wait till the waterfall lessened in volume againor find some other way out and what way was there none so far as andy could see the boy sat there for some time then thinking that he must not leave the girls alone any longer he got up to go but he did not feel at all happy as he moved away from the waterfall its noise grew less the boy turned round and saw that once again it had lessened until now it was no more than a gushing spring what a queer thing it was he turned to go on again and then stopped his eyes almost falling out of his head out from the waterfall exit came an enormous hairy leg then another andy knew perfectly well they were the same legs he and the others had seen before for some reason or other they filled the boy with fright he climbed hurriedly round the edge of the cliff to be out of sight of the man when he emerged from the hole he climbed down steadily he passed the place where toms camera was without thinking about it he was just below this place clinging to a rafter difbcult bit of the cliff when he heard the growling voice not far above him then something hurtled past bun something with a long brown strap it flew downwards but the seabirds and wind were making such a noise that andy did not hear crash or thud as the thing struck the rocks below he clung to the cliffside his heart thumping wondering if the man would come after him or had seen him but apparently he had not for no one came down the cliffpath and all was quiet except for the sounds of wind sea and birds andy his mind in a turmoil climbed down the rest of the cliff as fast as he could he knew the girls could see him and would be watching anxiously to see if tom were following what had happened to tom it was terribly worrying he reached the girls and found them sitting upright on their rock looking pale and frightened couldnt find tom said andy i think the silly little idiots got inside the waterfall holeand goodness knows whats happened to him you were right jill when you said that hairylegged man made that place his hideyhole he came out of there when i was quite near andylook said mary in a low scared voice and pointed to something on a rock not very far from them look that came down a little while ago and made us jump terribly it crashed on that rockand oh andyits toms camera mary burst into tears the shock of the camera falling so near and smashing into hundreds of bits had given her a shock and now andy had come back without tom andy what are we to do about tom asked jill surely he wouldnt have gone exploring like that all by himself tom can be very foolish at times said andy why did i leave him up there alone im afraid he may have been caught by that man theres something queer going on here i dont want to be mixed up in it i want to get back home no more adventures for me i had enough of them last year but andyandywe cant go home without tom said mary beginning to cry again we cant leave him here all alone id better take you safely home and get dad back here to find tom and discover whats going on said andy who looked rather white he didnt like seeing that smashed camera what a temper the hairylegged man must have to fling a beautiful camera down the cliff and smash it like that andy remembered how the man had smashed the birds eggs too and he didnt at all like the thought of coming into contact with him when he had two small girls to look after he stood up collect the things and come back to the boat he ordered we must go no said mary im not going im not going to desert tom if you are dont be silly said andy were not deserting him were going to get dad and come back and find tom come along dont argue im the skipper here jill began to gather up the things but mary was still obstinate andy hauled her to her feet and gave her a tough shake do as youre told cant you see im worried stiff its toms disobedience that has led to thisim not going to have any more trouble youll come along with jill and me straight away mary with tears streaming down her cheeks began to help jill to collect the things left over from their tea jill almost in tears herself gave a last glance down at the underground river which flowed so swiftly from the foot of the cliff then she stood still her eyes wide and her mouth opened to give a cry but none came she reached out her arm and pointed downwards the others looked rolling over and over on the river swept from side to side like a log came a strange dark object andy its tompoor poor tom said jill in a choking voice its too late to save him the rivers got him very white under his brown andy looked down at the tumbling body he saw it swept to one side on to the locks where sea and river met it tumbled out and lay there then he saw how the tired arms heaved up the exhausted body to a place of safety hes all right yelled andy almost startling the girls out of their skins hes all right hi tom tom you scamp where have you been how did you get here all three rushed down the rocks to the one where tom lay slipping and sliding as they went he looked up at them and grinned feebly hello he said nice to see you all again im sorry to say that weve plunged into the middle of a most exciting adventure you wait till ive told you everything anybody got anything to eat im most frightfully hungry chapter what happened on the way back andy jill and mary were so relieved to see tom alive and hungry that for a moment they could only stare at bun in joy and say nothing at all then jill rushed to get something for him to eat andy called after her bring a couple of rugs toms wet through and shivering soon tom was sitting in a sheltered corner munching bread and potted meat his wet clothes drying in the wind and a couple of warm rugs tucked round nun andy wouldnt let the girls ask him any questions till he had got some food inside him and had stopped shivering they could hardly wait to know what had happened to him how extraordinary it had been to see tom come rolling over and over in the restless waters of the underground river nowtell us everything said jill when tom had finished his meal tom glanced at andy and looked rather embarrassed he didnt like to own up to his disobedience which had nearly brought disaster on him andy saw the look i suppose you played the fool and got in through the waterfall opening he said not unkindly but sternly tom went red and nodded yesi did he said im sorry andy i know youre the skipper here i just felt i had to but i wished and wished i hadnt been such an idiot once id got through im very glad youre safe said andy but you listen to me young tomany more disobedience from you and you dont come out in my boat any more see im in charge and if you cant be loyal to your skipper youre no use i know andy i know said tom humbly i wont play the fool again ive had my lesson you wait till you hear do tell us begged jill dont scold him any more andy let him tell us his story so tom told them how he had wriggled through the waterfall opening found himself in the cave which became flooded so that he had to make his way farther in he told them about the rough steps leading out from the inner cave and the long winding downhill passages through the heart of the cliff when he described finding the cave down below used apparently as some kind of storehouse and the two men sitting there talking the others sat listening intently holding their breath so as not to miss a word golly said andy this is amazing theres something queer going on but what can it be you were lucky to escape tom but you must have had a shock when you fell into that swirling underground river i did said tom and wasnt it a bit of luck that it took me right out here almost to your feet i shouldnt have liked it much if the current had thrown me into that foaming surging bit over there dashing over the rocks id have been knocked to bits its a pity those men know somebody is here said andy i simply cant imagine what theyre up to can they be smugglers but what are they doing inside this cliff theres no road overland to take smuggled goods its a real puzzle do you think the men will come after us said jill looking rather scared wellthey only know about tomand maybe they think hes fallen over the cliff now said andy its plain they thought he had gone back up the winding passage to the waterfall opening they must have gone up there themselves thinking they were chasing himand all they found was his camera on the cliffledge they must have thrown it down in rage what a shame its smashed to bits tom was feeling much better now in fact he was feeling quite a hero true he had disobeyed andybut things had come out all right and he had made some queer discoveries he began to look a little cocky but andy soon put a stop to that i think we ought to get back home as soon as we can he said toms sure to get a chill after this that river water is icycold its a pity to bring our trip to such a sudden end but i dont want tom down with pneumonia or something toms face fell oh andydont be such an idiot im perfectly all right you know i am anyway andyisnt it too late to start back asked jill looking at the sun which was now well down in the west andy looked at it too and made some calculations the winds in our favourand we can get past the worst rocks whilst its still daylight i think we ought to go also those two men will be on the lookout for our boat i expect and may try to surprise us in the night blow said tom why did i go and upset things like this spoiling our lovely trip and we havent been to smugglers rock either once andy had made up his mind to do something he didnt take long to set about it come on he said getting up those men are sure to start prying around soon wed better go now they all went back to the andy with sad faces what a sudden end to what had promised to be a really exciting trip they clambered on board and put up the red sail the evening sun shone softly down and the sail glowed as they pulled it up throwing a brilliant shadow on the pale blue water the wind was very strong now andy deftly steered his boat out of the bay her sail filling with the wind soon she was scudding along fast nobody said anything they were all disappointed it was horrid to leave an unsolved mystery behind too how they would have loved to find out why those men were in the cave what they were doing there and who they were probably they never would find out because neither andys father nor the childrens mother might take much notice of their excited tale the sun seemed to go down very quickly just as it was about to disappear over the western edge of the world tom gave a yell and pointed ahead whats that he cried look over there by those tall rocks andys sharp eyes made out what it was at oncea motorboat it was lying still not moving could it be waiting for them there was nothing to do but go on the andy swept along her red sail glowing when she came near the waiting boat they heard her motor being started up and the boat swung out into the centre of the channel down which the andy was flying andy saw that he could not get past in safety the channel between the two ridges of rock was narrow there he would go on the rocks if he tried to swing past they came up to the motorboat a tall foreignlooking man leaned over the side who are you what are you doing here he shouted thats none of your business shouted back andy get out of our way anchor your boat and come on board here ordered the tall man most surprisingly if you dont well capture you boat and all who are you bellowed back andy angrily clear out of our way were children out on a sailing trip andy turn back lets go back to the cliff of rocks begged jill frightened andy looked scornful then seemed to alter his mind he looked anxiously at the sky which was now dark and overcast with the coming night and with heapedup clouds in a short time it would be almost dark the man joined by another man began to yell at andy again to come on board he could not really see if andys crew were children or not for there was a little distance between the boats then something happened a great wave surged up and took hold of the motorboat swinging her round violently she must have struck a rock just below the surface as the wave receded suddenly for there was a grinding noise and the motorboat shivered from top to bottom the two shouting men were almost thrown overboard they disappeared at once to see what the damage was nows our chance said andy well turn and go backbut not to the cliff of rocks which is where they will expect to find us ive no doubtbut to smugglers rock you remember where this channel forks off to it well take that courseand we must hope it wont be too dark for me to see it so whilst the men were trying to find out what damage had been done to their boat the andy turned round and stole off tacking a little to get the help of the breeze andy did not think that the motorboat would dare to come after them in the gathering dark so as soon as he could he pulled down the sail and took the oars with tom look out for the place where the channel forks he said its a good long row but never mind fortunately the current helped them and it was not so hard as andy had expected they found where the channel forked off for smugglers rock and then to their joy saw that the moon was sliding out from behind the thinning clouds that will help a lot said andy lookyou can see the faint shape of smugglers rock over there they slid along the channel which was wider here and came nearer to the tall steep rock they could not see it very clearly for it was full of shadows they took the boat into a small cove andy thought they had better drop anchor there and hope for the best he didnt think anyone would come looking for them at smugglers rock perhaps next day they could escape out to sea they let down the anchor are we going on to the little island asked jill no said andy we shouldnt be able to find our way properly with the moon slipping in and out of clouds like this well sleep on the boatas we planned to do can we all sleep on deck asked jill noyou and mary must sleep down in the cabin said andy have a rug eachthat should keep you warm enough down there well have the rest of the rugs and cushions because it will be chilly up on deck i feel a bit scared now said mary i didnt like those two men yelling at us you neednt be afraid said andy you will be quite safe down in the cabinand tom and i will take it in turns to keep guard up here in case anybody should come but no one will puzzled tired and still a bit frightened the twins went down into the cabin they passed up rugs and cushions to the boys then they settled down to sleep andy said he would take the first watch and wake tom up in three hours tom tired out with all his adventures was asleep at once andy sat beside him covered in rugs on guard what a curious adventure this was andy couldnt make head or tail of it chapter a night on the boat it was a lovely night with scudding clouds going across the moon in the quiet cove there was very little movement of the water and the boat hardly stirred andy heard the tiny lapping sounds against her sides as he kept his watch he puzzled over everything that had happened tom had said that the big cave inside the cliff at the foot where the underground river rushed by was stored with boxes and crates where had they come from and how did the men get them there wondered andy surely they couldnt have taken them up that steep cliff through the waterfall opening and down the winding passages that tom described thats quite impossible could a motorboat get up that rushing underground river nothe current is much too strongand by toms description of it i should think the roof is too low in parts noit was too much of a puzzle and andy soon gave up trying to solve it all im certain of is that theres something queer going on something unlawfulaod the sooner we get back now and tell the grownups the better thought andy we cant possibly tackle this ourselves and there are the girls to think ofi darent let them run into any more danger than i can help when his three hours were up he woke tom it was hard to wake him for the boy was really tired out after all his adventures that day still he was soon sitting up straight the rugs well wrapped round him looking out on the moonlit cove three hours tomthen wake me again said andy snuggling down in the rugs as close to tom as he could for warmth it was a chilly night tom felt terribly steeply he found that his head was nodding and his eyes were closing that would never do to go to sleep when guarding the others would be a real crimehe couldnt possibly do that andy would never never trust him again id better walk about a bit said tom to himself he cautiously wriggled out of his rugs so as not to wake andy and paced the deck he thought he heard a movement down below and he opened the cabinhatch softly are you all right down there he said in a whisper marys voice answered him i cant go to sleep tom ive tried and tried i simply cant let me come up on deck with you a bit and keep watch im sure andy wouldnt mind ill bring up some chocolate chocolate sounded pretty good to tom he called back softly well dont wake jill come on up and bring your rug just for a little while mary came up into the moonlight dragging her rug with her she looked round ohisnt it lovely up here with the moonlight making the sea all silvery what black shadows there are in smugglers rock i wonder if well have time to explore it tomorrow heres your chocolate tom they sat down together cuddling into the thick rugs they munched the chocolate which tasted delicious eaten inthe middle of the night like that tom felt quite wide awake by now he and mary began to discuss the days happenings in low tones so as not to wake andy did you get your torch wet asked mary you knowwhen you fell into the underground river yes i did said tom and felt in his pocket for it i expect its quite spoilt ill try it he pressed the little button that usually set the torch alightbut nothing happened it was quite spoilt tom put it back into his pocket again as he did so he felt something else therea tiny round thing what was it he took it out it was the little red pearl button he had found on the floor of one of the caves he showed it to mary look he said i forgot about this i found it on the floor of the cave behind the waterfall thats what made me feel certain the hairylegged man must hide somewhere in the cliff after all a button means a shirt or a vest doesnt it did he wear a red shirt when you saw him in the hidden cave far below asked mary turning the red button over in her hand no i dont think so said tom trying to remember i dont think the other fellow did either he was dressed like a fisherman i didnt much like the look of either of them he put the button back into his pocket and the two fell silent enjoying the soft motion of the little boat and the wishawisha noise that the water made against her mary thought it was such a lovely sound she bent over the side and dabbled her hand in the water awfully cold she said and yawned have you finished your chocolate i think ill go back now i feel sleepy i dont think anything will happen tonight tom were quite safe here she went below taking her rug with her tom had no fear of falling asleep now he felt wide awake he looked at smugglers rock what a tall steep rocky place it was he felt sure that there would be heaps of seabirds nesting there too he hoped andy wouldnt rush them all away in the morning without letting them land on the island and have a look at it the moon went behind a cloud at once smugglers rock became dark and black tom glanced idly at the top of itand then he straightened himself up suddenly and looked very sharply at something theres a light of some sort up there he said under his breath yesthere it is againflash flash flash somebodys signalling from there gracious are there people here too the light went on flashing tom woke andy by shaking him roughly the fisherboy awoke at once and sat up in alarm expecting he knew not what look andy looktheres a light flashing at the very top of smugglers rock said tom up there see can you see it its a signal of some sort i should think andy looked he soon spotted the light he watched it intently it went on for some time and then stopped what do you make of that said tom i dont know said andy one more puzzle added to the other puzzles anyway im determined to get away home as soon as possible tomorrow we ought to report all these queer doingsand wed better not be mixed up in them more than we can help i dont like this kind of puzzle the light did not flash any more andy looked at his watch and then curled himself up ive got another hour of sleep he said keep a sharp lookout tom and wake me if you see anything else going on but nothing else happened in the rest of toms watcn much to his disappointment he woke andy up at the right time and then curled up again in the rugs himself i dont feel a bit sleepy he said i could sit up all night now but he was asleep almost before andy had walked across the deck and back below in the cabin jill and mary were asleep too it was all very peaceful at dawn andy woke them all you girls get a quick breakfast going he ordered take these rugs down tom well start off as soon as we can which way are we going back asked tom dragging the rugs to the hatch to drop them down to the girls im not sure said andy if i were certain that that motorboat had gone id risk the way we know ive no idea if we can get out to sea from hereor what is the best course to take if we can i wish i dared climb up to a high bit of smugglers rock and have a looksee i cant see anything from here well why shouldnt you climb up smugglers rock and have a look round the sea said tom you might spot the motorboat you might see clearly how we could best make our way home from here have you forgotten those lights we saw flashing last night said andy theres somebody on the island we dont want to get caught by them it seems as if there is a perfect network of people in this desolate part of the coast but its so early in the morning said tom no one will be about now lets all have a quick breakfast andy and then hop across to smugglers rock quickly climb up to that high point up theresee where i meanand have a lookout from there we could see for miles i bet youd spot the motorboat if it was lying in wait for us anywhere about here wellperhaps id better try and spy out the way said andy maybe no one will be about yet as you say we wont talk or laugh as we go well be absolutely quiet they sat down on the deck to have a good breakfast this time it was hot soup out of tins with bread and plenty of biscuits spread with marmalade there was hot cocoa to drink too sweetened with condensed milk everybody enjoyed their queer breakfast very much indeed hot soup was a jolly good idea said andy to jill who looked pleased at his praise its so jolly cold this morning but then its very earlythe sun is only just coming up look they finished their breakfast watching the blue water in the cove turn to dancing gold as the sun came up everything looked clean and beautiful and washed mary said so it did even the rocks gleamed in the early sun as if somebody had been along and given them a good cleaning andy glanced up the steep rocks of the island nearby i think that high point that tom thought would be a good one is about the best to choose he said i dont quite like you girls coming but id rather we were all together well be as quick as we can they left all the breakfast things as they were and leapt across to a nearby rock soon they were clambering over the shining rocks going up as fast as they could there were no steep cliffs as there were in the bay they had anchored in beforejust masses of rocks covered with seaweed as far as the spray reached but dry and black beyond they went right up to the high point that tom had chosen certainly there was a wonderful view from there they looked all round the sea as far as they could it was rough that morning and white horses galloped everywhere there was no sign of the motorboat to be seen andy looked everywhere his hawklike eyes ranging for miles he had the fine sight of the fisherman and could often see things out to sea that neither tom nor the girls could see nothing to be seen said andy pleased good thing too because i cant for the life of me see how we would escape any other way than the one we know id be afraid to sail out to sea with all those rocks about welllets get back home as quick as we can said jill and began to leap from rock to rock downwards andy yelled a warningbut he was too late jill slipped and fell she tried to get up and couldnt andy hurried to her in great alarm whatever had she done chapter a horrid shock jill was sitting on a rock looking very white indeed she nursed one of her ankles and moaned a little tears ran down her cheeks whats up have you hurt your ankle asked andy kneeling down beside her oh jillhow foolish to skip down those steep rocks like that i know oh andy my ankle does hurt so oh what shall i do wailed poor jill im a baby to cry but i cant help it mary was almost crying too as she bent down by her twin she took off jills rubber shoe the ankle was already swollen andy felt it tenderly i dont think its a real sprain he said youve just given it an awful twist it will be all right soon dont walk on it just yet pull her near this pool said tom seeing a big clear pool of rainwater in the hollow of a rock she can put her foot into it that will be as good as bathing it i should think jills foot did reel better in the cold water soon the colour came back to her face and she rubbed away the tears i simply couldnt help crying she said you cant think how awful the pain was just for the moment but its much better now the foot was still very swollen andy thought she had better wait a while before trying to walk on it so they sat by the pool and talked andy keeping a sharp lookout in case anyone came he told the girls about the lights he and tom had seen the night before after a whife jill thought she could try to walk andy helped her up but as coon as she put her hurt foot to the ground she gave a cry and crumpled up again i dont think i cannot just yet anyway she said well rest a bit longer said andy trying not to look worried he did so badly want to get back home quickly he looked down the steep stretch of rocks below leading to the cove where the boat was he could not see the boat but it was quite a distance below it wouldnt be much good trying to help jill down the steep rocks at the moment she would probably slip and fall again dragging them with her they must all wait in patience they looked round them smugglers rock was truly a lonely desolatelooking place the seabirds did not nest there in such thousands as they did on the cliff of birds but there were plenty of them about circling in the breeze and calling loudly the island rose to a steep pinnacle anyone at the very top would have a perfectly marvellous view for miles out to sea i wish i could go right to the top and have a look what its like there said tom longingly you wont do anything of the sort said andy sharply you got into a nice mess yesterday and im not having you get into any more trouble tonlay besides you know perfectly well that that was where those lights showed last night if anyone is on this island now they would most likely be up there all right andy all right said tom i only just said id like to go up there im not going it seemed a long time till jill was able to put her foot to the ground again without too much pain it was still swollen but not quite so much it wasnt a sprain but she certainly had twisted it very badly its about halfpast ten said andy if you feel you can possibly limp down now jill with tom and me helping you wed better go jill tried her foot yesif she didnt put her whole weight on to it but held on to tom and andy she thought she could manage they started down it was a slow little procession that went down the rocks taking the very easiest way so that jill would not have to do any jumping twice she had to sit down and rest andy was gentle and patient but inside he felt anxious and worried suppose anyone on the island saw them and stopped them he was longing to get back to the boat and sail away they got down to the cove at last there lay the boat rocking gently where they had left her but immediately they saw her the children saw that something was lacking what was it wheres the sail said tom we left it folded on the deck at the end there where is it andy said nothing his keen eyes swept the boat from end to end and his heart went cold had someone taken the sail he left jill to tom and mary and went jumping down to the cove landing like a surefooted goat on the rock beside the andy he leapt on board he made a hurried search whilst the others came slowly nearer tom and mary helping jill along he turned to them with a grim face as they came aboard do you know whats happened somebodys been here and taken not only our sail but our oars too the three stared at him in horror the sail goneand the oars as well how could they get home then but andywe cant go home now said jill looking very pale with shock and pain im afraid not said andy and he helped jill to a comfortable place on the deck he looked all round searchingly but he could see nobody at all who had taken the sail and the oars someone came along whilst we were up on that high point he said someone who meant to keep us here and the easiest way to keep us was to do something that would make it impossible for us to take the boat home so he removed the sail and the oars if i could just get hold of him jill began to cry again her ankle was hurting her once more and she was longing to get back home and be comforted by her mother she sobbed bitterly andy put his arm round her poor old jill never mind well manage somehoweven if we have to swim home but jill couldnt smile you see she sobbed if i hadnt been such an idiot as to jump down the rocks like that and twist my ankle wed have had plenty of time to get away its all my faultand my ankle hurts againand i feel simply awful you go down into the cabin and lie down said andy mary will put a wet cold bandage on tom and i will talk over things and see what we think is best to do jill managed to get down into the cabin she was glad to lie down on the little bunk there and put her foot up mary wrung a bandage out in cold seawater and wrapped k carefully round the swollen ankle the boys sat up on deck and talked gravely together andy felt that things were serious now weve stumbled on to something that those men wanted to keep secret said andy they chose this lonely forgotten bit of coast for whatever it is they wanted to dosmuggle i suppose and now weve butted in and spoilt their little game theyll be very angry said tom you bet they will said andy its quite clear they dont mean us to get home and talk about it theyll keep us prisoner here till theyve finished their job whatever it is something to do with all those crates and boxes i suppose i wonder whats in them said tom forbidden goods of some kind said andy its very worrying your mother and my father will be very anxious when we dont turn up well they know where weve gone said tom brightening up theyll come and look for us your father will gt your uncles boat and come and see whats happened es sure to come to smugglers rock if he doesn t find us at the cliff of birds yes he will said andy but i bet our captors whoever they are have thought of that theyll deal with that when the time comes how asked tom what do you mean well i mean that if they see dads boat coasting along theyll take steps to see were not about said andy grimly tom looked scared what about our boat he said they cant hide that andy said nothing to that he was silent so long that tom looked up at him to his enormous alarm he saw what looked like one bright tear in the corner of the fisherboys eye he was so alarmed that he caught hold of andys hand andy whatevers the matter why do you look like that andy swallowed and blinked back the unexpected tear well idiot he said trying to speak naturally theyll probably scuttle my boat thats all thats the best way to hide a boat you dont want found i think theyre pretty desperate fellows and they wont stick at sinking a boat if it suits them sink the andy scuttle their beautiful swiftrunning boat tom stared at andy in horror they all loved the boat but andy loved her most of all because he had used her for a long time now and knew all her little ways all the fishermen loved their boats of course but this was andys first boat and a beauty oh andy said tom and couldnt think of anything else to say at all oh andy they said nothing for a few minutes then they heard mary coming up to soak jills bandage again dont tell the girls what were afraid will happen said andy in a low voice no good scaring them before it happens right said tom he managed to give mary a grin as she came up hows jill she says her ankle feels better now her foot is up said mary weve been talking about the oars and the sail tom couldnt we go and look for them we might find them hidden somewhere not very likely said andy it was pretty smart work on the part of the person who came along and saw our boat he went off with them at once i do feel hungry said tom i suppose it isnt time for a meal is it gracious andy ive just thought of something weve brought quite a bit of food with us luckilybut not enough for more than two or three days i hope we shant starve well be rescued long before that said andy seeing marys alarmed face anyway well have something to eat now its about twelve oclock look at the sun they had a good meal and andy and tom kept a lookout all the time in case they saw anyone stealing about but they saw no one we must make up our minds to stay here for a while said andy and i think well remove all the food and rugs and things from the boat tom well find a good littie home somewhere on smugglers rockin a cave or somewhereand make ourselves as comfortable as possible almost as if wed been wrecked said mary feeling suddenly cheerful that sort of thing is fun even if we are in trouble come onlets find a good place chapter a good little home they left jill on deck because her ankle was still painful though very much better she could hobble about now and felt more cheerful she was very disappointed not to be able to go with them and find a good sleepingplace for that night but why cant we sleep on the boat she asked surprised like we did last night the boys did not like to tell her that at any moment they thought somebody might come along and scuttle the boatsink her down to the bottom of the pool so that it was necessary to remove everything to some good place in order not to lose the things on the boat wed be more comfortable i expect if we find a sandy cove sheltered from the wind said andy well keep the boat in sight jill as we go so you neednt be afraid by yourself well be able to see you all the time and youll be able to see us the three of them set off they went over the rugged rocks keeping the andy in sight all the time the boys did not think anyone would go to the boat just then but andy was not going to risk leaving jill completely alone if they kept the boat in sight they could see what was happening at any moment its no good going the way we went this morning up to that high point said andy for one thing the boat is out of sight from there and for another i didnt see a single place where we could get comfort and shelter did you no said tom it all looked jolly hard and windswept and uncomfortable i thought lets go the other waylook is that green grass over there no its cushions of some kind of seashore plant we might find a good spot over there but higher up i reckon that if a storm came the sea would sweep right over these rocks were on now yes it would said andy you can see bits of seaweed here and thereclinging on in the hope of seawater i should think i hope a storm doesnt come that would about finish the andy lying there among those rocks shed be torn from her anchor and smashed to bits wellit doesnt look as if a storm is near said tom not liking this conversation at all its fine today though its cold look andylets climb up here to that broad ledge it looks pretty sheltered there is that a cave behind the ledge they climbed up to the broad ledge of rock keeping the andy well in sight all the time we dont want to go too far from the boat said andy it would be such a fag carrying everything if theres a cave there it would be very convenient there was a caverather an awkward one with a very low roof at the front so that the children had to crawl in almost flat but inside it opened out into a fairly roomy cave with a higher roof it smelt clean and fresh and had a sandy floor which andy was surprised to see this will do he said switching on his torch and looking round we can make the opening bigger by pulling away some of those overhanging tufts of roots and burrowing down in the sand below it will be rather fun lying in the cave and squinting out through that narrow opening at the sea weve got a very fine view said mary and she lay down to peep out i can see the andy from here jills still sitting on deck and look you can see the cliff of birds tooover there in the distanceand make out the channel between the two ridges of rocks we could see anyone coming to rescue us said tom couldnt we andy we could easily see your fathers boat from here we could signal there was a rocky ledge at one side of the cave mary patted it this will do to put our stores on she said and well put our cushions and rugs on the sandy floor we shall be very snug here it would be great funif only mother wouldnt be worried about us this cave will do fine said andy well go back and get our stores come on tomsqueeze out they all squeezed out andy looked up at the top edge of the entrance he began to pull away some of the earth and roots that hung down from above soon he had made the entrance a little bigger that will let more air in he said it might be stuffy at night with four of us in but it will certainly be warm no wind can get in here to make us shiver and shake they went back to the boat pleased that they had found somewhere fairly near they told jill all about it she showed them her ankle its much better she said it feels almost all right now i could help to carry the things up no you cant said andy you rest it as much as you can well take the things up and leave you in charge of the boat whilst we go to and fro they went down into the cabin they collected all the foodand there was quite a lot what a good thing they had stocked the andy so well they staggered off with the food jill got the little oilstove ready for them to take too they would need to boil water for tea or cocoa she put the kettle ready to be taken it was very tiring work carrying the things over the rocks up to the cave there were so many things to take andy did not mean to let anything be lost if the boat were sunk he meant to save all he could rugs cushions fishingtackle the cabin lamp mugs plates everything was stripped from the fishingboat the girls not knowing that the boys were afraid that the boat might be scuttled were astonished to see everything being taken mary thought it was most unnecessary work why do we take so much she grumbled im tired now andy its silly to take everything do as your skipper tells you said tom youre a good one to talk snapped mary it was you who disobeyed andy and got into a mess youre tired mary said andy stop carrying the things and let me finish them go back to jill and see if you can help her part of the way up her foot is so much better that i believe she can manage with just your help by teatime the cave was well stocked mary arranged the food on the rocky ledge there thats our larder she told the boys and this bit is the dresser with the plates and mugs and things at the back here is the kitchen because thats where weve put the stove and the kettle and saucepan the other part is a bedsittingroom because we shall have to live there and sleep there too when jill came up to the cave helped by mary she was delighted she thought it all looked most exciting the only thing was that it was rather dark there and andy did not want to use their torches too much because of wearing out the batteries we could light the cabin lamp said jill theres not a great deal of oil said andy well only light that when its really darkat night we can just manage to see inside the cave if nobody stops up the entrance with his body tom get out of the way youre blocking our daylight i was just having a looksee said tom weve got the andy under our eye all right here if anyone tries any little tricks we can see them i suppose your father will rescue us tomorrow said jill we shall only have a night here its a pity really because its such fun to sleep in a cave and keep having picnics do you suppose the people on this islandthe ones who took our sail and oars and flash those lights at the topdo you suppose they know weve come to this cave said mary i expect so said andy ive no doubt theyve got lookouts posted who see any ship and can watch anyones actions they must have seen us there early this morning down in the cove and been very surprised they couldnt have seen us coming last nightit was too dark how annoyed they must have been to see our boat there said tom weve butted in at just the wrong time for them i guess they were jolly glad when they saw we were only children jill and mary were now getting tea they wondered what to do for water to boil easy said tom there is plenty of rainwater in the hollows of the rocks up hereleft from last weeks rainstorms i should think ill fill your kettle for you from one of the pools right said mary and handed over the kettle tom squeezed out of the cave found a good pool of rainwater quite nearby and filled the kettle soon it was boiling on the oilstove making a nice gurgling sound jill cut some bread and butter and put out a jar of plum jam wed better not have tins of meat or sardines had we she said to andy just in case we arent rescued tomorrow and have to go on living here well want the sardines and meat for dinner then yes said andy we must go slow on the food till we see whats going to happen anyway this is a very nice tea i like plum jam i expect poor old tom could eat a whole loaf but hell have to be content with a few slices have you got tinned milk for tea jill or did we finish it all no ive got plenty said jill as a matter of fact we like spreading it on bread and butter like jam so i brought quite a lot of tins we shall be all right for tea and cocoa pass your mug andy ill fill it even andy worried as he was about what might happen to his beloved boat couldnt help enjoying his tea up there in the cave but soon the cave felt very hot because the oilstove warmed it and the children went and sat out on the ledge in the sunshine it was a very beautiful view spreading before them rocksand seaand more rocksand more seaand sky and clouds and birds making a pattern in the air said jill munching her slice of bread and jam i like looking at things like that when im having a picnic it makes my bread and jam taste nicer things always taste better when you eat them out of doors said mary ive often noticed that look said andy suddenly is that someone coming round the lefthand side of the cove down there seewhere that big rock sticks up yeshes going to the andy lets get back into the cave and watch if he doesnt know where we are weve no need to show ourselves with beating hearts the children squeezed into the cave they lay flat on their tummies and peered down to the cove below they could see a manhe looked like a fisherman and had big seaboots on hes going to the andy whispered tom whats he going to do chapter the hunt for the children hardly breathing the four children watched the man walking over the rocks towards the andy he was a tall burly man very dark and with a black beard do you know him andy whispered tom andy shook his head no he doesnt come from our district lookhes getting into the boat a faint shout came up to the children hes shouting to us to come out said mary he thinks were still there the man stood on the deck waiting but when no one answered him or came up from below he went to the cabin hatch and opened it he looked down and saw no one there he also saw that the boat looked remarkably empty of goods as well as of crew hes found out that weve removed all our things from the boat said andy the man went down into the cabin then he came up again stood on the deck and looked all about as if he expected to be able to see the children somewhere looktheres another man now whispered tom seecoming round the cove where the first one came what a funny little man he was he was bandylegged and walked as though he sat on a horse he had on seaboots and a souwester and a black oilskin that flapped in the wind he was short and squat and he yelled to the other man as he came his voice came faintly on the wind to the children now theyre talking together about our disappearance said tom quite enjoving himself do you think theyll come to find us andy were well hidden here the men talked together the little bandylegged one had a look round the boat and peered down into the cabin it made andy go red with rage to see strangers on his boat he longed to go down and turn them off but if he did that he would give away the hidingplace so he lay still red to his ears and jill put her arm over his shoulder to comfort him she knew what he was feeling andy was so proud of his boat and loved her so much the men separated and went off in different directions it was plain that they were hunting for the hidden children they peeped about down in the cove and occasionally shouted though the children couldnt hear the words shouting to us to come out i suppose said tom as if we would i bet they dont find us the men came up a bit higher and looked all about the rocks there there were one or two places there where the children might have hidden now they could hear what the men shouted to one another where are those brats yelled the bandylegged man wait till i find them wasting my time like this the children layquite quiet they didnt like the look of the bandylegged man at all as he came nearer he had bushy eyebrows that almost hid his eyes and a scar went all the way down one cheek the dark man was goodlooking and spoke with a foreign accent he looked stem as he went about the hunt wed better wriggle back right into the cave said andy if they come any higher they might just catch sight of us so they wriggled back soon they were crouching right at the very back catching a glimpse of the distant sea through the narrow entrance they kept very quiet for they heard the sound of the mens climbing feet coming near theres a cave somewhere about here they heard the bandylegged man call i remember my dog going into it once maybe theyve gone there we will look said the dark man and his steps came nearer the children saw his feet walking past the entrance their hearts almost stopped beating with fright but the feet went right past and out of sight good then they saw the bandy legs of the other man going by too but just as he was passing the legs stopped im sure that cave was here said his rather hoarse voice waitwhats this his foot kicked into the entrance of the cave then he bent down and looked inside finding it very awkward indeed but he could see nothing of course for it was pitchblack inside the cave jill gave a gulp of fright tom dug his fingers into her at once to stop her surely she wasnt going to give them away jill put her hand over her mouth she really hadnt been able to help giving that gulp they cannot be in there said the nearby voice of the dark man no one surely could creep in there look there is a cave higher up maybe they are in that to the childrens enormous relief the bandylegged man moved on they breathed more easily but did not dare to move they heard more shouting and calling and then there was silence is it safe to peep out said tom who was longing to know what was happening no said andy they may be sitting quietly somewhere waiting for us to show ourselves keep still tom they all kept very still and quiet only moving when their arms or legs felt cramped then they heard the voices again the dark man sounded thoroughly impatient and exasperated i tell you bandy it is important that we find these children if anyone comes to look for them they will signal to themand they know too much we must find them it is impossible that they should have hidden themselves away so well you can see for yourself they arent here said the other sounding sulky theyve taken all their things and maybe gone to the other side i hope not said the other man they will fall into trouble there nothey have not gone far bandy they could not carry so many things very far the men were standing near the cave again now the children heard the dark man suddenly give an exclamation look he said whats this spots of oil who could have spilt oil here but those children they took the lamp out of the cabinand the little cookingstove for it wasnt there so maybe it was oil from one of those blow said andy between his teeth he remembered how he had tipped the stove a little bringing it to the cave over a rather difficult rock nearby it looks as if they must be in that cave then after all said the bandy man yes thats oil all right little pests to give us so much trouble ill strike a match and look in the cave hell see us now whispered andy now you leave everything to me you others ill manage this soon the bandy legs were to be seen outside the cave entrance once more then the man knelt down and looked with difficulty into the low groundlevel entrance he struck a match and held its flame inside the entrance he gave a loud cry hey here they are the whole boiling of them lying as quiet as mice in a nest come on out all of you the children said nothing the match went out the man lit another and this time the dark man knelt down and looked into the entrance his head almost on the ground he saw the children too he spoke to them with authority now come out we shant hurt you but we want to see you out of here come along were not coming said andy there was a silence then the bandy man began to lose his temper he spluttered a little and began to yell look here you you thats enough bandy said the dark man he called into the cave how many of you are there four said andy and let me warn you that the first man who wriggles in here will get a blow on the head with the stove thats no way to talk said the dark man after a moments pause were not going to hurt you we want to take you somewhere much more comfortable we couldnt be more comfortable than we are thanks said andy politely are you coming or have i got to come in and get you yelled bandy suddenly come hi if you like said andy if you come in feet first well send you out doublequick with a good shove and if you come in head first were sorry for you weve got the oilstove waiting leave them bandy said the dark man standing up little idiots it will be the worse for them when they do come out we can always get them out when we want to how asked bandy easy enough youll see said the other the children wondered what he meant well well want them out as soon as we sight anything said bandy standing up too better give me your orders chief we can leave them for tonight said the dark man and began to walk away we have other things we can do soon there was silence again it was getting darker in the cave now for the sun had gone and twilight was coming the children lay quite quiet for some time but could hear nothing finally andy crawled to the entrance and peered out cant see down into the cove he said too dark cant see any sign of those men either beasts how do they suppose were going to be got out of here you wouldnt really drop the oilstove on that mans head would you asked jill very horrified at the thought no said andy but i thought the threat might keep them out of here till tomorrow when i hope my dad will come with uncle ned and his boat then well creep out and yell for all were worth thats what those men were afraid well do said tom he yawned i feel sleepy one of us will have to be on guard during the night andy we dont want anyone creeping in to surprise us jill and i will take our turns tonight said mary you two boys hadnt much sleep last night cant we ng up a pile of tins at the entrance so that anyone trying to creep in would knock them over and warn the one on guard jolly good idea mary said andy well do that at once i feel as sleepy as tom does you can have the first watch me the next jill the next and tom the next where are the tins i cant see in this darkness mary lighted the lamp and the cave at once glowed into warm yellow light it seemed cosy and snug in there the children wrapped their rugs round them and put cushions at their heads mary sat bolt upright proud to have the first watch she had built up a pile of tins at the entrance to the cave now no one could get in without being heard at once andy blew out the lamp darkness settled on the cave once more jill put out her hand and took marys ill hold your hand just to keep you company whilst youre watching she whispered good night soon there was silence in the cave except for the peaceful breathing of three sleeping children mary sat tense holding her breath at every sound she did hope that nobody would come whilst she was keeping watch chapter plenty of things happen mary watched and listened until it was time to wake andy she felt quite worn out by the time she had been on guard for two hours they were each keeping guard for the same timetwo hours but it seemed a very long time when everything was dark and still andy had nothing to report when he woke jill jill kept watch for two hours feeling rather sleepy at times but keeping herself awake by reciting softly all the poetry she had ever learnt toms turn came next he was very difficult to wake as usual jill thought she never would wake him but at last she had him sitting up rubbing his eyes youre to wake andy in two hours time and hell take the dawn watch she said he says he doesnt mind hell have had plenty of sleep by then tom couldnt keep his eyes open he rubbed them and nearly yawned his head off then he felt hungry and wondered where the girls had put the chocolate he felt about for andys torch and found it he switched it on and flashed the light on to the little ledge where the food was stored andy was awake immediately the torch flashed on he sat upright with a jerk blinking whats up he said nothing whispered tom i only wanted some chocolate ill never keep awake unless i have something to eat lie down ill wake you when its your turn again he saw the chocolate piled at the end of the ledge he took a bar snapped off the torch and began to tear the paper off the chocolate andy lay down with a grunt and was soon sleeping soundly again nothing happened in toms watch he woke andy just before dawn the boy sat up and saw the first grey light filtering in through the low caveentrance he wriggled there and looked out he could see nothing at all when the sun rose the others awoke jill sat up stretchbig she knew where she was at once but mary couldnt imagine where am i she said sitting up halffrightened only in the cave silly said jill its daylight again golly i feel stiff im a bit cold too i vote we get the stove going and boil some water for cocoa tom was wriggling to the cave entrance to have a breath of fresh air he sniffed eagerly and looked down to the cove below he gave such a loud cry that everyone jumped and mary dropped the match she was about to strike whats up whats the matter they cried our boatits gone it isnt there cried tom look the coves quite empty no boat there at all all four looked down to the cove below it was just as tom had said the boat was gone the andy was no longer there andy looked very miserable he didnt say anything at all tom knew how he was feeling oh andy you dont think those men have sunk her do you he said in a hushed voice surely nobody could do such a wicked thing to a beautiful boat like that andy still said nothing he left the others and went to the back of the cave where he busied himself lighting the stove and putting the kettle on to boil he couldnt bear to think that his lovely boat might be lying far down at the bottom of the water poor andy whispered jill with tears in her eyes isnt it awful tom why should those men sink our boat i suppose so that no one should see it and guess we were here if they came to look for us said tom feeling that the girls ought to know how serious things were you see we have stumbled on some kind of secret and those men dont want us to tell anyone but they know someone will be sure to come hunting for us so theyve sunk our boat and mean to hide us away somewhere so that we cant be foundthen we shant be able to tell what little we know the girls looked scared then jill cheered up but they havent taken us anywhere and when we see andys fathers boat coming well all climb up on to the high rocks above the cave and signal ill take off my vest and wave it kettles boiling came andys voice from the back going to make the cocoa jill jill scrambled back her foot was practically all right again but she blamed herself very much for her accident for if she had not twisted her ankle they might all by now have been safely back at home so she was eager to please andy in every way and show him how sorry she was andy looked very miserable jill didnt say anything to him but she gave his arm a quick squeeze she too felt very gloomy when she thought of the beautiful boat lying on the bottom of the seabut she knew that to andy his boat meant much more than a lovely plaything that was all it really was to the three visitors but to andy the boat was a friend and a comrade dad ought to be along soon said andy as they ate their breakfast when we didnt come home last night as we should have done everyone would get the wind up and be worried dad would start out for the cliff of birds early this morning if he didnt find us there hed come along here we must keep a lookout they finished breakfast andy peered out of the cave i must just slip down to the cove and have a look to see if the poor old andy is at the bottom there he said i wont be long and i wont be caught so dont be afraid but ive just got to go and have a look keep a watch out tom the boy wriggled put of the cave and the others saw him running and skipping like a goat down the steep rocks that sloped to the cove they saw him standing where the andy had been anchored peering down into the water here and there poor old andy this has upset him said jill its awful to lose his boat like that i feel its all my fault too looktheres that bandy man again said tom suddenly and two others with him theyve seen andybut hes seen them too look at him leaping up the rocks oh andy hurry hurry andy was not afraid of being caught by the three men he was far swifter than they were they yelled at him and ran but they were no match at all for the boy he leapt up the rocks and came panting to the cave he wriggled in with plenty of time to spare i dont know if theyve come for us he panted but they wont make us come out i dont see how they can unless they like to risk wriggling in on their tummiesand they are at our mercy then andy did you see the boat asked jill anxiously andy shook his head nothey havent sunk her just there i think they must have token her out to sea a bit and scuttled her in really deep water theres no sign of her down there i suppose they thought your father might spot her lying in the cove at the bottom said tom they must have taken her out in the night and not one of us heard a thing well the cove is a good way off said andy getting back his breath now look outhere come the men there was the dark man with the beard the bandylegged manand one that tom recognized at once looksee the fisherman with the glasses on his nose well thats one of the men i saw in the cave at the cliff of birds how did he get here did the motorboat call for him and take him off hes not the one with hairy legs is hethe man whose legs we saw when he sat above us on the cliff of birds asked jill no hes not here said tom nastylooking collection arent they andy felt desperate he was angered by the disappearance of his boat and quite ready to push any of the men down the rocks if only he could he was anxious too for the girls their mother had put them into his chargeand here they were in the midst of danger andy was quite determined to fight with any weapon he could if the men tried to wriggle into the cave the three came to the cave the dark man called out to them well children are you more sensible this morning are you coming out i advise you to no one said anythingthe man called again impatiently come along nowl no one will hurt you youll be sorry if you dont come out of your own free will we dont want to make you come still no reply there was a short silence and the dark man gave a rapid order set it going bandy bandy set something down by the cave just within the entrance it looked like some sort of can the children couldnt quite make out what it was they watched in silence bandy struck a match and held it to something in the can it flared up bandy seemed to damp it down and instead of flames smoke came out the wind was blowing in their direction and it blew the thick billowing smoke into the cave tom got a smell of it first and he coughed the beasts said andy suddenly theyre trying to smoke us out of the cavelike hunters smoke out wild animals the smoke poured in the children began to cough they choked the smoke was thick and smelt horrid and bitter it was quite harmless but the children didnt know that they felt frightened well have to go out spluttered andy its no good well have to go keep close to me when were out girls and do exactly what i say dont be afraid i dont think for a minute well come to any harm before he went out andy felt along the ledges for the packet of salt he knew was there the others didnt see him and would have been surprised if they had andy tore open the packet and slipped the salt into his pocket he had a little plan for that salt then panting and coughing he crawled out of the cave the girls came next and then tom the men stared at them why theyre only kidsexcept for this fisherboy said bandy interfering little varmints look look andy theres your fathers boat suddenly cried tom and they all swung round sure enough away in the distance was a big fishingboat the one used by andys uncle and his father when they wanted a bigger boat than andys hurrah yelled tom were all right youll have to let us go now theres andys father come on take them away said the dark man theres no time to be lost blindfold them to the childrens great dismay they were each blindfolded with big red handkerchiefs where were they going and why were their eyes bandaged were they going to some secret hideout that no one must know the way to the men pushed them forward roughly and they stumbled over a rocky path not seeing where they went oh wept mary let us wait let us wait for andys father well go home then let us go please let us go but the men pushed them on and when andys father sailed into the cove there was no one to be seen chapter prisoners the four children were pushed along by the men they were afraid of falling but the men guided them over the rough places it seemed to them all as if they were going upwards not on the level how they hoped that andys father would spot them if only he had his fieldglasses andy was doing his best to try and memorize the way as they went along up all the timeto the left first and then fairly straightthen a steep bit up where they had to help usthen to the left again keeping inwards i suppose we are behind big rocks now so that no one can see us from the sea andy was doing something else too that he hoped his captors were not noticing he was dropping little pinches of salt here and there as he went he had made a hole in his pocket and he let out a bit of the salt every now and again he wanted to be able to find his way to the smugglers hidingplace if ever he got free and had the chance to he hoped that he might be able to follow the little trail of salt he was leaving if only it doesnt rain thought the boy if it rains the salt will melt and there wont be any sign of it well i must hope for the best after about ten minutes rough stumbling the men told the children to halt there was a pause andy strained his eyes and then tried to pull off his bandage but he got a hard clip on the ear at once he heard a grating noise that puzzled him then the children were pushed roughly forward again and it seemed darker through their bandages going into the island itselfa cave of some sort or a passage thought andy as the men pushed the children along again they went upwards again and andy cautiously put his hands out to the side of him he felt rocky walls each side yes they were in a passage inside the island at last they all came to a stop youll be safe here for a bit said the jeering voice of the bandylegged man and he stripped off the red handkerchiefs that bound their eyes they blinked they were standing in a highroofed place looking at a big door andy felt something bright at the back of him and swung round he gave a gasp they were in a cave very high up that opened on to the sunlit sea it lay very far below moving slowly there was an absolutely sheer drop down from the cave to the seaa very frightening drop there was a bang as the heavy wooden door behind them shut the children heard bolts being shot into place they were prisonersbut what a strange prison its a big cave with a door at the backand a terribly steep drop down outside said jill peeping out and drawing back very quickly goodnessi shant look out again like that it makes me feel awfully giddy we couldnt possibly get out that way can we see andys fathers boat asked tom almost dazzled by the brightness outside after having his eyes bandaged for so long they all gazed out earnestly but there was nothing to be seen at all except a dangerous treacherous rockstrewn shore where waves battered themselves into foam and spray its said that no one can get beyond a certain point in a boat if they want to sail round the island said andy i dont believe anyone ever has sailed right round it you cant get near the other sideits too dangerous we must be almost on the other side now i should think i doubt if my father could get round as far as this i bet those men knew that then said tom gloomily they knew that we couldnt possibly signal from here because we wouldnt see your fathers boat beasts i hope theyre not going to keep us here long said andy i dont fancy being shut up like this without any food or rugs or anything this is as bad as last years adventure said jill wellalmost as bad the four children sat down in the cave andy got up after a while and went to the door he tried it but of course it was fast shut i knew it would be but i thought id just try said andy i do wonder how long theyll keep us here till my fathers gone home again i suppose and i do wonder too where they sank the poor old andy i hate to think of her at the bottom of the sea with fish swimming in the cabins and crabs getting into the bunks said jill horrid for about three hours nothing happened the children gazed out to sea hoping against hope to see a boat or a ship they could signal to but not one came into sight only the gulls circled and glided nearby calling to one another in their loud voices the children watched them for they had nothing else to do then there came the sound of the door being unbolted they all sat up at once who was it it was bandy he came in carrying a big jug of water and a plate of bread and meat nothing else at all you dont deserve a thing he said in his rather hoarse voice interfering tiresome nuisances you are eat this and be glad of it bandy how long are we to be kept here asked andy and what have you done with my boat sunk her why are you thinking of trying to sail away in her asked bandy with a nasty smile you can give up all hope of that shes sunk all right andy turned away sick at heart he had hoped against hope that his lovely boat wasnt really sunk cant you let us out now asked tom i suppose you shut us up because andys father came cowards do you want a clip on the ear said bandy coming into the cave and glaring at tom shut up tom now said andy its no good provoking him its pretty boring here bandy cant we have something to do and the rock is very hard to sit on serves you right children that come sticking their noses into what isnt their business deserve all they get said bandy who seemed to enjoy being nasty maybe youll be here for weeks ha hahow do you like the thought of that i think bandy if you do a thing like that youll be very sorry for yourself later on when all this is known said andy in a quiet voice youll be severely punished bah said bandy rudely and went out and shut the door bolting it noisily bah they heard him say again outside the food made them feel a little better though the bread was very stale and hard and the meat tasted a bit musty but they did not feel very cheerful as they gazed out through the opening at the sea and the sky thinking that they might be there for weeks jill and mary looked so upset that andy tried to cheer them up he was only being beastly he told them just trying to scare us all hell let us out as soon as my fathers boat has gone away dont you worry girls they saw no sign of andy father that day they did not knew how be and andys uncle sailed up and down and round about looking for the missing boat and the children they did not see them sailing to the cliff of birds and anchoring there to climb the cliff nor did they see them come back again and again to smugglers rock hunting for a cove where they might see the andy towards five oclock when they were all feeling very hungry indeed they heard the bolts of the door being pulled back this time it was the dark man who came in he spoke to them in his deep voice and they heard agaifl his slightly foreign accent and knew that he was not english you can go now the ship that has been hunting for you has given you up and has gone but i warn you that if it is sighted again you will once more have to come here to this cave where you will be imprisoned until the boat has once again gone we shall have to be set free of the island some time said andy why all this mystery and fuss what are you doing that you want to hide children shouldnt ask dangerous questions said the man and his eyes gleamed angrily when we have finished here you shall go but not till then you will now be blindfolded once again and taken down to the rocks you know so once again the red handkerchiefs were tied tightly round the childrens eyes and bandy and the dark man took them out of the cave downwards they went and then came out into the open air they were taken some way farther over the rocks and then the bandages were stripped off their eyes they blinked were near the cove said tom good lets go up to our cave and get a meal im jolly hungry andy watched to see which way the men went they rounded a corner of steep rocks and were soon out of sight if only i knew where they went and what they do he said in a low voice what is going on here wellill find the way into the heart of the island and discover whats going on before im much older but how can you said tom we were blindfolded wed never find the way im going to look for it said andy but not till weve had something to eat i want those men to get well out of the way first they went to their cave it seemed almost like coming home to squeeze in at the narrow entrance jill and mary were full of delight to be there again they looked at their larder hungrily what shall we have i think well go a splash and have something good said jill what about a tin of tongueand shall we hot up a tin of peas to go with it weve got just one and have a tin of pineapple chunks afterwards with condensed milk said mary and well make cocoa toolots of it well for goodness sake hurry up about it said tom im hungrier than ever when i hear you talk like that they had a most delicious meal and ate every single thing they had prepared for it and drank the last drop from the cocoa jug as mary put back the mugs she missed the packet of salt wheres the salt gone she said in surprise i took it said andy and ill tell you why i made a hole in my pocket and as we went blindfolded on our way this morning i kept dropping out pinches of saltso you see i ought to be able to find the way into the depths of the island by following my trail of salt oh andywhat a marvellous idea said tom lets go now and see if we can find the trail come on do lets i do think that was a clever thing to do well go and spy on those men this very evening chapter a trail to follow tom jill and mary thought it was very exciting to have a salt trail to follow now well be able to get inside the island and see what the men are doing said mary squeezing out of the cave entrance come on lets all go now my goodness wed better hurry look at those black clouds andy looked at them in alarm they were rainclouds blow blow blow he said are you talking to the wind or just being annoyed asked jill im being annoyed said andy as he felt the first drop of rain on his cheek the rain will melt all my trail of salt isnt that enough to make anyone annoyed well lets buck up then before it begins to pour said tom and they scuttled down the rocks they found a pinch of salt on a rock and exclaimed at it heres one we passed by here and theres another come on we can easily spot the white grains they followed the salt trail for a little way up the rocks and round to the left then the rain came down properly and in a trice the salt had disappeared andy looked very gloomy just my luck why didnt i follow the trail straightaway without stopping to have a meal and why didnt i think of something more sensible than salt but i was in such a hurry and it was the only thing that came into my mind blow never mind andy said jill it was an awfully good idea id never have thought of it at all wellcouldnt we do it again if those men take us off to the highup cave another time asked tom i bet your father wont give up hunting for us yet andy i bet hell be along again tomorrow if so those men wfll shut us up again bandy said they would yes theres a chance dad might sail this way again tomorrow said andy he might even bring out some of his friends in their boats to search all round we could try out my idea again but not with salt said jill thats too easy to meltor it might be blown away if it falls in a windswept place lets think of something else it must be something the men dont notice said mary what can it be nobody could think of anything for some time then tom had a brainwave i know do you remember seeing those little pink shells down in the cove well what about gathering up those filling our pockets with them no one would notice shells here and theretheyre so usual by the sea we could all drop one now and again as we go and there would be a lovely trail to follow yesand one that wouldnt melt away if it rained said jill good idea young tom said andy well do that we could collect them nowthen wed have them ready in case the men took us off to that cave again tomorrow so they all hunted for the little pink shells in the cove and found dozens of them they put them into their pockets it wouldnt matter in the least if the men searched their pockets and found the shellsbecause children always did collect them tom felt very pleased with his idea it grew dark better go back to our cave said andy well light the lamp and have a cosy evening its rather cold now too we got a bit wet in that squall of rain though it didnt last long it will be nice to be warm and dryand well make some tea and have biscuits for supperif tom hasnt eaten them all yet of course i havent said tom indignantly ive had just the same number as you they went up to their cave and squeezed in andy lighted the lamp and the stove too so that they could boil the kettle he had filled it with rainwater which most conveniently lay in a nearby hollow not far from the cave the cave certainly looked very cosy and was soon warm and stuffy but the children didnt mind that for they were cold and wet this is nice said jill pulling a rug round her i know horrid things have happened and i hate to think of people being worried about usbut i cant help enjoying being in this cosy cave and feeling warm and dry and having ginger biscuits to nibble everyone felt the same though andy looked rather stern and thoughtful jill knew he was always thinking of his lost boat he seemed to have lost his ready smiles and jokes now she gave him an extra biscuit because she felt sorry for him they slept well that night in the cave and no one kept watch because there didnt seem to be any need to they didnt feel that the men would really harm them and they all wanted a good nights sleep so they slept soundly and nothing disturbed them they woke when the sun was quite high and andy was surprised were late this morning he said im going to rinse my face and hands in that pool over therei feel messy they all did the same jill produced a comb and they made their hair tidy they had begun to look like little savages mary said they had a rather poor breakfast of stale bread and butter and jam but they did not like to open any more of their precious tins in case the men were mean with food they hadnt much liked the bread and meat they had had the day before andy the men are coming again said tom suddenly he was sitting outside on the ledge and oh golly look over there onetwo threefourfive fishingboats my word your fathers got half the fleet out to look for us lets signal quick cried andy but the boats were too far away to see them and at the same moment the men came up to the cave they were the same three as before with red handkerchiefs dangling ready in their hands to blindfold the children remember the shells said andy in a low voice come out all of you said the dark mans voice tom had scrambled back so they were all in the cave now well go out without making a fuss said andy to the others we dont want to be smoked out again that was horrid i coughed all day and so did the rest of you they squeezed out of the cave and stood up the men blindfolded them quickly then once more they were pushed along the rocks and made their staggering stumbling way as before again they went to the left and upwards and again they came to a standstill and heard the curious grating sound then they were pushed into a darker place and knew they were inside the rocky hill before long they were in the same cave as before looking out to sea from a great height and heard the wooden door being bolted behind them i dropped my began jill in an eager voice and broke off with a groan as tom and andy gave her sharp digs with their fingers dont what did you do that for andy nodded his head towards the door you dont know if any of them are behind listening to what we may say he whispered dont say a thing till i nod my head at you they all stayed silent for a while then when andy was certain their captors had gone he nodded his head but speak low all the same he said i dropped my shells all the way whispered jill i havent a single one left they just gave out when we got here ive dropped all mine too said mary i was so afraid the men would notice did you drop yours tom of course said tom i kept hearing mine drop too and thinking the men would notice youve got very sharp ears said andy nobody else would hear those tiny shells dropping ive got about four left i was afraid id drop them all before i came to the place and that would be sickening well we seem to have done all right between us said tom in the same whisper that everyone was using we ought to be able to track down the trail here easily enough we could get inside the hill then and snoop round and find out a lot i think well have to do it at night said andy the men will be about in the daytimebut at night i imagine they sleepexcept the man who flashes that light at the top of the hill ooohat night said jill rather scared i wouldnt like that well only tom and i will go said andy we will leave you cosily asleep in the cave and get back to you before dawn well take your torches toothen we shall have plenty of light i wonder if those fishingboats are sailing all round and about looking for signs of us everywhere said tom i wish we had left something about so that if they landed on the island they would see it and know we were here id thought of that said andy but you may be sure the men would remove every single thing that might tell we were here dad wont find anything hell have to go back again today with all the others and report that theres nothing to be found i wish we could send some message to your mother shell be so anxious yes she will said jill shell never never let us go out alone with you in a boat again andy last year we got wrecked in a storm and had a tremendous adventure for weeksand this year weve got caught by smugglersif they are smugglers well we couldnt help it said andy how were we to know that there was all this going on in the cliff of birds and smugglers rock once more dry bread and meat was presented to the children by bandy this time it was ham which tasted a lot nicer then sooner than the day before they were set free but they were blindfolded just the same and led stumbling and unsteady to the rocks above the cove i think your friends will now give up the search for you said the dark man in rather a nasty voice so you will be free to roam on the island but you will find that steep sheer rocks make it impossible for you to get round to the other side so do not try you may fall and be hurtand if so we shall not help you what kind people you are remarked andy bandy looked as if he would like to box his ears but he didnt the men went off and left them alone jill ran a little way up the rocks as soon as they were out of sight she came back her face pink with excitement our trail of shells is there quite easy to see youll be able to follow them well tom and andy they stretch up over the rocks said jill i can make out the trail for quite a long way well i hope the men dont spot it then said andy well do a bit of tracking tonight tom it will be most exciting chapter a queer midnight journey the boys thought they would not start following the trail till about midnight then they could be fairly certain that the men would be asleep they decided to try and go to sleep themselves for a few hours first so that they would not be too tired ill keep awake for you and wake you at midnight if you like said jill ive got a watch if i have the lamp on i know i shall keep awake no its all right i shall wake at midnight said andy who was one of the clever people able to wake himself at any time he planned we can all go to sleep so they cuddled up in their rugs put their heads down on the cushions they had brought from the boats and were soon asleep and dreaming at midnight just as he had said he would andy awoke he sat up and switched on his torch almost twelve oclock he shook tom hard and woke him oooh said tom and woke with a jump sh dont wake the girls whispered andy its time for us to go buck up give me jills torch whispered tom you know mines no use i must have a torch andy handed him one then the boys squeezed out of the cave and stood on the windy hill it was cold and dark clouds covered the night sky now to pick up the trail said andy and shone his torch cautiously down shading it with his fingers so as not to show too much light they soon picked up the trail of pink shells which gleamed brightly in the torchlight the boys made their way over the rocks following the shells easily there was one bit where the trail broke and they went wrong but they soon came back to the trail and found the right way we must all have stopped dropping shells at the same moment said tom thinking it was queer to find such a gap but it wasnt much of a gap come on they went on and on round to the left and upwards then the trail of shells suddenly stopped this is where we must have gone inside said andy and he shone his torch on the rocks that towered beside him just there but there was no way in at all the wall of rock stood there unbroken there was no entrance into the hill funny said andy perhaps the trail goes on after all perhaps weve come to a gap again where none of us threw down shells ill go on and see you stay here and shine your torch out now and again so that i shall know where to come back to if i cant find any more shells he soon came back theres no more to be seen he said this must be where we went in but how in the world can anyone walk through solid rock he shone his torch on the rocky wall again he discovered a crack of about an inch wide that seemed to go inside the hill funny said andy and shone his torch up and down the crack look tomthis crack seems the only way into the hillbut how could anyone squeeze through a crack like that we certainly didnt the boys tried to find some other place to get hi but there was none they were forced to come back to the same place once more andy remembered something do you remember the funny noise we heard he asked tom sort of grating noise i wonder if by any chance this rock movesyou know like the stone moved in the open sesame cave in the tale of all baba and the forty thieves but how could we move a heavy rocky wall like that said tom andy went to the crack again he shone his torch down it then he shone his torch above and belowand he found something on a ledge below that made bun almost shout look toman iron bar put there to use as a lever i shouldnt wonder well ill try he picked up the strong iron bar and slipped it into the crack he and tom pressed hardand lo and behold part of the rock slipped aside with a curious grating noise it was evidently balanced so finely on its base that it could be moved almost at a touch when it was open the boys saw the dark entrance into the hill andy shone his torch in it looked rather frightening wellwho would have thought of a way in like that said andy in a whisper i feel like ali baba now dont lets try and shut the rock behind us in case we cant open it from the inside we dont want to make ourselves prisoners they left the rock as it was put down the iron bar and went inside the hill a long tunnel yawned in front of them after they had followed it for some way it split in two one tunnel then went upwards and the other downwards which should they follow up i think said andy the upgoing one may lead us to the light at the top of the island and we could have a good look at it the boys crept on up the tunnel using their torches but switching them off at once if they thought they heard anything but the inside of the rocky hill was dark and silent it was weird to be there in the middle of the night not knowing what they might see or hear the tunnel split into two again one tunnel ran on the level and the other still went up andy and tom went along the level one to see what they could find they came to a strong wooden door with bolts and a lock i bet this is the door of the cave those men shut us in today and yesterday said andy well see shall we cautiously they opened the door yesit was the very same cave they retraced their steps and joined the tunnel that went on upwards they suddenly saw a light shining somewhere in front of them quiet hissed andy stand still and listen but there was nothing at all to be heard so they went cautiously on towards the light they came into an enormous cave lighted by a great ships lantern that swung from an iron hook in the rocky roof this cave was furnished most comfortably with two or three mattresses a table chairs and cupboards in which stores were evidently kept a stove was burning with a kettle boiling away on top on the table was set a meala very good meal too which made tom feel very hungry indeed the pink slices of ham lay on a dish and a jar of tongue had been opened nearby a rich dark plumcake stood on a plate and a tin of peaches had been opened look at that said tom his mouth watering i really must have a slice of that ham be careful the meal is set for someone and the kettle boiling so that the man its meant for cant be far away whispered andy hell be back soon we dont want to be caught cant we just nip in and get some of the ham begged tom theres time well quick then said andy he nipped in with tom the boys snatched four slices of the ham and a half loaf of bread andy cut an enormous slice of the cake they stuffed everything into their pockets they were just about to run out of the cave into the tunnel when they heard someone coming the someone sang as he came a seashanty it was bandys hoarse voice quick hide said andy looking round into that chest quick they lifted the lid of an enormous chest and got inside it putting the lid down quietly just as bandy came into the lighted cave he came in singing lustily and took the kettle off the stove he made himself some tea and then sat down to the table he stared at the ham look at that wheres half the ham gone and wheres my bread if that greedy pig of a stumpy has come in here and taken my supper again ill knock him down bandy growled and muttered then he saw that someone had cut a huge slice of the plumcake and he rose to his feet in anger my cake too ill teach him ill box his ears till he cant tell if hes standing up or sitting down illill he disappeared out of the cave taking the tunnel that led downwards andy and tom badly wanted to laugh poor stumpy he would deny till he was black in the face that he had taken bandys supper but bandy wouldnt believe him lets get out of here whilst weve got the chance said andy walking out wed better go on upwards or we shall run into bandy come on tom tom stopped to snatch a few more bits of ham and another piece of cake then he ran after andy into the tunnel again upwards they went wondering where they would come to they had to use their torches again presently there were rough steps cut in a steep upward passage it seemed as if they were never coming to an end tom gave a huge pant and sat down andy i must have a rest i simply must those steps are so steep andy sat down beside him panting too he switched off his torch he smiled in the darkness to think of bandy going off to accuse stumpy whoever he might be of taking his supper the ham bread and cake were now safely disposed of and both boys felt very satisfied they got up after a rest and continued on their way suddenly the steps stopped and they came out on to a kind of platform the wind swept suddenly and viciously on them were on the top of smugglers rock the very topwhere that light was flashed from cried andy my isnt the wind fierce lookheres the enormous lamp that must have flashed those signals said tom and he flashed his torch on to a great lamp which was of course not now lighted see andythe beams from this would flash a long wayto ships far out waiting to come in with smuggled goods my word said andy thats just about right were very high up here ships many miles away could catch these signals suddenly he clutched toms arm listenarent those footstepsand whistling again perhaps bandy is coming up to signal hop under the platform that the lamps on we may not be seen at all they crept under the wooden platform on which the great lamp stood then bandy came and began to do something to the lamp in a minute or two brilliant flashes lit up the night the lamp was signalling to someone bandy signalled for ten minutes then he turned out the light in some way and went down the steps again the boys didnt dare to follow they went down a few steps found a rough hidden corner in the rocky wall and lay down there in a few moments they were asleep they awoke at dawn stiff and shivering cross at having been to sleep andy went on to the windy platform and looked all roundwhat a perfectly marvellous view why he could see all round the rocky island he looked down on the side he had never seen beforeand gave a low cry look tomlook down there whatever do you make of that chapter more discoveries the two boys gazed down far far down to where the sea gleamed in the early sunlight they saw a blue harbour an almost round cove protected on all sides by steep rugged rocks at first it seemed as if there was no outlet to the sea itself at allthe harbour looked more like an inland lake it was full of motorboats some large some small they lay at rest all but one which was just making its way cautiously into the cove through so narrow an opening that the boys could scarcely make it out from where they were look at that said andy whoever would dream there was this cove this natural harbour the other side of the island no one can see it from the other sideand i imagine that unless you know your way among those farflung rocks stretching out there for miles youd never find your way in here well welli must say its a nice little smugglers haunt the motorboats looked like toys from where the boys stood they were very high up indeed the strong wind almost blew their heads off their shoulders they could see for miles and miles round the island on every side no wonder the smugglers knew when my father was coming said andy they could sight his boat miles away i wonder if they sighted ours when we went to the cliff of birds they did the second time said tom thats why they sent out that motorboat to stop us youre right said andy my wordwhat a huge smuggling business this must beall those motorboats i suppose they send them out to ships lying at anchor some miles awayships that have seen this signaland take off their goods to bring them here in safety this is a wonderful hidingplace where do they smuggle the goods to said tom and why do they smuggle them to save paying duty on them i suppose they get them into the country this way but how do they get them away from here theres no road overland even from the cliff of birds its a puzzle said andy if only we could escape and report all this do you remember i told you about all those boxes and crates in that cave in the cliff of birds said tom how do you suppose they get them there from here andy couldnt answer him the two boys stood looking out at the magnificent view for some time watching the motorboats at rest and seeing men unload the motorboat that had just come slipping through the narrow opening i bet that boat went out last night to whatever ship bandy was signalling to with his lamp said andy i just bet that motorboat was loaded up miles out to sea and slipped back here whilst it was still not dawn she just got in in time they must have men who know these rocks like a book said tom i wouldnt care to chug through them i think wed better get back to the girls said andy theyll be longing to know all weve seen if only we could get back home they turned to go down the steps it was dark down there but they did not like to switch on their torches now in case bandy was about and spotted them so they made their way down cautiously feeling for the steps with their feet and taking rather a long time to get down be careful were getting near to that big caveroom where we took the ham and cake from whispered andy they came to the big cave it was still lighted by the big ships lantern swinging from the roof quietly andy slid his head in to see if bandy was there he could hear him as well as see him the little bandylegged man was lying on one of the mattresses flat on his back fast asleep his mouth was open and he was snoring loudly theres no one else there said tom looking round quickly but he hasnt finished that tongue or the peaches andy lets get them nohe might wake up said andy palling tom back he wont hes snoring hard said tom come on lets get the stuff we havent had any breakfast he and andy stole quickly into the huge cave they snatched up the dish of peaches and the dish of tongue as they turned to go bandy gave such an enormous snore that he made tom jump the boy tripped over an uneven piece of rocky floor and fell headlong the glass dish he was carrying smashed to pieces and both tom and andy were covered with juice fathead hissed andy and dragged him up they tore to the passage but bandy was wide awake now and sitting up he ydled loudly what you come back again to steal my food stumpy after the lamming i gave you last night too you greedy fellow you pig you run he thought we were the fellow that he went and lammed last night gasped andy run well hide somewhere before he catches us bandy was really on the warpath this time to think that stumpy was taking his food again hed teach him hed catch stumpy and knock his stupid head against the wall hed the boys fled down and down they passed the forking tunnel that led to the cave where they had twice been bolted in they tore on down hoping soon to get to the place where the tunnel split in two one part going down and the other going back to the place where they had entered the hill by way of the moving rock once we get to that forking of the tunnel well be all right panted andy we can slip out of the entrance there and make our way back to the girls they came to it at last and ran along it to get out into the sunshine but when they got to the end of that passage the big rock had been slid back into place again there was no way out blow how do we move it from this side to open wondered andy he pushed and pulled and shoved but the rock would not move there seemed to be nothing at all that the boys could find to use as a lever this time either the rock was fast shut somebodys been along here found the rock entrance open and shut it said andy at last its no good we cant open it well we cant go back up the tunnel to bandys room said tom hed be sure to catch us sooner or later lets go to where the tunnel forks and take the downward path this time said andy well see where it leads to it might perhaps take us out another way its no good us staying here to be caught like rats in a trap so back they went once more listening cautiosly for bandy they took the downward way at the forking of the tunnel and made their way along dark musty passages winding here and there these passages must be right in the heart of the hill like the tunnel in the cliff of birds said tom listenwhats that it was the sound of a quarrel the boys crept nearer to the shouts its bandy going for stumpy again said andy poor stumpy we do seem to be getting him into trouble out of the tunnel another cave opened rather like the one above which was apparently bandys this one however was smaller and not so well furnished in it bandy and stumpy were quarrelling the cave was not very well lighted and the boys felt certain they could not be seen as they stopped in the dark passage to peep in for a moment whystumpy is the hairylegged man whispered tom see his bare hairy legs and enormous feet hes the one that swung his legs above us that dayand i saw him again in the cave down at the foot of the cliff of birds with the other man too there was a fine old fight going on in stumpys cave roaring and shouting and yelling chasing round and dodging the boys wished they could stop and watch for the sight was rather comical but they thought the chance of slipping by unnoticed was too good not to be taken and they dodged quickly past the entrance of the cave neither of the men saw them and now the tunnel dipped very steeply indeed and went downwards for a long way into the very depths of the earth said tom in a hollow voice that quite startled andy the walls of the rocky tunnel suddenly began to gleam in a queer way phosphorescence said andy isnt it curious tom most unearthly lets go back said tom suddenly i dont like this at all and i dont like that funny noise right over our heads either andy had noticed a queer noise tooboom boom boom booooooom what can it be he wondered no tom we cant go back now after coming all this way well come out somewhere soon we must if only this tunnel would go upwards again its gone down so deep they went on again between the wide gleaming walls there was plenty of room in this passageroom for three men to walk abreast if need beand the roof was well above their heads they walked on using their torches and feeling very tired of the long dark way andy was puzzled smugglers rock was not a big island they could have walked right through it by now where were they going he suddenly stopped and clutched toms arm tom jumped violently dont do that he said whats up tomi know where we areand i know what that noise is said andy in an excited voice what is it said tom looking at him startled its the sea we can hearabove our heads said andy above our heads said tom looking up as if he expected to see waves breaking over him what do you mean were under the rocky floor of the sea said andy in a loud voice were in an underground tunnel right under the sea itselfand i bet i know where it leads to it goes to the cliff of birds tom gaped he was so astonished that he couldnt say a word he stared at andy and listened to the dull muffled boom above him yesit must be waves pounding away up there far above their heads tom hoped the floor of the sea was good and strong it wasnt nice to think of all that water away up there thats why that tunnel sloped so steeply said andy it goes right under the sea we must be a good way under by nowbut i dont know how far we are from the cliff of birds i suppose well get there sooner or later now we know how the smugglers take their goods thereand store them in that cave you saw there they carry them here under the sea itself come on said tom in excitement come onlets see where this leads toquick chapter an unexpected find the two boys went eagerly forward along the strange tunnel it was so wide that it could have taken two traintracks no wonder the smugglers could so easily carry goods from smugglers rock to the cliff of birds boom boom boooooom the restless sea went on pounding away overhead i hope said tom that there isnt a leak in any of the rocks in the roof of this queer undersea tunnel it would be awful to think of the sea pouring in dont be silly this tunnel must have existed for years said andy theres no reason why it should suddenly spring a leak were all right i suppose we are really said tom blow my torch is giving out well ive got twomine which im using and jills said andy i gave you marys well make do with just mine now because we may need jills torch later on if mine gives out walk close to me my word dont these walls and roof gleam its a weird tunnel it must have been used in the olden days quite a lot i wonder who first found it and went along it said tom stumbling over an uneven piece here shine your torch more downwards andy i cant see where im going they went on for a long while andy tried to reckon out how long a tunnel would be that stretched between the cliff of birds and smugglers rock surely they must be nearing the end of it now listenthat booming noise isnt nearly so loud said tom suddenly stopping andy listen youre right said andy well that can only mean one thingwere out from under the sea nowmaybe under the cliff of birds you know andyi think we shall probably come up into that cave where i saw all those boxes and crates stored said tom thinking hard when i was there i saw stumpy and the fisherman with glasses disappear down a hole in the floor of the caveand i bet that hole led down into this tunnel i should think youre right said andy come on well soon see its nice not to hear the sea booming overhead any more it wasnt a very pleasant sound it made me feel a bit queer me too said tom i felt as if i was walking along some kind of unpleasant dream on they went again the passage was still very wide indeed and grew even wider as they stumbled forward then andys torch flashed on more stores the tunnel had now widened into what looked like a big underground hall it was lined with hurriedly piled cases of all kinds andy went over to them curiously and shone his torch on them maybe theyre brandy he said i know thats smuggled in sometimes each case has got some sort of scribbled letters or numbers on look at all those green ones too heres one half broken said tom bring the torch over we might be able to see whats inside soon the torch was flashing on to the halfbroken case the boys pulled out handfuls of straw packing and padding material then andy gave a long low whistle and stood staring in astonishment tom looked at him impatiently what is it do you know whats inside yeslook heresee that shining barrel there are guns hereand revolvers too i expect and ammunition in those green boxes over there i bet im right my wordthis is more than smuggling what is it then said tom in a whisper i dont understand nor do i yet said andy i only know that those men are bringing in thousands of gunsand ammunitionand sending them from here somewhere elseeither to sell to countries who are not allowed to have these things or to use against our own country in some way its a plot of some sorta dangerous plot too which might mean peril to our land and people in some way my goodness meno wonder those men sank our boat kept us prisoner and did all they could to prevent my father from finding us tom felt scared they wont hurt the two girls will they he said thinking of jill and mary left alone in the cave i dont think so said andy what are we to do what can we do we ought somehow to get back and report this strange findand we ought to get back to jill and mary and look after them but how are we to do either tom sat down on a box things were happening a bit too fast he looked fearfully round the great underground storehouse guns guns by the thousand gunpowder too perhaps ammunition waiting to be used in wicked ways by wicked people he shivered andy sat down beside him to think the fisherboy looked worried he wished he was grownup grownups always seemed to know the right thing to do and they could do it but he didnt know what was the right or best thing and even if he did how could he do it the thing is he said out loud is it bfest to go back and try and get out on smugglers rock and find the girlsor is it best to go on and make our way into the cliff of birds perhaps that would be best because we could go up the tunnel there that leads to the waterfall tom and maybe climb out of the opening there into the daylight and wait to see if my father comes hunting for us again then we could signal yesthats a jolly good idea said tom the men couldnt possibly guess we have found the undersea tunnel and come to the cliff of birds why they may not even know we are not with the girls if they dont go snooping round our cave we could wait our chance and signal from the cliff of birds it sounds all right said andy rather gloomily but i doubt if my father will come again todayhes becn two days running and found nothing maybe theyll all be off searching other places now still it really is the only thing we can do said tom getting up come on well go right on now shall we wed better be careful though because we might run up against one of the men in the cliff of birds so they left the underground hall behind them and made their way cautiously onwards again the tunnel narrowed after a little while and became more as it had been beforea wide rocky passage with a high roof it ran upwards suddenly i bet its leading to that cave whispered tom dont make a row and shade your torch with your hand andy moving very quietly now the two boys went on the passage suddenly came to a very abrupt end a rocky wall barred their way a blind end said andy feeling up and down it with his hands blow what does this mean it didnt seem to mean anything except that the passage had ended they could go no farther at all andy gave a huge sigh he was exhausted now with his long stumbling walk and it seemed the last straw that they should not be able to find a way out he sat down suddenly and tom fell beside him his legs shaking with tiredness its no good said andy i cant go back im tired out were beaten tom felt the same but after a short rest andy felt more cheerful he flashed his torch round again and then suddenly turned it upwards shining it above his head he gave a cry and clutched toms arm lookwhat idiots we are theres the way outabove our heads a big hole in the roof of course tom gazed up and saw a big round hole in the roof of the suddenlyended tunnel he gave a gasp of course andy didnt i tell you those two men disappeared down a hole in the floor of their cave wellthats the hole i bet its got to lead somewhere and it led down to this passage why didnt we flash our torch upwards before both boys immediately felt better so much better in fact that they both leapt up and were prepared to go on for miles again if need be andy tried to see how to climb up but there was no sign of steps or footholds of any kind whats thattwisted round something there whispered tom suddenly andy shone his torch he saw a rope caught round an iron staple driven into the rock the rope was as dark as the rock and neither of the boys had noticed it before they had been looking for steps cut out or for iron footholds thats itthats the way to get up and down whispered andy well go up right away i dont imagine theres anybody in the cave above or we should see a light of some sort ill go first tom hold the torch for me tom took the torch his hand was trembling with excitement and relief so the light was rather shaky andy untwisted the rope and took hold of it it was firm and strong the fisherboy went up it like a monkey he was used to ropes he found himself in the darkness he had no idea where he was once he had climbed up out of the hole he looked down and saw toms anxious face in the light of the torch throw up the torch he said careful now thats it now ill shine it down for you catch hold of the rope come on tom climbed up the rope too and andy gave him a helping hand at the top they stood up and looked round by the light of their torch yesthis is the cave i told you aboutthe one with the storeswhere the underground river rushes nearby said tom good thing theres no one here andy flashed his torch at the piles of boxes those are foodstores he said see theres a box halfunpacked lookfull of tinned food to feed all the men who help in this unlawful work my word whoever planned this planned it very thoroughly i suppose this food goes to feed all the crews of those motorboats ill show you where the underground river flows said tom and dragged him behind the pile of boxes at one side of the cave he showed him the hole beyond which the dark river rushed in its narrow tunnel thats where i jumped in said tom wellwe wont go that way said andy its a bit too dangerous for my liking well go up not down tomup that twisting tunnel you found that leads to the waterfall openingand well hope the torrent of water will be small enough today for us to creep out of the opening and then well wait on the cliff and signal said tom well soon be rescued come on andyinto the tunnel we go chapter andy gets a real surprise andy and tom left the storecave behind and went into the tunnel that led upwards tom was sure he knew the way he remembered how he had first found his way into ithe had squeezed through the waterfall entrance found himself in a big cave gone into the next cave and found steps leading upwards and from there had found his way down the twisting tunnel to the storecave they had just left yes he knew the way all right there was no chance of making a mistake anyway because as far as he remembered there had only been the one tunnel to follow it hadnt kept forking into two as the tunnel had in smugglers rock so flashing their torches in front of them the boys began the long tiring pull upwards it seemed much longer to tom than it had been before well its because it goes up this time not down said andy who was panting too it must be much easier going down it than up my what a climb after a tune tom stopped in surprise he shone his torch in front of him and stared puzzled why andy lookthe passage splits into two here after alland i felt sure it didnt i felt sure there was only the one way to follow blow i cant have noticed it when i came down andy examined the fork of the tunnel noyou wouldnt notice it he said youd come round that dark cornerseeand wouldnt see there was another way leading off here because of that juttingout rockand youd just go on down without noticing it come on but andy waitim not at all sure which passage i came down in said tom i might have come by either and not noticed the other one oh which one did i take well reallyi should have thought you would have known that said andy rather unfairly for the two tunnels looked exactly alike in the darkness tom didnt know he stood and stared at them both wondering which was the right one well it doesnt really matter said andy at last well take the righthand one and hope for the best if it doesnt lead out on the cliff we can easily go back and take the other one yes we could said tom relieved come on then lets take this one it may be the right one i have a feeling it is but his feeling was wrong it was most decidedly the wrong one it twisted and turned much more than the right one had and tom soon was quite certain they were wrong better go back he said im sure this isnt right well i wonder where it leads to then said andy puzzled its going upwards do you think it leads to the top of the cliffor goes to the other side of the shallow bay where we once anchored the andy it must come to an end soon i should think we might as well just see what happens so they went on and were soon rewarded by seeing what they thought must be daylight shining far ahead and sure enough it was the passage suddenly came out from a deep cleft in the high cliff and there below them was the sea crashing over the rocks that studded that coast for miles on end they sniffed the fresh air in delight after the mustiness of the tunnel it was delicious it was lovely too to feel the clean cool wind on their faces they sat down on the ledge scaring away half a dozen indignant nestingbirds the disturbed eggs rolled round and round in a circle but fortunately did not drop off the ledge now if we just had something to eat said tom he put his hand into his pocket and to his great delight found a piece of ham and a halfpiece of cake the boys shared his find together hungrily wishing there was more we are higher up than we were before when we were on the waterfall ledge said andy i wonder where we are exactly were not right at the top of the cliff i think weve gone beyond the cliff of birds and are now on a ledge the other side lets lean over the ledge and see if the cove we anchored in is down below us or not i dont think it is well you look down said tom its a bit too high up even for me i shall feel giddy if i lean over the ledge at this height hold my legs and ill go to the edge and put my head over said andy he lay down flat on his tummy and worked himself to the edge of the sharp ledge tom laid hold of his ankles and held them firmly andy looked down miles below as it seemed the sea moved silently and slowly towards the cliff the boys were too high up to hear any sound of the sea at all it was queer to look down and see so far below andys eyes swept the coastline just there it was as he had thoughtthey were no longer above the cove where they had once anchored the andy they must be farther round the coast the boys eyes examined the shore below closelyand then he saw something that made him stare so hard that his eyes blurred and he couldnt see hold me fast tom hold me he cried im going to wriggle a bit farther forwardi must see whats exactly below us miles down hold me tight tom tightened his grip of andys sturdy ankles as the boy hung himself a bit farther over the ledge the better to see what was below he stared he stared in silence for so long that tom got impatient what is it he said im tired of hanging on to you what can you see andy couldnt believe what he saw he shut his eyes and then opened them again yes it was still there how very extraordinaryand how very very marvellous he slid back on his tummy and sat up his face happy and glowing his eyes shone so brightly that tom was startled andywhats up he said tom do you know whats down therehidden in a little channel of water in a fold of the cliff itself said andy in a voice that shook with excitement youll never guess never what cried tom our boat yelled andy and beat on the rocky ledge with his hands our boatthe andyl but shes sunk said tom thinking that andy must be mad you know she is i know sfae isntl said andy wouldnt i know my own boat that ive sailed in scores of times those men were telling lies to us they havent sunk the andyl theyve got her down there hidden in a fold of the rocksoh a very very clever hidingplace indeed i dont believe anyone could possibly spot her from the sea she could only be spotted from just up here but andyoh andy it cant be said tom a ridiculous tear spurting out from the corner of one eye i was sure she was sunk what a mercy we took the wrong passage and got up here we wouldnt have known about her if we hadnt would we how simply absolutely marvellous want to see her said andy want to have a peep at our dear old boat she hasnt got her sail up but i knew it was her i nearly fell over when i first spotted her good thing you were holding my legs tom wellyou hold mine jolly tightly said tom and laid himself down on his tummy soon he was peeping over the edge of the cliff and saw far down below a tiny boat tucked away in a small channel of water hidden by a fold in the rocks is it really the andyt he said i wouldnt be able to tell she looks all deck to me but theres a red spot on her which must mean her sail is folded up there theyve put it back again its the andy all right said andy joyfully id know her out of a million boats what a bit of luck she hasnt been sunk we know where shes hidden now weve only got to get her and we can sail away home yesbut how are we going to get her said tom wriggling back that wont be easy the two boys leaned against the rock at their backs and discussed what would be the best thing to do now plainly they must try to get down to the andy the whole difficult problem of escape would be solved if only they got her we cant possibly climb down the cliff here and get to her said andy we should fall and be dashed to pieces it seems to me that absolutely the only thing to do is to get down to our own cove somehowthe one the underground river flows intoand climb round the rocks at the base of the cliff till we reach the andy it will take ages oh goodnessand weve got no food said tom dolefully that doesnt seem a very good idea to me wellthink of a better idea then and well follow it said andy but of course tom could think of nothing else at all youre right he said at last with a sigh its the only thing to do but andy lets get back to that storecave where the boxes of food are kept we could open some of those tins and at least have something to eat we cant go on too long without food at least i cant all right said andy anyway tom i think it would be better to keep in hiding till the evening in case anyone sees us clambering about the rocks to get to the andy come on well get down to the storecave now and get what food we want then well take it up to the ledge by the waterfallif we can get through the waterfall entranceand wait there till we think its safe to climb down and get round the rocks to find the andy it was easier to get down to the storecave than it had been to climb from it up to the cliff there was no one there the boys hunted about and found two or three tinopeners good they each put one in their pockets and then chose a few tins to take with them tongue said tom and spam and pears and apricots and plums thats my selection they hunted about for sacks to put them in and found some old bags each boy put his selection of tins into a bag threw it over his shoulder and set out again to the cliffbut this time they took the other tunnel when they came to the fork andy was amazed to see the caves where the torrent of water ran through on its way to the waterfall theres hardly any water pouring out today thank goodness said tom come on andyitll be difficult wriggling along that narrow ledge to the entrance with our tins it wasbut they managed it and there they were at last out on the ledge of the cliff of birds and sitting down at the back of the shallow cave where tom had left his illfated camera now for a meal said the everhungry tom and thena good long doze in the sun after thatall set to find the good old andyl chapter down to the andyand what happened there the boys had a very good meal up on the ledge m the sm they talked about the girls and wondered how they were getting on and if they were all right at any rate theyve got food said tom i wish they could share this spam and peaches with me its an awfully good mixture how you can cut yourself a bit of spam and then spear a peach and eat it beats me said andy i dont like mixing up things like that isnt this sun delicious tom the wind has dropped a bit i saywhat shall we do when we get the andy go and rescue the girls firstor run straight for home and report what we know i dont see how we can rescue the girls said tom spearing a bit of spam and a peach together on the end of his knife we should only be seen by the men looking out for your fathers boat and theyd capture us again wed better run for home the wind will be behind us wont it so we could get back fairly quickly yes i feel worried about the girls though said andy lying down on his back unable to eat any more im afraid those men will be very angry when they find weve escapedif they do find it outand theyll make things unpleasant for jill and mary perhaps this was a horrid thought andy was very fond of the two girls and tom loved his twin sisters dearly but if they went back to smugglers rock to get the girls they might get captured themselves again and what would be the use of that andy fell asleep before he had time to worry any more about it tom drank the last drop of sweet juice from his tin then lay back in the sunshine too and shut his eyes both boys were really exhausted with their exertions they did not wake until the sun was well down in the west andy sat up and shook tom tom wake up its time we climbed down and made a search for the andy well get down to the foot of the cliffs and then try to make our way westwards round the pkce where those rocks jut right out we ought to come across the fold in the cliff where the andy is hidden sooner or later the tide is going out so the rocks will be fairly well uncovered tom yawned as he sat up he felt stiff he did not like the thought of the long climb downwards but it had to be faced andy began to climb down first and tom followed when they were at the foot of the cliff at last andy turned westwards and began to clamber over the rugged rocks uncovered by the tide they were slippery with seaweed but both boys were very surefooted and hardly slipped at all they made their way round the point and came in sight of another stretch of wild rocky coast somewhere hidden along there was the andyl but where there was no sign of her from where they stood she was in a very clever hidingplace indeed seethats the way they brought her in said andy pointing to a narrow little seapath free of rocks the men must know these coasts like the palm of their hands there are some jolly clever sailors among them slowly they made their way along the rocks that skirted the cliff looking out for some bend that would mean the sudden fold that hid the andy but it really seemed as if it was impossible to find then they found it they rounded a steep rock as tall as a churchand saw a narrow deepblue runway of water running into a fold of the cliff this is it said andy in delight see quite hidden except from above way up the cliff thereor here where we stand looking right in what a blessing we spotted the boat from above wed never have found her any other way they went up the little runway of water that lay quietly in a hollowedout channel of rock it twisted right into the fold of the cliffand there at the end of it lying quietly at anchor was the andy the boys stood still and stared at her in proud delight what a darling of a boat she was and not sunk after all said tom poor old andyyou were awfully miserable about that werent you yesmore than id ever been in my life before said andy anywaythere she is waiting for us is anyone about do you think there didnt seem to be anyone at all not a sound was to be heard except the usual wind and sea and bird noises no one whistled no one shouted it seemed quite safe to go and explore the andy she hadnt got her sail up but it was there on the deck andy saw that the oars had been put back too good the boys made their way towards the boat she was stripped of everything of course for the children had taken the things from her themselves and put them in their cave in smugglers rock still what did that matter the boat herself was there safe and sound they were soon on board her andy examined her lovingly from top to toe yes she was all right no harm had come to her at all it was getting rather dark andy looked up at the sky i think it wouldnt be a bad idea if we set off now he said it will be dark long before we get homejbut we must chance the journey and hope we shant strike a rock i know the way pretty well now the boys thought they would row the andy carefully out of the narrow litde creek and put up the sail as soon as they got out to sea they began to make ready to pull up the anchor they were just about to haul it up when andys sharp ears caught an unusual sound he stopped and put his hand on toms arm listen he said can you hear anything tom listened trying to make out something besides the wind and the sea at first he could hear nothing then he did hear something yes i can hear the sound of some regular noise he said chug chug chug chug oh andy is it one of their motorboats somewhere near yes said andy thats just about what it is oh i hope its not coming in here just as we were getting off too the noise is louder tom wed better hide in case the motorboat is coming in here the boys climbed over the side of their boat and looked about for a hidingplace there were plenty there rocks stuck up all over the place lets climb up a bit just over there said andy pointing see where i mean theres a good rock there we can hide behind and see everything from hear everything too come on the engine of that motorboat is going more slowly i believe its nosing its way in here this very minute the boys climbed quickly up to the big rock about six feet above the andy they crouched down there waiting andy suddenly clutched tom and pointed there it is he whispered see coming in down the little creek up to the andy pity its so dark now i can hardly see whos on the motorboat the motorboat nosed its way up and came to rest beside the andy a man jumped out and called to someone else its bandy whispered tom i think the other man is stumpy isnt he the man with the hairy legs what are they going to do a lamp was lighted on the motorboat and another one was placed on the fishingboat nearby then bandy and stumpy got very busy what they were doing the boys could hardly make out in the deepening twilight they seem to be carrying things from one boat to the other whispered andy what are they doing its a puzzle isnt it to and fro went the men carrying all kinds of things andy suddenly recognized something and he gave a low exclamation that quite startled tom look thats our little cooking stove isnt it whispered andy you can just see it in the light of that lamp they are putting it into the cabin of the andy then both boys were silent for the same thought had come to them both the stove had been in their snug cave up on the rocks of smugglers rock were all the things being put into the andy the things that had been taken from that cave and if so what was happening to the girls the men must have climbed up to the cave discovered that the boys were gone and that only the girls were thereand then what had happened where could the girls be they must have been turned out of the cave if all the things were taken away now the two boys were really worried they couldnt bear to think of jill and mary frightened and alone in the hands of those grim smugglers everything seemed puzzling again why bring the things back to the andy what was the sense of it why not leave them where they wereand the girls too and above all where were the girls the two men worked hard for some time and then apparently had transferred all the things they meant to for they put out the light on the andy both of them went back to the motorboat sat down and lighted cigarettes are they going to stay here all night whispered tom in dismay well never get away if they do well we cant get off till they go because they are blocking the way out for the andy now said andy in a gloomy whisper pity we didnt get off a few minutes sooner theyd have seen us and given chase said tom its just as well we didnt i wish theyd go it would be so nice to get back home with the andy everything complete in her again if only we knew about the girls when they had smoked their cigarettes the two men got up they had had very little to say to one another and then only commonplace remarks andy wondered if bandy was still angry with stumpy for apparently stealing his food well go and have a word with the chief said bandy throwing his glowing cigarette end into the water well see if anyone has found those dratted boys good thing weve got the girls to bargain withnice little hostages they are the men climbed on to a ledge and made their way up the creek andy and tom could not see where they went because it was now almost dark must be some entrance into the cliff of birds up that way muttered andy in toms ear i wonder who the chief is perhaps that fellow with the glasses you once saw in the storecave with bandy tom wonder how long theyre going to be ive a good mind to take their motorboat and chance the run home in itl i know how to drive one tom was cold with the evening wind and with suspense he shivered now with excitement what take their boat andy he said would you really dare chapter who is in the cabin it was quite dark now the sky was perfectly clear and the stars shone out giving so little light that in that shutin creek there was none to see by only the lamp on the motorboat gleamed out showing the deck there andy listened for the mens voices nothere was no sound of them they had gonebut for how long what had to be done must be done now if they were to get away quickly the boys got down from their hidingplace and crept softly over the rocks to the waiting motorboat it was quite still on the narrow waters of the calm little creek they climbed over the sides and examined it it was whilst they were looking at it to see how to start it up that they were startled by a noise in the cabin of the boat it was a curious noisea kind of longdrawnout groan the boys stood absolutely still almost startled out of their wits for they had been so certain they were alone they listened the groan came again theres someone herein that cabin whispered andy in toms ear wed better get out quick we dont want to be discovered here come on quiet now the boys climbed out as quietly as they could they made for their hidingplace again puzzled whos in there whispered tom he sounded as if he was ill or hurt who is it goodness knows said andy all i know is hes a frightful nuisance whoever he ishes prevented us from taking the boat what shall we do now whispered tom we cant stay up here all the night oh those men will come back soon said andy then maybe theyll push off and we can get going in the andy we must wait and see the boys sat themselves down and prepared to wait with what patience they could tom shivered again he and andy sat as close together as possible for warmth can you hear any more groans asked tom andy shook his head no they seem to have stopped but they began again a little later then other noises began someone hammered on the door of the motorboats cabin someone shook the door violently and kicked it hard the boys listened more startled than ever then a voice they knew very well indeed came up to them a voice muffled by the door of the cabin but quite unmistakable let me out where am i you let me out or ill kick the place down the boys felt their hearts jump and they stared down at the motorboat in amazement its jill its jills voice said andy forgetting to whisper in his enormous astonishment but whats jill doing there quick lets go to her the boys leapt down again not caring if they fell or not they were so eager to reach the little girl she was going quite mad with fury in the locked cabin she was now hitting the door with somethingcrash crash crash andy couldnt help smiling he had seldom seen jill in a temper but he knew she had one he wondered if mary was there too if so she was very quiet andy landed on the motorboat first and ran to the cabindoor jill was now raining heavy blows on it and shouting so loudly that she could not hear andys voice calling to her jill jill stop all that hammering so that i can unlock the door and get in youll hit me if you dont stop it but the furious little girl went on and on quite beside herself crash smash crash what in the world had she got in her hand there was a pause at last and jill plainly quite tired out began to sob bitterly andy hammered on the door with his fist jill its me andy were going to unlock the door and come in dont smash at it any more there was a dead silence inside the cabin jill evidently couldnt believe her ears then there was a wild cry of joy andy oh andy darling andy unlock the door quick andy unlocked and unbolted the door jill flung herself on him and tom weeping for joy i thought you were lost for ever she sobbed we didnt know what to make of it when you didnt come back the men said you never would we thought you must be drowned oh andy oh tom lets go home wheres mary asked tom in the cabinon that bunk thereshe wont wake up said jill andy took the lamp from the deck of the motorboat and flashed the light on to where mary was lying in a bunk whats wrong with her he asked hearing her breathing very loudly indeed i dont know said jill i think it must have been something those men gave us to drink that sent us off to sleep like that i didnt drink so much as mary didi didnt like the taste of minebut mary drank all hers and then we fell fast asleep and didnt know what was happening i woke up just now and ielt awiully sick and i groaned and groaned yeswe heard you said andy poor old jill i expect mary will wake up soon my word jill you nearly broke that door down what did you hit it with that stool said jill i felt so angry when i knew those men had put us somewhere and left us i dont know where we are you see we fell asleep in that cave high up in smugglers rockwhere the men put us all before when aadfs father came to look for us youve got a lot to tell us said andy and weve got some pretty peculiar things to tell you too but we cant stop now to exchange news because those men may come back at any tune we dont want all to be captured again nothis is a jolly good chance to escape the whole lot of us said tom but andywe must tell them one thing andy knew what that was of course oh yes he said jillthe andy wasnt sunk shes close by this very boat sails and pars and everything the man must have taken her and hidden her there shes safe and sound tom and i were just about to run home in her if we could when bandy and stumpy brought this motorboat up the creek and we had to hide oh said jill in joy andy im so awfully glad i was miserable about her of course but i knew you must be ten times more miserable we were almost at the top of the cliff when andy saw her said tom hed have fallen over with joy if i hadnt had hold of his ankles andy suddenly remembered that bandy and stumpy might come back at any moment look herewe mustnt chatter like this he said we must make up our minds what we are going to do tom and i were thinking of running for home in this motorboat as we cant get at the andy this boat is blocking up the way and we cant get the andy out well lets go then said jill eagerly its awfully dark though i dont know how youll see your way andy a deep groan from the cabin bunk made them jump it was mary waking up after her long sleep feeling sick jill went to her its all right mary youll soon feel all right mary halfasleep still and feeling very sick groaned again lets get her up into the open air said andy shell feel better then shes awfully pale the two boys helped the poor little girl out of her bunk still feeling very sick she went on deck and was glad to feel the cool wind on her face she soon stopped groaning i feel a bit better she said feebly tom andyhow is it youre here where are we tell you all about it soon said andy no time now well start up this motorboat and get going as soon as we can jill and tom can tell you everything as we go he went to start up the engine but no matter how he tried the engine wouldnt start up it made a humming noise but nothing more happened andy could have cried whats up cant you get her going said tom herelet me have a try but although they all had a try nobody could start up the motor of the boat why they didnt know it was most aggravatingespecially as they couldnt possibly go on the andy because the motorboat was in the way look outtheres someone coming said tom suddenly see the light of their cigarettes up there the four children stared up the narrow creek yes there was certainly someone comingtwo people for there was the glow from the ends of two cigarettes it must be bandy and stumpy coming back blow skip out of the boat quickly whispered andy giving jill a helping hand shut the cabindoor tom and lock it the men may slip off without looking in and seeing that the girls aren t there if they do go we can all get away in the andy hurry tom locked and bolted the door of the cabin then he joined the others on the ledge and they all crept behind a rock wishing their hearts were not beating so loudly bandy and stumpy came along smoking they clambered on board their boat the children hardly dared to breathe would they be able to start up the engine and go how they hoped and prayed that they would hear the roar of the engine and know that it would soon take the boat safely away from them then into the andy they would climb and away they would go stumpys voice came to them those girls all right do you think bandy they ought to have waked up by now that sleepingdraught you gave them wasnt too strong was it funny they havent come round from it yet awlet them alone came bandys hoarse voice what does it matter if i gave it to them strong keep them quiet well have to carry them from the cabin to their boat if theyre not awake thats all well dump them down into their boats cabin and lock them in safely no one will ever know where they areand if those two boys ever get back home and split on us well well have those two girls as hostagesour safety against theirs a nice bit of work well ill get one of the girls now said stumpy and he unlocked the cabindoor here hand me the lamp there was a moments silence as he took the lamp and swung its light into the cabin then he suddenly gave a loud cry whats this theres nobody here those two girls have gone chapter andy has a fine idea bandy and stumpy were filled with the utmost amazement to find their two prisoners gone the children heard their astonished remarks as they searched the little cabin but the door was still locked and bolted how could they have gone kids cant walk through locked doorsand theres no window they could open we left them fast asleep here i looked in at them before we wentand locked and bolted the door afterwards i know i saw you ill swear to that then whats happened to them heres the cabin just as it was when we left itlocked and boltedand we come back to find it still locked and boltedand the kids gone i dont like it look heredo you suppose anyone came along and let them outand locked and bolted the door again suddenly said bandys hoarse voice there was a pause before stumpy answered its possiblebut whos about here in the middle of the nighthere in this lonely place nobody its a queer thing shall we go and tell the chief not me said bandy at once what do you think hed say to us if he knew his two precious prisoners were gonehis only means of bargaining if his little game gets reported no stumpyweve got to find those girls somehow they cant be far away now can they no youre right there said stumpy their own fishingboat is still hereand theyre not likely to swim down this creek or to climb the cliff here either unless they want to break their necks they must be hereabouts search the motorboat first said bandy and then the fishingboat yonder its a pity we didnt carry them there as we were told to do dump them down in the cabin and bolt the hatch over them well if they could get out of a locked and bolted door here they could have got out of a bolted cabin in their own boat said stumpy come ontheyre not on our boat lets take our torches mid look around all these rocks the children began to tremble bandy and stumpy were two fierce men and angry ones now too it would not be pleasant to be found by them andy frowned what could he do to distract the men from hunting round the rocks an idea came to him he bent down and groped about for a stone or piece of rock he found one and stood up again he tried to make out where the andy was and then taking aim he flung the rock as hard as he could in her direction it fell on the deck of the fishingboat with a loud crash that echoed up and down the little creek tom jill and mary jumped violently they had not known what andy was going to do but bandy and stumpy jumped even more violently goshdid you hear that said bandys voice what was it it sounded as if it came from the fishingboat yonder thats where they are come on quick well get them the tiresome little brats forgetting all about searching the rocks the two men hurried to where the andy floated they climbed on deckand after them climbed andy as softfooted as a cat a wild plan was in his head he didnt know if he could carry it out or notbut it was worth trying the men flashed their torches about the boat and lifted up the folded sail nobody there of course theyll be down in the cabin said bandy come onwell see and wont i shake the little varmints when i get hold of them he opened the hatch and leapt down into the little cabin stumpy stood above it looking down and suddenly something happened to him that gave him the shock of his life something hurled itself at his back and sent him right off his balance he gave a shout of terror and then fell headlong down the open hatch into the little cabin below he fell right on top of the equally startled bandy knocking him over so that he fell and struck his head hard against the wooden table his torch flew from his hand and crashed its light going out the little cabin was in darkness bandy quite sure that some unexpected enemy had fallen upon him to kill him began to fight like a madman he struck out at the horrified stumpy who tried in vain to stop him bandy was quite beside himself with anger and panic and his great fists hammered stumpy unmercifully so that in selfdefence stumpy had to hammer back the two men rolled over and over pummelling each other yelling and shouting for all they were worth it was pitchblack in the little cabin andy flashed his torch down just once and grinned with delight to see the two rogues going for each other let them get on with it by all means the boy slammed down the hatch and bolted it the noise startled the two men and they stopped fighting it also startled the three hidden children and they jumped what was that whispered jill i wish i could see whats happening a cheerful voice came over to them through the darkness you all right tom and the girls yes andy but what was all the yelling and smashing and that last big slam called back tom glad to hear andys voice again he had had no idea why andy had left them nor what he was doing oh bandy got down into the cabin and i shoved stumpy in to keep him company said andy still more cheerfully i dont think bandy welcomed stumpy much because theyve been fighting like wild cats the slam you heard was the hatch closing down its well and truly bolted too there were squeals from the two girls and a loud shout from tom andy youve got them prisoner good work andy good work soon the four were on the fishingboat and andy told them proudly once more how he had made the two men prisoner it seemed too good to be true bandy and stumpy who now knew they had been fighting each other were doing their best to bang open the hatch its no good andy yelled down to them gleefully its too hefty to smash open and you should see the bolts make as much noise as you like though so long as you cant get out are they really caught asked mary sitting down on the deck feeling suddenly sick again oh dearall this has made me feel bad again youll soon be all fight mary said jill i fed quite better now golly andy that was a good trick of yours what are we going to do next well i dont somehow think anyone will be along this way tonight so we can let those two fellows shout all they want to said andy when dawn comes well set free the motorboat and somehow get her down the creek and out of the way of the andy then well take the andy and run for home with bandy and stumpy asked tom his eyes wide with excitement well theyll have to come too whether they want to or not said andy with a grin two nice little prisoners who will have to explain quite a lot of things to quite a lot of people very soon ill be awfully glad to get home safely said jill so will we all said andy i vote we have a rest till dawn we cant mess about with the motorboat whilst its dark oh andyweve slept for ages said jill cant we talk i want to know all about your adventuresand tell you what happened to us too well fire away said andy tom and i have had a good sleep today too well all talk lets get back to the motorboat and talk in the cabin there its cold here bandy and stumpy have got all the rugs down in our little cabin the four of them went to the motorboat and curled themselves up in the two bunks there they lighted the lamp too and soon it looked quite cosy did anything much happen after we had gone asked andy well mary and i didnt hear you leave the cave when you went to follow the trail of shells said jill we didnt wake up till morning we remembered where you had gone of course and we hoped you wouldnt be too long we had breakfast and then we squeezed out of the cave to wait for you you didnt come and you didnt come said mary so we thought we would follow the trail of shells ourselves and see if we could find you we followed them and came to where they stopped i bet you didnt know where to go next interrupted tom we didnt said jill we couldnt imagine why the shells ended at a blank wall of rock and then suddenly the rock opened golly said tom that must have scared you it did said jill it scared us terribly we ran awaybut that bandylegged man tracked us back to our cave and yelled to us to come out we had to come out in the end said mary because he threatened to smoke us out again he thought you two boys were in there and he yelled and yelled to you to come out too when you didnt he crawled inand found the cave empty what did he do then asked andy with great interest he raved at us and tried to make us say where you were said mary he was horrid then he hunted about all over the place and still couldnt find you then some other men came and they had a sort of meeting we couldnt hear what they said they sent bandy into our cave and he brought out everything said jill then we were taken blindfolded as before back to that highup cave in smugglers rockthe one we were all put in before we didnt have any food or drink for ages and then bandy came with some and we think that what we drank must have had sleepingmedicine in it said mary because when we had drunk it we simply couldnt keep our eyes open yes they must have given you sleepingdraughts said andy beasts then they meant to bring you here and lock you into the andy keeping you as hostages in case tom and i had escaped and could report the whole affair to someone what a bit of luck we happened to be here too yes now tdl us how you came to be here begged jill go on andy tell every single thing so andy and tom told their tale tooand when they had finished the dawn was coming up and it was tune to get to work again with luck they should be home that dayand what a surprising lot of news they had for the grownups so anxiously looking for them chapter running for home and now the four children began to be very busy indeed the daylight filtered into the narrow hidden creek and gave them just enough light to see by the boys clambered on board the motorboat and tried once more to start up the engine but for some reason or other again they could not get the boat to go lets untie her and give her a jolly good push said andy shell perhaps float away then and give us room to get out the andy so they untied the rope that held the motorboat moored to a postlike rock then all together the children shoved and pushed the boat slid away from the ledge they stood on and floated away down the creek shes going cried jill shes going down to the sea all by herself now shes stuck said andy as the boat seemed to get herself wedged against a rock ill get an oar from the andy and climb into the motorboat and push her along by the oa tom fetched him an oar from the andy andy ran down the ledge jumped to a rock and from there to the deck of the motorboat he shoved the oar against the rock and pushed the boat out of her corner she bobbed there not seeming to know which way to go andy shoved with the oar again mind you dont break it yelled tom seeing the oarblade bending a little ohthere she goes down the creek come on out andy or youll go with her but andy did not get out of the motorboat till she was right out of the little channel then when she was safely bobbing about in a patch of water outside he clambered over the side slithered down to a rock that was under water and began to wade back to the rocky ledge that ran beside the creek an enormous wave nearly sent him flying but he managed to keep his balance he went back to the others grinning well the motorboats out of our way all right he said thats good now to get the andy out well have to use the oars again wed put up the safl when we get the wind a great noise began again down in the cabin of the andy bandy and stumpy evidently knew that something was up how they crashed and banged against the bolted hatch but it was good and strong and they couldnt make it budge make all the noise you like andy called to the men cheerfully we dont mind by the way your motorboats been turned loose i hope it wont smash to pieces on the rocks theres a pretty good tide running with this strong wind all kinds of terrible threats came up from the cabin but the children only laughed at them they were feeling very happy now they had the andy back they were all together again they had two fine prisoners and a wonderful secretand they were going to run home before the wind hurrah tom of course wanted to finish the rest of the food in the tins that he and andy had brought down the cliff andy looked at his watch and decided they might have ten minutes for a meal it was a very merry meal jill and mary were hungry for both girls felt perfectly all right again by now then they set off the boys worked away with the oars getting the andy carefully down the little creek of water big waves splashed up it now but they managed very cleverly the boat gradually went down the little channel and was at last bobbing on the open sea we have to follow that seapath there between the rocks said andy then we round the point and find ourselves opposite the shallow bay where we anchored the andy before then we turn into the channel of water between the two long ridges of rock and run for home the boat bobbed violently on the surging water the tide was running very high indeed the wind whipped by them sending their hair straight up tom take the oars and keep her off the rocks there said andy ill put up the sail jill take the tiller for a minute thats right keep her headejd the way she is andy was just about to put up the sail when he heard a cry from mary oh lookthe motorboat is going on the rocks look at her the children looked mary was right the motorboat was indeed on the rocks with no one to guide her or control her she was quite at the mercy of the waves and they had taken her right on to the wicked rocks that dotted the sea just there there was a smashing grinding noise the childrens faces grew grave and solemn it wasnt nice to see a boat smashed to pieces like that dont lets watch any more said tom its awful to see the waves smashing it uppoor thing its on its side nowand look at that great hole there when next its swept off the rocks it will fill with water and sink one less boat for the smugglers said andy and put up the red sail deftly the wind filled it gleefully and the sail flapped eagerly andy slid down to the seat by the tiller and took it from jill put the oars in tom he said were all right now off we go with the wind it was glorious to feel the little boat leaping along if she could sing she would said mary even as it is i sometimes think her sail flaps out a kind of song there came a noise from below the children listened trying to make out the voice against the sound of wind and waves its only bandy saying that they feel sick down there and want some fresh air said tom with a grin jill put her mouth to the crack of the hatch and called down you made me and mary feel sick with your horrid sleepingmedicine its your turn now you wont come up here i should think not said andy and swung the tiller round as the boat entered the channel between the long wicked rows of sharp black rocks do they really think wed let them come up hereto overpower us and whisk us back to smugglers rock what a hope plainly bandy and stumpy didnt feel there was much hope for it for they said no more the children forgot about them as they raced along they revelled in the speed of their boat and loved the way she seemed to gallop over the whitetopped waves andy looked the picture of happiness as he sat at the tiller his brown face glowing and bis deepblue eyes reflecting the sea dear old andy thought jill looking at him hes got back his boat and hes happy again its true that its our boat toobut hes the real skipper for a long time the boat swept on over the waves and they made very good time indeed well be home about eleven at this rate shouted andy the wind whipping his words away as he called them out they swept into their homewaters just after eleven the red sail making a bright speck on the blue waters the children eyed the shore eagerly would their mother be there would andys father be there of course notbecause they didnt know the children were coming home at that very moment but they were there all the same someone had sighted the andy as she turned into the harbour and the word was sent round at once the andy is back there she is the andy is come home again lets hope the children are safe and sound the childrens mother was fetched at once and ran down to the jetty her face bright with hope she had been very unhappy the last few days andys father stood there too his blue eyes watching the incoming boat then a shout went up theyre all on board the whole four of them theyre safe thank god for that andys father turned to the childrens mother theyre safe maam he said his eyes bright with joy i knew theyd be all right with my andy look at them waving to us theyre all right maam theyre all right many willing hands made the andy safe as she stopped beside the jetty the children leapt off and ran to their mother andy got a hug from his father and then he pointed back to the boat weve two prisoners there dad look out for them theyre pretty dangerous fellows weve got them bolted down everyone gaped andys father rapped out a few questions and andy answered breathlessly then three of the listening fishermen stalwart sturdy fellows started grimly towards the andy they opened the hatchand up came bandy and stumpy looking very green indeed they were grasped by rough strong hands and jerked off the andys deck to the jetty its a case for the police dad said andy theres something very queer going on in the cliff of birds and smugglers rock we found cases upon cases of guns and ammunition the fishermen whistled and looked at one another one of them went off to fetch the local policeman it was all very exciting indeed im jolly hungry said tom the girls laughed it was so like tom to say that in the middle of all the excitement his mother put her arm round them come along and have a good meal she said im so happy to have you back youve no idea how worried ive been andys father and uncle and many of the other fishermen all went out hunting for youand there wasnt a trace of you to be found im longing to hear every single thing andys father and andy went with them bandy and stumpy were left in charge of the fishermen until the policeman came tom wondered what his mother had got for their meal he felt he really could enjoy one now that all worry and trouble were ended whilst andy and the others were sitting down to a noisy and exciting meal many things were happening the policeman decided that all these curious affairs that the children had reported were quite beyond him and he had rung up the superintendent in the next big town the superintendent listening carefully had been filled with amazement yes certainly this was a very big affair indeed he telephoned in his turn to headquarters and soon dozens of telegraph wires were humming with news and instructions bandy and stumpy were safely in prison and fearful of their own skins they gave away all the secrets of their chiefthe children knew nothing of this but laughed and chattered as they told their mother that afternoon all that had happened they had quite forgotten how afraid they had been and how worried when things end well nothing seems to matter said tom i do wonder what will happen to all those smugglers mother chapter the end of it all that evening when the children had talked themselves out and really thought they had nothing more to say a very large and shining car drove up to the cottage out of it stepped a neat and welldressed little man whose sharp clever eyes looked in turn at each of the four children you dont know who i am he said but i am someone in charge of very highup affairs and i want to ask you a few questions my name is colonel knox ive heard most of your story from andys father now can you tell me this did any of you ever see the man that bandy and stump call the chief welli did see a man once in the storecave with stumpy a man wearing glasses but dressed like a fisherman said tom i dont know if he was the chief though no that wasnt the chief said the sharpeyed man stumpy has told us who that man was we are hoping to get him tomorrow with all the others what are you going to do asked tom with great interest were going to round up all the smugglers and their boats said colonel knox were combing out all the passages and tunnels and caves were opening every case and box and crate we shall crossexamine every man we getand we shall set that great lamp burning you told us of and watch for the ships that answer the signal we shall get them too why did they smuggle those guns and things in said jill there is a country that is not allowed to import firearms of any kind said the colonel those arms you found were made in a distant land and have been smuggled here to take across to this other country where they are forbidden as you can imagine very high prices are paid for these forbidden firearms men in our country i regret to say have been acting as a gobetweenthat is they smuggle the arms here and for a price take them to the buyers they make a very pretty fortune out of it oh said the children wideeyed and astonished andy considered a moment and the man youd really like to get hold of is the one they call the chief he said colonel knox nodded yes all the other fellows merely obey orders hes the big brain behind it all weve suspected this affair for a long time but we couldnt find out how the forbidden goods were brought here or where nor did we know who the brain behind it was and if you dont get him hell probably start off again somewhere else said tom well i wish we could tell you who he is dont bandy and stumpy know noall they know is that he is a tall fellow who always wears a mask when visiting them said colonel knox and they think he lives in the nearest big town so that he can get to the cliff of birds without too great a loss of time when he needs to but as there are about fifty thousand people living in that town its like looking for a needle in a haystack yes i see said andy i do hope you get him colonel knox i say wasnt it a bit of luck we stumbled on their haunt it was quite an accident a very happy accident for us said the colonel we dont want our country mixed up in any affair of this sort it was a clever ideato have a hideout of motorboats in such a hidden coveand a lamp to signal out to sea from a place that no one else ever saw at nightand to use the tunnels and caves as storehouses how did the chief get the goods out of the cliff of birds and smugglers rock asked andy puzzled were not quite sure yet said colonel knox but we think there is another way out of the cliff of birds leading to a flat piece of ground at the backa good place for aeroplanes to land it is likely that the chief took off loads of firearms in his planes my word said tom what a dangerous plot we found i wonder the men didnt guard us more carefully than they did ahthey didnt know what wily birds you were said the colonel with a laugh but they quite meant to use the two girls as hostages if you got home and reported their doings that would have been very unpleasant for jill and maryand im afraid we would have had to let the miscreants free rather than risk anything happening to the girls its a good thing we captured bandy and stumpy said andy a very good thing said colonel knox we got out of them a tremendous amount of valuable information enough to capture all the rest of the gang and round up their hidingplaces and stop all their plans its just the chief we cant seem to lay our hands on its a pity we never sawjiim said tom a great pity agreed colonel knox well im proud to have met you childrenyoure a fine brave adventurous four i must go nowbut i want you to come over to the big town where i live and have lunch with me tomorrow for a treat will you do that oh yes cried the four but how can we get there asked jill there is only one train ill send my car for you said colonel knox and got up to go the children took him to his sleek black car they liked him very much hes clever and kind and goes straight to the point in everything said tom i only wish we could tell him who the chief of the smugglers is but we cant the next day the car was sent to fetch the four children they climbed into it proudly and were soon whisked away to the nearest big town they stopped at the grandest hotel in the place and were met in style by colonel knox at the door they felt most important walking in with himand when tom read the menu for the lunch he looked at his host in awe can we have all these things he said oh it will be the best meal weve ever had look it says mixed icecreams at the bottom can we have vanilla strawberry and chocolate all mixed yesand coffee icecream as well i believe said colonel knox laughing well sit down now who wants gingerbeer to drink and who wants lemonade or orange soon the children were in the middle of a most glorious meal tom looked blissfully happy he thought this was a wonderful reward for all the adventures they had been through when he was in the middle of his mixed icecream he looked up and saw a man seating himself at a nearby table he was a tall burly fellow with deepset eyes and black wavy hair he nodded to colonel knox whos that asked tom in a low voice the colonel looked surprised ohjust one of the inhabitants of this town he said one of our very richest though you wouldnt think it to look at him tom was staring at the man curiously he certainly didnt look rich for he wore his clothes carelessly and the sleeve of his coat wanted mending his red shirt was open at the neck and lacked a button halfway down tom suddenly went as red as a beetroot with excitement he began to burrow deep into first one pocket and then another whatevers the matter said andy why do you look like that tom tom brought something out from his pocket he pushed it across to colonel knox who looked at it in the greatest surprise thinking that tom had suddenly gone mad sir said tom in a whisper i found that red pearl button in a cave in the cliff of birds it must have belonged to one of the men there though i never saw one with a red shirt on but look at that man over there hes got on a red shirtand it has red pearl buttons exactly like thisand one is missing colonel knoxs eyes flashed from toms button to the mans shirt he slipped the button into his pocket say no more now he commanded dont even look at the fellow understand there was something in those commanding tones that made the children feel a little frightened they obeyed eating their ices and keeping their eyes carefully away from the man at the other table colonel knpx scribbled a note on a piece of paper beckoned to a waiter and told him to deliver it somewhere then the colonel became his own charming joking self again and apparently took no notice at all of the man in the red shirt nearby ill let you know if your button has solved our problem he said to tom when the man got up and went it may have it may have hes the one man we never even suspected good for you tom my word this is a great affair and no mistake so it was before long the whole of the motorboats in the cove had been taken all the crews too and every smuggler found in the caves the smuggled goods had been confiscated ships that helped in the smuggling were captured and the whole plot exposed and the man in the red shirt was the leader the chief of the whole gang it was too good to be true that tom should have found the button that led to his capture colonel knox was very pleased about it indeed you shall certainly have a fine new camera for your help with the button he said to tom without you we should never have known who the chief wasno one even suspected him he ran the whole business very cleverly indeed and not even the men themselves ever saw him face to face he has made a fortune out of his smugglingbut he wont make any more money for many many years to come what a lot has happened in a week or so said jill as they all sat on the jetty that night waiting for the fishingboat to come back with andy and his father look there she goes leading all the rest of the boats as usual ahoy andy ahoy were waiting for you their mother came up to see the fishingboats come in as andy stepped off on to the jetty tom turned eagerly to his mother mother can we go out with andy in his boat next weekwhen he has a day off i know a lovely place id like to go to certainly not said his mother what lose you again for days on end and not know where you are my dears i shall never never let you go out alone with andy again all the same i expect she will after all they are the adventurous four and there may be plenty more adventures waiting for them yet
