 chapter one is billy marr telling the truth tell me again about this woman you killed billy said logan it was late one thursday afternoon and inspector jenny logan of the edinburgh police was sitting at her desk in the london road police station opposite her was an ordinarylooking man wearing a dirty pair of jeans an old blue pullover and a dark green jacket with holes in it his name was billy marr ive told you already inspector said billy waving a finger in the air shes up on calton hill i killed her with my own hands i killed her and left her body in the grass in a corner of the room by the door sat sergeant grant there was a notebook on his crossed legs but the notebook was closed and he did not have a pen in his hand he looked bored what did she look like he asked marr billy marr turned to look at grant you think im lying dont you you think im not telling you the truth this time just because ive come in here sometimes when ive had a few drinks and ive told you about things i havent really done you think im making this up billy turned back to logan well its true this time this time ive really done it he sat up straight and met logans eyes this time ive really killed her marrs breath smelt of alcohol out of the corner of her eye logan could see grant shaking his head slowly from side to side well what did she look like asked logan she was blonde said billy marr very definitely still looking logan straight in the eye ok she said and how exactly did you kill her how repeated marr yes how marr looked confused for a moment then his face lit up like i said with my own hands he said i put them round her throat and i pressed and pressed you strangled her yes said marr i strangled her did you knock her out first asked grant what do you mean asked marr i mean did you knock her out hit her anything like that asked grant patiently no no said marr why would i do that i just strangled her grant did not say anything he just looked at logan logan put her elbows on the desk in front of her and her head in her hands she ran her fingers through her short brown hair and then looked up at billy marr poor billy he came into the london road police station once every couple of months or so to tell the police about something he had done or rather had not done because his stories were never true ok billy said logan sergeant grant will take you downstairs and show you out out said marr there was some surprise in his voice youre not keeping me in then no billy said logan were letting you go you see if you try and strangle someone and theyre conscious they fight back at you there arent any cuts or scratches on your face or hands where this poor blonde woman tried to fight you off because of that i dont think you killed anyone at all billy so goodbye and off you go there was an edge of anger to logans voice billy was wasting police time but to take any action would waste even more time the best thing to do was to listen to him and send him away grant stood up and so did marr but then marr pointed at logan youll be sorry you let me go he said i told you this time was different this time i really did it and then he turned and left logans office with sergeant grant close behind him logan sat back in her chair and looked out of the window it was a cool and cloudy september day a few leaves on the trees in the park over the road had started to change colour within a few weeks they would turn a rich golden brown edinburgh preparing for another winter logan hoped it would be a peaceful one but thought it unlikely edinburgh was a big city with all the usual problems that big cities had there was a quiet knock at the door and sergeant grant came back into the room ive got rid of billy he said and i told him i didnt want to see him again until well after christmas logan shook her head and smiled sadly her anger gone hes a strange one isnt he she said just wanting the attention someone to talk to but can you actually imagine billy killing anyone grant shook his head and started to say something but logans phone rang she picked it up inspector logan grant watched as her eyes opened wide in amazement well be there she said putting the phone down she looked at grant theyve found the body of a young woman on calton hill blonde dead grants mouth opened in surprise find billy marr and get him back here ordered logan ill get up to calton hill and ill be back as soon as i can grant was already on his way along the corridor as logan took her jacket from the back of her chair and followed him chapter two a discovery on calton hill the road to the top of calton hill goes up behind the old royal high school a beautiful building that in logans opinion should have been used to house the new scottish government instead millions of pounds had been wasted on a new building about halfway up the hill logan pulled her car over to the side of the road behind two police cars and an old blue volvo she recognised helen robertson the police doctor among a group of police officers near a wall some metres below the level of the road as she got out of her car logan turned and looked up towards the nelson monument and the city observatory she thought that the view from the top of calton hill was one of the best over the city well it was when there wasnt a dead body on the side of the hill walking down through the long grass by the side of the road logan could see the body of the young woman lying half on her side with her back against the wall helen robertson who had been bending over the body examining it stood up when she saw logan arrive robertson had dark hair and was wearing black trousers and a light blue blouse she and logan had worked together before on a number of cases and had always got on well jenny hi she said she took a deep breath its an unpleasant one im afraid logan said nothing she just looked down and studied the body and its position she waited for robertson to speak young woman blonde midtwenties possibly a bit younger i dont know who she is shes been strangled but it wasnt done here logan looked up sharply when robertson mentioned how the woman had died the body was brought here sometime after death continued robertson she was also hit on the head at some time and her hands have been tied logan bent down to have a closer look at the womans body she was wearing a pink tshirt and a dark blue skirt a sex attack asked logan i dont think so but i cant be sure until ive done some scientific tests replied helen there dont seem to be any cuts or marks on the lower part of her body what about the time of death asked logan again ill know more when ive done some tests said robertson but at a guess id say about eighteen to twenty hours ago logan looked at her watch it was five oclock so sometime between ten and midnight last night then that sounds right said robertson look ill do the tests and the scientific examination first thing in the morning and if i find anything interesting ill give you a call great said logan and she put her hand lightly on robertsons arm in thanks robertson bent down again and started to pack her things into a small black bag logan turned and looked at the police officer standing nearest to her she recognised him from the london road police station but he was new and she did not know his name he was tall with sandycoloured hair and fair skin logan guessed that he was about the same age as her im sergeant graham madam said the officer introducing himself davy graham i found the body at four twentyfive and reported it in to the station right said logan do we know who she is im afraid not said graham no bag no wallet no id of any kind how did you find the body asked logan i was on a routine call nothing important anyway as i was driving past i noticed something pink down here it looked kind of odd so i came over to see and it was this poor girl who was around here at the time i dont remember anyone of any interest said graham half closing his eyes in thought an old lady walking her dog a few tourists nothing unusual tourists often came up calton hill to look at the view and to visit the edinburgh experience a show about the history of edinburgh in the old city observatory even though the summer was over there were still quite a few tourists around ok said logan id like you to direct things here for the moment right madam said graham the scientists will be here soon to look round this area logan pointed to the area around where the body was found but id like you to get some more men and search the whole hill look for anything that might be important but especially for a bag or wallet or id that someones thrown away ok madam logan looked up towards the top of the hill has anyone been allowed to leave since you found the body she asked not yet madam good talk to everyone up there find out if anybody saw anything find out too if anyone was here last night between ten and midnight ill be at london road call me when youve finished she said logan turned to take a last look at the body of the unknown girl and as she did so an icy feeling ran down her back a young life had been needlessly taken away and once again a killer was on the streets of edinburgh as she walked back to her car logan thought about billy marr would grant have been quick enough to catch him before he had got too far from the police station could he really have killed this woman or was it just complete chance that a body had been found on calton hill ten minutes after he had admitted killing someone there as she drove back towards the police station she wondered what billy marr was going to say chapter three another talk with billy marr billy marr is as mad as a tree full of monkeys said sergeant grant when logan arrived back at her office you found him then said logan he was just round the corner in a cafe on leith walk when he saw me go past he ran out after me shouting here i am here i am logan smiled at the thought but her face quickly became serious again youve had more to do with billy marr than me she said do you really think he could be a murderer sergeant grant was sixty and had lived and worked in edinburgh all his life logan had worked with him for the last four years and she knew he had an excellent memory and was a very good detective if there was anything useful to know about billy marr grant would know it ive known billy since he was a kid said grant and hes certainly an odd guy he was strange at school and hes even stranger now but could he kill someone grant shook his head i think its very unlikely he looked at logan admittedly the dead person is a young woman and i would guess that billys never had normal relationships with women but even so grant shook his head again id be very surprised if it was billy logan put her jacket over the back of her chair and moved towards the office door lets go and talk to him again she said and well have to try and forget about his regular visits here and keep an open mind do we know who the woman is yet asked grant no replied logan we havent found any id she looked out of the window at the darkening sky theyre still looking up on calton hill but itll soon be too dark an hour and half later logan and grant were still sitting with billy marr in a small interview room in the london road police station grant had taken his tie off and was sitting back in his chair logan had her elbows on the table her fingers together under her chin she was looking at marr who was sitting opposite her a cassette recorder was on the table recording their conversation logan spoke billy ive been patient for as long as i can but im beginning to get angry billy just looked at her without speaking logan continued you say you met this woman she was young and blonde and you strangled her on calton hill sometime in the early hours of this morning thats right said billy he was watching logan carefully as if he wasnt quite sure what she was going to do you see my problem is this continued logan you wont tell me where you met this woman or what you talked about you cant tell me who she was you havent told me how you managed to strangle her without her fighting back and leaving scratches on your face and youve told me that you killed her on calton hill but i know she wasnt killed there i killed her said billy i put my hands round her throat and strangled her he sat with his hands on his knees and looked at logan logan closed her eyes for a moment and then opened them again right she said her teeth pressed tightly together in anger im ending this interview billy im keeping you here tonight and ill want to talk to you again in the morning and im warning you i want the truth from you or youre going to be in serious trouble logan left the room with grant close behind her back in her office logan sat down heavily on her chair and threw her notebook on to the desk why does he do it she asked angrily not expecting an answer grant remained standing if you want my opinion he said i thought you were very patient logan looked up at him thanks she said just then there was a knock at the door and sergeant graham came into the room we managed to finish searching calton hill before it got dark he said and asked logan nothing im afraid there were a few old cigarette packets and things like that which weve sent to the scientists but id be surprised if they find anything and nobody there saw anything he put a piece of paper on logans desk names and addresses of the people who were there in case you need them logan gave the paper a quick look and then put it to one side it was unlikely to be useful but you could never be sure ok she said thanks for your help graham remained standing in the doorway is it right that youve been interviewing billy marr about this he asked logan looked up yes why she asked well i happened to see him last night where was this asked logan over on lothian road there was a bit of trouble in an indian restaurant we were called the trouble was nothing to do with him but he was in the restaurant what time was this asked logan about midnight he was still there when we left at one had he been there long do you think oh yes one of the waiters mentioned that hed come in early in the evening logan and grant looked at each other if he arrived early and was still there at one began grant then he cant be the killer so why does he say he is asked logan she looked at graham and grant but noone spoke she looked at her watch and took a deep breath right she said to graham send billy home but make sure he knows how angry i am and if i catch him in here again telling us about something he hasnt done tell him ill logan stopped to think about what she would do ill think of something said graham chapter four student life clare rutherford aged twentyfive she was a student at the university said logan it was nine oclock on friday morning logan was sitting at her desk sergeant grant had just come into the room how do we know he asked she shares a flat in marchmont with a girl called katie jardine jardine reported her missing this morning for many years the marchmont area had been popular with students a number of the university buildings were just a short walk away across an area of parkland called the meadows twentyfive is quite old for a student said grant research student explained logan she finished her degree course a couple of years ago and stayed on to do some research shes in the computer science department well she was what about jardine asked grant also a research student replied logan apparently rutherford was going to a concert at the usher hall on tuesday night jardine is from glasgow and was staying at her parents place in glasgow that night it was her fathers birthday she came back on wednesday afternoon and when rutherford hadnt appeared by late thursday evening she called the police are we sure its rutherford asked grant the body matches her description but we need to go over and talk to jardine now get someone to call the university or perhaps better still the computer science department and find out what they can rutherfords home address a photograph if they have one who directed her research who her friends were tell them we think shes missing but dont say we think shes dead not yet not until were absolutely certain its her ill meet you in the car park in five minutes marchmont road was a wide street with tall buildings on each side the flat that clare rutherford and katie jardine shared was a light and airy secondfloor apartment the living room contained a sofa a couple of armchairs and a tv but as the flat was always rented out to students the furniture was neither expensive nor tasteful when i got back on wednesday afternoon and she wasnt here i didnt think anything of it katie jardine was saying she was short with rather wild dark hair she wore blue jeans and a red sweater jardine continued but when she didnt come back on wednesday night i got worried i mean we always told each other if we were going to be away for the night she would at least have left a note im sure she would have you been in touch with any of her friends asked logan yes said jardine everyone i could think of noone saw her at the university on wednesday or thursday boyfriends asked grant no jardine shook her head and smiled at grant i mean its not as if guys arent interested in her shes very popular but well she always says she doesnt want to get tied down in a relationship not yet anyway shes from new zealand her grandparents were scots thats why she came here to university but even though shes been in scotland quite a while she hasnt decided if she wants to stay have you looked round the flat and in her room has anything been taken asked logan not that i can see all her things seem to be here do you have a photo of her asked logan no said jardine i dont but there are quite a few photos in her room there might be one of her there does she ever wear a pink tshirt and a dark blue skirt jardines hand went up to her mouth yes sometimes she said almost in a whisper and as she spoke a tear started down her cheek youve found her havent you logan put her hand on jardines arm were not sure about anything just yet she said gently is it ok if we have a look in her room when jardine nodded through her tears logan looked at grant who left the room to look round the rest of the flat half an hour later logan and grant were sitting in logans car on marchmont road grant was holding a list of the names and addresses of rutherfords friends that katie jardine had given him logan was looking at a photograph of clare rutherford that grant had found in her room apparently rutherfords supervisor is a guy called dr david balfour said logan he directs a lot of the research in the computer science department logan reached up to get her seat belt and pull it down hes got an office in kings buildings out on west mains road she continued i suggest we go and see him were going to need someone to look at the body and tell us for certain that its clare rutherford we cant really ask katie jardine can we no said grant it would break the poor girls heart at least we think it would said logan grant looked at her sharply im sure youre right she said but we still need to check that katie jardine was at her parents house on tuesday night true said grant one of the reasons that logan was such a good detective was that she was careful she checked everything even the obvious logan looked at the photograph again for a moment and said perhaps we should think about giving this photo to the newspapers and television and asking for help from the public weve very little information so far we dont know where she met her killer where she was killed or why grant looked at logan she was staring out of the car window watching two boys kicking a football along the pavement she had a good relationship with journalists well with one journalist really it was a relationship that had been helpful in the past logan smiled at grant and then started the car ok lets go and see dr balfour while were getting there use your phone get someone to go to the usher hall to find out about the concert on tuesday evening see if they can find out where rutherford was sitting and who was sitting near her maybe she met someone at the concert grant took his phone out of his pocket and logan headed the car south along marchmont road chapter five clare rutherfords supervisor kings buildings was a collection of ugly modern buildings set very close together in an area off west mains road dr david balfours office was in the james clerk maxwell building it was a grey twostorey block with tall narrow windows named after a famous nineteenthcentury scottish physicist the building contained the universitys computer science department and a sign on the door read edinburgh regional computing centre when logan introduced herself and sergeant grant balfour came round from behind his desk to shake their hands his actions were friendly but he didnt smile and to logan his eyes seemed to be grey careful and rather cold he was much older than her and had black rather oily hair combed very flat across his head he was wearing an old dark brown patterned jacket and light brown trousers which looked as if they hadnt been cleaned for a long time please he waved a hand at two chairs in front of his desk do sit down how can i help he moved back and sat on the front edge of his desk grant gave a small cough looking out of the corner of her eye logan saw that grant had moved away from the chairs a little and wasnt going to sit down logan decided to remain standing too she was as tall as david balfour but if she sat he would be looking down at her that was an advantage she did not want him to have thank you she said ill stand balfour said nothing he looked at grant and then back at logan and smiled not nervously thought logan which was what most people did when the police walked in it was more of an unpleasant smile dr balfour im afraid ive got some bad news for you said logan oh replied balfour and the smile dropped from his face i understand you direct the work of a research student called clare rutherford logan paused as balfour nodded agreement well logan continued we found a dead body on calton hill yesterday evening which we believe to be her oh no balfours hand went up to his mouth god thats awful poor clare logan watched him carefully he was saying all the right words but his eyes seemed to be without feeling perhaps they were always like that then for a moment he looked as though he was going to cry logan and grant looked at each other how did she die was she murdered asked balfour logan looked back at balfour yes she was she said oh no how awful said balfour he looked out of the window lifted his head and bit his bottom lip you directed her research said logan inviting him to tell her more well yes i did said balfour turning back to logan his eyes still seemed watchful he went on i have a number of students working on different research programmes i check how they are getting on make sure they know what theyre supposed to be doing make sure they explore all the right areas and of course if they have any problems research problems or personal problems they can always come and talk to me logan wondered if students would want to take their personal problems to someone like balfour he did not seem an especially caring sort of person and did she have any asked logan did clare rutherford have any problems not that i know of said balfour raising his eyebrows a little she was very adult very intelligent popular asked grant yes she seemed to have a lot of friends a favourite one asked grant you mean a boyfriend asked balfour his mouth unsmiling his eyes still empty of feeling not that i know of no and how did you get on with her logan asked very well said balfour his eyes narrowing a little undoubtedly he realised that he was now part of a murder investigation and that the police might be thinking that he was the murderer she was an excellent student hardworking intelligent yes excellent and her research continued logan what was it about she was looking into wireless technology ways of running computers and other sorts of hardware without having them physically joined together by wires i see not knowing much about how computers worked logan didnt see at all but she wasnt going to tell balfour that she would find out later did you meet her outside the university she asked looking balfour straight in the eye balfour said nothing as he returned logans look i dont think thats any of your business he finally answered quietly this is a murder investigation said logan equally quietly everything is my business did you meet her outside the university i took her out for dinner once or twice but i do that with all my research students i find it leads to a better relationship but its just dinner balfours eyes were hard now nothing else ok said logan easily now i understand that ms rutherfords parents are in new zealand yes replied balfour the thing is she began we need someone to look at the body and tell us for certain that its her the colour started to leave david balfours face her parents are not in this country we feel it would be very difficult to ask one of her friends so we were wondering im sorry to have to ask you to do this but we really do need your help chapter six getting help balfour had not wanted to see clare rutherfords dead body but logan had pointed out that as no relatives were available and as he was her supervisor he was the obvious person to ask finally they agreed a time for him to visit the london road police station as they were walking down the steps in front of the james clerk maxwell building grant turned to logan its difficult to know what to make of him he said how do you mean asked logan well he seemed quite friendly and helpful except when you asked if he met rutherford outside the university though the fact that he wasnt so helpful then is perhaps understandable said grant but said logan but his eyes said grant leaving the sentence unfinished as they reached their car yes his eyes said logan opening the door and getting in she smiled at grant and started the car you find out about balfour his home life his relationship with his students that sort of thing she said and ill find out about his research on their way back to the police station the car phone rang logan turned on the speaker logan she said jenny its helen robertson said a voice from the speaker hi helen said logan what have you got for me not much im afraid jenny said robertson ive got no improvement on the time of death about eighteen to twenty hours before she was found and as we thought she was strangled the only injuries are the bang on the back of the head and those that came from being strangled so it definitely wasnt a sex attack what was she hit with asked logan something wooden said robertson possibly even just a piece of wood you can see the square shape on her head where it hit her and ive found a few tiny pieces of wood in her hair her clothes asked logan again not much said robertson the clothes are very ordinary and certainly hers theres nothing there to help find the killer except yes there were some tiny bits of a sort of orange material sticking to the back of her tshirt and her skirt what is it asked logan well from what i can tell its some sort of roof insulation material you know the stuff that people put in the roofs of their houses to stop the heat escaping in winter i dont know how that might help you logan was quiet for a moment then she spoke i guess it means that either she was kept in a shop or somewhere where they keep that sort of stuff or else the murderer kept her in the roof of his house she stopped speaking again for a moment while she thought then she said helen if we find more of that material can you match it to what you found on clare rutherfords body well yes she said i can match it to similar material but this stuff is everywhere however if you find where she was kept ill almost certainly be able to show that she was there ok thatll be useful thanks for phoning helen said logan and she turned off the phone it was midday when they arrived back at london road grant went to find out more about david balfour and logan asked sergeant graham to organise a team of officers to interview clare rutherfords friends then she went up to her office to arrange some help sitting at her desk logan picked up the phone and tried a number she knew well tam macdonald scottish daily news tam my dear said logan its jenny jenny said tam his voice warm and friendly how are you not great actually said logan and im ringing to ask for some help when logans friendship with tam macdonald a journalist had first come to the attention of logans senior officers they had not liked the situation at all they liked it even less when the friendship developed into a more serious relationship but they had to admit that it had not yet been a problem in fact just over a year ago tam had saved the police a lot of time by finding a criminal who had recently escaped from prison whats the problem jenny asked tam you dont sound your usual self tam macdonald usually joked with logan about the police asking journalists for help however he realised from logans voice that this was not a good time im sure i dont replied logan im working on the calton hill murder the main problem is information we think we know who the girl is now but logan pushed her fingers back through her hair its just taking a long time to find out anything i mean shes been dead for thirtysix hours and her name is about the only useful piece of information we have that doesnt sound like the jenny logan i know said tam youre not usually so pessimistic tell me how i can help and then ill take you out tonight to cheer you up the following day clare rutherfords picture was on the front page of the scottish daily news tam obviously had friends in television too as the photo appeared on a number of television news programmes anyone who had seen her on the tuesday evening of her disappearance was asked to ring the london road police station police were especially interested in anyone who had seen her at the usher hall or between the usher hall and marchmont after the concert a team of officers spent the weekend answering calls although grant and logan investigated the more interesting ones they got no further in finding the murderer then on sunday evening there was another disappearance chapter seven another student disappears frances stewart said sergeant grant reading logan information from his notebook called fran by her friends aged twentyfive university student she has a room in a flat in the new town drummond place the owner of the flat a mrs dalwhinnie rang in a few moments ago apparently fran went out to a party last night and she hasnt been back since the party was at the home of one of her university teachers she might have just met some guy at the party said logan and gone back to his place i suggested that to mrs dalwhinnie said grant with a small smile and she told me at some length what is wrong with the world today mrs dalwhinnie has a loud voice and strong feelings about what is right and wrong logan smiled apparently grant continued fran stewart is the perfect young lady her parents are friends of mrs dalwhinnie and she and mrs dalwhinnie go to church together every sunday evening thats why mrs dalwhinnie is sure that fran is missing grant spoke in a different voice obviously trying to sound like mrs dalwhinnie my fran would never miss a sunday evening without telling me logan smiled again and stood up i think wed better go and have a word with her i thought you might say that said grant shes expecting us the new town is the part of edinburgh immediately north of princes street it is still called the new town even though it is over two hundred years old in some ways it is the most beautiful part of the city it has wide streets and large squares with grand houses built around private parks mrs dalwhinnies flat was in one of these big houses mrs dalwhinnie was a big woman in her late fifties she was wearing a grey dress with a grey pink and blue scarf around her neck she had attractive shoulderlength grey hair and wore halfmoon glasses on the end of her rather large nose i hope you are not intending to repeat any of the suggestions about frans behaviour that your sergeant mentioned over the phone said mrs dalwhinnie in her rather loud voice just because some young people have no idea how to behave properly it doesnt mean that everyone is the same indeed mrs dalwhinnie said logan sergeant grant didnt mean to suggest that ms stewart would misbehave in any way he was just exploring the possibility that there was another explanation for her disappearance they were sitting in the living room in mrs dalwhinnies flat in drummond place the room was tasteful with expensive oldfashioned furniture a piano in one corner and a large desk covered with papers in another corner you told sergeant grant that ms stewart went to a party last night continued logan yes said mrs dalwhinnie she went with some of her friends from university it was at the house of someone called kenneth henderson hes her research supervisor shes not a student you see shes a research assistant a very clever girl cleverer than her supervisor if you ask me logan smiled where was the party she asked hope terrace said mrs dalwhinnie passing logan a piece of paper ive written the address down here for you thank you said logan taking the paper whats ms stewart researching she asked something to do with computers said mrs dalwhinnie but i dont know too much about it logan and grant looked at each other has she ever mentioned someone called david balfour dr david balfour asked sergeant grant mrs dalwhinnie thought for a moment i dont think so she started slowly but its possible we dont talk a lot about what she does because as i say i dont really understand it logan was quiet for a moment thinking how strange it was that both rutherford and stewart were researching similar areas was it possible they were part of the same research programme did she know a girl called clare rutherford asked grant you mean the girl who was found on calton hill yes said grant nodding no said mrs dalwhinnie we talked about that of course fran knew who she was but she didnt really know her grant had no more questions so he looked across at logan how did ms stewart go to the party asked logan she walked said mrs dalwhinnie even though clare rutherford had recently been murdered mrs dalwhinnie seemed to sit up even straighter inspector we cannot hide ourselves away we cannot let a handful of criminals stop us from going about our daily lives fran walked everywhere in edinburgh its one of the nice things about edinburgh dont you think although its a city its small enough to walk just about everywhere logan agreed but she didnt say so instead she asked and would she have walked home afterwards of course even if it was very late asked logan yes said mrs dalwhinnie looking away from logan for the first time and out of the window we always said that the streets of edinburgh were safer than in other cities inspector im just hoping we were right her voice was not quite as strong as before before they left logan asked for a photograph of fran stewart from mrs dalwhinnie she also told her that they would make every effort to find the missing girl on the pavement outside logan looked at her watch it was already seven thirty lets go and talk to kenneth henderson she said then we might as well go home chapter eight the party at hope terrace late on sunday evening there wasnt much traffic on the way across town to hope terrace a cold wind had started to blow in from the east and most people were spending the evening inside in the warm although hope terrace was in the marchmont area it was very different from the street where clare rutherford had lived these were houses for the rich not for students you can almost smell the money said grant breathing in through his nose as he pushed the doorbell kenneth henderson answered the door wearing a light blue denim shirt and dark blue jeans with a light brown leather belt he had bright blue eyes and dark brown hair that was quite long and combed back over his ears he was in his early thirties and handsome and he knew it he opened the door wide looked first at logan then at grant and then back at logan kenneth henderson asked logan yes said henderson inspector logan and sergeant grant said logan wed like to ask you a few questions sure of course come in come in said henderson logan and grant walked through a large square hall into a bright room with a light wooden floor the furniture was all light wood too with bright blue and yellow covers on the chairs and the sofa logan noticed a photograph lying on one of the tables it was of henderson with an attractive young woman they had their arms round each other and were laughing henderson waved towards the chairs sit down he said sitting down in an armchair himself and looking at logan whats this all about i understand you had a party last night said logan yes said henderson oh i hope the neighbours havent been complaining about the noise again not that i know of said logan but a young girl who came to the party hasnt been home since fran stewart fran said henderson yes she was here she left fairly early as i remember about one oclock i happened to notice what the time was when she came to say goodbye but nobody else left until about four in the morning henderson seemed quite relaxed did you know clare rutherford asked logan suddenly oh god henderson sat forward you dont think the same thing has happened to fran were keeping an open mind said logan watching him carefully but were giving it our full attention well yes i can understand that replied henderson getting comfortable in the armchair again so repeated logan did you know clare rutherford well sure i knew who she was but we never had anything to do with each other professionally or privately said henderson giving logan a big smile who else was at your party asked logan people from the university said henderson students teachers david balfour asked grant yes david was here for a time henderson smiled again but hes not really a party animal he probably left early what do you mean probably asked grant henderson looked at grant grant was sixty with thick black hair and a large black moustache his clothes as always looked rather old a blue jacket and grey trousers he did not look much a party animal either well i dont check when my guests arrive and leave said henderson and some people just leave when they want to go home they dont come and say goodbye anyway sometimes i can be difficult to find again he looked at logan raised his eyebrows and gave her a big smile i sometimes end up in the bedroom logan looked at henderson but did not smile she was attractive and she knew it but being attractive was not always a help to a police officer because she was good looking people did not always take her seriously she did not like it when that happened your girlfriend she pointed at the photograph on the table exgirlfriend said henderson stretching lazily and putting his hands behind his head still looking at logan he continued the position of girlfriend is open at the moment its a great opportunity for the right woman a difficult position to fill i would think she said rather sharply grant looked across logan never got angry even when questioning difficult people but there was always a first time henderson laughed and looked a little uncertain perhaps youd be kind enough to give sergeant grant a list of everyone who was at your party said logan then she stood up and started looking at the pictures and the books in the room her lips pressed tightly together in a little pile she found three photographs she picked the photos up and looked at them henderson with three different young women obviously the position of girlfriend wasnt so difficult to fill even though henderson was in her opinion far too pleased with himself silently logan warned herself to be careful she must not allow any dislike of henderson to affect the investigation she heard henderson finish the list of names i understand ms stewart was a research assistant what was she like asked logan looking down at henderson hardworking replied henderson thoughtfully hardworking and not much fun a bit too serious really then he smiled at logan i mean i invited her because i work with her but i was surprised when she turned up she really needs someone to show her how to have a good time logan said nothing she just placed the photos carefully on the table by hendersons chair thank you for your help she said well be back if this becomes a murder investigation logan said nothing on the way back to the london road police station neither did grant when they arrived there it was almost nine oclock as logan turned off the car engine she asked what have you found out about david balfour only that he doesnt have a criminal record said grant but ive got a cousin who works in the university and im meeting him for a drink in half an hour ask him about henderson too said logan chapter nine another talk with david balfour monday morning started badly for logan and soon got worse her kettle broke while she was making breakfast so she couldnt make a cup of tea she then found she had set her video recorder wrongly and it had not recorded a programme that she wanted to watch things soon got much worse when she arrived at the london road police station she was told that frances stewart had been found dead near craigmillar park golf course driving out to the golf course grant told logan what he had discovered about david balfour and henderson apparently theres a big question about balfours job at the moment the university want to kick him out but theyre having to be very careful whys that asked logan well they want him out because hes not doing his job hes ok at teaching and getting his students through their exams but these days universities expect their staff to bring in money from research especially the computer science staff new technology makes good money and balfour isnt bringing in good money no said grant he isnt bringing in any money so why are they having to be careful asked logan well his wife died last year after a long illness ah said logan wondering if that explained his strange behaviour and dirty clothes everyone feels that his work has been poor because of that explained grant i see said logan a difficult situation and what about henderson it seems hes the golden boy of the computer science department said grant logan made an impolite noise to show that she did not share this opinion hes popular with students and staff and he gets good results but more importantly he manages to bring in a lot of money to the university grant said nothing for a moment then looked at logan and smiled but he said logan smiled and waited for grant to go on she was pleased that there was a but about kenneth henderson some people wonder if all the money that should go to the university from hendersons work does actually go to the university you mean the big house suggested logan exactly continued grant not many people can afford a big house in hope terrace on a university salary and a research percentage whats a research percentage asked logan well if a researcher develops something that the university then sells the university keeps a third of the money the researchers university department gets a third and the final third goes to the researcher i see said logan some people think henderson is making too much money that he must be keeping some back from the university and grant paused again to let logan enjoy the fact that there was more to come some people think he has not been completely honest about his research how do you mean asked logan well last year the university sold a computer program to an american company there was some disagreement about who developed the program henderson or one of his students in effect people are saying he has stolen research from his students logan was quiet for a few minutes after grant finished talking finally she spoke i need to find out more about what these girls were researching it might be important also we need to know where balfour was when clare rutherford was murdered and what time he left hendersons party and where he went we didnt ask him before but then we didnt know frances stewart was dead right said grant by the way weve checked and katie jardine was with her parents last tuesday night logan and grant arrived at the craigmillar park golf course shortly after helen robertson the police doctor the body was in a group of trees not far from the road it was also not far from kings buildings thought logan and that might well be important robertson was bent over the body as logan and grant reached the trees she heard them arrive but did not look up eventually she completed her examination and stood up im afraid it looks very similar to the last one she said off the record id say youre looking for the same person who killed the girl at calton hill i might be able to be certain later the three of them stood looking out over edinburgh for a moment arthurs seat with its mountainous parkland was away to the left craigmillar castle in the distance in front of them logan wondered who they were looking for and why was this person killing was it to do with sex murder often was or was there another reason money for example or could it be professional jealousy she took a deep breath and turned to look at the body she recognised the face from the photo that mrs dalwhinnie had given her even though the girls tongue was sticking out and her face was blue round her mouth and lips like clare rutherford frances stewart had been a pretty young woman slim and with long waistlength red hair she lay now in a light green blouse and a long dark green skirt her beautiful hair falling over the green grass tell me about it said logan she was strangled too said robertson but this time it looks as if the killer didnt use their hands they might have used a scarf or a belt or something like that ill tell you more when ive examined the body time of death about midnight last night give or take half an hour each way ok said logan again there are no scratches on the body and no signs of any sexual activity that i can see though of course that doesnt mean that sex wasnt a reason behind the murder true said logan its always a possibility anyway said robertson ill get you my report as soon as i can oh and as before her hands have been tied at some time thanks helen logan turned to grant organise a search of the area then well go and see dr balfour again logan and grant found david balfour in his office on west mains road he appeared to be wearing the same clothes as the last time they had met as at their earlier meeting logan preferred to stand not giving balfour the opportunity to look down at her also as at their last meeting she found his eyes odd im afraid weve got some more questions for you dr balfour she began never mind inspector said balfour this time he had remained seated at his desk im happy to help you if i can logan continued first of all wed like to know where you were last tuesday evening and then wed like to know where you were between ten and midnight on wednesday evening let me think said balfour pushing his hair back with his hand on tuesday evening i went to the usher hall there was an irish band playing that i wanted to see grant and logan looked at each other who did you go with asked logan noone replied balfour i went on my own what did you do after the concert asked logan i went home said balfour on my own did you see clare rutherford at the concert no i didnt know she was interested in irish music said balfour then suddenly he realised the importance of logans questions and his hand flew up to his mouth oh god was she at that concert before she disappeared he asked how awful youre sure you didnt see her there asked grant balfour just shook his head and looked rather sadly at the desk in front of him and what about between ten and midnight on wednesday evening asked logan balfour thought for a moment i was having a drink with some friends in mathers mathers was a bar in the west end of edinburgh till when asked logan about eleven thirty said balfour still looking down at the desk names and addresses said logan balfour gave the names and addresses of three other university teachers and grant wrote them in his notebook the other question said logan is what time did you leave the party on saturday night balfour looked up quickly what party he asked kenneth hendersons party you were there werent you asked logan but it wasnt a question how do you know logan and grant said nothing they just looked at balfour and waited balfour looked from one to the other and realised he wasnt going to get an answer to his question i left about twelve thirty said balfour i dont like parties much and afterwards asked grant afterwards i went straight home do you know someone called fran stewart frances stewart asked logan i know the name because shes in the computer department but i dont know her she works for kenneth why so you didnt speak to her at the party on saturday night asked logan not that i know of said balfour logan took the photograph of fran stewart out of her pocket and passed it to balfour balfour took the photo and gave it a quick look yes thats her he said but i certainly didnt speak to her to be honest i dont even remember her being there logan took the photo back balfour looked up why are you asking these questions he asked because fran stewart disappeared when she left that party and we found her body this morning said logan shes been murdered too logan looked hard at balfour he shook his head slowly from side to side a look of disbelief on his face chapter ten crossing the city logan asked grant to drive back to the london road police station she opened the car window and took some deep breaths even though it was a cool autumn day there are some things that need checking she said to grant find out where balfour was sitting in the usher hall i want to know if he could have seen clare rutherford while he was there find out whos interviewing the other guests at hendersons party and make sure they ask if anyone saw balfour and fran stewart in conversation at any time and finally get hold of billy marr again billy marr asked grant in surprise yes i get the feeling he must have seen clare rutherfords body on calton hill said logan what i cant work out at the moment is why he thinks he killed her grant smiled he had almost completely forgotten about billy marr but it was no surprise to him that logan hadnt she often followed unusual lines of thought and said logan as ideas continued to hurry into her mind lets get a list of all the researchers in the computer science department and their supervisors i dont know what were looking for but it might be worth a try they pulled into the car park at the police station and got out of the car and get some lunch said logan then well go and see henderson ive got some more questions for golden boy grant smiled he went off to do what logan had asked him to while she went upstairs to her office at first she just stood and looked out of the window there was a park on the other side of the road and children played in it at all times of the year in sunshine snow or even rain she looked at the children playing there today and wondered what type of adults they would become adults who worked slept and played or adults who stole fought and killed she had been investigating murder cases for four years now the job didnt seem to get any easier she still found it difficult to accept the idea that one person could take another persons life but they did she turned to look back into the room on one wall was a large map of edinburgh she walked over to it and found the important places in the case calton hill the craigmillar park golf course her finger ran over the map where had the killer met these girls she wondered was it at the same place still thinking about this question she picked up a pencil from her desk clare rutherford was walking back from the usher hall to her flat in marchmont logan drew a line from the usher hall to marchmont road fran stewart was walking back to drummond place from the party in hope terrace logan drew a line from drummond place to hope terrace where did the lines cross the meadows people did not walk in straight lines though thought logan and she looked again at the map working out the way that each girl might have chosen to walk home would they both have walked through the meadows yes they might was that where the killer met them it was as likely as anywhere else she thought just then the phone rang it was helen robertson exactly the same as on calton hill said robertson everything the same the bang on the head the hands tied she was strangled and theres that roof insulation material on the blouse and skirt ok thanks said logan she picked the phone up again immediately to call tam macdonald tam she said im afraid i need your help again ok jenny he replied and if theres a story for me at the end that would be good too logan smiled to herself tam ever the journalist she told him a bit about the recent developments in the case and explained some of her thoughts to him what id like you to do she continued is to chat to some people up at the university and find out whats going on in the computer science department both the dead girls were doing research up there id be happy to jenny said tam but why dont you do it yourself it is a murder inquiry after all you can ask anybody anything true said logan but first of all i dont understand much about computers and you do and secondly people are not so free with information when theyre talking to the police but if a journalist was writing about how the university is at the cutting edge of developments in computer science they might tell me all sorts of things they wouldnt tell you finished tam at three oclock logan checked that henderson would be at home on their way over to hope terrace logan explained to grant her thoughts about the meadows its quite well lit the meadows said grant i mean there arent many dark corners where you can hit someone over the head tie them up and take them away no said logan i dont think thats what happened i think the killer must have picked the girls up there and taken them somewhere else either the killer is very good at persuading people to go with him or else the killer knew both the girls and the girls werent afraid of him or her finished grant right said logan now fran stewart went missing on a saturday night i think its very unlikely that there would be any sort of regular pattern of movement through the meadows on a saturday night you know people who go through at the same time every saturday theres just people going out to pubs and clubs and restaurants which they may or may not have done the week before but rutherford went missing on a tuesday night said grant exactly said logan and its tuesday again tomorrow tuesdays are far less busy than saturdays and there may be regular traffic people going to and from work regular tuesday activities that sort of thing so tomorrow evening from lets say nine thirty to twelve thirty i want to stop everyone in the meadows and ask them if they saw anything unusual the week before ok said grant as they pulled in outside hendersons house ill get that organised for tomorrow evening chapter eleven a slow investigation ah the lovely inspector logan said henderson smiling at her as he opened his front door he was wearing a pink shirt light brown trousers with a brown leather belt and brown shoes his teeth were a bright white logan did not smile back i said wed be back if this became a murder investigation she said it has oh said henderson the smile disappeared from his face and he opened the door wider so that logan and grant could enter the house the living room looked exactly the same as the last time logan and grant had been there except for a copy of the scottish daily news on the table logan sat on the blue and yellow sofa henderson took an armchair near her grant stood by the door mr henderson began logan please call me kenneth said henderson logan looked henderson straight in the eye getting friendly with henderson was the last thing on her mind keeping a professional distance seemed a much better idea mr henderson she continued what time did your party start henderson said nothing for a moment he looked a little disappointed that logan had refused to use his first name out of the corner of her eye logan could see grant smiling to himself henderson coughed about eleven oclock he said a crowd of us went to the pub first then we came back here and a few more people arrived later when did fran stewart arrive she got to the pub amine thirty something like that said henderson i really cant remember and balfour i should think about eleven thirty as i remember he didnt come along to the pub first he usually just comes for a short time so that people see him then he leaves like i said before he doesnt like parties much did you see balfour and stewart talking to each other no i dont think so replied henderson looking out of the window as he thought about his answer not that i remember anyway ok said logan who did speak to her then henderson opened his arms wide come on inspector i cant remember that i understand this is a murder investigation and im very sorry about fran but i really cant remember who talked to who on saturday night logan said nothing waiting henderson stood up and walked over to the window he turned back to look at her down at the pub everybody spoke to everybody we were standing up and moving around all the time when we came back here i was too busy making sure everyone had a drink and something to eat and was looking happy henderson walked back to his armchair and sat down again i spoke to fran for about five minutes in the pub about her research and for about two minutes here when she came to say goodbye other than that i really didnt notice her like i said she was a bit too serious logan sat back on the sofa and crossed one knee over the other she brushed the leg of her trousers with one hand i understand you make a lot of money for the university she said yes replied henderson looking rather pleased with himself you must make quite a bit for yourself too said logan waving a hand to show that she was talking about the house oh no henderson pointed at her no no i know some people think im taking money that should really go to the university but thats not true the house and everything here used to belong to my parents theyre both dead and the house is mine i get a university salary and a third of any money that my research makes for the university thats the arrangement with the university and im happy with that he moved forward to the edge of the chair and while were talking about my work you will also find people who say that i have stolen research from students and told people it was mine and thats not true either i take it said logan of course not henderson was very certain there are often grey areas about whose research is whose especially when people are supervising researchers but i always try to be extremely honest about it logan said nothing she just looked at henderson for a moment it was impossible to know if he was telling the truth or not sometimes she knew when people were lying or telling the truth but not always then she asked what exactly are you and your team researching at the moment computer security new ways of keeping information safe ways of stopping hackers you know people who get into computers to find out or steal information that they shouldnt have mm said logan hoping that tam got back to her quickly about the research going on at the university what about david balfour she continued i understand he doesnt make as much money for the university as you do henderson took a deep breath poor david he said shaking his head hes a nice enough guy but hes had a bad few years what with his wife being ill and then dying to be honest the university is not very happy with him at the moment logan was silent for a moment thinking about hendersons answer then changing the subject she asked now what about last wednesday between ten and twelve in the evening where were you then last wednesday said henderson his eyes moving quickly from side to side as he thought about the question i was here at home preparing classes for the next day suddenly he realised why logan had asked the question hey he said is that when clare rutherford died his face started to go red you cant think i had anything to do with that he stood up angrily thats crazy anyone with you here on wednesday night asked logan standing up herself no replied henderson logan said nothing but just raised her eyebrows hendersons shoulders went down no noone was with me he said more quietly but i had nothing to do with clare rutherfords death i promise you back at london road logan and grant sat in her office drinking tea and thinking about the case there was a knock at the door and sergeant graham came in he was wearing jeans and a black tshirt under the same brown leather jacket he had been wearing when he had met logan on calton hill weve found out where balfour was sitting in the usher hall said graham he had a number of pieces of paper in his hand which he looked at from time to time as he was speaking the ticket office keeps all its records on computer he and rutherford were in different parts of the hall and on different levels she was at the top in the cheap seats and he was at ground floorlevel near the back its possible they saw each other but we cant say for certain graham paused waiting to see if logan or grant had any questions they didnt weve also talked to everyone who was at kenneth hendersons party he continued and weve had no luck there quite a few people talked to fran stewart quite a few people saw her talking to other people nobody saw her talking to david balfour everyone said she was nice but serious nobody was seen trying to chat her up and nobody left the party with her were quite sure about that some of the other girls were in the hall when she left things arent getting any easier are they logan said worse actually said graham we cant find billy marr what said grant and logan at the same time and sat forward in their chairs well hes not at home said graham and he hasnt been home all day weve also had a look in some of the places where he usually spends time but so far no luck lines appeared on logans forehead as she thought about this development eventually she shook her head as if clearing her brain and said ok just keep looking for him give his description to all the police officers out on the streets tonight let them know that were looking for him ok madam said graham and finally we have the list of researchers he gave some papers to logan and some to grant i made copies for both of you good said logan both of you have a look through these she looked at grant and graham take them away and go through them if you find anything interesting let me know immediately if not ill see you tomorrow morning grant and graham left the room logan put the pile of papers on her desk and turned to look out of the window perhaps they would find out something useful at the meadows the following night logan certainly hoped so it had been almost a week since clare rutherford had disappeared rutherford was now dead and so was frances stewart the longer an investigation continued the less chance there was of finding the murderer chapter twelve an evening on the meadows the bruntsfield hotel not far from the meadows is a large comfortable hotel in bruntsfield place a kilometre or two south of princes street the hotel bar called the kings bar is on the lower ground floor and has an entrance down some steps from the small car park at the front of the hotel at eight thirty on tuesday evening logan and grant were sitting in the bar they had spent the morning sorting through the mountain of paper that the case was producing most of this was interview reports there were interviews with people who were at the usher hall interviews with friends of clare rutherford and frances stewart and interviews with the guests at kenneth hendersons party the two police officers had spent the afternoon making arrangements for the evenings activity they intended to stop everyone who passed through the meadows that tuesday and find out if they had been there the week before grant was dressed in his usual grey trousers and blue jacket logan was wearing a dark grey jacket and trousers and a peachcoloured blouse she wore small earrings of a scottish design but no makeup logan didnt often wear makeup and never at work in front of grant was a large glass of orange juice logan was drinking tomato juice having spent the whole day discussing the case they had now moved on to talking about grants garden grants nephews and nieces and what he and mrs grant were going to do when he retired in three months time grant was sixty years old and was stopping work at the end of the year logan picked up her drink and finished it she looked at her watch ok she said lets go and see who can remember what they saw this time last week there are a number of paths across the meadows with trees along them and a road melville drive between the meadows and another green area of parkland called bruntsfield links police officers were stopping everyone both in cars and on foot they showed photos not just of clare rutherford but also of frances stewart and asked people if they had seen either of them they asked especially if people had seen clare rutherford some time after the concert the week before logan and grant spent their time moving between the different groups of officers and keeping up to date with what was happening as logan drew near one of these groups she heard a voice she recognised i think youll find that i dont need to answer these questions ive already spoken to inspector logan at some length the voice was saying it was kenneth henderson and he was wearing an expensive and very fashionable brown leather coat he hadnt seen logan arrive but turned as soon as he heard her voice i think youll find you do need to answer these questions mr henderson she said we have discussed wednesday evening as i remember but not tuesday evening where were you then henderson looked at logan inspector on tuesday evenings i always play squash at the lothian squash club on coates crescent until what time asked logan it depends said henderson what time did you leave the club last week henderson thought for a moment i stayed for a drink afterwards i guess i left about ten thirty and you walked back this way along lothian road past the usher hall and up here across the meadows yes said henderson i always do did you see clare rutherford as you were walking home last week as logan asked the question one of the police officers held forward a photograph of clare rutherford for henderson to see henderson waved it away i know what she looks like he said impatiently and then corrected himself in a more gentle voice looked like he looked at logan no he said i didnt see her logan looked at henderson for a long time without speaking he had been walking past the usher hall at about the time that clare rutherford had disappeared he might have been at home on his own when she was killed but he might not frances stewart had disappeared after leaving his party he had certainly had the opportunity but why would he have killed these two women his love life seemed important to him had he asked both women out and they had refused him it seemed unlikely he had suggested that he was interested in logan but hadnt been especially worried when she had not shown similar interest in him was it something to do with research at the university was that really likely she could take him down to london road for further questioning or she could make him sweat for a bit she decided to make him sweat mr henderson she said you must admit it seems odd that frances stewart disappeared after your party and clare rutherford disappeared when you were both in approximately the same place id like you to pop into london road police station tomorrow sometime for a further chat about all this henderson took a deep breath at a time that suits you said logan say four oclock tomorrow afternoon and logan turned and walked on to the next group of police officers the questioning continued through the evening but they got no more information at twelve thirty logan walked over to a group of people standing on melville drive she intended to thank the police officers for giving up their evening and to tell them to go home however as she reached the group she saw a face she recognised its katie jardine isnt it she asked oh inspector logan hello said jardine her hair was very wild today how are you have you got any further with your investigation no not yet but were still working on the case said logan and then looked at the girl who was with katie jardine jardine noticed logans look this is karen she said karen ramsay shes a friend of mine karen ramsay was easily cm tall logan thought and she was big too she looked older than katie jardine probably in her late twenties but most noticeable of all she had long blonde hair and an extraordinarily beautiful face logan smiled at ramsay then looked back at jardine and said on your way home yes she said weve just been to the cinema we stopped for a drink on the way back jardine looked up at ramsay as she spoke oh i see said logan turning to karen ramsay are you a research student at the university too yes i work there parttime as well she added ramsays voice was deep with a west coast accent she looked logan straight in the eye when she spoke to her it was a look that made logan feel a little uncomfortable as if she shouldnt be asking ramsay questions oh yes said logan asking for more information without actually making it a direct question the fact that she felt uncomfortable didnt stop her questions it made her more interested in searching for information karen teaches at the university said katie logan noticed grant look more closely at ramsay and begin to take more interest in the conversation just a few hours a week said ramsay im really doing research for a phd a doctorate you want to become a doctor asked logan yes said ramsay a doctor of computer science oh said logan you work in the computer department yes said ramsay right said logan thoughtfully so whats your research all about ramsay looked down at jardine and then back at logan she smiled how much do you know about computers inspector not much replied logan but i just wondered if your research was related in any way to what clare rutherford and frances stewart were doing the effect of ramsays stare was almost physical to logan not really said ramsay i only knew a little about what they were doing people dont talk too much about their research not until the research is finished anyway professional competition asked logan sort of said ramsay her eyes not leaving logans it has been known for people to steal ideas as a result researchers dont usually talk too much about their work i imagine you knew clare rutherford since she shared a flat with ms jardine of course said ramsay you werent by any chance in this part of town a week ago were you asked logan she looked directly at karen ramsay as she spoke actually yes said ramsay i usually work at the bruntsfield hotel in the restaurant on tuesday evenings ive got a week off which is why im not there this evening i was probably coming home about this time again logan felt uncomfortable as ramsay looked her in the eye and did you see clare as you were going home asked logan im afraid not said ramsay logan looked at her watch ok thanks for your help she said youd better get off home thanks and good luck with the investigation said jardine as the two women setoff towards marchmont logan watched them walk away and then turned to grant what did you think of karen ramsay she asked shes tall said grant smiling you got interested at one point in the conversation though said logan seriously yes said grant that was when the university and the computer department were mentioned again but i cant see how it could be important nor can i said logan pushing her fingers back through her hair and she was happy to tell us she was here last week i just found her a little well i cant explain perhaps its nothing to do with the case anyway odd that shes working said grant not really replied logan students often have to work their way through university even phd students a bit of teaching at the university a bit of waitressing its quite normal really logan looked round the meadows there werent many people still around at this time of night right she said i think were finished here not that weve got any further send everyone home and ill see you in the morning chapter thirteen computer technology wednesday morning was bright and sunny but the weather did not make logan feel any better to try and make herself feel a bit happier she wore a greenyblue scarf tam had given her last year eating her breakfast logan thought over everything that had happened during the last nine days she didnt seem to be getting anywhere she still didnt know where the girls had been killed or why the three hours spent at the meadows the evening before had seemed largely a waste of time kenneth henderson was coming in for questioning but even though she disliked him she did not feel that he was the person she was looking for karen ramsay was a strange new addition to the case and logan knew that she would have to find out more about the tall girl from the west coast but could ramsay have killed the two young women was it really likely logan shook her head trying to clear her thoughts when she arrived at the police station tam macdonald was waiting in her office he stood up and kissed her lightly on the cheek he could see from the look on her face that she was not in the best of moods dont ask she said seeing his questioning look but not wanting to talk about her problems just tell me what youve found out she put her jacket over the back of her chair and sat behind her desk they were very helpful up at the university when they heard what i wanted to write about started tam they were especially interested when they heard there would be no dead women mentioned in the article logan smiled tam had a way of putting things which often made her smile i spent a couple of hours with the head of computer science yesterday afternoon essentially there are three main areas of research in the department at the moment computer languages is one area the special languages that make a computer work security is another area how to stop people breaking into your computer and wireless technology is the third area tell me more about that said logan balfour mentioned it and it was clare rutherfords area of research well at the moment if i want to i can send information from my computer to yours but the computers have to be joined by wires either directly or indirectly like over the internet but with wireless technology i can put my computer on the table next to yours and with the right software they can talk to each other without being joined i see said logan just dont ask me exactly how it works continued tam i know a bit about computers but not that much anyway he changed the subject the university is apparently doing very well with its research into computer languages and into security a lot of the research has been used in business and has made the university a lot of money and wireless technology inquired logan well that too has been a really important area of research up until recently however the head of computer science seemed to think that unless someone comes up with some new ideas or a new direction fairly soon they will think about cutting back in that area at least for a while thats interesting said logan sitting back in her chair and wondering how david balfour would feel about it did he need a new direction badly enough to kill someone for it after a moment she asked were rutherfords research and stewarts similar in any way at all i thought you might want to know that replied tam since im not a police officer it was a difficult question to ask without appearing very nosy but after id spoken to the head he got one of his researchers a woman called karen ramsay to give me a tour of the department karen ramsay yes do you know her i met her yesterday too said logan go on well working so closely with the head she knows what everyone is researching so i just happened to mention the murders and i just happened to wonder if they were researching similar areas apparently not they worked for different people in different areas of research thats interesting thats more or less what she told me said logan i wonder if its true she stared out of the window at the park over the road and became lost in thought tam sat quietly for a moment or two then he coughed im off to work then he said logan looked round suddenly oh sorry tam i was just thinking about something tam looked at her carefully are you ok jenny not really she said the case is over a week old and were getting nowhere its beginning to get me down a bit tam put his hand on logans shoulder but you never know when your luck might change he said logan smiled at him as he left the room a few minutes later shortly after ten thirty logan phoned to check that katie jardine would be at home then picked up her jacket and left the office on her way out of the building she stopped at sergeant grants desk we need to find out more about karen ramsay that woman we met last night she told him see what you can find out by lunchtime im going to talk to katie jardine ill be back this afternoon to speak to henderson logan could have driven to marchmont road but as she came out into the fresh air the sun was still shining a good walk might clear her head and give her a fresh view of the case she thought the streets were busy with people shopping and enjoying the september sunshine it was edinburgh at its best half an hour later logan was walking past some of the university buildings the shopping streets had been busy but there were few people on the streets around the university she heard a car slow beside her and a voice she recognised called out if youre going up to marchmont i can easily give you a lift chapter fourteen where is inspector logan kenneth henderson arrived at london road police station at exactly four oclock the front desk let sergeant grant know that he had arrived and grant went to find logan her office was empty and looked the same as it had that morning grant asked around in the offices near logans but nobody had seen her since before lunch grant went back to logans office it was unlike her to be late without letting him know he picked up the phone in her office and tried her mobile number it was switched off that was strange he searched through the papers on her desk and found katie jardines phone number the phone was answered after the third ring hello ms jardine asked grant yes said jardine its sergeant grant here madam edinburgh police grant went on i was wondering if inspector logan was still with you im sorry sergeant replied jardine what do you mean still with me she never came i thought she must have changed her mind oh said sergeant grant he was worried she must have done ok thanks anyway im sorry to have bothered you and he put the phone down slowly for a couple of minutes grant stood there thinking what was logan doing he had worked with her for four years now and he knew how she worked she didnt go off on her own if she was going somewhere she told him where exactly as she had done that morning he looked at his watch it was five or six hours since she had left just then sergeant graham came into the office oh said graham when he saw grant i was looking for the inspector so was i said grant and explained the situation where else could she have gone asked graham what was she working on at the time shed just asked me to find out everything i could about karen ramsay katie jardines friend we met the other night said grant looking through logans list of phone numbers as he had another idea tam macdonald answered his phone on the first ring for the second time in as many minutes grant explained the situation she didnt say what she was going to do said tam but yes she was interested in karen ramsay id found out that ramsay was one of the few people in the computer science department who knew what all the researchers were doing jenny seemed to think that was interesting ok well thanks anyway said grant im sure theres a natural explanation for all this its too early to start worrying yet but grants feelings did not match his words im sure youre right said tam listen will you ask her to call me when she comes in just to let me know shes ok sure grant put the phone down slowly thinking fast he turned to graham kenneth henderson the guy who had the party hes down at the front desk the inspector wanted to interview him this afternoon lets ask him about karen ramsay five minutes later grant graham and henderson were sitting in an interview room a cassette recorder was on the desk recording their conversation mr henderson grant was saying i understand that since she was the head of departments research assistant ms ramsay would know something about each researchers work thats right said henderson we know that both the murdered girls worked in the computer science department and we know that they both knew karen ramsay were trying to decide how important this information is henderson sat and thought for a moment i cant see how it could be he began unless yes graham and grant spoke together well its very unlikely said henderson but if she had seen how the research of the two women might be used together perhaps something which noone else had noticed then well henderson opened his arms wide what asked graham impatiently it would depend said henderson possibly two pieces of research put together might be a great opportunity to make money it might even make her famous i suppose there was silence for a moment then grant spoke mr henderson id like to know if there is any possible connection between the research these two women were doing would you be able to look into that certainly said henderson ill tell my boss to call you if he needs any further explanation no problem replied grant once henderson had left grant spoke to graham ring the university find out where ramsay is and meet me down in the car park we need to talk to her grant went back to his office to collect his jacket as he walked from there down to the car park he kept wondering what might have happened to logan he knew she was a very good police officer she was intelligent she was a good detective she could look after herself grant didnt have any children but if he had had he would have liked a daughter like her he knew as well as anyone that police work could be dangerous he hoped that she was all right grant and graham reached the car park at the same time ramsays not at the university said graham ive got her home address mayfield gardens he started the engine and turned the car out onto london road grant switched on the blue light he did not want to waste time stuck in traffic chapter fifteen grant and graham investigate jenny logan woke up in the dark she had a terrible headache and her wrists hurt she tried to move them but couldnt they were tied together behind her was it day or night and where was she she turned her head and looked up she could see bits of light above her little by little her eyes became used to the dark and she realised she was in the roof space of a building it was obviously an oldish building because of the light coming through the small holes in the roof if she could see light it must be day she wondered if it was still wednesday under her there were long pieces of wood going in one direction along the floor of the roof space between each of these was the kind of roof insulation material helen robertson had spoken about that kept heat in buildings logan could not see if it was orange or not she had a feeling it probably was this must be the place where the two murdered women had been kept was hers to be the third dead body found in one of edinburghs green areas perhaps it hadnt been a good idea to accept a lift from someone who was part of a murder investigation but it had seemed like a good opportunity to talk anyway it was no use worrying about the past she needed to think about the present she needed to get out of here fast logan tried to open her mouth but there was a piece of parcel tape stuck over it she tried making a noise it was possible but the sound was not very loud her feet were not tied so she started to move them round so she could get to her knees the police car pulled up outside a tall building in mayfield gardens grant and graham got out quickly and entered the building through the front door just inside on the left was a row of postboxes the name of the owner and the number of the flat on the front of each box here said graham pointing at the last in the row flat eight top floor there was no lift so they ran up the stairs graham took the lead grant still healthy at sixty was not far behind there were two flats on each floor flats and were at the top flat at the back of the building flat at the front as they arrived at the door grant spoke ill ask the questions you look out for anything unusual if you get the chance look around a bit graham nodded grant knocked at the door a few moments later it opened im sergeant grant madam said grant holding up his id card we met the other night at the meadows and this is sergeant graham i wonder if we could come in and ask you a few questions of course karen ramsay opened the door wide to let the police officers into the flat the short hall led off to the left into a large comfortable living room there were two closed doors on the right and one open door straight ahead leading into a small kitchen ramsay closed the front door and followed them into the living room please sit down she said grant and graham sat both of them looking round the room there was a round dining table piled high with books and four chairs a couple of armchairs and a sofa covered in a dark blue material shelves full of books on computing a desk with a computer on it and another door that looked as if it led into a cupboard a dark brown jacket hung over the back of one of the dining chairs a greenyblue scarf over the back of another ms ramsay began grant perhaps you could tell us something about the research that clare rutherford and frances stewart were the doorbell rang excuse me said ramsay going into the hall to answer the door graham immediately stood up and started wandering around the room he put his head round the door into the kitchen they heard voices at the front door and then karen ramsay saying well the police are here and then sergeant grant and i cant remember the other ones name and then well come in and ask them if you want the front door closed and karen ramsay came back into the room followed by tam macdonald sorry to interrupt you sergeant grant said macdonald but i was hoping to ask ms ramsay a few questions i just wanted to know how long suddenly he stopped as his eyes fell on the scarf over the back of one of the dining chairs thats jennys he said chapter sixteen catching a murderer inside the roof space jenny logan had managed to move her legs round underneath her her eyes now used to the dark she could just see a thin line of light around what seemed to be a doorway near it there was a small space where there was a proper floor logan stood up and began moving carefully across the space towards the floored area her legs felt shaky and it was difficult to balance with her hands behind her back but keeping close to the wall she moved slowly and quietly towards the doorway there was the low sound of voices coming through logan held her breath and listened there were both male and female voices but she could not hear what was being said now that she was standing logan felt the strength returning to her legs she felt there was a decision to make she could stay quietly where she was and wait or she could run against the door or kick it and see what happened usually logan preferred to take action rather than wait for developments she took three steps back bending down where the roof came down towards the floor she took a deep breath then she pushed off hard taking three short steps and throwing herself at the door in front of her in the dark logan had been unable to examine the door closely had she been able to see she would have noticed that while the door was wooden quite thick and well made the lock was small cheap and easily breakable her shoulder hit the wood hard the door flew open into karen ramsays living room at exactly the moment that tam macdonald noticed the greenyblue scarf over the back of the chair logan fell into the room hands behind her back parcel tape over her mouth dirt from the roof space over her clothes and hair karen ramsay had been prepared for trouble since grant and graham arrived at her flat she was the first to act tam macdonald stood between her and the freedom of her front door her elbow flew back hard into macdonalds stomach he made a strange cry as the air left his body and his hands holding his stomach he fell to his knees and then sideways to the floor ramsay raced for the door graham who had been standing in the kitchen doorway moved next jumping over macdonald he reached ramsay as she was pulling the door open there are times when the police try to do the minimum possible in order to hold or stop someone graham did not think that this was one of those situations ramsay was not only tall but strong graham took a handful of ramsays long blonde hair and pulled it back hard her head came back her hands left the door she screamed she tried to turn her hands reaching out her fingernails like the feet of a wild eagle but graham was ready his foot shot out the kick landing on the side of ramsays knee her legs went from under her and she fell to the floor graham went down with her still holding her hair his other hand reaching for one of her arms ramsay started to fight back but graham caught an arm and turning it quickly he let go of her hair put his knee in the centre of her back and pushed her wrist up between her shoulders ramsay cried out again dont move said graham breathing heavily and continuing to hold ramsays wrist tightly so that she would not move grant realising that there was little he could immediately do to help from where he was sitting on the far side of the room had bent down to help logan he carefully tore the parcel tape away from her mouth and started to untie her hands tam macdonald had managed to get himself into a sitting position his back was against the wall by the kitchen door but he was still trying to catch his breath with her hands finally free logan stood up and moved quickly across the room to tam are you ok tam she asked kneeling down to put a hand on his shoulder and looking him in the eye tam nodded rather than try to speak logan stood up and brushed some of the dirt off her clothes she looked at sergeant graham good work sergeant she said get her down to london road with sergeant grant ill be along in a while turning she put out a hand to help tam to his feet chapter seventeen what billy marr really did the following morning logan and grant were sitting in logans office on the second floor logan still had red marks around her wrists where she had been tied up there was a knock and the door opened it was helen robertson hi jenny i heard you were back at work already she said how are you not too bad thanks said logan i was just passing went on robertson and i thought youd like to know that the insulation material we found on the two murdered women is a match with the material found in the roof space at karen ramsays flat good said logan it all helps to make sure we have the right person and that she goes to prison better still continued robertson they found some more material in the roof space at ramsays flat which is an exact match with fran stewarts skirt excellent said logan so what was it all about asked robertson why did she do it logan sat back in her chair holding a cup of coffee it seems that it was all to do with research in the computer science department at the university she began i dont understand it completely but kenneth henderson explained the main ideas to me essentially its like this two of the areas of research at the university are new wireless technology and computer security and one of the main problems with wireless technology is security for example as i understand it if i have the right equipment i can park outside your office log on to your computer and then help myself to information without you knowing anything about it so why dont computer scientists just help each other find the answer to the problem asked robertson well apparently some researchers get very worried about other people stealing their ideas explained logan so they keep all their research very secret however there were a few people at the university who knew what all the researchers were doing and karen ramsay was one of them finished robertson exactly said logan she saw how two different pieces of research could work together to provide an answer a brilliant idea that would not only get her a phd but also make her rich the problem was the two people who had actually done the research so she decided to kill them said robertson right again said logan she looked across at grant for him to finish the story for helen robertson she knew both the women said grant so it was easy enough to offer them a lift presumably she followed them waiting for a suitable opportunity late at night both of them would probably have been happy to accept the offer of a lift from someone they knew after that it was easy there was silence in the room as they thought about what ramsay had done there was another knock at the door sergeant graham looked into the room sorry to interrupt you he said but do you still want to see billy marr hes just been brought in downstairs to grants surprise logan said actually yes bring him up ill leave said robertson no no helen wait come and sit down and logan pointed to a chair beside her desk robertson sat down looking a little confused as a police doctor she wasnt usually present at interviews a few minutes later sergeant graham showed billy marr into the room sit down billy said logan now then i want you to tell me exactly what happened two weeks ago when you found the womans body on calton hill marr was about to open his mouth to speak when logan said and no dont tell me you killed her because we know who killed her and it wasnt you just tell me what you saw and did well i was up in the park there on wednesday night well thursday morning he began like i told you before what time asked logan i guess about two or three in the morning id been out for a meal at an indian restaurant id had a few drinks and i was sitting against the wall close to the road and then i fell asleep when i woke up there was someone sitting further along the wall i thought she was watching me i sat there for a time and so did she i told her to stop watching me but she didnt marrs voice got louder was that a problem asked logan sure it was said marr i didnt like her staring at me so what did you do asked logan i ran over towards her i was really angry what did you do repeated logan i put my hands round her throat i was so angry said marr i didnt mean to kill her he continued but i did she made this horrible noise i let go and jumped back but it was too late she fell sideways and she was dead really i didnt mean to kill her it just happened like that logan looked at helen robertson billy said robertson she paused and waited until marr looked up at her and she was sure she had his attention she was dead when you found her im absolutely certain of that but she made an awful dying noise when i put my hands round her throat said marr robertson thought for a moment then she spoke billy dead bodies often make strange noises they do strange things sometimes dead bodies even sit up it can be very frightening if you dont know that it happens marr was quiet for a few moments as he thought about what robertson had said so you mean she could have made the noise even if she was dead he said eventually yes said robertson marr was quiet for a little longer then he looked at logan thank you he said i really thought id killed her i really thought it was my fault i didnt know why you wouldnt believe me ok i understand billy said logan now off you go sergeant grant will see you out grant and billy marr left logans office helen robertson went too closing the door behind her logan stood up stretched a little and looked out of her office window at the park over the road there was a knock at the door logan turned round as tarns red hair and glasses appeared round the door hi jenny he said coming in and letting the door close behind him tam he took her in his arms and held her tight for a moment then he stood back still holding her hands and looked her up and down how are you he asked ok she nodded i was worried he said logan looked out of the window so was i i dont suppose its worth suggesting you do a different job logan looked at tam and smiled what do you think she asked i think its too important to you youre too good at it and youre too lucky he said logan took him in her arms and held him tight again youre absolutely right she said especially that bit about being lucky the end
