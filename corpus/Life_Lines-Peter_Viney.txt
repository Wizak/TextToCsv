chapter one computing the future rachel put down her pen and closed her eyes she felt tired very tired she looked up at the clock four thirty good there was enough time to get to the newspaper office before five oclock and she wanted the advertisement to go into fridays newspaper then well she didnt know what was going to happen next it was a wonderful idea and it was a new idea she picked up the finished advertisement and walked through the office door into the computer room the computer room was always busy fourteen people worked there rachel smiled and said hello to everyone as she walked across the room long pieces of blue paper were coming out of the computers the operators were checking them carefully then putting them into envelopes rachels company used computers to do horoscopes for people you sent the date time and place of your birthday to the company computer astrology ltd and the computers could do a horoscope for you rachels boss mervyn astra started the company three years before mervyn astra wasnt his real name of course but it sounded good it sounded good in the newspaper and magazine advertisements his real name was brian smith but only a few people knew that rachel was his assistant she didnt like mervyn very much he was a short fat man with glasses and very long hair mervyn drove an orange rollsroyce everywhere there were gold stars all over it its good advertising mervyn always said anyway when rachel had the new idea mervyn said all right you can try it on friday morning rachel got up early she was waiting for the newspaper it arrived at eight oclock rachel hurried to the table and opened it she was looking for her advertisement there it was on page seven rachel smiled she didnt really believe in palmistry she thought it was nonsense but she thought astrology was nonsense too and the advertisement wasnt a lie not really mervyn was a wonderful computer programmer and the computer program really did have all the information that they could find about palmistry it could read the photographs with a special video camera and it could compare them to thousands and thousands of pictures in the program the program was very expensive mervyn worked on it for a long time rachel was a little worried she wanted the idea to be successful mervyn could get angry very quickly and he hated losing money she read the advertisement again and laughed rachel grant palmistry consultant that was funny it was mervyns idea of course do you want to know about the future palmistry is the science of telling the future from peoples hands its a very old science you can learn about your life and about important things that will happen to you you can learn about your thoughts future romances andyour future wealth we use modern technology to give

cheque for made out to computer astrology ltd to rachel grant palmistry consultant computer astrology ltd po box lazenhurst le iq dont forget to write your name on the back of the photograph computer astrology ltd director mervyn astra chapter two its all nonsense rachel didnt need to worry the idea was successful it was more successful than the computer horoscopes a week later they had thousands of photographs of hands they put the advertisement in more newspapers and magazines mervyn had to buy more computers and a month later there were thirty people working in the computer room mervyn bought a yellow cadillac and put pictures of hands all over it he used to drive the rollsroyce during the week and the cadillac at weekends he was a very happy man mervyn gave rachel a lot more money but she wasnt happy she was embarrassed by her job palmistry consultant three months ago it was funny now it was embarrassing when people said what do you do she usually said oh i work with computers one day rachel was at a party she was speaking to a woman they were talking about sport when the woman asked her name rachel told her suddenly the woman said are you the rachel grant you know the palmistry consultant er yes yes i am said rachel why have you heard about me oh yes said the woman i have ive seen the advertisements in all the newspapers i used to be very interested in palmistry i used to read peoples hands used to be said rachel arent you interested in it now no im not said the woman i read a lot of books about it its all nonsense nonsense rachel smiled why do you think so she asked well said the woman think about it what does the life line tell you it tells you how long people will live she said yes said the woman so in and before the two world wars were there a lot of people with short life lines i dont know said rachel ive never thought about it well said the woman think about it for a minute did fortune tellers see a lot of people with short life lines millions of people died in the wars maybe i dont know but no fortune teller wrote about it never ive read all the important books no one wrote about it thats interesting said rachel but maybe they didnt want to tell people about it and it was a long time ago what about the vietnam war and cambodia what about ethiopia i can give you a lot of modern examples too fortune tellers dont usually tell bad news said rachel people dont want to know have you read much about palmistry miss grant the woman said well yes of course we had to read everything before we wrote the computer program said rachel oh yes im sorry i forgot you are a palmistry consultant arent you the woman smiled come on miss grant she said its nonsense and you know that its nonsense dont you i can see that chapter three frightened of the future the next day rachel was sitting in her office she was thinking about the woman at the party she looked through some books on palmistry she had a lot of books she couldnt find any information about life lines before the two world wars maybe the woman was right she stood up and went to the door mark she called mark can you come into my office for a minute mark was one of the computer programmers he worked with mervyn on the palmistry program he came in and sat down rachel told him about the woman at the party mark she said can we do a statistical analysis of all the palmistry photographs mark looked surprised yes he said we can do that its easy but why what are you looking for im not sure said rachel ive got an idea maybe its a silly idea but i want to compare all the photographs maybe we can find something in all of them something about the future you mean you mean a lot of short life lines i hope not said rachel but its interesting isnt it i want you to compare different towns and cities compare them with each other and compare them with the country areas i want statistics for different areas of the country weve got all this information in the computer why dont we use it you can do it cant you does mervyn know about this said mark not yet said rachel i probably wont tell him either youre right said mark mervyn wont like it he wont like it at all hes frightened of the future did you know that hes never done his own horoscope on the computer i wanted to do it when we were writing the program we needed to try the program but he didnt want his horoscope and he didnt want a photograph of his hand either he was afraid they both laughed chapter four some interesting results a few days later mark walked into rachels office he put a box on her desk and sat down whats in there said rachel computer printouts said mark well said rachel what have you found mark looked down at the desk nothing really he said in most areas weve got photographs of hands with long life lines middlesized life lines and short life lines we didnt learn very much you see we havent got enough photographs wed need a thousand or more from each area of the country before we could do any real statistical analysis but weve had thousands and thousands of photographs said rachel yes but thats from everywhere in the country said mark wait a minute said rachel you said in most areas there are long life lines middlesized life lines and short life lines you didnt say in all areas there is one area but its silly said mark go on said rachel its only one town chatford he said chatford said rachel yes its a middlesized town in the southwest about people live there i know the town well i used to live there too you used to live there asked rachel i didnt know yes i used to be a computer operator at the power station that was four or five years ago before i worked for mervyn anyway theres a big nuclear power station just outside chatford i used to work there on computers what about chatford said rachel first weve got nearly two thousand photographs from chatford two thousand isnt that a lot from one town yes and its enough to do a statistical analysis look at the list these are all towns about the same size as chatford there are twentytwo photographs from norwich one hundred and eight from oxford ninetythree from bournemouth one hundred and five from torquay eightysix from brighton fortytwo from exeter why did we get so many from chatford asked rachel yes i wanted to know that too its very easy mervyns brother owns the newspaper there the chatford evening star he gave mervyn a lot of free advertisements and he wrote a lot of stories about computer palmistry for the newspaper mervyn comes from chatford i met him there he was visiting his brother well whats strange about the photographs it sounds silly but more than seventyfive per cent have got short life lines said mark did that happen in any other town not really all the photographs from norwich had long life lines then i looked at the addresses on the back of the photographs we only had twentytwo but twenty were all from the same hospital for old people they were all from people more than eighty years old thats interesting you mean all of these old people had long life lines maybe its not nonsense maybe said mark anyway said rachel how short were the life lines in chatford i looked at each age group under ten ten to twenty twenty to thirty thirty to forty the life lines were shorter than average in all of them i mean they werent very very short were they shorter or longer than mine asked rachel she showed mark the palm of her left hand mark looked at it carefully er they were about the same he said rachel felt cold suddenly dont worry said mark do you understand statistics if you put one foot in water at c and the other foot in water at then statistically youre comfortable what said rachel well the average temperature will be thats statistics rachel looked at him have you spoken to mervyn about the printouts she asked no you told me not to tell him said mark good ill speak to him can you leave the computer printouts here mark chpater five none of its true mervyn wasnt very happy that day on the way to work he had a small accident in the rollsroyce he drove into the back of another car that evening he was going to be on a television programme about fortune tellers he was worried about it he was thinking about the television programme when rachel knocked on his office door whos that im busy go away its me rachel i said go away i must speak to you come back later its important mervyn rachel opened the door and went in yes what do you want said mervyn well mervyn i had an idea im not interested in your ideas said mervyn you were interested in my idea for computer palmistry said rachel ok sit down and tell me but hurry im very busy rachel told him about the woman at the party and he laughed does it matter he said well yes she said i wanted the computer to compare the photographs from different towns we dont pay you to play with the computer said mervyn angrily anyway you arent a computer programmer you couldnt do this someone helped you who was it mark said rachel but he did the work in his own time he used my computer and he used my electricity said mervyn can i show you what we found said rachel she showed the printouts to mervyn he got angrier and angrier rachel he said this is all nonsense nobody can tell you about the future you dont believe this do you dont you believe it she said quietly of course not its not true none of it then youre cheating your customers yes i know said mervyn theres a fool born every minute youve heard that before havent you thats why im a rich man anyway we got all the information about palmistry and astrology from the best books the program doesnt cheat it gives us the best information on palmistry but all of the information is nonsense rachel stood up thats it mervyn youre a cheat and a thief mervyn smiled thank you he said well im not working for you any more you can find another palmistry consultant ask at the prison theyll find somebody for you she left mervyns room and hurried back to her office she put on her coat and walked out the air outside felt clean and good she smiled she wasnt a palmistry consultant any more now she thought im
