america all rights reserved including that of translation into foreign languages including the scandinavian frank merriwells new comedian chapter i never say die it is not a pleasant experience to wake up on a beautiful morning to the realization that one has failed there seems a relentless irony in nature herself that the day that dawns on a night when our glittering hopes have become dead dull ashes of despair and ruin should be bright and warm with the suns genial rays so frank merriwell felt this fine morning in puelbo colorado the night before with high hopes he had produced his new play for old eli he recalled the events of that first production with almost a shudder for old eli had been a failure a flat appalling stupefying failure from the rise of the curtain everything and everybody had gone wrong lines were forgotten ephraim gallup had had stage fright his own best situations had been marred how much of this was due to the lying handbills which had been scattered broadcast asserting that he was not the real frank merriwell but an impostor a deadbeat and a thorough scoundrel frank could not tell he believed that these efforts to ruin him had little effect for when at the close of the performance he had made a speech from the stage assuring the audience that he would bring his play back and give a satisfactory performance his reception had been cordial but the play had failed parker folansbee his backer had acted queerly and frank knew that after the company had reached denver the relations between him and his backer would cease for old eli had been wellnigh ruinous and when they got back to denver merry and his friends would be without funds then the thought came to him of the prejudice expressed against a poor black cat he had allowed to travel with the company he could not restrain a smile as he perceived that the superstitious members of the company would feel that the cat had hoodooed them as if a cat could affect the fortunes of men the thought of the cat gave a pleasant turn to his reflections and he cheered up immensely he had failed no he would not acknowledge failure defeat disaster he would not lie down and abandon the struggle for he was not built of such weak material where was the fault was it in the piece or in the way it had been played he realized that although the piece was well constructed it was not of a high artistic character such as must appeal by pure literary merit to the best class of theater patrons it could not be ranked with the best productions of pinero jones howard thomas or even clyde fitch he had not written it with the hope of reaching such a level his aim had been to make a popular piece such as would appeal to the masses he fell to thinking over what had happened and trying to understand the cause of it all he did not lay the blame entirely on the actors it was not long before he decided that something about his play had led the spectators to expect more than they had received what was it they had expected while he was thinking of this alone in his room at the hotel bart hodge his old friend and a member of his company came in hodge looked disgruntled disappointed disgusted he sat down on the bed without speaking hello old man said frank cheerfully whats the matter with your face it would sour new milk and you ought to have a face that would sour honey growled bart i should if i were in your place whats the use that wouldnt improve things if i were in your place id take a gun and go forth and kill a few stiffs i always supposed a stiff was dead didnt know one could be killed over again oh you can joke if you want to but i dont see how you can feel like joking now anybody else would swear and that would be foolish perhaps so but you know as well as i do that your play was murdered and mangled last night thats so bgosh drawled a doleful voice and ephraim gallup another of the company franks boy friend from vermont came stalking into the room looking quite as disgusted and dejected as hodge an im one of the murderers frank looked ephraim over and burst out laughing why he cried your face is so long that youll be hitting your toes against your chin when you walk if youre not careful whut i need is somebuddy to hit their toes against my pants jest where i set down an do it real hard said ephraim i wisht id stayed to hum on the farm when i went back there and giv up the idee that i was an actor i kin dig taters an saw wood a darn sight bettern i kin act youre all right ephraim assured merry you had to fill that part in a hurry and you were not sure on your lines that worried you and broke you up if you had been sure of your lines so that you would have felt easy i dont think there would have been any trouble as far as you were concerned i dunno abaout that i never felt so goshdarn scat as i did larst night why i jest shook all over an one spell i didnt think my laigsd hold me up till i got off ther stage it was awful you had an attack of stage fright they say all great actors have it once in their lives waal i never want to feel that air way agin an i spoilt that scene in the dressin room of the clubhaouse oh jeewhillikins im goin aout of the show business frank an git a job paoundin sand it dont take no brains to do that cheer up you are going to play that same part in this play and youll play it well too whut then be yeou goin to keep right on with the play asked the vermonter in astonishment no said merry i am not going to keep right on with it i am going to put it into shape to win and then im going out with it again my motto is never say die you heard what i told the audience last night i promised them that i would play in this town and would make a success i shall keep that promise hodge shook his head you are smart frank but theres a limit im afraid your luck has turned you are hoodooed just then a coalblack cat came out from under the bed and walked across the room and i suppose you think this is my hoodoo smiled merry as the cat came over and rubbed against his leg thats where you are away off this cat is my mascot and she shall travel with me till the piece wins she has stuck to me close enough since she walked onto the stage where we were rehearsing in denver the cat is not the hoodoo said bart shaking his head i know what is you do sure name it i am you yes frank stared at bart in surprise and then burst out laughing well how in the world did you happen to get such a foolish notion into your head he cried its not foolish declared bart stubbornly its straight i know it and you cant make me think differently frank rose and walked over to hodge putting a hand on his shoulder now you are talking silly old man he said you never were bad luck to me in the past why should you be now youre blue you are down in the mouth and your head is filled with ridiculous fancies things would have happened just as they have if you had not joined the company i dont believe it you always were superstitious but i believe you are worse than ever now you have been playing poker too much thats what ails you the game makes every man superstitious he may not believe in luck at the beginning but he will after he has stuck to that game a while he will see all the odd things that happen with cards and the conviction that there is such a thing as luck must grow upon him he will become whimsical and full of notions thats whats the matter with you hodge forget it forget it i think you are likely to forget some things altogether too early merriwell for instance some of your enemies whats the use to remember unpleasant things they remember you one of them did so to an extent that he helped ruin the first presentation of your play how it isnt possible that you have forgotten the lying notices circulated all over this city stating that you were not the real frank merriwell accusing you of being a fake and a thief something like a shadow settled on merrys strong face no i have not forgotten he declared i remember all that and id like to know just who worked the game it was a goldinged measly trick exploded ephraim you thought it would not hurt you frank said hodge you fancied it would serve to advertise you if anything it may have advertised you but it did you damage at the same time when the audience saw everything was going wrong it grew angry and became convinced that it was being defrauded then you had trouble with that big ruffian who climbed over the footlights with the avowed purpose of breaking up the show oh well smiled merry in a peculiar way that fellow went right back over the footlights yes you threw him back that quieted the audience more than anything else for it showed that you were no slouch even if you were a fake oh i suppose ill find out some time just who did that little piece of advertising for me perhaps so perhaps not tap tap tap a knock on the door come frank called the door opened and billy wynne the property man looked in letter for you mr merriwell he said frank took the letter and wynne disappeared after being thanked for bringing it excuse me said merry and he tore open the envelope a moment later having glanced over the letter he whistled news asked bart just a note from the gentleman we were speaking of just now answered frank its from the party who gave me the free advertising waal ill be kicked by a blind kaow exploded gallup an did he hev ther gall to write to ye yes said frank listen to this then he read the letter aloud mr frank merriwell dear sir by this time you must be aware that you are not the greatest thing that ever happened you received it in the neck last night and i aided in the good work of knocking you out for i circulated the warning notice which denounced you as an impostor a deadbeat and a thief the public swallowed it all and in disguise i was at the theater to witness your downfall it was even greater than i had dared hope it would be i understand the managers in other towns have canceled with you folansbee has declined to back your old show any longer and you are on the beach ha ha ha this is revenge indeed you are knocked out at last and i did it youll never appear again as the marvelous young actorplaywright and the name of frank merriwell will sink into oblivion it is well yours with satisfaction leslie lawrence i knew well enough it was that dirty rascal who did the job cried hodge springing up the cur waal dinged if he hadnt oughter be shot burst from gallup an he knows folansbees gone back on ye its no use frank said hodge disconsolately you are done for the story is out folansbee has skipped us and he has not skipped us hes simply decided to go out of the theatrical business it was a fad with him anyhow as long as everything was going well he liked it but i see he is a man who cannot stand hard luck he is changeable and that makes him a mighty poor man to back a venture it takes a man with determination and a fixed purpose to win at anything changing around jumping from one thing to another never having any clear ideas is enough to make a failure of any man folansbee doesnt need to follow the show business for a living he went into it because it fascinated him the glamour is all worn off now and he is ready to get out if it let him go its all right to say let him go but what are you going to do without him you are talking about putting your play out again but how will you do it ill find a way that is easier said than done you have been lucky frank there is no question about that you cant be that lucky all the time there are more ways than one to catch an angel i rather think youll find that angels are not so thick once in a while there is a soft thing who is ready to gamble with his money by putting it behind a traveling theatrical company but those soft things are growing scarcer and scarcer too many of them have been bitten still i have a feeling that ill find a way to succeed of course you can advertise for a partner to invest in a sure thing and all that but those games are too near fraud rascals have worked those schemes so much that honest men avoid them i shall not resort to any trickery or deception if i catch an angel i shall get one just as i obtained folansbee by telling him all the risks and chances of failure well youll not get another that way darned if i aint afraid now nodded ephraim but mr folansbees goin to take keer of this compny aint he hes goin to take it back to denver he has agreed to do so at this moment there was another sharp rap on the door which happening to be near frank opened cassie lee walked in followed by roscoe havener the soubrette and the stage manager of for old eli cassie showed excitement well what do you think of him she cried of whom havener asked merry no folansbee what about him hes skipped skipped sure thing run away impossible its a straight fact declared the little soubrette theres no doubt of it corroborated havener waal may i be tickled to death by grasshoppers ejaculated gallup this caps the whole business burst from hodge i cant believe that said merriwell slowly how do you know havener his baggage is gone garland and dunton traced him to the station they were just in time to see him board an eastbound train as it pulled out he has deserted us chapter ii darkness and dawn frank could not express his astonishment i cant believe it he repeated folansbee would not do such a thing hodge laughed shortly harshly you have altogether too much confidence in human nature merry he said i never took much stock in this folansbee he is just the sort of person i would expect to do such a trick the company is hot merriwell said havener theyre ready to eat you me yes for what for getting them into this scrape i dont see how they can blame me there came a sound of feet outside and a bang on the door which was flung open before frank could reach it into the room stalked granville garland followed by the remainder of the company plainly all were excited well mr merriwell said garland assuming an accusing manner and striking a stage pose we are here so i see nodded frank calmly whats the matter you engaged us to fill parts in your play i did we hold contracts with you i beg your pardon i think you are mistaken what i made no contracts with you i simply engaged you you hold contracts with parker folansbee folansbee has deserted us sir declared garland accusingly we have been tricked fooled deceived we hold contracts you were concerned with folansbee in putting this company on the road and you are responsible we have come to you to find out what you mean to do i am very sorry began frank being sorry for us doesnt help us a bit cut in garland rudely i believe you knew folansbee was going to skip frank turned his eyes full on the speaker and he seemed to look his accuser straight through and through mr garland he said you are rude and insulting i do not fancy the way you speak to me well what are you going to do about it thats what id like to know put in lloyd fowler i want my money i didnt come out here to be fooled this way mr fowler spoke frank you have not earned any money instead you have earned a fine by appearing on the stage last night in a state of intoxication who says so i do then you li fowler did not quite finish the word frank had him by the neck and pinned him against the wall in a moment merrys eyes were flashing fire but his voice was steady as he said take it back sir apologize instantly for that garland made a move as if he would interfere but bart hodge was before him in an instant looking straight into his face and saying hands off touch him and you get thumped get out cried garland not a bit of it if you want a scrap i shall be pleased to give you what you desire here fellows called garland get in here all of you and give these two tricksters a lesson come on wait cried havener stepping to the other side of merriwell dont try it for i shall stand by him me too boys cried cassie lee getting into line with her small fists clinched and a look of determination on her thin face dont nobody jump on frank merriwell unless i take a hand in the racket the rest of the company were astonished they realized that frank had some friends but it was not until after he had awakened to realize just what the situation meant that ephraim gallup drew himself together and planted himself with merrys party wheee he squealed if theres goin ter be a ruction yeou kin bet ill fight fer merry though i aint much of a fighter id ruther run then fight any day onless i have ter fight but i reckon ill hev ter fight in this case if there is any fightin immediately granville garland became very placid in his manner we didnt come here to fight he said but we came here to demand our rights an to sass frank put in the vermonter but bgosh yeou are barkin up ther wrong tree when yeou tackle him he kin jest natterally chaw yeou up frank still held fowler against the wall now he spoke to the fellow in a low commanding tone apologize at once he said come sir make haste i didnt mean anything faltered the frightened actor i think i was too hasty i apologize be careful in the future advised merry releasing him then merry turned to the others saying ladies and gentlemen until havener just brought the news i did not know that parker folansbee was gone it was a great surprise for me as i did not dream he was a person to do such a thing even now i cannot feel that he has entirely deserted us he may have left town rather than face us but i hope he has been man enough to leave money behind that will enable us to return to denver at least you must see that we are in the same box together i am hit as hard as any of you for i had hoped that folansbee would stand by me so that i would be able to put the play in better shape and take it out again i have lost him as a backer and if he has skipped without leaving us anything i have barely enough money to enable me to get back to denver havent you any way of getting hold of money asked harper unfortunately i have not answered merry if i had money in my pocket i would spend the last cent to square this thing with you and i know thats on the level chirped cassie lee well its mighty tough muttered billy wynne thats all ive got to say well have to get up some kind of a benefit for ourselves said havener thats the only thing left to do come up to my room invited miss stanley and well try to devise a scheme for raising the dust come on they followed her out leaving ephraim bart and frank whew breathed gallup sitting down on the bed hanged if i didnt kinder think there was goin to be a ruction one spell i wanted to run but i warnt goin to leave frank to be thrashed by a lot of hamfatters bgee they were excited when they came in said merry apologizing for the ones who had departed if it hadnt been for that they would not have thought of making such a scene well frank spoke bart i hope this will teach you a lesson how i hope it will teach you not to put so much confidence in human nature after this have less confidence and do more business in writing i havent a doubt but folansbee would have stuck by you all right if the new play had proved a winner but he saw a chance to squeal when it turned out bad and he jumped you i had a contract with him about the other piece said merry but you know he did not return from st louis till just before we were ready to start out and so i had not been able to arrange matters about this piece and that lets him out easy yes he gets out without any trouble and i dont believe i can do a thing about it again there came a rap on the door when it was opened a bell boy accompanied by a graybearded gentleman stood outside mr merriwell said the bell boy here is a gentleman to see you the man entered walk right in sir invited merry what can i do for you frank closed the door the stranger slowly drew off his gloves critically looking merriwell over so you are mr frank merriwell he said yes sir i recognize you nodded the man do you remember me no sir i cant say that i do although i believe i have seen your face before i think you have but i did not wear a full beard then ah then it is possible the beard has made the change that prevents me from recognizing you quite likely will you sit down i have some important business with you explained the stranger with a glance toward gallup and hodge immediately bart started for the door see you later frank he said come on ephraim gallup followed hodge from the room when they were gone frank again invited the stranger to be seated thank you said the man as he accepted a chair for reasons i wish you would look at me closely and see if you recognize me i recognize you although you are older but i must proceed with the utmost caution in this matter and i wish you would recognize me and state my name so that i may feel absolutely certain that i am making no mistake frank sat down opposite the gentleman at whom he gazed searchingly he concentrated his mind in the effort to remember frank had found that he could do many difficult things by concentration of his mental forces now he sought to picture in his mind the appearance of this man without a beard gradually he felt that he was drawing nearer and nearer the object he sought finally he made a request please speak again sir why do you wish me to speak again said the stranger smiling so that your voice may aid me in remembering i wish to associate your voice and your face very well what do you wish me to say you have said enough i have your voice now im afraid youll not be able to remember said the stranger it doesnt make any great difference for i recognize you and i can make assurance doubly sure by asking you a few questions first i wish to ask excuse me interrupted merry you are from carson city nevada you are connected with the bank in carson where i deposited a certain amount of valuable treasure found by myself and some friends years ago in the utah desert your name is horace hobson correct cried the man with satisfaction now can you produce the receipt given you for that treasure yes sir nodded frank immediately producing a leather pocketbook and opening it i have it here in a moment he had found the paper and handed it to mr hobson the gentleman adjusted some goldrimmed noseglasses and looked the receipt over this is the receipt he nodded you instructed the bank officials to use every effort and spare no expense to find the relatives of prof millard fillmore and the rightful heirs to the treasure i did i am here to inform you that the bank has carried out your instructions faithfully then you have found prof fillmores relatives quickly asked merry his heart sinking a bit on the contrary we have found that he has no relatives living he seems to have been the last of his family the end of it then it has been necessary for us to go to considerable expense to settle this point beyond a doubt but we have done so in accordance with your directions of course we shall not lose anything we have ascertained the exact value of the treasure and have deducted for our expense and trouble at a meeting of the bank directors i was instructed to turn over the remainder to you i have here papers showing the exact valuation of the treasure as deposited with us here is a complete account of all our expenses and charges we have found a balance remaining of fortythree thousand seven hundred and thirtyeight dollars i was sent to turn this money over to you as i could identify you beyond doubt and there could be no mistake to make it certain in my own mind i wished you to recognize me you did so and i knew i could not be making a mistake i will take up this receipt here and in return will give you a check for the amount if that is satisfactory to you frank sat like one dazed staring at horace hobson was it possible that he was not dreaming was he in his hour of need to receive this immense sum of money no wonder he fancied he was dreaming at last he gave himself a slight shake and his voice did not falter as he said it is perfectly satisfactory to me sir i will accept the check chapter iii merriwells generosity mr hobson departed and then frank rang for a bell boy and sent for bart and ephraim merrys two friends came in a short time i have called you up said merry to talk over the arrangements for putting for old eli on the road again without delay i have decided on that it will take some little time to manufacture the costly mechanical effect that i propose to introduce into the third act and we shall have to get some new paper i believe i can telegraph a description to chicago so a full stand lithograph from stone can be made that will suit me and i shall telegraph today hodge stared at frank as if he thought merry had lost his senses you always were a practical joker he growled but dont you think its about time to let up i dont see that this is a joking matter you should have some sympathy for our feelings if you dont care for yourself merry laughed a bit my dear fellow he said i assure you i was never more serious i am not joking i shall telegraph for the paper immediately paper like that costs money and the lithographers will demand a guarantee before they touch the work and i shall give them a guarantee i shall instruct them to draw on the first national bank of denver where my money will be deposited your money gasped hodge jeewhillikins gurgled gallup then franks friends looked at each other the same thought in the minds of both had merry gone mad had his misfortune turned his brain i believe i can have the effect i desire to introduce manufactured for me in denver frank went on i shall brace up that third act with it i shall make a spectacular climax on the order of the mechanical horse races you see on the stage i shall have some dummy figures and boats made so that the boat race may be seen on the river in the distance i have an idea of a mechanical arrangement to represent the crowd that lines the river and the observation train that carries a load of spectators along the railroad that runs beside the river i think the swaying crowd can be shown the moving train the three boats yale harvard and cornell with their rowers working for life harvard shall be a bit in the lead when the boats first appear but yale shall press her and take the lead then i will have the scene shifted instantly so that the audience will be looking into the yale clubhouse the rear of the house shall open direct upon the river there shall be great excitement in the clubhouse which i will have located at the finish of the course the boats are coming outside along the river mad crowds are cheering hoarsely whistles are screeching yale students are howling the college cry here they come now the excitement is intense hurrah yale has taken the lead the boats shoot in view at the back of the stage yale a length ahead harvard next cornell almost at her side and in this form they cross the line yale the victor the star of the piece myself who has escaped from his enemies barely in time to enter the boat and help win the race is brought on by the madly cheering college men and down comes the curtain on a climax that must set any audience wild hodge sat down on the bed frank he said grimly youre going crazy it would cost a thousand dollars to get up that effect i dont care if it costs two thousand dollars ill have it and ill have it in a hurry laughed merriwell i am out for business now i am in the ring to win this time yes you are going crazy nodded hodge where is all the money coming from ive got it bart went into the air as if he had received an electric shock you youve what he yelled got the money asserted frank where shouted bart right here may i be tickled to death by muskeeters gasped gallup got two thousand dollars said hodge oh come off merriwell you are carrying this thing too far now just take a look at this piece of paper invited frank as he passed over the check he had received from horace hobson bart took it he looked at it he was stricken dumb gallup looked over barts shoulder his jaw dropped his eyes bulged from his head and he could not utter a sound how do you like the looks of it smiled merry what what is it faltered bart a check cant you see a check that is good for fortythree thousand seven hundred and thirtyeight dollars good for that why it cant be now is this more of your joking merriwell if it is i swear i shall feel like having a fight with you right here its no joke old man that piece of paper is good it is good for every dollar the money is payable to me ive got the dust to put my play out in great style even then bart could not believe it he groped for the bed and sat down limply still staring at the check which he held in his hand whats this for he asked its for the fillmore treasure which i found in the utah desert exclaimed frank it was brought to me by the man who came in here a little while ago then gallup collapsed his knees seemed to buckle beneath him and he dropped down on the bed waal may i be chawed up fer grass by a spavin hoss he murmured hodge sat quite still for some seconds merry he said at last beginning to tremble all over are you sure this is good are you sure there is no crooked business behind it of course i am smiled frank how can you be asked bart i received it from the very man with whom i did the business in carson when i made the deposit in order that there might be no mistake he came on here and delivered it to me personally i think im dyin muttered ephraim ive received a shock from which ill never rekiver fortythree thousan dollars oh say i know theres a mistake here not a bit of a mistake assured merriwell smiling triumphant and all that money is yourn no why why ther checks made out to yeou because the treasure was deposited by me and yeou faound it i found it but i did so while in company with four friends now hodge showed still further excitement those friends were not with you at the moment when you found it he said ive heard your story you came near losing your life the mad hermit fought to throw you from the precipice the way you found the treasure the dangers you passed through everything that happened established your rightful claim to it it belongs to you alone i do not look at it in that light said frank calmly and positively there were five of us in the party the others were my friends diamond rattleton browning and toots a nigger exclaimed bart do you call him your friend i do exclaimed merry more than once that black boy did things for me which i have never been able to repay although a coward at heart so far as danger to himself was concerned i have known him to risk his life to save me from harm why shouldnt i call him my friend his skin may be black but his heart is white oh all right muttered hodge i havent anything more to say i was not one of your party at that time no i wish i had been so yeou could git yeour share of the boodle grinned ephraim no cried hodge fiercely so i could show the rest of them how to act like men i would refuse to touch one cent of it i would tell frank merriwell that it belonged to him and he could not force me to take it thats all mebbe the othersll do that air way suggested the vermont youth not on your life sneered bart theyll gobble onto their shares with both hands i know them ive traveled with them and i am not stuck on any of them i shall compel them to take it smiled frank i am sorry fellows that you both were not with me so i could bring you into the division id find a way to compel hodge to accept his share not in a thousand years exploded bart waal drawled ephraim i aint saying but id like a sheer of that money well enough but theres one thing i am sayin sence hodge has explained why he wouldnt tech none of it i be goldinged if yeou could force a single cent onter me ef i hed bin with yeou same as them other fellers was i say hodge is jest right abaout that business the money belongs to yeou frank an yeoure the only one that owns a single dollar of it bgosh thats right ephraim nodded hodge and there isnt another chap in the country who would insist on giving away some of his money to others under similar circumstances some people might call it generosity i call it thundering foolishness i cant help what you call it said frank i shall do what i believe is right and just and thus i will have nothing to trouble my conscience conscience conscience youll never be rich in the world for you have too much conscience do you suppose the wall street magnates could have become millionaires if they had permitted their conscience to worry them over little points i fancy not acknowledged merry shaking his head i am certain i shall never become wealthy in just the same manner that certain millionaires acquired their wealth id rather remain poor such an argument does not touch me hodge oh i suppose not but its a shame for you to be such a chump just think what you could do with fortythree thousand dollars you could give up this show business you could go back to yale and finish your course in style you could be the kingbee of them all oh its a shame haow muchll yeou hev arter yeou divide asked ephraim the division will give the five of us eight thousand seven hundred and fortysix dollars and eighty cents each answered frank hes figured that up so quick muttered hodge i snum eight thaousan dollars aint to be sneezed at cried the vermonter its a pinch beside fortythree thousand said bart yeou oughter be able to go back to college on that frank he can if hell drop the show business nodded bart and confess myself a failure acknowledge that i failed in this undertaking would you have me do that oh you wouldnt confess anything of the sort what were you working for to go back to yale was it not sure well i dont suppose you expected to make so much money that you would be able to return with more than eight thousand dollars in your inside pocket hardly then what is crawling over you if you are fool enough to make this silly division you can go back with money enough to take you through your course in style and have the memory of what happened in this town last night rankle in my heart hardly i made a speech from the stage last night in which i said i would play again in this city and i promised that the audience should be satisfied i shall keep that promise oh all right i suppose youll be thinking of rewarding the ladies and gentlemen who called here a short time ago and attempted to bulldoze you i shall see that the members of the company one and all are treated fairly i shall pay them two weeks salary which will be all they can ask hodge got up thrust his hands deep into his pockets and stared at frank with an expression on his face that was little short of disgust you beat them all he growled id do just like that i dont think not one of those people has a claim on you id let them all go to the deuce it would be serving them right well i shall do nothing of the sort my dear fellow i presume you will pay lloyd fowler two weeks salary i shall bart turned toward the door where are you going im going out somewhere all alone by myself where i can say some things about you i am going to express my opinion of you to myself i dont want to do it here for there would be a holy fight ive got to do it in order to let off steam and cool down i shall explode if i keep it corked up inside of me he bolted out of the room slamming the door fiercely behind him frank and ephraim went up to the room of stella stanley which was on the next floor they found all the members of the company packed into that room may we come in asked merry pleasantly we dont need him muttered lloyd fowler who was seated in a corner dont get him into the benefit performance let him take care of himself come right in mr merriwell invited stella stanley i believe you can sing were arranging a program for the benefit you know shall we put you down for a song i hardly think so smiled frank ah muttered fowler triumphantly he thinks himself too fine to take part in such a performance with the rest of us i rather think youve hit it whispered charlie harper and i know you are off your trolley hissed cassie lee who had not missed the words of either of them hes on the level really exclaimed miss stanley in surprise and disappointment do you actually refuse yes why because there will be no performance wont no why not i refuse to permit it said frank a queer twinkle in his eyes then several of the company came up standing and shouted what that beats anything i ever heard of in my life said fowler for genuine crust it surely does spoke up harper cassie lee looked surprised and havener was amazed surely you are not in earnest merriwell the stage manager hastened to say never more so in my life answered frank easily then youre crazy oh i guess not well you are said garland you have gone over the limit we are not engaged to you in any way you said so you explained that we could not hold you responsible you cannot come here and dictate to us we shall carry out this performance if you try to prevent it you will make a great mistake be calm advised merry you are unduly exciting yourself mr garland well its enough to excite anyone meow out of the room trotted franks black cat which had followed him up the stairs put that cat out cried agnes kirk it has caused all our bad luck frank picked the cat up i told you the cat was a mascot he said it has proved so i should say so sneered fowler let him take himself out of here cat and all cried charlie harper let him explain what he means by saying we shall not give a benefit performance urged havener who really hoped that frank could say something to put himself in a better light with the company yes urged cassie what did you mean by that frank such a performance is quite unnecessary assured merry weve got to do something to raise money to get out of this city i will furnish you with the money each and every one you shouted several yes how asked havener you said a short time ago that you hadnt enough money to amount to anything at that time i hadnt since then i have been able to make a raise now there was another bustle of excitement oh cried several thats different i knew there was something behind it exclaimed cassie with satisfaction have you been able to raise enough to take us all back to denver frank i think so and i believe i shall have a few dollars left after we arrive there how much have you raised asked havener fortythree thousand dollars answered frank as coolly as if he were saying fortythree dollars for a moment there was silence in the room then expressions of incredulity and scorn came from all sides fowler set up a shout of mocking laughter well of all the big bluffs i ever heard this is the biggest he sneered say i dont mind a joke said stella stanley but dont you think you are carrying this thing a trifle too far mr merriwell i would be if it were a joke confessed frank easily but as it happens to be the sober truth i think no one has a chance to ask i will not only pay your fare to denver but each one shall receive two weeks salary which i think you must acknowledge is the proper way to treat you ill believe it when i get my hands on the dough said fowler fortythree thousand fiddlesticks any person who doubts my word is at liberty to take a look at this certified check said merry producing the check and placing it on the little table then they crushed and crowded about that table staring at the check fowler nudged harper to whom he whispered i believe its straight so help me id like to kick myself yes its straight acknowledged harper dolefully i am just beginning to realize that we have made fools of ourselves by talking too much what can we do take poison well have to eat dirt or hell throw us down it looks that way thus it came about that fowler was almost the first to offer congratulations by jove mr merriwell he cried im delighted you are dead in luck and you deserve it it was pretty hard for you to be deserted by folansbee in such a sneaking way i have said all along that you were a remarkably bright man and merited success thats right put in harper he said so to me last night we were talking over your hard luck i congratulate you mr merriwell permit me permit me both harper and fowler held out their hands frank looked at the extended hands but put his own hands in his pockets laughing softly somewhat scornfully it is wonderful he said how many true friends a man can have when he has money and how few true friends he really has when he doesnt have a dollar oh my dear mr merriwell protested fowler i know i was rather hasty in some of my remarks but i assure you that you misunderstood me it was natural that all of us should be a trifle hot under the collar at being used as we were i assure you i did not mean anything by what i said if i spoke too hastily i beg a thousand pardons again let me congratulate you again he held out his hand you are at liberty to congratulate me said merry but still disdaining the proffered hand i shall pay you the same as the others dont be afraid of that but i shall give you your notice for i shall not need you any more with several of the others i shall make contracts to go out with this piece again as soon as i can make some alterations get new paper and start the company fowler turned green oh of course you can do as you like sir he said i dont think i care to go out with this piece again it is probable i should so inform you even if you wanted me harper backed away he did not wish to receive such a calling down as had fallen to the lot of fowler cassie lee held out her hand her thin face showing actual pleasure you dont know how glad i am frank she said in a low tone never anybody deserved it more than you thats right agreed havener douglas dunton had not been saying much but now he stood forth struck a pose and observed methinks that along with several of me noble colleagues i have made a big mistake in making offensive remarks to you most noble high muckamuck wouldst do me a favor then apply the toe of thy boot to the seat of me lower garments with great vigor frank laughed the same old dunton he said forget it old man its all right theres no harm done while the members of the company were crowding around merriwell fowler and harper slipped out of the room and descended the stairs straight to the bar of the hotel they made their way leaning against the bar they took their drinks and discussed franks fortune another man was drinking near them he pricked up his ears and listened when he heard merriwells name and he grew excited as he began to understand what had happened excuse me gentlemen he said after a time i do not wish to intrude but i happen to know mr merriwell will you have a drink with me they accepted they were just the sort of chaps who drink with anybody who would set em up do you mind telling me just what has happened to mr merriwell asked the stranger who wore a full beard which seemed to hide many of the features of his face has he fallen heir to a fortune rather answered harper dryly more than fortythree thousand dollars has dropped into his hands this morning is it possible asked the stranger showing agitation are you sure yes i am sure i saw the certified check on a carson city bank he was broke this morning but now he has money to burn the stranger lifted a glass to his lips his hand trembled somewhat all at once with a savage oath he dashed the glass down on the bar shivering it to atoms as he did so the hairs of his beard caught around the stone of a ring on his little finger and the beard was torn from his face showing it was false the face revealed was black with discomfiture and rage it was the face of leslie lawrence franks old enemy was again discomfited chapter iv in the smoker so frank took the company back to denver he was able to do so without depositing the check till denver was reached as horace hobson furnished the funds holding the check as security hobson went along at the same time while on the train frank made arrangements with several members of his company in the revised version of for old eli when the play went on the road again he said nothing to lloyd fowler nor charlie harper although he did not make arrangements with granville garland he asked garland if he cared to go out with the company again informing him that he might have an opening for him fowler saw merry talking with some of the members and he surmised what it meant he began to feel anxious as time passed and frank did not come to him he went to harper to talk it over harper was in the smoker pulling at a brierwood pipe and looking sour enough he did not respond when fowler spoke to him whats the matter asked fowler sick yes growled harper what ails you disgusted at what somebody who myself for one somebody else yes who youre it fowler fell back and stared at harper he had taken a seat opposite his fellow actor harper returned his stare with something like still greater sourness whats the matter with me asked fowler wondering youre a confounded idiot answered harper bluntly well i must say i like your plain language exclaimed fowler coloring and looking decidedly touched you were in a bad temper when we started for denver but you seem to be worse now whats the matter oh i see now that ive put a foot in the soup i am broke and i need money all i am liable to get is the two weeks salary i shall receive from merriwell if id kept my mouth shut i might have a new engagement with him like the others then some of the others have a new engagement all of them i reckon except you and i we are the fools of the company well what shall we do cant do anything but keep still and swallow our medicine perhaps you think that but im going to hit merriwell up well youll be a bigger fool if you do after the calling down you received from him today at that moment frank entered the smoker looking for hodge who had been unable to procure a good seat in one of the other cars bart was sitting near harper and fowler as frank came down the aisle fowler arose i want to speak to you mr merriwell he said all right nodded frank go ahead i have heard that you are making new engagements with the members of the company well you havent said anything to me no i suppose it is because i made some foolish talk to you this morning well i apologized didnt i yes well i presume you will give me a chance when you take the play out again no sir frank said it quietly looking fowler full in the face so you are going to turn me down because i made that talk well i have heard considerable about your generosity but this does not seem very generous ever since joining the company and starting to rehearse mr fowler you have been a source of discord once or twice you came near flatly refusing to do some piece of business the way i suggested once you insolently informed me that i was not the stage manager you completely forgot that i was the author of the piece i have heard that you told others not to do things as i suggested but to do them in their own way several times before we started out i was on the verge of releasing you which i should have done had there been time to fill your place properly last night you were intoxicated when the hour arrived for the curtain to go up you went onto the stage in an intoxicated condition you did not do certain pieces of business as you had been instructed to do them but as you thought they should be done therefore ruining a number of scenes you were insolent and would have been fined a good round sum for it had we gone on in a number of ways you have shown that you are a man i do not want in my company so i shall let you go after paying you two weeks salary i believe i have given the best of reasons for pursuing such a course then frank stepped past fowler and sat down with hodge the actor took his seat beside harper who said i hope you are satisfied now satisfied muttered fowler id like to punch his head off very likely nodded harper but you cant do it you know he is a holy terror and you are not in his class behind them was a man who seemed to be reading a newspaper he was holding the paper very high so that his face could not be seen and he was not reading at all he was listening with the keenest interest to everything as frank sat down beside hodge he observed a look of great satisfaction on barts face well merriwell said the darkfaced youth with something like the shadow of a smile you have done yourself proud lets go forward suggested merry the smoke is pretty thick here and some of it from those pipes is rank i want to talk with you so they got up and left the car as they went out fowler glared at merriwells back hissing oh id like to get even with you instantly the man behind lowered his paper leaned forward and said i see you do not like mr merriwell much if you want to get even with him i may be able to show you how to do it with startled exclamations both harper and fowler turned round the man behind was looking at them over the edge of his paper who are you demanded fowler i think you know me said the man lowering his paper lawrence sat there in denver frank was accompanied to the bank by mr hobson it happened that kent carson a wellknown rancher whom frank had met was making a deposit at the bank hello young man cried the rancher in surprise i thought you were on the road with your show i was smiled frank but met disaster at the very start and did not get further than puelbo well thats tough said carson sympathetically what was the matter a number of things confessed frank the play was not strong enough without sensational features i have found it necessary to introduce a mechanical effect besides rewriting a part of the play i shall start out again with it as soon as i can get it into shape then your backer is all right hes standing by you on the contrary smiled merry he skipped out from puelbo yesterday morning leaving me and the company in the lurch well that was ornery said carson what are you going to do without a backer back myself i have the money now to do so i am here to make a deposit then it came about that he told mr carson of his good fortune and the rancher congratulated him most heartily frank presented his check for deposit asking for a check book the eyes of the receiving teller bulged when he saw the amount of the check he looked frank over critically mr hobson had introduced frank and the teller asked him if he could vouch for the identity of the young man i can was the answer so can i spoke up kent carson i reckon my word is good here ill stand behind this young man are you willing to put your name on the back of this check mr carson asked the teller hand it over directed the rancher he took the check and endorsed it with his name there he said i reckon you know its good now yes said the teller there will be no delay now mr merriwell can draw on us at once frank thanked mr carson heartily thats all right said the cattleman in an offhand way i allow that a chap who will defend a ragged boy as you did is pretty apt to be all right how long will it take to get your play in shape again well i may be three or four days rewriting it i dont know how long the other work will be three or four days well say why cant you come out to my ranch and do the work really i dont see how i can do that declared frank i must be here to see that the mechanical arrangement is put up right now you must come declared carson i wont take no for your answer you can give instructions for that business i suppose you have a plan of it not yet but i shall have before night can you get your business here done today i may be able to but i am not sure then youre going with me tomorrow i cant leave my friends who are bring them right along it doesnt make a bit of difference if there are twenty of them ill find places for them and they shall have the best the twin star affords now if you refuse that offer you and i are enemies the man said this laughingly but he placed frank in an awkward position he had just done a great favor for merriwell and frank felt that he could not refuse very well mr carson he said if you put it in that light ill have to accept your hospitality thats the talk wont my boy at yale be surprised when i write him youve been visiting me ha ha ha mr carson was stopping at the metropole while frank had chosen the american the rancher urged merry to move right over to the metropole and the young actorplaywright finally consented but frank had business for that day first he telegraphed to the lithographers in chicago a long description of the scene which he wanted made on his new paper he ordered it rushed and directed them to draw on his bankers for any reasonable sum then he started out to find the proper men to construct the mechanical effect he wished he went straight to the theater first and he found that the stage manager of the broadway was a genius who could make anything frank talked with the man twenty minutes and decided that he had struck the person for whom he was looking it did not take them long to come to terms the man had several assistants who could aid him on the work and he promised to rush things frank felt well satisfied returning to his hotel merry drew a plan of what he desired as he was skillful at drawing and very rapid it did not take him more than two hours to draw the plan and write out an explicit explanation of it with that he returned to the stage manager they spent another hour talking it over and frank left feeling satisfied that the man perfectly understood his wants and would produce an arrangement as satisfactory as it could be if it were overseen during its construction by frank himself frank was well satisfied with what he had accomplished he went back to the american and drew up checks for every member of the old company paying them all two weeks salary lloyd fowler took the check without a word of thanks the others expressed their gratitude then frank moved over to the metropole where he found kent carson waiting for him hodge and gallup came along with frank these are the friends i spoke of mr carson explained frank wheres the rest of them asked the rancher looking about these are all all yes sir why by the way you talked i reckoned you were going to bring your whole company along he remembered hodge whom he had seen with frank once before and he shook hands with both bart and ephraim you are lucky to be counted as friends of a young man like mr merriwell said the cattleman that is youre lucky if hes anything like what my boy wrote that he was my boy is a great admirer of him its strange i dont remember your son said frank why hes a freshman yes but i know a large number of freshmen so my boy said said you knew them because some of them had been trying to do you a bad turn but he was glad to see you get the best of them for you were all right he said the freshmen as a class thought so too your son was very complimentary if i return to yale i shall look him up then you contemplate returning to college i do when next fall if i do not lose my money backing my play oh you wont lose fortythree thousand dollars that is not all mine to lose only onefifth of that belongs to me and i can lose that sum then why dont you let the show business alone and go back to college on that because i have determined to make a success with this play and i will not give up never yet in my life have i been defeated in an undertaking and i will not be defeated now the rancher looked at frank with still greater admiration you make me think of some verses i read once he said ive always remembered them and i think theyve had something to do with my success in life they were written by holmes the rancher paused endeavoring to recall the lines it was plain to frank that he was not a highly educated man but he was highly intelligent a man who had won his way in the world by his own efforts and determination for that reason he admired determination in others i have it exclaimed the rancher here it is be firm one constant element in luck is genuine solid old teutonic pluck see yon tall shaft it felt the earthquakes thrill clung to its base and greets the sunrise still stick to your aim the mongrels hold will slip but only crowbars loose the bulldogs grip small as he looks the jaw that never yields drags down the bellowing monarch of the fields chapter v natures nobleman frank found the twin star ranch a pleasant place the house was large and well furnished everything being in far better taste than he had expected merry knew something of ranches and ranch life which however he said nothing about he was supposed to be a very tender tenderfoot nobody dreamed he had ever handled a lariat ridden a bucking broncho or taken part in a roundup gallup roamed about the ranch inspecting everything and he was a source of constant amusement to the punchers as the cowboys were called after one of these tours of inspection he came back to the room where frank and bart were sitting filled with amazement vermont farms are different from this one smiled merry waal naow yeoure talkin id like ter know haow they ever do the milkin here i dont blieve all ther men theyve got kin milk so menny caows why i saw a hull drove of moren five hundred cattle about here on the farm an they told me them warnt a pinch of what mr carson owns gosh all hemlock but he must be rich mr carson seems to be pretty well fixed said merry thats so hes got a fine place here only its too goldinged mernoternous monotonous how the graounds too flat aint any hills to rest a fellers eyes aginst i tell yeou it does a man good to go aout where he kin see somethin besides a lot of flatness an sky there aint northin in the world purtier than the varmount hills in summer theyre all green an covered with grass an trees an daown in the valleys is the streams an rivers runnin along sometimes swift an foamin sometimes slow an smooth like glars an ther cattle are feedin on ther hills an ther folks are to work on their farms an ther farm haouses all painted white are somethin purty ter see they jest do a mans heart an soul good an then when it is good summer weather in varmount i be dadbimmed if theres any better weather nowhere ther sun jest shines right daown as if it was glad to git a look at sech a purty country an ther skys as blue as elsie bellwoods eyes ther birds are singin in ther trees an ther bees go hummin in ther clover fields an theres sich a goldurn good feelin gits inter a feller that he jest wants ter larf an shaout all ther time aout here there aint no trees fer ther birds ter sing in an there dont seem ter be northin but flat graound an cattle an sky frank had been listening with interest to the words of the country boy a lover of nature himself merry realized that gallups soul had been deeply impressed by the fair features of nature around his country home yes ephraim he said vermont is very picturesque and beautiful the vermont hills are something once seen never to be forgotten gallup was warmed up over his subject but when it comes to daownright purtiness he went on there aint northing like varmount in the fall fer that then evry day yeou kin see ther purtiest sights human eyes ever saw then is the time them hills is wuth seein first the leaves on ther maples an beeches an oaks they begin ter turn yaller an red a little bit then ther frost comes more an them leaves turn red an gold till it seems that ther hull sides of them hills is jest like a purty painted picter the green of the cedars an furs jest orfsets the yaller an gold where there is rocks on the hills they seem to turn purple an blue in the fall an they look purty too purtiern they do at any other time i uster jest go aout an set right daown an look at them air hills by the hour an i uster say to myself i didnt see haow heaven could be any purtier than the varmount hills in ther fall but there was folks he went on whut lived right there where all them purty sights was an never saw um they warnt blind neither i know some folks i spoke to abaout how purty the hills looked told me they hednt noticed um naow what du yeou think of that ive even hed folks tell me they couldnt see northin purty abaout um naow whut do yeou think of that i ruther guess them folks missed half ther fun of livin they was born with somethin ther matter with um it uster do me good ter take my old muzzleloadin gun an go aout in the woods trampin in the fall i uster like ter walk where the leaves hed fell jest to hear um rustle id give a dollar this minute ter walk through the fallen leaves in the varmount woods i didnt go out ter shoot things so much as i did to see things there was plenty of squirrels but i never shot but one red squirrel in my life he come aout on the end of a limb clost to me an chittered at me in a real jolly way sames to say hello young feller aint this a fine day aint yeou glad yeoure livin an then i up an shot him like a goldurn pirut ephraim stopped and choked a little bart was looking at him now with a strange expression on his face frank did not speak but he was fully in sympathy with the tenderhearted country youth bart rose to his feet heaving a deep sigh im afraid i missed some things when i was a boy he said there were plenty of woods for me but i never found any pleasure in them i used to think it fun to shoot squirrels but now i believe it would have been greater pleasure for me if i had not shot them i never listened to the music of the woods for i didnt know there was any music in them gallup you have shown me that i was a fool then with his hands thrust deep into his pockets he walked out of the room because ephraim was very verdant the cowboys on the twin star fancied that mr carsons other visitors must be equally as accustomed to western ways frank was hard at work on his play and that caused him to stick pretty close to the house however he was a person who believed in exercise when he could find it and so on the afternoon of the second day he went out and asked one of the punchers if he could have a pony the man looked him over without being able to wholly conceal his contempt kin you ride he asked yes answered frank quietly hawse or kaow asked the cowboy if you have a good saddle horse id like to have him said merry and be good enough to restrain your sarcasm i dont like it the puncher gasped he was angry the idea of a tenderfoot speaking to him in such a way all right he muttered ill git ye a critter but our western hawses aint like your eastern ladies hawses he departed hodge had overheard all this and he came up you want to look out merry he said that chap didnt like the way you called him down and hell bring you a vicious animal i know it nodded merry pulling on a pair of heavy gloves it is what i expect bart said no more he had seen merry ride and he knew frank was a natural horse breaker the puncher returned in a short time leading a little wiry evileyed broncho he was followed by several other cowboys and merry heard one of them say better not let him try it hough hell be killed and carson will fire you ill warn him returned the one called hough an then i wont be ter blame he wants ter ride let him ride if he kin frank looked the broncho over is this the best saddle horse you have he asked waal hes the only one handy now was the sullen answer hes a bit onreliable at times an youd better look out fer him i wouldnt recommend him for a lady ter ride by that i presume you mean he is a bucker waal he may buck some admitted the puncher surprised that frank should ask such a question you havent anything but a hackamore on him said merry why didnt you put a bit in his mouth do people usually ride with hackamores out here he kinder objects to a bit confessed the cowboy his surprise increasing people out here ride with any old thing mebbe you hadnt better try him has he ever been ridden certainly you give your word to that yep all right then ill ride him frank went into the saddle before the puncher was aware that he contemplated such a thing he yanked the halter out of the mans hand who leaped aside with a cry of surprise and fear barely escaping being hit by the bronchos heels for the creature wheeled and kicked with a shrill scream frank was entirely undisturbed he had put on a pair of spurred riding boots which he found in the house and now the broncho felt the prick of the spurs then the broncho began to buck down went his head and up into the air went his heels down came his heels and up went his head then he came down on all fours and his entire body shot into the air he came down stifflegged his back humped again and again he did this with his nose between his knees but still the tenderfoot remained in the saddle good lord cried the wondering cowboys bart hodge stood at one side his hands in his pockets a look of quiet confidence on his face from an upper window of the ranch a pretty sadfaced girl looked out seeing everything frank had noticed her just before mounting the broncho he wondered not a little for up to that moment he had known nothing of such a girl being there he had not seen her before since coming to the ranch all at once the broncho began to pitch aplunging jumping forward as he bucked he stopped short and whirled endforend bringing his nose where his tail was a moment before he did that as he leaped into the air then he began to go up and down fore and aft with a decidedly nasty motion he screamed his rage he pitched first on one side and then on the other letting his shoulders alternately jerk up and droop down almost to the ground good lord cried the cowboys again for through all this frank merriwell sat firmly in the saddle is this yere your tenderfoot what yer told us ye was goin ter learn a lesson hough they asked waal ill be blowed was all the reply hough made the broncho pitched fencecornered but even that had no effect on the rider hough told the truth when he said the animal had been ridden before realizing at last the fruitlessness of its efforts it suddenly ceased all attempts to unseat frank two minutes later merriwell was riding away on the creatures back and hough the discomfited cowboy was the laughingstock of the twin star ranch chapter vi a change of name at the open upper window of the ranch the sadfaced pretty girl watched and waited till frank merriwell came riding back over the prairie here he comes she whispered he is handsome so handsome he is the first man i have seen who could be compared with lawton kent carson had heard of franks departure on wildfire the bucking broncho he found it difficult to believe that his guest had really ridden away on the animal and he was on hand together with bart and ephraim when merry came riding back near one of the corrals a group of cowboys had gathered to watch the remarkable tenderfoot and make sarcastic remarks to hough who was with them looking sulky and disgusted mr carson hurried to greet frank look here young man he cried id like to know where you ever learned to ride bucking bronchos this is not the first time i have been on a cattle ranch mr carson smiled frank springing down from wildfire one of the cowboys came shuffling forward it was hough say tenderfoot he said keeping his eyes on the ground i allows that i made some onnecessary remarks ter you a while ago i kinder hinted as how you might ride a kaow bettern a hawse ill take it all back you may be a tenderfoot but you knows how ter ride as well as any of us i said some things what i hadnt oughter said an i swallers it all thats all right laughed frank goodnaturedly you may have had good reasons for regarding tenderfeet with contempt but now you will know all tenderfeet are not alike i dont hold feelings thankee said hough as he led wildfire away frank glanced up toward the open window above and again he caught a glimpse of that sad sweet face mr carson shook hands with frank now i know you are the kind of chap to succeed in life he declared i can see that you do whatever you undertake to do i am beginning to understand better and better how it happened that my boy thought so much of you he took frank by the arm and together they walked toward the house again merry glanced upward but somewhat to his disappointment that face had vanished it was after supper that merry and hodge were sitting alone on the veranda in front of the house when bart suddenly said in a low tone merriwell i have a fancy that there is something mysterious about this place is that so said frank what is it i think there is some one in one of those upper rooms who is never seen by the rest of the people about the place what makes you think so there is a room up there that ive never seen anyone enter or leave the door is always closed twice while passing the door i have heard strange sounds coming from that room this grows interesting admitted frank go on the first time said bart i heard some one in there weeping and sobbing as if her heart would break her heart came quickly from merrys lips yes then it is a female beyond a doubt the second time i heard sounds in that room today after you rode away on the broncho i heard some one singing in there singing yes it was a love song the voice was very sad and sweet and still there seemed something of happiness in it hodge was silent well you have stumbled on a mystery nodded frank slowly what do you make of it i dont know what to make of it unless some friend or relative of carsons is confined in that room why confined there you know as well as i do frank opened his lips to say something about the face he had seen at the window but at that moment carson himself came out onto the veranda smoking his pipe the rancher took a chair near and they chatted away as twilight and darkness came on how are you getting along on your play mr merriwell asked the man very well answered frank you know it is a drama of college life life at yale no i didnt know about that it is just now i am puzzled most to find a name for it what was the name before for old eli uhum who was old eli there cried merry that shows me there is a fault with the name even though your boy is in yale you do not know that yale college is affectionately spoken of by yale men as old eli no never knew it before though come to think about it berlin did write something in some of his letters about old eli i didnt understand it though and the public in general do not understand the title of my play they suppose old eli must be a character in the piece and i do not fancy there is anything catching and drawing about the title i must have a new title and im stuck to find one that will exactly fit i suppose you must have one that has some reference to college oh yes that is what i want one that brings yale in somehow all you yale men seem to be stuck on that college youre true blue frank leaped to his feet with a cry of delight i have it he exclaimed what gasped mr carson the title you have yes you gave it to me then i did sure thing what is it true blue that is a title that fits the play yales color is blue you know people may not understand just what the title means but still i believe there is something attractive about it something that will draw and the audience will understand it before the play is over true blue is the name i have been well paid for coming out here mr carson besides entertaining me royally you have given me a striking name for my play well im sure im glad if ive done that laughed kent carson i must put that title down on the manuscript said frank i feel an inspiration i must go to work at once i am in the mood now and i can write excusing himself he hurried into the house soon a light gleamed from the window of the room in which he worked which was on the ground floor looking in at that window hodge saw frank had started a fire in the grate and lighted a lamp he was seated at a table writing away swiftly kent carson got up and stood beside hodge looking into the room merriwell is a great worker said the rancher hes a steam engine declared bart i never saw a fellow who could do so much work and so many things there is no telling how long he will drive away at that play tonight now that he has the title he may finish it tonight and be ready to leave here in the morning if that happens i shall be sorry i gave the title so soon said the cattleman sincerely i have taken a great liking to that young man frank worked away a long time utterly unconscious of the flight of the hours at last he became aware that the fire in the open grate had made the room uncomfortably warm he had replenished it several times as there was something wonderfully cheerful in an open fire he arose and flung wide the window the moon a thin shining scimitar was low down in the west soon it would drop from view beyond the horizon there was a haze on the plain slowly out of that haze came two objects that seemed to be approaching cattle said merry turning back from the window and sitting down at the table again he resumed work on the play he did not hear the door open softly he did not hear a light footstep behind him he did not hear a rustling sound quite near and it was not until a deep tremulous sigh reached his ears that he became aware of another presence in the room like a flash frank whirled about and found himself face to face with the girl he had seen at the window in astonishment frank gazed at the girl who was dressed in some dark material as if she were in mourning he saw that she was quite as pretty as he had fancied at first although her face was very pale and sad the color of her dress and hair made her face seem paler than it really was only a moment did frank remain thus then he sprang up bowing politely and saying i beg your pardon i did not know there was a lady in the room she bowed in return do not rise she said i saw you today from my window and i could not sleep till i had seen you again somehow you seemed to remind me of lawton i thought so then but now it does not seem so much that way still you made me think of him i have been shut up there so long so long i have not talked to anybody and i wanted to talk to somebody who could tell me something of the world something of the places far away i am buried here where nobody knows anything to talk about but cattle and horses franks heart was thrilled with sympathy do they keep you shut up in that room he asked no i stay there from choice this is the first time i have been downstairs for weeks i have refused to leave the room i refused to see my father i cant bear to have him look at me with such pity and anger your father he is mr carson yes it is strange he has never spoken to me of you i was not aware he had a daughter although he spoke proudly of his son in an instant frank regretted his words a look of anguish swept over the face of the girl and she fell back a step one thin hand fluttering up to her bosom no she cried and her voice was like the sob of the wind beneath the leaves of a deserted house he never speaks of me he says i am dead dead to the world he is proud of his son berlin my brother but he is ashamed of his daughter blanche frank began to suspect and understand the truth this girl had met with some great sorrow a sorrow that had wrecked her life instantly merrys heart was overflowing with sympathy but his situation was most embarrassing and he knew not what to say the girl seemed to understand this dont think me crazy because i have come here to you in this way she entreated dont think me bold oh if you could know how i have longed for somebody with whom i could talk i saw you were a gentleman i knew my father would not introduce me to you but i resolved to see you hoping you would talk to me hoping you would tell me of the things going on in the world i shall be glad to do so said merry gently but dont you have any papers any letters anything to tell you the things you wish to know nothing nothing i am dead to the world you were writing have i interrupted you no i am through working on my play tonight your play she cried eagerly what are you doing with a play perhaps perhaps she stopped speaking seeming to make an effort to hold her eagerness in check i am writing a play frank explained that is i am rewriting it now i wrote it some time ago and put it on the road but it was a failure i am going out again soon with a new company her eagerness seemed to increase then you must know many actors she said perhaps you know him know whom lawton lawton kilgore frank shook his head never heard of him she showed great disappointment i am so sorry she said i hoped you might be able to tell me something about him if you can tell me nothing i must tell you i must talk to somebody you see how it is mother is dead father sent me to school in the east it was there that i met lawton he was so handsome he was the leading man in a company that i saw then after the company disbanded for the season he came back to spend the summer in the town where i was at school i suppose i was foolish but fell in love with him we were together a great deal we became engaged frank fancied he knew what was coming the girl was skipping over the story as lightly as possible but she was letting him understand it all i didnt write father about it she went on for i knew he would not approve of lawton he wanted me to marry brandon king who owns the silver forks ranch i did not love king i loved lawton kilgore but the principal of the school found out what was going on and he wrote father then lawton disappeared and i heard nothing from him they say he deserted me i do not believe it i think he was driven away i waited and waited for him but i could not study i could not do anything he never came back and at last father came and took me away he brought me here he was ashamed of me but he said he would not leave me to starve for i was his own daughter his kindness was cruel for he cut me off from the world still i believe that some day lawton will come for me and take me away from here i believe he will come if they have not killed him she whispered the final words they who asked frank startled my father and my brother she answered they were furious enough to kill him they swore they would she had told merry her story and she seemed to feel relieved she asked him many questions about the actors he knew he said he had the pictures of nearly all who had taken parts in his two plays she asked to see them and he brought them out from his large traveling case showing them to her one by one she looked at them all with interest of a sudden she gave a low sharp cry her hand darted out and caught up one of the photographs here here she panted you have his picture here this is lawton kilgore lawton my lover it was the picture of leslie lawrence chapter vii the tragedy at the ranch that exclaimed frank you must be mistaken that mans name is not kilgore it is lawrence he fancied the girl was crazy he had wondered if her misfortune had affected her brain this is the picture of lawton kilgore she repeated in a dull tone do you think i would not know him anywhere under any circumstances this is the man who promised to marry me this is the man my father hates as he hates a snake well that man is worthy of your fathers hatred said merry for he is a thoroughbred villain but i think you must be mistaken for your father met him in denver this man had me arrested and your father followed to the police station and was instrumental in securing my release if this man was kilgore your father would have found his opportunity to kill him you do not understand panted the girl father has never seen him to know him has never even seen his picture if lawton was known by another name father would not have recognized him even though they met in denver frank began to realize that the girl was talking in a sensible manner and something told him she spoke the truth to his other crimes lawrence had added that of deceiving an innocent girl and he is in denver panted the ranchers daughter he is so near oh if he would come to me frank was sorry that he had permitted her to see the photographs but it was too late now for regrets the girl pressed the picture to her lips you must give it to me she panted i will take it to my room i wish to be alone with it at once oh i thank you then she hurried from the room leaving merry in anything but a pleasant frame of mind there was a sound outside the window frank got up and went over to the window looking out he saw two horses standing at a little distance from the ranch a man was holding them and the faint light of the moon fell on the mans face well i wonder what that means speculated frank those horses are saddled and bridled who is going to ride them tonight then he remembered the two forms he had seen coming out of the mist that lay on the plain and he wondered if they had not been two horsemen something about the appearance of the man at the heads of the horses seemed familiar he looked closer about the size and build of lloyd fowler he muttered looks like fowler but of course it is not there was a step on the veranda and a figure appeared at the open window into the room stepped a man frank sprang back and was face to face with the intruder leslie lawrence he whispered yes said the man advancing insolently i am leslie lawrence what do you want i want an engagement in your new company i have come here for it will you give it to me frank was astounded by the insolence of the fellow i should say not he exclaimed what do you take me for no leslie lawrence alias lawton kilgore villain deceiver of innocent girls wretch who deserves hanging i will not give you an engagement unless it is with an outraged father go if you wish to live leave instantly if kent carson finds you here he will know you now and your life will not be worth a cent at this moment the door was flung open and ephraim gallup came striding into the room saying as he entered darned if i knowed there was a purty young gal in this haouse thought id come daown frank an see if yeou was goin to stay up all night writin on that play of waal i be goshblamed ephraim saw lawrence and he was astounded didnt know yeou hed visitors frank he said so you refuse me an engagement do you merriwell snarled lawrence all right youll wish you hadnt in a minute he made a spring for the table and caught up the manuscript lying on it then he leaped toward the open grate where the fire was burning thats the last of your old play he shouted hurling the manuscript into the flames both frank and ephraim sprang to save the play but neither of them was in time to prevent lawrences revengeful act you miserable cur panted frank out shot his fist striking the fellow under the ear and knocking him down at the same time ephraim snatched the manuscript from the fire and beat out the flames which had fastened on it lawrence sat up his hand going round to his hip he wrenched out a revolver and lifted it frank saw the gleam of the weapon realized his danger and dropped an instant before the pistol spoke the shot rang out but even as he pressed the trigger lawrence realized that merriwell had escaped but beyond frank directly in line he saw a palefaced girl who had suddenly appeared in the open door he heard her cry lawton and then through the puff of smoke he saw her clutch her breast and fall on the threshold shot down by his own hand horror and fear enabled him to spring up plunge out of the open window reach the horses leap on one and go thundering away toward the moonlight mists as if satan were at his heels there was a tumult at the twin star there was hot mounting to pursue lawrence and his companion carson had heard the shot he had rushed down to find his daughter shot in the side supported in the arms of frank merriwell a few words had told carson just what had happened he swore a fearful oath to follow lawrence to death the girl heard the oath she opened her eyes and whispered father dont he didnt mean to shoot me it was an accident ill have the whelp stiff at my feet before morning vowed the revengeful rancher he gave orders for the preparing of horses he saw his daughter carried to her room he lingered till the old black housekeeper was at the bedside to bind up the wound and do her best to save the girl then carson bounded down the stairs and sent a cowboy flying off on horseback for the nearest doctor a hundred miles away kill the horse under ye if necessary prescott he had yelled at the cowboy get the doctor here as quick as you can all right sir shouted prescott as he thundered away now exclaimed kent carson now to follow that murderous hound till i run him to earth he found men and horses ready and waiting he found frank merriwell and bart hodge there both of them determined to take part in the pursuit we know him said merriwell he fired that shot at me we can identify him frank believed that lawrence had murdered the ranchers daughter and he like the others was eager to run the wretch down they galloped away in pursuit the rancher four cowboys merriwell and hodge all armed all grimfaced all determined the sun had risen when they came riding back to the ranch ephraim gallup met frank did ye git ther critter he asked in a whisper no was the answer then he got erway came in accents of disappointment from the vermonter no whut haows that neither lawrence nor fowler escaped then it was fowler with him i believe so whut happened to um they attempted to ford big sandy river an got drownded no where they tried to cross is nothing but a bed of quicksands horses and men went down into the quicksands they were swallowed up forever the doctor came at last he extracted the bullet from blanche carsons side and he told her she would get well as the wound was not dangerous kent carson heard this with deep relief he went to the bedside of the girl and knelt down there blanche he whispered huskily can you forgive your old dad for treating you as he has you are my own girl my little blanche no matter what you have done father she whispered in return i am glad you have come to me at last but you know you are ashamed of me you can never forget what i have done i can forget now he declared thinking of the man under the quicksands of big sandy you are my daughter i am not ashamed of you you shall never again have cause for saying that of me kiss me papa she murmured sobbing brokenly he pressed his lips to her cheeks and when he was gone from the room she took a photograph from beneath her pillow and gazed at it long and lovingly she knew not that the man had been swallowed beneath the quicksands of the big sandy the tragic occurrences of the night hastened the departure of frank and his friends from twin star ranch although kent carson urged them to remain frank had however finished his play which thanks to the prompt act of ephraim had been only slightly injured by its fiery experience and was anxious to put it in rehearsal so a day or so later frank bart and ephraim were once more in denver chapter viii the old actors champions along a street of denver walked a man whose appearance was such as to attract attention wherever seen that he had once been an actor could be told at a glance and that he had essayed great rфles was also apparent but alas it was also evident that the time when this thespian trod the boards had departed forever and with that time his glory had vanished his ancient silk hat although carefully brushed was shabby and grotesque in appearance his prince albert coat buttoned tight at the waist and left open at the bosom was shabby and shining although it also betokened that with much effort he had kept it clean his trousers bagged at the knees and there were signs of mannish sewing where two or three rents and breaks had been mended the legs of the trousers were very small setting tightly about his thin calves his shoes were in the worst condition of all although they had been carefully blackened and industriously polished it was plain that they could not hold together much longer the soles were almost completely worn away and the uppers were breaking and ripping the linen of this frayed gentleman seemed spotlessly white his black silk necktie was knotted in a broad bow the mans face was rather striking in appearance the eyes had once been clear and piercing the mouth firm and well formed but there was that about the chin which belied the firmness of the mouth for this feature showed weakness the head was broad at the top with a high wide brow the eyes were set so far back beneath the bushy grayish eyebrows that they seemed like red coals glowing in dark caverns for red they were and bloodshot the mans long hair fell upon the collar of his coat and on his face was set the betraying marks of the vice that had wrought his downfall the bloodshot eyes alone did not reveal it but the purplish unhealthy flush of the entire face and neck plainly indicated that the demon drink had fastened its death clutch upon him and dragged him down from the path that led to the consummation of all his hopes and aspirations he had been drinking now his unsteady step told that he needed the aid of his cane in order to keep on his feet he slipped his hat fell off rolled over and over dropped into the gutter and lay there the unfortunate man looked round for the hat but it was some time before he found it when he did in attempting to pick it up he fell over in the gutter and rolled upon it soiling his clothes at last with a great effort he gathered himself up and rose unsteadily to his feet with his hat and cane what ho he muttered thickly it seems the world hath grown strangely unsteady but perchance it may be my feet some boys who had seen him fall shouted and laughed at him he looked toward them sadly mock mock mock he cried some of you thoughtless brats may fall even lower than i have fallen well i like that i dont think exclaimed one of the boys i dont low no jagged stiff to call me a brat then he threw a stone at the old actor striking the man on the cheek and cutting him slightly the unfortunate placed his crushed and soiled hat on his head took out a handkerchief and slowly wiped a little blood from his cheek all the while swaying a bit as if the ground beneath his feet were tossing like a ship now let it work he quoted mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt how now fellow the thoughtless young ruffians shouted with laughter looker the old duffer cried one aint that a picture fer yer look exclaimed the actor behold me with thy eyes even lower than i have fallen may thou descend but i have aspired to heights of which thy sordid soul may never dream out upon you dog with these words he reached the walk and turned down the street lets foller him cried one of the gang we can have heaps of fun with him come on come on with a wild whoop they rushed after the man they reached him danced around him pulled his coat tails jostled him crushed his hat over his eyes give the old duffer fits cried the leader who was a tough young thug of about eighteen there were seven boys in the gang and four or five others came up on the run eager to have a hand in the racket the old actor pushed his hat back from his eyes folded his arms over his outthrown breast and gazed with his red sunken eyes at the leader as if declaiming on the stage he spoke you have done that you should be sorry for there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am armed so strong in honesty that they pass me by as the idle wind which i respect not this caused the boys to shout with laughter git onter ther guy what ails him hes locoed loaded you mean hes cracked in the nut and he needs another crack on the nut shouted the leader dancing up and again knocking the hat over the old mans eyes once more pushing it back the aged actor spoke in his deep voice made somewhat husky by drink be patient till the last romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear believe me for mine honor and have respect to mine honor that you may believe censure me in your wisdom and awaken your senses that you may oh thats too much cried the ruffianly young leader we cant stand that kind of guy whatre yer givin us anyway hes drunk shouted several alas and alack sighed the old man i fear thou speakest the truth boundless intemperance in nature is a tyranny it hath been the untimely emptying of the happy throne and the fall of many kings thats what causes your fall declared the ruffianly leader as he tripped the actor causing him to fall heavily whats this exclaimed frank merriwell who with hodge for a companion just returned from twin star ranch at this moment came into view round a corner what are those fellows doing to that poor man raising hob with him said bart quickly the old fellow is drunk and they are abusing him well i think its time for us to take a hand in that i should say so come on frank sprang forward bart followed the old actor was just making an effort to get up the young ruffian who led the gang kicked him over the sight made franks blood leap you cowardly young cur he cried and he gave the fellow a crack on the ear that sent him spinning hodge struck out right and left quickly sending two of the largest fellows to the ground permit me to assist you sir said frank stooping to aid the actor to rise the leader of the gang had recovered he uttered a mad howl at em fellers knock the stuffins outer them he screamed rushing on frank merry straightened up instantly he whirled about and saw the biggest tough coming at him with the rest of the gang at his back then frank laughed walk right up you young terriers he cried in a clear ringing voice well make it rather interesting for you give it to them hodge hodge did so together the two friends met the onslaught of the gang their hard fists cracked on the heads of the young ruffians and it was astonishing how these fellows were bowled over bart was aroused his intense anger was betrayed by his knotted forehead his flashing eyes and his gleaming teeth he did not speak a word but he struck swift strong and sure if those chaps had expected an easy thing with the two welldressed youths who had interfered with their sport they met the disappointment of their lives it actually seemed that at one time every one of the gang had been knocked sprawling and not one was on his feet to face the fighting champions of the old actor it was a terrible surprise for the toughs one after another they sprang up and took to their heels what have we struck gasped the leader looking up at frank get up invited merry standing over him get up and i will give you another dose excuse me gasped the fellow as he scrambled away on his hands and knees sprang up and followed the rest of the young thugs it was over the gang had been put to flight and it had been accomplished in a very few moments hodge stood there panting glaring about looking surprised and disappointed as well as angry that was too easy he exclaimed i thought we were in for a fight evidently they did not stand for our kind of fighting smiled frank it surprised them so that they threw up the sponge before the fight was fairly begun i didnt get half enough of it muttered bart during the fight the old actor had risen to his feet now frank picked up his hat and restored it to him after brushing some dirt from it the man received it with a profound bow placing it on his head he thrust his right hand into the bosom of his coat struck a pose and cried are yet two romans living such as these the last of all the romans we saw you were in trouble said merry and we hastened to give you such assistance as we could it was a goodly deed a deed well done thy arms are strong thy hearts are bold methinks i see before me two noble youths fit to have lived in the days of knighthood you are very complimentary smiled frank amused at the old mans quaint way the actor took his hand from his bosom and made a deprecating gesture saying nay do not think i flatter for what advancement may i hope from thee i but speak the thoughts my heart bids me speak i am old the wreck of a once noble man yet you did not hesitate to stand by me in my hour of need even at peril to yourselves i cannot reward you i can but offer the thanks of one whose name it may be you have never heard one whose name today but for himself and his own weakness might be on the tongues of the people of two continents gentlemen accept the thanks of william shakespeare burns mr burns said frank from your words and your manner i am led to believe that you are an actor nay nay once i trod the boards and interpreted the characters of the immortal bard for whom i was named that time is past i am an actor no longer i am a has been my day is past my sun hath set and night draweth on apace i thought i could not be mistaken said frank we too are actors although not shakespearian ones is this true exclaimed the old tragedian and i have been befriended by those who wouldst follow the noble art brothers i greet thee but these are sad sad days for the drama hath fallen into a decline the legitimate is scoffed at the stage is defiled by the ribald jest the clownish lowcomedy star the dancing and singing comedian and vaudeville ah me that we should have fallen into such evil ways the indecencies now practiced in the name of art and the drama are enough to make the immortal william turn in his grave oh for the good old days but they are gone forever gone it seems strange to meet an actor like you at liberty and so far from the rialto declared merry i have been touring the country giving readings burns hastened to explain ah it is sad sad once i might have packed the largest theater of the metropolis today i am doing well if i bring out a round dozen to listen to my readings at some crossroad schoolhouse in the country thus have the mighty fallen i presume you are thinking of getting back to new york nay nay what my eyes have beheld there and my ears have heard is enough my heart is sick within me i was there at the opening of the season one broadway theater was given over to burlesque of the very lowest order while another was but little better in character a leading theater close to broadway was packed every night by welldressed people who went there to behold a vile french farce in which the leading lady disrobed upon the stage ah me in truth the world hath gone wrong the ways of men are evil and all their thoughts are vile it is well that shakespeare cannot rise from his grave to look upon the horrors now perpetrated on the englishspeaking stage if he were to be restored to life and visit one of our theaters i think his second funeral would take place the following day he would die of heart failure frank laughed heartily i believe you are right it would give william a shock that is certain but there are good modern plays you know the actor shook his head i do not know he declared i have not seen them if there is not something nasty in the play of today then it must of a certainty have its effect in the way of some mechanical contrivance a horse race a steamboat explosion a naval battle or something of the sort it seems that a piece cannot survive on its merits as a play but must perforce be bolstered up by some wretched device called an effect truer words were never spoken admitted frank and still there are a few plays written today that do not depend on such devices in order to catch the popular fancy however i have found it necessary to introduce effects you speak as one experienced in the construction of plays i have had some experience i am about to start on the road with my own company and my own play of a sudden frank seemed struck by an idea by jove he exclaimed did you say you were at liberty just at present yes then if i can get you you are the very man i want the old man shook his head your play can contain no part i would care to interpret he said with apparent regret but i think it is possible that you might be induced to play the part i had a man for it but i lost him i was on my way to the orpheum to see if i could not find another to fill his place what sort of a part is it asked burns plainly endeavoring to conceal his eagerness it is comedy what cried the old actor aghast and horrified wouldst offer me such a part dost think i i who have played hamlet brutus lear and othello would stoop so low this is the most unkindest cut of all but there is money in it good sure money i have several thousand dollars to back me and i am going out with my piece to make or break i shall keep it on the road several weeks at any cost the old actor shook his head it cannot be he sadly said i am no comedian i could not play the part if you will but dress as you are if you will add a little that is fantastic to your natural acting you can play the part it is that of a wouldbe tragedian a shakespearian actor worse and worse moaned the old man you would have me burlesque myself out upon you i will pay you thirtyfive dollars a week and railroad expenses how can you do better thirtyfi the old actor gasped for breath he seemed unable for some moments to speak it was plain that the sum seemed like a small fortune to him at last his dignity and his old nature reasserted itself young man he said dost know what thou hast done i i am william shakespeare burns a paltry thirtyfive per week bah go to well ill make it forty and i can get a hundred good men for that at this time of the season the aged thespian bowed his head slowly he spoke again quoting why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me you would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck to the heart of my mystery but the money you seem to need that money is a good thing to have methinks there is much reason in his sayings it is true ah but how can i thus lower myself as you have said the good old days are past it is useless to live for them live for the present and the future money is base stuff but we must have it come come i know you can do the part well get along splendidly good reasons must of force give place to better as cassius saith men at some time in their lives are masters of their fates but i think for me that time is past but forty dollars ye gods it is better than reading to a scant dozen listeners at crossroads schoolhouses ah well you take advantage of my needs i accept but i must have a dollar at once with which to purchase that which will drown the shame my heart doth feel you shall have the dollar assured frank come along with us and we will complete arrangements so the old actor was borne away outwardly sad but inwardly congratulating himself on the greatest streak of luck he had come upon in many moons chapter ix welcome letters frank merriwell was determined to give a performance of his revised play in denver for advertising purposes he had the utmost confidence in true blue as he had rechristened the piece but the report of his failure in puelbo had spread afar in dramatic circles being carried broadcast by the eastern dramatic papers and managers were shy of booking the revised version some time before after receiving the fortune from the carson city bank merry had made a fair and equal division sending checks for their share to browning diamond and rattleton toots share he had been unable to forward not knowing the address of the faithful darky who had been forced to go forth into the world to win his way when frank met with the misfortune that caused him to leave yale and now came three letters from three yale men diamonds was brief dear old comrade it is plain you are still a practical joker your very valuable check on the first national of denver received i really do not know what to do with so much money but i am afraid you are making a mistake by using a check on an existing bank why didnt you draw one on the first sand bank of denver it would have served your purpose just as well cant write much now as i am making preparations for vacation which is only a month away im afraid it will be a sorry vacation for me this year not much like the last one then we were all together and what times we did have at fardale and in maine im blue tonight old friend and do not feel like writing i fancy it has made me feel bluer than ever to read in the dramatic reflector of your unfortunate failure in puelbo and the disbanding of your company after your backer deserted you hard luck frank hard luck all the fellows have been hoping you would make money enough to come back here in the fall but all that is over now what are you doing cant you find time to write to us and let us know we are very anxious about you i will write you again when i am more in the mood hoping your fortune may turn for the better i remain always your friend jack diamond frank read this aloud to hodge and gallup in his room at the metropole hotel waal by ginger exploded ephraim what do yeou think of that now you see what your reputation as a practical joker is doing for you merry said hodge well ill be hanged if i dont believe diamond considers it a joke laughed frank of course he does nodded bart well he is putting a joke on himself hell be somewhat surprised when he discovers that ephraim began to grin thats so by thutter he cried here is a letter from rattleton said merry picking up another from the mail he had just received i wonder how he takes it read it and find aout advised gallup a wise suggestion bowed frank with mock gravity tearing it open this is what he read dear merry cheese it what do you take us for a lot of chumps were onto you eight thousand fiddlesticks im going to have the check framed and hang it in my room it will be a reminder of you say that was tough about your fizzle in puelbo it came just when we were hoping you know the fellows have been gathering at the fence and talking about you and your return to college since browning came back and told us how you were making a barrel of money with your play now the report of your disaster is spread broadcast and we know you cannot come back its tough diamond is in a blue funk he hasnt been half the man he was since you went away hasnt seemed to care much of anything about studying or doing anything else and as a result it is pretty certain hell be dropped a class but diamond is not the only one you know browning was dropped once he is too lazy to study but in order to keep in your class he might have pulled through had you been here now it is known for an almost certain thing that he will not be able to pass exams and you know what that means im not going to say anything about myself its dull here none of your friends took any interest in the college theatricals last winter and the show was on the bum the whole shooting match made a lot of guys of themselves baseball has been dead slow so far this season we are down in the mud with princeton crowing it takes you merry to twist the tigers tail what was the matter everything all the pitchers could do for us was to toss em up and get batted out of the box the new men were not in it they had glass arms and the old reliables had dead wings it was pitiful i cant write any more about it id like to see you frank would i ask me oh say dont you think you can arrange it so you can come east this summer come and see me say come and stay all summer with me at my home we wont do a thing but have a great time write to me and give me your promise you will come dont you refuse me old man yours till death rattles heres another cried frank if that doesnt beat why they all think those checks fakes as i said before said hodge you see what your reputation as a practical joker is doing for you i see nodded frank it is giving me a chance to get a big joke on those fellows they will drop dead when they learn those checks actually are good waal i should say yes nodded ephraim jest naow theyre kainder thinkin yeou are an object fer charity heres brownings letter mr frank merriwell millionaire and philanthropist dear sir i seize my pen in my hand being unable to seize it with my foot and hasten to acknowledge the receipt of your princely gift with my usual energy and haste i dash off these few lines at the rate of ten thousand words a minute only stopping to rest after each word after cashing your check with the pawnbroker i shall use the few dollars remaining to settle in part with my tailor who has insisted in a most ungentlemanly manner on the payment of his little bill which has been running but a short time less than two years i think the sordid greed and annoying persistence of this man has much embarrassed me and i would pay him off entirely if it were not that i wish to get my personal property out of my uncles safedeposit vault where it has been resting for some time it is evident to me that you have money to burn in an open grate that is great as griswold would say and it was so kind of you to remember your old friends the little hint accompanying each check that thus you divided the spoils of our great trip across the continent was not sufficient to deceive anyone into the belief that this was other than a generous act on your part and a free gift there is not much news to write save that everybody is in the dumps and everything has turned blue i suppose some of the others will tell you all about things so that will save me the task which you know i would intensely enjoy as i do love to work it is the joy of my life to labor i spend as much time as possible each day working on a comfortable couch in my room but i will confess that i might not work quite so hard if it was not necessary to draw at the pipe in order to smoke up when are you coming east arent you getting tired of the west why cant you make a visit to yale before vacation time you would be received with great йclat excuse my french i have to fling it around occasionally when i cant think of any latin or greek why do you suppose latin and greek were invented why didnt those old duffers use english and save us poor devils no end of grinding unfortunately i have just upset the ink and having no more i must quit yours energetically bruce browning well its simply marvelous that he stuck to it long enough to write all that laughed frank and he like the others thinks the check a fake hodge got up and stood looking sullenly out of the window whats the matter bart asked merry detecting that there was something wrong nothing muttered the darkfaced fellow oh come was there anything in those letters you did not like no it was something there was not in the letters what not one of those fellows even mentioned me cried hodge fiercely whirling about i didnt care a rap about diamond and rattleton but browning would have showed a trace of decency if he had said a word about me he made a bad blunder and was forced to confess it but ill bet he doesnt think a whit more of me now oh you are too sensitive old man they did not even write anything in particular for news and think how many of my friends at college they failed to mention oh well they knew i was with you and one of them might have asked for me i hope you may go back to yale merry but wild horses could not drag me back there i hate them all hate them hodge yes hate them bart almost shouted they are a lot of cads there is not a whole man among them then he strode out of the room giving the door a bang behind him of course frank made haste to reply to the letters of his college chums assuring them that the checks were perfectly good and adding that although he had some reputation as a practical joker he was not quite crazy enough to utter a worthless check on a wellknown bank as that would be a criminal act frank mentioned hodge and without saying so in so many words gave them to understand that bart felt the slight of not being spoken of in any of the letters from his former acquaintances one thing frank did not tell them and that was that he was on the point of starting out again with his play having renamed it and rewritten it and added a sensational feature of the spectacular order in the view of a boat race between yale harvard and cornell even though he was venturing everything on the success of the piece merry realized now better than ever before that no man was so infallible that he could always correctly foretell the fate of an untried play it is a great speculation to put a play on the road at large expense the oldest managers are sometimes deceived in the value of a dramatic piece of property and it is not an infrequent thing that they lose thousands of dollars in staging and producing a play in which they have the greatest confidence but which the theatergoing public absolutely refuses to accept frank had been very confident that his second play would be a winner in its original form but disaster had befallen it at the very start he might have kept it on the road as it stood for at the very moment when he seemed hopelessly stranded without a dollar in the world fortune had smiled upon him by placing in his hands the wealth which he had found in the utah desert at the time of his bicycle tour across the continent but merry had realized that in the condition in which it then stood it was more than probable that the play would prove an utter failure should he try to force it upon the public this caused him to take prompt action first he brought the company to denver holding all of them save the two men who had caused him no small amount of trouble namely lloyd fowler and charlie harper calmly reviewing his play at twin star ranch frank decided that the comedy element was not strong enough in the piece to make it a popular success on the road accordingly he introduced two new characters it would be necessary in order to produce the effect that he desired to employ a number of supers in each place where the play was given as he did not believe he would be warranted in the expense of carrying nonspeaking characters with him on his return to denver frank had hastened at once to look over the mechanical effect which had been constructed for him it was not quite completed but was coming on well and as far as frank could see had been constructed perfectly according to directions and plans of course one man had not done the work alone he had been assisted by carpenters and scene painters and the work had been rushed merry got his company together and began rehearsing the revised play his paper from chicago came on and examination showed that it was quite up to the mark in fact havener the stage manager was delighted with it declaring that it was the most attractive stuff he had seen in many years but for the loss of one of the actors he had engaged to fill one of the comedy parts merry would have been greatly pleased by the manner in which things moved along now however he believed that in william shakespeare burns he had found a man who could fill the place left vacant although hodge had been ready enough to defend burns from the young ruffians who were hectoring him on the street he had little faith in the man as a comedian hodge could see no comedy in the old actor to tell the truth it was seldom that hodge could see comedy in anything and low comedy sure to appeal to the masses he regarded as foolish for another reason hodge felt uncertain about burns it was plain that the aged tragedian was inclined to look on the wine when it was red and bart feared he would prove troublesome and unreliable on that account i am done with the stuff hodge had declared over and over on that night in the ruffians den at ace high i swore never to touch it again for i saw what brutes it makes of men i have little confidence in any man who will drink it oh be a little more liberal entreated frank you know there are men who drink moderately and it never seems to harm them i know there are such men admitted bart but it is not blood that runs in their veins its water not all men are so hotblooded and impulsive as you and jack diamond dont speak of diamond i dont think anything of that fellow i am talking about this burns he is a sot thats plain drink has dragged him down so far that all the powers in the world cannot lift him up some night when everything depends on him he will fail you for he will be too drunk to play his part then you will be sorry that you had anything to do with him all the powers in this world might not be able to lift him up admittted frank but there are other powers that can do so i pity the poor old man he realizes his condition and what he has missed in life but the chances are that the audience will throw things at him when he appears as a comedian instead of that i believe he will convulse them with laughter well you have some queer ideas well see whos right frank kept track of burns dealing out but little money to him and that in small portions so that the old actor could not buy enough liquor to get intoxicated if he wished to do so the first rehearsal was called on the stage of the theater in denver merry had engaged the theater for that purpose the entire company assembled frank addressed them and told them that he was glad to see them again one and all they shook hands with him then burns was called forward and introduced as the new comedian at this he drew himself up to his full height folded his arms across his breast and said ay new is the word for it for never before i swear have i essayed a rфle so degraded or one that hath so troubled me by night and by day comedy comedy what sins are committed in thy name granville garland nudged douglas dunton in the ribs whispering in his ear behold your rival methinks he intrudeth on my sacred territory nodded dunton but he has to do it on the stage and on the stage i am a villain we shall not quarrel burns proved to be something of a laughingstock for the rest of the company hes a freak declared billy wynne known as props all of that agreed lester vance i dont understand why merriwell should pick up such a creature for us to associate with sniffed agnes kirk but merriwell is forever doing something freakish just think how he carried around that black tramp cat that came onto the stage to hoodoo us the first time we rehearsed this piece and there is the cat now exclaimed vance as the same black cat came walking serenely onto the stage yes here is the cat said frank who overheard the exclamation she was called a hoodoo before i have determined that she shall be a mascot and it is pretty hard to get me to give anything up when i am determined upon it well i havent a word to say declared agnes kirk but she looked several words with her eyes the rehearsal began and progressed finely till it was time for burns to enter the old actor came on but when he tried to say his lines the words seemed to stick in his throat and choke him several times he started but finally he broke down and turned to frank appealingly saying huskily i cant i cant it is a mockery and an insult to the dead bard of avon its no use i give it up i need the money but i cannot insult the memory of william shakespeare by making a burlesque of his immortal works then he staggered off the stage chapter x at the foot of the bed late that evening after the work and rehearsing of the day was over frank bart and ephraim gathered in the room of the firstmentioned and discussed matters i told you burns was no good said hodge triumphantly i knew how it would be but he showed up sooner than i expected i suppose you will get rid of him in a hurry now i think not answered merry quietly what cried hodge astounded you dont mean to say you will keep him after what has happened i may well frank im beginning to believe the theatrical business has turned your head you do not seem to possess the good sense you had once is that so laughed merry just so snapped hodge oh i dont know i rather think burns will turn out all right after making such a fizzle today well youre daffy you do not seem to understand the man at all i can appreciate his feelings i cant i thought not it must be rather hard for him who has always considered himself a tragedian and a shakespeare scholar to burlesque the parts he has studied and loved bah thats nonsense why the mans a pitiful old drunkard you give him credit for too fine feelings and you do not seem to give him credit for any feelings even a drunkard may have fine feelings at times perhaps so perhaps so i know it it is drink that degrades and lowers the man when he is sober he may be kind gentle and lovable well i havent much patience with a man who will keep himself filled with whisky frank opened his lips to say something but quickly changed his mind knowing he must cut hodge deeply he longed however to say that the ones most prone to err and fall in this life are often the harshest judges of others who go astray i ruther pity the pore critter said ephraim but i dont blieve hell ever make ennyboddy larf in the world he looks too much like a funeral that is the very thing that should make them laugh when he has his makeup on i have seen the burlesque tragedian overdone on the stage so that he was nauseating but i believe burns can give the character just the right touch well if you firmly believe that its no use to talk to you for youll never change your mind till you have to broke out hodge i have seen a sample of that in the way you deal with your enemies now there was leslie lawrence let him rest in peace said frank he is gone forever an its a dinged good riddance said gallup the only thing im sorry fer is that the critter escaped lynchin yes he should have been lynched flashed bart at the twin star ranch now the poor girl he deserted is lying on a bed of pain shot down by his dastardly hand he did not intend the bullet for her said frank quickly no but he intended it for you it was a great case of luck that he didnt finish you if you had pushed the villain to the wall before that instead of dealing with him as if he had the least instinct of a gentleman in his worthless body you would have saved the girl from so much suffering she loves him still said frank her last words to me were a message to him for she does not know he is dead beneath the quicksands of big sandy the quicksands saved him from the gallows an they took another ungrateful rascal along with him bgee said ephraim with satisfaction yes nodded frank i think there is no doubt but lloyd fowler perished with lawrence for i fancied i recognized fowler in the fellow who accompanied lawrence that fatal night and fowler was a drinking man so i should think he would be a warning to you said hodge i shouldnt think youd care to take another sot into the company you must know that there is as little resemblance between fowler and burns as there is between night and day perhaps so but burns can drink more whisky than fowler ever could and he is ashamed of himself for it i have talked with him about it and i know oh he made you believe so he is slick he was not trying to deceive me so you think he knows where his money comes from to buy whisky its more than even chance that when you are ready to start on the road he will give you the slip he asked me to release him today and you refused i did i urged him to stay with us hodge got up that settles it he exclaimed now i know theatricals have wrought your downfall your glory is fast departing then let it depart laughed frank you have been forced to confess yourself mistaken on other occasions you may on this goodnight said hodge and he went out ephraim grinned some fellows would say itd be a goldanged sensible thing fer yeou to git rid of that feller he said nodding toward the door hes gittin to be the greatest croaker i ever knew hodge is getting worse admitted frank gravely i think the unfortunate end of his college course has had much to do with it he broods over that a great deal and it is making him sour and unpleasant i can imagine about how he feels if he ever larfed hed be more agreeable danged if i like a feller that alwus looks so sollum an ugly sometimes he looks as ef he could snap a spike off at one bite an not harf try wait said frank if i am successful with this play i hope to go back to yale in the fall and take hodge with me i think he is getting an idea into his head that his life career has been ruined at the very start and that is making him bitter ill take him back run him into athletics get his mind off such unpleasant thoughts and make a new man of him waal i hope ye do said gallup rising and preparing to go theres jest one thing abaout hodge that makes me keer a rap fer him whats that its ther way he sticks to yeou be gosh i believe hed wade through a redhot furnace to reach yeou an fight for yeou if yeou was in danger i havent a doubt but hed make the attempt nodded frank an he kin fight the vermonter went on aout at ace high when we was up against all them ruffians he fought like a dozen tigers all rolled inter one thats ernnther thing that makes me think a little somethin of him yes agreed merry bart is a good fighter the only trouble with him is that he is too ready to fight there are times when one should avoid a fight if possible but hodge never recognizes any of those times i never knew him to try to avoid a fight waal drawled ephraim with a yawn im goin to bed goodnight frank goodnight merry closed the door after gallup and carefully locked and bolted it then he sat down took a letter from his pocket and read it through from beginning to end when he had finished he pressed the missive to his lips murmuring elsie elsie dear little sweetheart for some time he sat there thinking thinking his face flushed and paled softened and glowed again sometimes he looked sad and sometimes he smiled had a friend been there he might have read franks thoughts by the changing expressions on his face at last merry put away the letter after kissing it again and having wound up his watch undressed and prepared for bed his bed stood in a little alcove of the room and he drew the curtains back exposing it donning pajamas he soon was in bed reaching out he pressed a button and snap out went the gas turned off by electricity frank composed himself to sleep the dull rumble of the not yet sleeping city came up from the streets and floated in at his open window the sound turned after a time to a musical note that was like that which comes from an organ and it lulled him to sleep for some time merry seemed to sleep as peacefully as a child gradually the roaring from the streets became less and less frank breathed softly and regularly and then without starting or stirring he opened his eyes he lay quite still and listened but heard no sound at first for all of this he was impressed by a feeling that something was there in that room with him it was a strange creepy chilling sensation that ran over frank he shivered the least bit rustlerustle it was the lightest of sounds but he was sure he heard it some object was moving in the room frank remembered that he had closed and locked the door not only had he locked it but he had bolted it so that it could not be opened from the outside by the aid of a key alone what was there in that room how had anything gained admittance frank attempted to convince himself that it was imagination but he was a youth with steady nerves and he knew he was not given to imagining such things without cause rustle rustle there it was again there was no doubt of it this time something moved near the foot of the bed still without stirring merriwell turned his gaze in that direction at the foot of the bed a dark shape seemed to tower impressed by a sense of extreme peril frank shot his hand out of the bed toward the electric button on the wall by chance he struck the right button snap up flared the gas and there at the foot of the bed stood a man in black his face hidden by a mask the sudden upflaring of the gas seemed to startle the unknown intruder and disconcert him for a moment with a hiss he started backward bolt upright sat frank merrys eyes looked straight into the eyes that peered through the twin holes in the mask thus they gazed at each other some seconds there was no weapon in the hands of the masked man and merriwell guessed that the fellow was a burglar that was franks first thought then came another why had the man sought the bed franks clothes were lying on some chairs outside the alcove and in order to go through them it had not been necessary to come near the bed then merry remembered the feeling of danger that had come over him and something told him this man had entered that room to do him harm somehow frank became convinced that the fellow had been creeping up to seize a pillow fling himself on the bed press the pillow over the sleepers face and commit a fearful crime even then frank wondered how the man could have gained admittance to the room up leaped the former yale athlete backward sprang the masked man over the foot of the bed merry recklessly flung himself dodging a hand that shot out at him and placing himself between the man and the door as he bounded toward the door merriwell saw with a feeling of unutterable amazement that it was tightly closed and that the bolt was shot in place just as he had left it he whirled about with his back toward the door goodevening he said isnt this rather late for a call i wasnt expecting you the man was crouching before him as if to spring toward him but franks cool words seemed to cause further hesitation a muttering growl came from behind the mask but no words did the unknown speak it is possible you dropped into the wrong room said merry i trust you will be able to explain yourself for you are in a rather awkward predicament besides that you have hidden your face and that does not speak well for your honest intentions without doubt the intruder was astonished by merriwells wonderful coolness although startled from slumber in such a nerveshocking manner frank now seemed perfectly selfpossessed silence you dont seem to be a very sociable sort of caller said merry with something like a faint laugh wont you take off your mask and sit down a while the youth asked the question as if he were inviting the stranger to take off his hat and make himself at home the mans hand slipped into his bosom frank fancied it sought a weapon now it happened that merry had no weapon at hand and he felt that he would be in a very unpleasant position if that other were to get the drop on him frank made a rush at the stranger the man tried to draw something from his bosom but it seemed to catch and hang there and merry was on him the unknown tried to dodge and he partly succeeded in avoiding franks arms however he did not get fully away and a second later they grappled the man however had the advantage for all that frank had rushed upon him he had risen partly behind merry after dodging he clutched frank about the waist and attempted to hurl him to the floor with crushing force frank merriwell was an expert wrestler and although taken thus at a disadvantage he squirmed about and broke his fall simply being forced to one knee now i have ye panted the man hoarsely have you came from franks lips oh i dont know there was a sudden upward heaving and the exyale athlete shot up to his feet but the man was on his back and a hand came round and fastened on merrys throat with a terrible crushing grip frank realized that he was dealing with a desperate wretch who would not hesitate at anything and merriwells life was the stake over which they were struggling frank got hold of the mans wrist and tore those fingers from his throat although it seemed that they nearly tore out his windpipe in coming away on his back the fellow was panting hoarsely and merry found it no easy thing to dislodge him round and round they whirled frank might have shouted for aid but he realized that his door was bolted on the inside and no assistance could reach him without breaking it down besides that merrys pride held him in check there was but one intruder and he did not feel like shouting and thus seeming to confess himself outmatched and frightened they were at a corner of the alcove the partition projected sharply there and of a sudden with all his strength merry flung himself backward dashing the man on his back against that projecting corner there was a grunt a groan and a curse it seemed that for an instant the shock had hurt and dazed the man and in that instant merry wrenched himself free now this thing will be somehow more even he whispered from his crushed and aching throat he whirled to grapple with the fellow but again the slippery rascal dodged him leaping away frank followed the man caught up a chair swung it and struck at merriwells head with force enough to crush franks skull merry could not dodge but he caught the chair and saved his head although he was sent reeling backward by the blow had the fellow followed him swiftly then it is barely possible he might have overcome frank before merry could steady himself a moment of hesitation however was taken advantage of by the youth the chair was tossed aside and merry darted after the fellow who was astounded and dismayed by his persistence round to the opposite side of the table darted the intruder and across the table they stared at each other well said frank in grim confession you are making a right good fight of it and i will say that you are very slippery i havent been able to get a hold of you yet though youll come down on the run when i do the man was standing directly beneath the gas jet which merry had lighted by pressing the electric button of a sudden he reached up and turned off the gas plunging the room in darkness then as frank sprang toward the jet something swooped down on him covering his head and shoulders in a smothering manner chapter xi a mystery to solve frank realized that some of the clothing from the bed had been torn off and flung over his head he attempted to cast it aside but it became tangled so he could not accomplish his purpose as readily as he wished although he was not long in doing so retreating he was prepared for an assault for it seemed that the masked unknown would follow up the advantage he had gained no assault came frank paused and listened and to his amazement he could hear no sound in the room still he felt that the man must be there awaiting for an opportunity to carry out the deadly purpose which had brought him into his apartment at that hour it was not pleasant to stand there in the darkness half expecting to feel a knife buried between his shoulders at any instant gradually franks eyes became accustomed to the semigloom of the room still he could see nothing that lived and moved beyond him was the window standing open as he had left it the light wind gently moving the draperies well thought merry i wonder how long the fellow will keep still hell have to make a move sometime he backed up against the door and stood there facing the window placing a hand behind him he took hold of the knob of the door which he found was still locked securely this assured him that the intruder had not escaped in that direction merry felt certain that the man was close at hand he knew he could unlock and unbolt the door and leap out quickly he could slam the door behind him and lock it thus penning the man in there then he could descend to the office and inform the clerk that he had captured a burglar somehow he did not feel like doing that that seemed too much as if he were running away he did not fancy doing anything that seemed in the least cowardly even though it might be discreet further than that however it was by no means certain that even though he locked and secured the door behind him after leaping out of the room he could hold the intruder captive in some manner the man had entered that room without disturbing the lock or bolt on the door how had he entered frank looked toward the open window but he knew it opened upon the face of the hotel four stories from the level of the street and that settled in his mind all doubts about the window for he instantly decided that it had not been possible for the masked unknown to get into the room that way had he been in some old colonial house he would have fancied the fellow had gained admittance by means of a panel in the wall and a secret passage but he was in a modern hotel and it was beyond the range of probability that there were secret passages or moving wall panels in the structure these thoughts flitted through his mind swiftly as he stood there trying to hear some sound that would tell him where the intruder was in the room all was still below in the street a cab rattled and rumbled along the silence was even more nerveracking than the unexpected appearance of the masked man had been the mystery of the whole affair was beginning to impress merry and a mystery always aroused his curiosity to the highest pitch take your time sir he thought as he leaned against the door and waited i believe i can stand it as long as you can near at hand the door of another room swiftly opened and closed the sound of hurried footsteps passed the door of merriwells room frank was tempted to fling open his door and call to the man but he hesitated about that till it was too late let him go he thought perhaps he would have been frightened to death had i called him in here the push button by which he could call assistance from the office was in the alcove at this time of night it was not likely there would be anything but a tardy answer to his call should he make it but the electric button which turned on and ignited the gas was also in the alcove frank longed to reach that button he longed to light the gas in order to look around for the intruder of course he could have lighted it with a match but he realized that such a thing might be just what the unknown hoped for and expected the man might be waiting for him to strike a match the minutes fled something must be done merry at last decided then he resolved to leave the door move slowly along the wall reach the button and light the gas if possible with the silence of a creeping cat he inched along every sense was on the alert it took him a long time to come to the foot of the bed at the opening of the alcove but he reached it at last was the masked man waiting for him in the darkness of the alcove it seemed certain that he could be nowhere else in the room frank hesitated nerving himself for what might come surely it required courage to enter that alcove he listened wondering if he could hear the breathing of the man crouching in the alcove he heard nothing then every nerve and muscle seemed to grow taut in merriwells body and with one pantherlike spring he landed on the bed in the twinkling of an eye he was at the head of the bed and his fingers found the push button snap the gas came on with a flare it showed him standing straight up on the bed his hands clinched ready for anything that might follow nothing followed frank began to feel puzzled why in the name of everything peculiar doesnt he get into gear and do something if hes going to do anything at all thought the youth on the bed again a bound carried him over the footboard and out into the middle of the room where he whirled to face the alcove his eyes flashing round the place the bed covering which had been flung over his head lay in the middle of the floor where he had cast it aside nothing stirred in the room on a chair near at hand frank could hear his watch ticking in his pocket then the intruder had not taken the watch which was valuable frank glanced toward his clothes he had carefully placed them in a certain position when he undressed and there they lay as if they had not been touched or disturbed in the least queer burglar meditated merry should have thought hed gone through my clothes first thing but where was the fellow there seemed but one place for him and frank stopped to look beneath the bed there was no one under the bed the wardrobe door stood slightly ajar ah thought frank at last he must be in there for there is no other place in this room where he could hide without hesitation frank flung open the door of the wardrobe saying come out sir but the wardrobe was empty save of such clothing and things as frank had placed there with his own hands merriwell fell back beginning to feel very queer he looked all around the room walking over to a sofa across a corner and looking behind that in the middle of the floor he stopped this beats anything i ever came against he exclaimed was it a spook then the pain in his throat where those iron hands had threatened to crush his windpipe told him that it was no spook and it could not have been a dream he decided i know there was a living man in this room how did he escape that is one question when it is answered i shall know how he obtained admittance and why did he come here frank examined his clothes to make sure that nothing had been taken he soon discovered that his watch money and such valuables as he carried about with him every day were there not a thing having been disturbed that settled one point in franks mind the man had not entered that room for the purpose of robbery if not for robbery what then it must have been for the purpose of wreaking some injury on merriwell as he slept i was warned by my feelings frank decided i was in deadly peril there is no doubt of that frank went to the window and looked out it seemed a foolish thing to do for he had looked out and seen that there was not even a fire escape to aid a person in gaining admittance to his room the fire escape he had been told was at the end of the corridor it was a night without a moon but the electric lights shone in the street below something caused merry to turn his head and look to his left what was that close against the face of the outer wall something dangled a sudden eagerness seized him he leaned far out of the window doing so at no small risk and reached along the wall toward the object with the tip of his fingers he grasped it and drew it toward him it was a rope the mystery is solved muttered frank with satisfaction this explains how the fellow entered my room he shook the rope and looked upward he could see that it ran over the sill of a window two stories above did he come down from there should have thought he would have selected a window directly over this and did he climb back up this swaying loosely dangling rope frank wondered not a little and then as he was leaning out of his window the light of the street lamps showed him that a window beyond the dangling rope on a level with his was standing open the sight gave merry a new idea i believe i understand how the trick was worked he muttered that must explain how the fellow was able to vanish so swiftly while my head was covered by the bedclothes with the aid of this rope he swung out from his window and into mine he could do it easily and noiselessly while my head was covered he plunged out of the window caught the rope and swung back thats it frank drew his head in quickly but he still clung to the end of the rope this he drew in and lay over the sill yes he decided that is the way the fellow escaped he had the rope right here so that he could catch it in a moment and grasping it he plunged outward through the window his momentum carried him right across and into the other window it was a reckless thing to do but perfectly practical then he remembered how he had heard while standing with his back against his own door the door of an adjoining room open and close followed by the sound of swift footsteps passing outside that was when he left his room merry decided it did not take frank long to resolve to explore that room to seek for some clew to the identity of the masked intruder with the aid of the rope he could swing into the open window with its aid he could swing back to his own room he would do it of course merry realized what a rash thing he was about to do of course he understood that he might be rushing to the waiting arms of his late antagonist still he was not deterred all his curiosity was aroused and he was bent on discovering the identity of the man if such a thing were possible he grasped the rope and climbed upon the window sill looking out he carefully calculated the distance to the next window and the momentum he would require to take him there having decided this he prepared to make the swing and then just at the very instant that he swung off from the window sill he heard a hoarse triumphant laugh above he looked up out of the window from which ran the rope a man was leaning in his hand was something on which the light from the street lamps glinted it was a knife with that knife the wretch whose face was covered by a mask gave a slash at the rope just as merry swung off from the sill with a twang the rope parted it was sixty feet to the street below frank fell chapter xii the name on the register not far however for he released the rope and shot out his arms he had swung across so that he was opposite the open window when the rope was cut merriwell knew all his peril at the instant when he swung from the sill of his own window but it was too late for him to keep himself from being carried out by the rope in a twinkling his one thought was to reach the other window quickly knowing he would be dashed to death on the paving below if he did not he flung himself toward that window just as the rope parted his arms shot in over the sill and there he dangled down past his head shot the rope twisting and writhing in the air like a snake he heard it strike on the sidewalk in front of the hotel an exclamation of rage broke from the lips of the man in the window above for he realized that frank had not fallen with the rope he leaned far out lifted his arm made a quick motion and something went gleaming and darting through the air he had flung the knife at frank it missed merriwell shot downward and struck with a ringing clang on the stones below missed snarled the man well ill get you yet then merriwell drew himself in at the window and the peril was past no wonder he felt weak and limp no wonder that he was jarred and somewhat bewildered it was a marvel that he was not lying dead in the street below frank understood the full extent of the peril through which he had passed and a prayer welled from his lips thank god he was grateful in his heart and he felt that he had been spared through the kindness of an allwise providence it was some moments before he could stir he lay on the floor panting and regaining his strength he heard no sound in the room for all the noise he had made in coming in and more than ever he became convinced that the room had been occupied by his desperate enemy who had sought to destroy him that night there was now no longer a doubt concerning the purpose of the man who had gained admission to franks room the fellow had not come there for plunder but for the purpose of harming merriwell frank rose and sought the gas jet which he lighted then he looked around somehow it seemed that the room had been occupied that night although the bed was undisturbed showing that no person had slept in it frank fancied that his enemy had sat by the window waiting waiting till he felt sure merry was sound asleep and frank had been sleeping soundly he realized that and he knew something had caused him to awaken just in time what was it was it some good spirit that hovered near to protect him he looked all round the room but could find nothing that served as a clew to the identity of the man who had occupied the apartment but the register would tell to whom the room had been let having decided to go down and look the register over frank wondered how he was to get back into his own room for the door was locked and bolted on the inside he went to the window and looked out there was no way for him to reach his window now that the rope had been cut and i should not be surprised if i am locked in this room thought merry investigation showed however that the door was unlocked and he was able to step out into the corridor but there he was shut out from his own room by lock and bolt and dressed in nothing but a suit of pajamas the adventure had assumed a ludicrous aspect frank wondered what he could do it was certain that they would not break into his room at that hour of the night for the sound of bursting the bolt would disturb other sleepers the watchman came down the corridor he saw frank and came onward with haste plainly wondering what merry was doing there look here said frank i want to know the name of the man who occupies no this room next to mine what is the matter asked the watchman this person has disturbed me said frank truthfully i am not going to raise a kick about it tonight but i shall report it to the clerk in the morning does he snore loudly inquired the watchman i didnt think you could hear through those partitions here said frank who had seen the watchman before you know me my name is merriwell i havent a cent in these pajamas but ill give you two dollars in the morning if you will go down to the office look on the register find out who occupies no and come back here and tell me now it happened that frank had given the watchman fifty cents the night before to do something for him and so the man was persuaded to go down to the office although it is quite probable that he did not expect to see the promised two dollars in the morning frank waited the watchman came back after a time well asked merry did you look on the register and find out the name of the man who was given no i did nodded the watchman what is his name william shakespeare burns was the astonishing answer frank staggered he told the watchman he had made a mistake but the man insisted that he had not that was enough to excite merry more than anything that had happened to date could it be that burns the old actor whom he had befriended had sought his life it did not seem possible if it were true then beyond a doubt the man had been bribed to do the deed by some person who remained in the background it did not take frank long to tell the watchman what had happened the man could scarcely believe it he seemed to regard merriwell as somewhat deranged if you do not think i am telling the truth said merry get your keys and try my door if you are able to open it i shall be greatly pleased the watchman did so but he could not open the door of the room now said merry to make yourself doubly sure go down to the sidewalk in front of the hotel and you will find the rope there the man went down and found the rope he came back greatly agitated this is a most astonishing occurrence he said never knew anything like it to happen here before keep your eyes open for the man who had no said merry i am going to take that room and sleep there the rest of the night in the morning the door of my room must be opened for me he went into that room closed the door locked it and bolted it closed and fastened the window and went to bed of course he did not go to sleep right away but he forced himself to do so after a time and he slept peacefully till morning in the morning frank found the door of his room had been forced so he was able to go in immediately on rising he had been unable to obtain a room with a private bath connected but there was a bathroom directly across the corridor and he took his morning dip coming out as bright as a new dollar but the mystery of the midnight intruder weighed heavily on merry he felt that he would give anything to solve it and it must be solved in some manner bart came around before breakfast and he found merriwell standing in the middle of his room scowling at the carpet frank was so unlike his accustomed self that hodge was astounded whats happened asked bart one of the most singular adventures of my life answered frank and he proceeded to tell bart everything singular cried hodge i should say so you are dead in luck to be alive i consider myself so confessed merry but i would give any sum to know who entered my room last night of course the name on the register was false are you certain certain great scott you do not fancy for an instant that burns was the man do you i dont know well i do you mean you think you do no i mean that i know burns was not the man how do you know why hang it hodge why should that unfortunate old fellow wish to harm me who has been his friend somebody may have hired him to do it oh youre daffy on that point reason will teach you that if it had been burns he would not have registered under his own name but i absolutely know it was not burns i encountered besides being ridiculous that a man of his years and habits should venture to enter my room in such a manner the man whom i encountered was supple strong and quick as a flash burns could not have fought like that he could not have escaped in such an astonishing manner oh well perhaps not admitted hodge who seemed reluctant to give up but i have warned you against burns all along and oh drop him now somebody else is trying to injure the poor fellow i want to know who did the job last night and w s burns will not be able to tell me anything bart had no more to say and they went down to breakfast together of course the hotel people promised to do everything possible to discover who had made the assault but frank had little confidence in their ability to accomplish anything in fact he believed the time had passed to do anything for it seemed that his enemy had escaped from the hotel without leaving a trace behind him frank thought over the list of enemies who had sought to injure him since he entered theatricals and he was startled three of his enemies were dead arthur sargent had been drowned percy lockwell was lynched and leslie lawrence met his death in the quicksands of big sandy river of his living enemies who might be desperate enough to enter his room and seek to harm him philip scudder stood alone where was scudder was he in denver if so if so he is the man decided frank merry resolved to be on his guard for something told him another attempt would be made against him chapter xiii the race all that forenoon he worked in the theater setting up the new mechanical arrangement which had been completed and preparing for the rehearsal that afternoon rehearsal time came and the members of the company assembled all but burns he was missing what do you think about it now asked bart grimly the same as i thought before declared frank burns was almost brokenhearted at rehearsal yesterday it is possible he may not come today for you know he wished to be released ah said a sad voice as the person in question appeared it is necessity that brings me i fain would have remained away but i need the money and i must do that which my heart revolts against i believed you would come said frank greeting the old tragedian you will get used to the part after a while it is better to make people laugh than to make them weep but it is too late for me to turn myself into a clown where did you stay last night asked merry at my humble lodgings was the answer a man by your name registered at the hotel where i stop and had the room next to mine is it possible there are two william shakespeare burns in the city of denver the old man drew himself up thrusting his hand into the bosom of his coat with his familiar movement of dignity there is but one he said but one real william shakespeare burns in the whole world i am he but you were not at the hotel last night of a certainty i was not to that i will pledge mine honor if another was there under my name he is an impostor frank was satisfied but bart was not or if hodge was satisfied he would not confess it the rehearsal began frank had engaged some people to work the mechanical arrangement used in the third act and they had been drilled and instructed by havener the first act went off well the storm at the conclusion being worked up in firstclass style scarcely a word of that act had frank altered so there was very little trouble over it the second act was likewise a success havener finding it necessary to interrupt and give instructions but twice then came the third act which merry had almost entirely rewritten in that act the burlesque tragedian was given an opportunity and burns showed that he had his lines very well although he ran over them after the style of the oldtime professional who disdains to do much more than repeat the words till the dress rehearsal comes the third act was divided into three scenes the second scene being an exterior showing the river in the distance lined by a moving swaying mass of people along the river raced the three boats representing yale harvard and cornell keeping pace with them on the shore was the observation train black with a mass of spectators as the boats first came on harvard had a slight lead but yale spurted on appearing and when they passed from view yale was leading slightly all this was a mechanical arrangement made to represent boats a train the river and the great crowd of spectators the rowers in the boats were inanimate objects but they worked with such skill that it was hard to believe they were not living and breathing human beings even the different strokes of the three crews had been imitated this arrangement was an invention of merriwells own in fact it was more of an optical illusion than anything else but it was most remarkable in its results for from the front of the house a perfect representation of the college boat race appeared to be taking place in the distance on the stage havener was a man who said very little but he showed excitement and enthusiasm as this scene was being worked out when the boats had disappeared the stage grew dark and there was a quick shift to the interior of the yale boathouse the entire front of the house toward the river had been flung wide open behind the scenes the actors who were not on the stage at the moment and the supers hurrahed much like the cheering of a vast multitude whistles shrieked and then the three boats shot into view with yale still in the lead the characters on the stage proper in the boathouse had made it known that the finish was directly opposite the boathouse and so when the boats flew across with yale in advance it was settled that the blue had won then frank merriwell who had escaped from scheming enemies and rowed in the race for all the attempts to drug him was brought on by his admirers and with the yale cheer of victory the curtain came down roscoe havener came rushing onto the stage and caught frank merriwell by the hand crying merriwell you are a genius i want to say right here that i have doubted the practicability of this invention of yours but now i confess that it is the greatest thing i ever saw your sawmill invention in john smith was great but this lays way over it you should make your fortune with this but you must protect it i shall apply for a patent on the mechanism said frank i am having a working model made for that purpose thats right you have your chance to make a fortune and i believe you can make it with this piece it is a chance agreed frank gravely but i shall take it for better or worse i am going into this thing to make or break ive got some money and ill sink every dollar im worth in the attempt to float this piece frank spoke with quiet determination hodge stood near and nodded his approval and satisfaction its great merry he said in approval its something new too you will not have any trouble over this the way you did about the sawmill scene i hope not cassie lee the little soubrette who was engaged to havener found an opportunity to get hold of franks hand she gave it a warm pressure im so glad she whispered looking into his eyes if ross says it will go you can bet it will he knows his business ive been waiting for him to express himself about it and now that he has i feel better you are right in it frank i think you are a dandy thank you cassie smiled frank looking down at her and even though he liked cassie who had always been his friend he was thinking at that moment of another little girl who was far away but whom he had once hoped would create the part in true blue that had been given to cassie in the fourth act frank had skillfully handled the fall of the play keeping all in suspense as he worked out the problem one of the chief arts of successful play constructing too often a play falls to pieces at once after the grand climax is reached and the final act is obviously tacked on to lengthen it out this one fault frank had worked hard to avoid and he had succeeded with masterly skill even introducing a new element of suspense into the final act merry had noticed that in these modern days the audience sniffs the andlivedhappyforeverafter conclusion of a play from afar and there was always a rustling to get hats and coats and cloaks some moments before the end of most plays to avoid this he determined to end his play suddenly and in an original manner this he succeeded in doing in a comedy scene but not until the last speech was delivered was the suspense entirely relieved havener who could not write a play to save his life but who understood thoroughly the construction of a piece and was a discriminating critic was nearly as well pleased by the end of the piece as by the mechanical effect in the third act if this play does not make a big hit i shall call myself a chump he declared i was afraid of it in its original form but the changes have added to it the elements it needed to become immensely popular when the rehearsal was over cassie lee found burns seated on a property stump behind the scenes his face bowed on his hands his attitude that of one in deep sorrow now whats the matter with you she asked not unkindly are you sick the old tragedian raised his sad face and spoke join not with grief fair woman do not so to make my end too sudden learn good soul to think our former state a happy dream from which awaked the truth of what we are shews to us but this i am sworn brother sweet to grim necessity and he and i will keep a league till death there was something strangely impressive in the old mans words and manner and the laugh she tried to force died on cassies lips i spose thats shakespeare you are giving me she said i dont go much on shake he was all right in his day but his day is past and he wont go down with people in general now the public wants something up to date like this new play of merriwells for instance ah yes sighed burns i think you speak the truth in these degenerate days the vulgar rabble must be fed with what it can understand the rabbles meager intellects do not fathom the depths of the immortal poets thoughts but its eyes can behold a mechanical arrangement that represents a boat race and i doubt not that the groundlings will whoop themselves hoarse over it thats the stuff nodded cassie thats what we want for i rather reckon mr merriwell is out for the dust the dust ah sordid mortals all the world today seems out for the dust well i rather think thats right what do you want anyway if you have plenty to eat and drink and wear youre in luck what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed a beast no more thats all right but just think of the ones who cant get all they want to eat and who are driven to work like dogs day after day without ever getting enough sleep to rest them ah but few of them have hopes or aspirations they are worms of the earth oh i dont know i reckon some of them are as good as anybody but theyre down on their luck the world has gone against them but they have never climbed to the heights only to slip back to the depths then is when the world turns dark the old tragedian bowed his head again and feeling that she could say nothing to cheer him up cassie left him there frank came in later and had a talk with burns the old man acknowledged that he believed the play would be a success but he bemoaned his fate to be forced to play a part so repulsive to him merry assured him that he would get over that in time and succeeded in putting some spirit into the old fellow chapter xiv franks new comedian the day came for the great dress rehearsal of true blue to which the theatrical people of denver the newspaper men and a great number of prominent people had been invited frank had determined on this course at great expense but he believed he would be repaid for the outlay his chief object was to secure good newspaper notices and recommendations from the theater managers in the city it was to be an afternoon performance so that it would not interfere with any of the regular theatrical attractions to play in town that night early in the day hodge advised frank to keep a sharp watch on burns dont let him have any money merry he fancies he will have to go through a terrible ordeal this afternoon and he wishes to brace up for it if he gets all he wants to drink he will be loaded to the muzzle when the time comes to play frank feared this and so when burns appealed to him for money he refused the old man telling him he could have some after the performance then merry set gallup to watch the tragedian frank was at work in the theater where various members of the company were practicing specialties and the stage hands were arranging everything so that there would be no hitch about the performance within thirty minutes after gallup was set to watch the old actor he came to frank in a hurry saying if you want to keep mr burns sober i advise yeou to come with me an git him aout of a grog shop daown the street merry whats that exclaimed frank why he hasnt the money to buy liquor even if he has gone into a saloon he wont hev to buy it i guess why not well i saw two men pick him up an take him inter the gin mill they axed him would he come in an have somethin with them did he know them didnt seem ter he looked kainder sprised but he accepted the invite in a hurry then it is time that we looked after him nodded merry grimly show me where he has gone ephraim hodge followed them they left the theater and hurried along the street to a saloon he went in here said ephraim without a word frank entered the moment merry was within the place he saw burns standing near the bar while a crowd had gathered around him the old man had placed his hat on the bar tossed back his long black hair which was streaked with gray struck a pose and was just beginning to declaim from shakespeare go it old chap cried a halfintoxicated man well put up the red eye for you as long as you will spout the old mans voice rang out clear and strong his pronunciation was perfect and his enunciation clear and distinct involuntarily merry paused a moment to listen at that moment it came to frank that burns might beyond a doubt have been an actor of no small merit had he eschewed drink and followed his ambition with unswerving purpose for the first time merry fully appreciated the outraged feelings of the old fellow who was compelled to burlesque the tragedian on the stage frank strode forward into the crowd followed by his friends burns he said quietly interrupting the old man i want you to come with me the aged actor stopped speaking all the dignity seemed to melt from him in a moment and he reached for his hat murmuring i merely came in for one small bracer i needed it and the gentlemen were good enough to invite me here coarsely cried a man whats this mean whos this thats comin here to spoil our fun throw the feller out cried another growls of anger came from the others gathered about and they crowded nearer look out for trouble whispered hodge in franks ear get out of here ordered the first speaker confronting merry were bein entertained i beg your pardon gentlemen said merry smoothly hesitating slightly before the final word there are reasons why i come here to take mr burns with me i am sorry to spoil your entertainment but it is necessary is the old fellow bound out to you sneeringly asked one do you own him no man owns me cried the tragedian drawing himself up and staring round i am my own master ill bet you dont dare take another drink said the man quickly thrusting a brimming glass of whisky toward burns youre afraid of the young gent im afraid of nobody declared burns eagerly reaching for the glass i have drunk all i could get and i always shall for all of anybody thats the talk down with it take your medicine youre the boy the crowd shouted its approval burns lifted the glass franks hand fell gently on his arm mr burns he said swiftly i ask you as a particular favor not to drink that liquor i ask you as a gentleman not to do it merry knew how to appeal to the old man in a manner that would touch the right spot burns looked straight into franks eyes an instant and then he placed the glass on the bar if you ask me that way he said ten thousand fiends cannot force me to touch the stuff there was a groan from the crowd the old duffer caves sneered one man he hasnt any backbone oh say sibilated hodge in merrys ear get him out of here in a hurry i cant stand much of this i feel like thumping a few of these ruffians steady cautioned frank we do not want to get into a barroom brawl if we can avoid it theyre a purty darn toughlookin craowd muttered ephraim why wouldnt it be a purty good thing fer ther young chaps all ter take a drink suggested somebody thats right cried the leader ill stand for them all and the actor shall drink with them dont let them git out gents till theyve taken their bitters the rough men hemmed them in i fear you are in an unfortunate predicament said burns you will have to drink with them i never drink said merry quietly yer cant refuse here declared the man who had offered to buy the drinks its a mortal insult ter refuse ter drink hyar i never took a drink in my life gentlemen said merriwell speaking calmly and distinctly and i shall not begin now you will have to excuse me he started to force his way through the crowd a hand reached out to clutch him and he wheeled like a flash toward the man at whom he pointed squarely crying take off that false beard if you are a man show your face you are in disguise i believe you are a criminal who does not dare show his face his ringing words drew the attention of the crowd to the man whom he accused merry improved the opportunity and hurried his friends and burns toward the door before the gang was aware of it they were out of the saloon and frank breathed his relief not till they had reached the theater did a thought come to frank that made him regret his hasty departure from the saloon heavens he exclaimed i believe the man who wore the false beard was the same one who entered my room at the hotel by means of the rope he dashed back to the saloon followed by hodge and gallup but when he reached the place nearly all the crowd had left the man he sought having departed with the others frank was disappointed he learned at the saloon that the accused man had not removed the beard but had sneaked out in a hurry after frank was gone returning to the theater merry was informed that burns was behaving strangely he seems to be doped declared hodge i think he has been drugged burns was in a dressing room and havener was working to keep the man awake although the old actor was begging to be allowed to sleep as soon as frank saw him he dispatched one of the supers for a physician the doctor came and gave burns a powerful emetic following that with a dose of medicine that seemed to brace the man up thus burns was pulled into shape for the afternoon performance although frank realized that he had very nearly wrecked everything burns remained in the theater and lunch was brought him there mr merriwell he said i will surprise you by the manner in which ill play my part this afternoon it shall be burlesque of a kind thatll satisfy you the performance was to begin at two oclock some time before that people began to arrive and they came fast at two oclock there were nearly five hundred persons in the auditorium the company was all made up and waiting behind the scenes cassie lee started to find frank to ask him how he liked her makeup in a corner behind the scenes she saw a man stopping near a mass of piledup scenery something about the mans appearance and his actions attracted her attention she saw him pick up a can and pour some of the contents on the scenery then he crouched down there taking a match safe from his pocket in a moment it dawned on cassie that the fellow was up to deviltry he had saturated the scenery with oil and he was about to set it on fire cassie screamed and frank merriwell who was near at hand heard her he came bounding to the spot just as the startled man lighted his match quick frank cried cassie hes setting the scenery afire frank saw the fellow and leaped at him the scenery flared up where the match had touched it then the fire bug turned to run merriwell was on him had him hurled him down no you dont you dog grated frank you shall pay for this dastardly trick cassie with rare presence of mind caught up a rug which happened to be near and beat out the fire before it had gained much headway a terrible struggle was going on between frank and the man he had captured the fellow was fighting with all his strength to hurry off and escape no you dont came through merriwells teeth i know you you are the chap who entered my room you it was who attempted to drug burns so that this performance would be ruined and now you have made a fatal mistake by attempting to fire the theater i have you and i shall hold you you will be safely lodged behind prison bars for this trick curse you panted the man that does not hurt me said merry now be quiet he pinned the fellow to the floor and held him till others came up then the mans hands were tied now well have a look at him said merry rolling the captive over on his back and pulling the old hat from his head then he gave a cry of amazement staggering back hodge was there and he was no less astounded gallup was speechless with astonishment and incredulity the dead alive cried frank the man he had captured was the one he believed beneath the quicksands of big sandy river leslie lawrence im not dead yet grated lawrence fowler went down in the quicksands but i managed to float away i hid under the rivers bank and there i stayed like a hunted wolf till you gave up looking for me i swore to settle the score with you but you tried hard enough you were the one who entered my room at the hotel was i prove it i dont have to the job you tried to do here is enough that will put you safely away somebody call an officer an officer was called and lawrence was taken away the audience in front had heard some of the commotion behind the scenes and had grown rather restless but they were soon calmed an orchestra was on hand to play and everything was carried out as if it had been a regular performance the first act went off well and it received mild applause the second act seemed to take full better but still the audience had not been aroused to any great show of enthusiasm then came the third act the first surprise was burns he literally convulsed the audience by the manner in which he burlesqued the shakespearian tragedian he astonished frank for merry had not dreamed the old actor could be so intensely funny even hodge was seen to smile once when burns came off after doing an exceptionally clever piece of work which caused the audience to applaud most heartily frank met him and grasped his hand saying my dear mr burns you have made the comedy hit of the piece your salary shall be fifty dollars a week instead of forty but william shakespeare burns burst into tears sobbing brokenly the comedy hit of the piece and i have broken my own heart it was impossible to cheer him up the boat race followed swiftly and it wrought the audience up to a high pitch of enthusiasm and excitement when the curtain came down there was a perfect shout of applause such as an enthusiastic western audience alone can give frank merriwell frank merriwell was the cry that went up from all parts of the house frank was obliged to come before the curtain and make a speech which he did gracefully and modestly when he was behind the curtain again havener had him by the hand saying you will get some rousing press notices tomorrow merriwell this play will be the hit of your life a manager of one of the local theaters came behind the scenes and offered frank three thousand dollars for the piece when frank declined the man promptly made it five thousand but even that sum was not accepted then came the fourth act in which burns again appeared as the burlesque tragedian in this he was to repeat a parody on hamlets soliloquy but apparently before he was aware of it he began to give the soliloquy itself in a moment the man had flung off the air of the clown he straightened to his full height his eyes gleamed with a strange fire his chest heaved and his voice sounded clear as the ring of steel he electrified every person who heard him with all the dramatic fire of a booth he swung into the soliloquy and a hush fell over the audience he held them spellbound he swayed them at his will he thrilled them as never had they been thrilled at that moment william shakespeare burns was the tragedian sublime and it is probable that he reached such heights as he had never before attained he finished it was over and then realizing what he had done he tottered off the stage then the audience applauded long and loud trying to call him back again but behind the scenes he had fallen into frank merriwells arms faintly murmuring it is finished frank bore the man to a dressing room the play went on to the end without a break but it was not necessary for burns to enter again when the curtain fell on the final act havener came hurrying to merry burns wants to see you in the dressing room he said you had better come at once frank went there the moment he saw the old actor who was reclining on some rugs his face ashen his eyes looking dim and sunken still deeper into his head frank said somebody go for a doctor at once he knelt beside the man and the old actor murmured it is useless to go for a doctor i heard you tell them but it is no use i told you my heart was broken i spoke the truth it broke my heart when i had to burlesque his words died out in his throat hes going somebody whispered for the company was gathered around there was a brief silence and then the old man seemed to draw himself up with pride as they had seen him do in life yes sir he said distinctly my name is burns william shakespeare burns tragedian at liberty the old eyes closed a faint sigh escaped his bloodless lips and the old actor was at liberty chapter xv a newspaper notice yesterday afternoon through the courtesy of manager frank merriwell an invited audience of at least five hundred persons witnessed the first performance of mr merriwells revised and rewritten play at the orpheum theater and the verdict of that audience which represented the highest and most cultured element of denver society was that the sprightly sensational fouract comedy drama was a success in every way the play which is now named true blue was originally christened for old eli and after a single performance mr merriwell withdrew it for the purpose of rewriting it correcting certain faults he had discovered and strengthening one or two weak points as he wrote the piece he was able to do this work of reconstruction quickly and thoroughly and the result is a play of which he as author manager and star performer may well be proud the following is the cast dick trueheart frank merriwell barry hattleman douglas dunton spruce downing rufus small crack hyerman bartley hodge reuben grass ephraim gallup manny sizzwell william wynne prof gash roscoe havener edwin treadwell william shakespeare burns carius dubad granville garland spike dubad lester vance millie blossom miss cassie lee inez dalton miss stella stanley nancy noodle miss agnes kirk college life is the principal theme of true blue and mr merriwell having studied at yale is quite capable of catching the air and spirit of old eli and reproducing it on the stage this he has done with a deftness and fidelity that makes the play remarkable in its class or possibly with greater accuracy lifts it out of its class for up to the production of this piece all college plays have been feeble attempts to catch the spirit of the life they represent or have descended into the realm of farce or burlesque while the author of true blue has written a play to suit the popular fancy he has not considered it necessary to write down to the general public and for all of the college slang which of a necessity is used by several of the characters there is nothing offensive in the entire piece nothing to shock the sensibilties of the most refined the comedy in places is a trifle boisterous but that was to be expected and it does not descend to mere buffoonery it is the kind of comedy at which the spectator must laugh even though he may resolve that he will not and when it is all over he feels better for his laughter instead of feeling foolish as he does in many cases after witnessing other popular plays the pathos strikes the right chord and the strongest situations and climaxes are stirring enough to thrill the most sluggish blood in some respects the story of the play is rather conventional but it is handled in a manner that makes it seem almost new through the four acts dick trueheart the hero is pursued by his enemies carius dubad and his worthy son spike and on various occasions they succeed in making things extremely unpleasant for the popular young athlete through two acts the villains pursue the hero keeping the audience on the qui vive the climax of the third act was the great sensational feature of the play in this act dick escapes from his enemies and all sorts of crafty snares and is barely in time to take his place in the yale boat which is to race against harvard and cornell carius dubad has appeared on the scene and at the last moment in order to break dicks spirit he reveals that dicks guardian has squandered his fortune so that the hero is penniless and will be forced to leave college for all of this revelation trueheart enters the boat and aids in winning the race against harvard and cornell greatly to the discomfiture of the villainous father and son who have bet heavily against yale of course mr merriwell made yale win in his play the mechanism that showed the boat race on the distant river the moving observation train the swaying crowds with waving flags hats and handkerchiefs was truly a most wonderful arrangement and it filled the spectators with admiration and astonishment a quick dark shift followed and then the boats actually appeared with yale the winner and trueheart was brought onto the stage in the arms of his admiring fellow collegians while the curtain descended amid a burst of genuine enthusiastic applause such as is seldom heard in any theater mr merriwell was called before the curtain and he made a brief speech which seemed modest and characteristic of this young actor and playwright who is certain to follow a brilliant career on the american stage in the final act the hero was in straitened circumstances but all ends well with the discomfiture of old dubad and his worthy son and the final settlement of all jealousies between the other characters not only as author of the play but as the star does frank merriwell merit a full meed of credit and praise although he is young and impulsive and his acting might not meet the approval of certain critics there was a breeziness and freshness about him that captivated and carried the audience it is said that he has never attended a school of acting and this may readily be believed for there is nothing affected nothing stiff nothing stilted and mechanical about his work on the stage in his case at least it has been greatly to his advantage not to attend a dramatic school he is a born actor and he must work out his own methods without being hampered by convention and instruction from those who believe in doing everything by rule he is a handsome young man and his stage presence is both striking and effective worthy of note was it that he enunciated every word distinctly and pronounced it correctly in great contrast to many other stars who sometimes mangle speech in a most distressing manner he has a voice that seems in perfect keeping with his splendid figure being clear as a mellow bell full of force and delightful to hear the work of douglas dunton as barry hattleman was good mr small who is a very large man faithfully portrayed spruce downing the lazy student crack hyerman the hotblooded southerner as represented by bartley hodge who made the southerner a thorough fireeater who would fight for his honor at the drop of the hat as reuben grass ephraim gallup literally convulsed the audience without doubt his delineation of the downeast yankee was the best ever seen in denver miss cassie lee played the sweet and winsome millie blossom and her singing and dancing met approval the inez dalton of miss stanley was handled with great skill and she was jealous passionate resentful and loving in turn and in a manner that seemed true to life as nancy noodle an old maid in love with prof gash miss agnes kirk was acceptable and now comes the duty of mentioning a man who was the surprise of the evening his name was given on the program as william shakespeare burns and as he represented a burlesque tragedian it was supposed that the name was assumed it has been learned however that this is the name by which he was known in real life mr burns first appeared in the second act and as edwin treadwell the frayed backnumber tragedian he literally caused many of the audience to choke in the effort to repress their uncontrollable laughter at the close of the third act a local theatrical man declared that w s burns far excelled as a comedian anybody he had ever seen essay a similar part but the sensation came in the fourth act when the actor started to parody hamlets soliloquy but seemed to forget himself and the parody together and swung into the original william shakespeare the laughter died out the audience sat spellbound scarcely breathing the eyes of every person were fixed on the actor who went through the soliloquy to the end giving it with all the power of a forrest or a booth as the actor retired the audience awoke realized it had seen and heard a man who was no clown but a real tragedian and the applause was long and loud william shakespeare burns did not appear again on the stage of that theater he will not appear again on any stage he is dead but few particulars have been learned about him but it seems that this was his first attempt to play comedy and his last he regarded himself as the equal of any interpreter of shakespeare living or dead but misfortune and his own weakness had never permitted him to rise to the heights to which he aspired grim necessity had compelled him to accept mr merriwells offer to play in true blue the part of the burlesque tragedian his heart and soul had rebelled against doing so and often at rehearsals he had wept with mortification after going through with his part his body was weakened by privation he declared last night that his heart was broken a few minutes after leaving the stage the last time he expired in one of the dressing rooms of the theater thus ended a life that might have been a grand success but for the failings of weak human nature mr merriwell will go on the road at once with true blue he has engaged a competent man to fill the place made vacant by the death of mr burns his route for some little time is booked and he leaves denver today for puelbo where he opens tomorrow the play the star and the company merit success and we hope mr merriwell will find it convenient to play a regular engagement in this city before long it is certain if he does he will be greeted by packed houses denver herald and advertiser all the denver papers contained notices of the performance but the one quoted was the longest and the most elaborate not one of the notices was unfavorable they were enough to make the heart of any manager glad and it was not strange that frank felt well satisfied but he was inexpressibly saddened by the sudden and tragic death of william burns for he had recognized the genius in the old actor who had been dragged down from a highroad to prosperity and fame by the hands of the relentless demon that has destroyed so many men of genius drink on account of his bookings frank could not remain in denver to attend the funeral of the veteran tragedian but he resolved that burns should be buried with all honors and he made arrangements for a suitable funeral of course the papers announced the funeral and the story of burns remarkable death having become familiar to all the church was packed to the doors the man whose wretched life had promised a wretched death and a nameless grave was buried without pomp but with such honors as might have been given to one well known and highly esteemed above his grave a modest marble was placed and chiseled on it was a single line from the immortal bard whom he loved and understood and interpreted with the faithfulness and fire of genius after lifes fitful fever he sleeps well and every expense frank merriwell provided for nothing was neglected everything was done that good taste and a good heart demanded chapter xvi the veiled woman as may be understood the members of franks company were individually and collectively delighted with the apparent success of the play and their efforts perhaps agnes kirk was the only one who complained she was not at all pleased by the notices she obtained frank immediately secured a supply of denver papers and marking the notices mailed them to the managers of theaters and the editors of papers along the route true blue was to follow then he had typewritten copies made of extracts from these notices which he added to his collection of press notices already manufactured for advertising purposes and sent them on to his advance agent who had been out on the road several days frank knew how to work every point to the best advantage and he did not lose anything he was tireless in his efforts and it was wonderful what an immense amount of work he accomplished no one knows how much he can do till he makes the test hodge aided him as far as possible and frank found bart a valuable assistant hodge was fully as eager as merriwell for the play to be a great success frank had opened with the piece under its original name in puelbo and it had met disaster there he vowed that he would return to that place with the play and make a success of his engagement he engaged the leading theater in the city for three nights being obliged to pay in advance for it as the manager had no confidence in the revised play frank had been working the papers of the city one of them was edited by a remarkably genial gentleman by the name of osgood and this editor had seen in the original play material for a strong piece he admired merrys pluck in opening the second time in that city and he literally opened the columns of his paper to frank who telegraphed down extracts from the denver papers as soon as the notices appeared the house in puelbo was to be well papered the first night but was to depend entirely on the drawing qualities of the play for the audience on the following two nights frank was making a great hustle to get away from denver and he was returning from the theater to his hotel after seeing the last of the special scenery moved to the railroad station when a heavily veiled woman stopped directly in his path as he was walking hastily he nearly ran against her i beg your pardon madam exclaimed frank lifting his hat very awkward of me not at all she said in a low voice that was not unpleasant nor unmusical you were hurrying and i stopped directly in your way i am the one who should beg to be excused not at all he hastened to say i assure you that it was entirely on account of my awkwardness he was about to pass on but her gloved hand fell on his arm and she said i wish to speak with you mr merriwell you know me exclaimed frank surprised indeed i do why should i not all denver knows you today am i so famous as that smiled merry i fear you flatter madam it is not flattery you must not doubt my sincerity very well i will not but you must speak hastily for i have a train to catch in an hour and thirty minutes and i havent too much time to attend to all i have to do but you must give me a little of your time you really must she said persuasively putting her hand on his arm again if you will come with me please do where oh i know a nice quiet place where we can talk somehow frank did not like her words or manner a feeling that there was something wrong about her came over him really you must excuse me he said i have not the time to go anywhere to talk if you have anything to say to me you can say it here now dont be obstinate youll not regret it if you come but i do not even know who you are that veil if you come i may remove the veil she murmured frank drew back so that her hand fell from his arm madam he said you have placed me in a very awkward position i do not like to appear rude to a lady but of course you do not and so you will grant my request it is a small matter but not to me for my time is valuable just now i am ready to hear anything you have to say but you must say it here would you keep a lady standing on the street she exclaimed with a slight show of resentment i cannot say all i have to tell you in a minute and i have explained that i cannot spare time to talk over anything for more than a few moments i think you will have to excuse me goodday he lifted his hat and started to pass on but again she placed herself squarely in front of him to his great annoyance mr merriwell she said i have seen you on the stage and i admire you greatly you will not be rude to one of your admirers i know you are far too gallant for that it was plain she sought to cajole him by flattery and that was the surest way to repulse him is it possible she is one of those foolish women who fall in love with actors frank asked himself somehow she did not seem like that there was nothing of the giddy gushing girl about her he could not see her face but her figure was that of a matured woman and he judged that she must be twentyfive years old at least it seemed too that there was a purpose in her words and movements but frank resolved on action for he had found that it was useless to waste words talking to her he made a quick move to one side and passed her intending to hasten away barely had he done so when she flung her arms about his neck and screamed loudly frank was astounded by this unexpected move of the veiled woman shes crazy that was the thought that flashed through merrys mind he realized that he was in an awkward predicament and he attempted to whirl about the woman was very strong and having taken him by surprise she nearly threw him down to save himself he caught hold of her help she cried some men came running up madam said frank hurriedly are you demented what is the meaning of this you wretch she blazed oh you cowardly scoundrel to assault a lady on the public street in broad daylight surely you are i saw him do it declared a little man with red whiskers i saw him assault you madam call an officer palpitated the woman quick before he gets away he shall not get away declared a big man with a crooked eye glowering at frank if he tries it ill attend to him looks like a wouldbe masher piped a slim man with a very long neck ducking and nodding his head in an odd manner he should be taught a lesson one or two others expressed themselves in a similar manner frank had thought of making a break and hastening away but now he saw it would not do for he would have a howling mob at his heels the instant he attempted such a move he realized it would seem cowardly to run away in such a manner and would look like a confession of guilt which caused him to decide to stay and face it out even though the predicament was most embarrassing gentlemen he said looking squarely at them and seeming to pay very little attention to the mysterious woman even though he was perfectly on his guard not knowing what move she might make next i trust you will give me a chance to explain what has happened explain it in the police court growled the big man with a crooked eye thats the proper place for you to make your explanations the judge will listen to you cried the slim man his head bobbing on his long neck like the head of a crane that is walking along the edge of a marsh dont attempt to escape by means of falsehoods you rascal almost shouted the little man with the red whiskers bristling up in a savage manner but dodging back the moment frank turned on him gentlemen i have been insulted by this fellow came from behind the baffling veil worn by the woman he is a low wretch who attacked me in a most brutal manner we will see that you are protected madam assured the little man his red whiskers seeming to bristle like porcupine quills as he dodged round frank and placed himself on the opposite side of the veiled unknown madam he repeated i will see that you are protected i will you are very kind she fluttered but where is the officer the reaction the shock the weakness permit me to offer you any assistance possible gallantly spoke a man in a sack coat and a silk hat stepping forward and raising the latter piece of wearing apparel thereby disclosing a shining bald spot on the top of his head which he covered as quickly as possible evidently hoping it had escaped the womans notice you are in a city my dear lady where insults to the fair sex never go unpunished he attempted to smile on her in a pleasant manner but there was a sort of leer in his eyes and around his sensual mouth that betrayed his true character plainly enough the woman did not accept his arm which was half tendered but she made a great show of agitation and distress which affected the various witnesses its a shame piped the man with the long neck and the bobbing head its an outrage blustered the little man with the bristling whiskers and savage manner its most unfortunate murmured the gallant man with the silk hat and sack coat its a bad break for mr masher ejaculated the big man with the crooked eye and glowering look frank smiled he could not help it for he was impressed by the comedy of the affair despite the unpleasantness of the situation he was in at that moment this would be good stuff for a scene in a play he thought and he made a mental note of it then he turned to the woman madam he said what have i ever done to you that you should attempt to injure me in this manner dont let him speak to me the scoundrel she entreated appealing to the men but it is no more than fair that you should answer me persisted merry i do not know you i have not even seen your face will you not lift your veil and permit me to see your face so that i may know who has brought me into this unpleasant position he adds to his insults by requesting me to expose my identity on the street after such an affair as this she almost sobbed he would disgrace me he would have my name in all the newspapers reprehensible purred the gallant man terrible cackled the man with the bobbing head dastardly exploded the individual with the red whiskers criminal grated the giant with the crooked eye and they all glared at frank at least all of them but the one with the crooked eye it is possible that he also glared at the supposed offender but he seemed to be glaring at a white horse on the opposite side of the street repressing his laughter with difficulty merry said i assure you gentlemen i never saw this lady to my knowledge before a few minutes ago when she stopped me on the street and again the woman screamed will you listen to his base falsehoods she cried with a show of the greatest indignation and distress he is trying to disgrace me still further by asserting that i stopped him on the street stopped him as if a lady would do such a thing the idea squawked the man with the long neck his head seeming to bob faster than ever as if it sought to express by its excited movements the indignant emotions his tongue could not utter my dear lady i would not remain here to be thus insulted declared the gallant man bending toward her and endeavoring to summon a look of concern to his treacherous countenance he should be placed in irons blurted the fierceappearing little man his red whiskers seeming to work and squirm with intense excitement and anger he ought to have his head broken roared the big man his crooked eye still seeming to glare at the white horse in a most terrible and awesome manner others of the assembled crowd murmured to themselves in a most indignant manner all seeming to regard frank as the offender frank took out his watch and looked at it gracious he mentally exclaimed time is flying if this keeps up much longer ill not reach puelbo today now he shows his anxiety and concern said a voice in the crowd hes beginning to be frightened said another voice hes anxious to get away said a third but he cant get away said a fourth this is all very interesting thought frank but it is decidedly unpleasant waal whut in times sake is goin on here id like ter know cried a voice that was familiar to frank and a tall lank countrifiedappearing youth came up to the outskirts of the crowd stood on his tiptoes and peered over it was ephraim gallup and he saw frank waal darned if it aint merry made a swift movement clapping a finger to his lips and gallup usually rather slow to tumble to anything understood him at once relapsing into silence let me git in here where i kin see the fun he said and he elbowed the people aside as he forced his way through the crowd it did not take him long to reach the center of the throng although a number of persons were indignant at his manner of thrusting them aside or stepping on their feet whuts up he asked ef theres anything goin on i kainder want to see it this young masher has insulted this lady explained the man with the bobbing head sho exclaimed gallup yeou dont say so mister waal i am sprised he has treated her in an outrageous manner added the man with the agitated and fiery whiskers i do declare ejaculated ephraim id never thought it of him by thutter the lady requires protection declared the gallant man with the mismated wearing apparel yeou dont tell me gasped the vermonter his surprise seeming to increase aint it awful but the fellow needs a lesson rasped the man with the eye that persisted in looking in the wrong direction i think ill hit him once or twice my gracious fluttered gallup hev ye gotter hit him real hard dont yeou spose he might hit back let him try it came fiercely from the giant be yeou goin to hit where yere lookin asked the country youth cause ef yeou be id advise that man with the wart on his nose to move at this the man who owned the wart dodged with a suddenness that provoked a titter of laughter from several witnesses ephraim was adding to the comedy of the affair and frank bit his lips to keep from laughing outright despite his annoyance over being thus detained the big man with the crooked eye flourished his fists in the air in a most belligerent fashion and instantly merriwell gazed at him sternly saying be careful sir you are imperiling the lives of everyone near you and you may strain yourself thats right by gum nodded gallup whimsically yeou may warp one of them air arms flingin it araound so goldarn permiscuous like here comes an officer somebody uttered the cry it is high time exclaimed the little man trying to soothe his agitated whiskers by pulling at them it surely is croaked the lank individual his head bobbing with renewed excitement madam the law will give you redress bowed the gallant man again taking off his silk hat and again clapping it on suddenly as if a breath of cool air on his shining pate had warned him of the exposure he was making oh why didnt the officer stay away a minute longer so i might have thumped him regretfully grunted the fighting man with the misdirected eye the policeman came up and forced his way through the crowd demanding what does this mean what is happening here a lady is in trouble the bobbing man hastened to explain in serious trouble chirped the bewhiskered man she has been insulted declared the gallant man by a masher finished the man with the errant eye where is the lady asked the officer there all bowed politely toward the masked woman where is the masher was the next question there their scornful fingers were leveled straight at frank merriwell chapter xvii arrested oh sir exclaimed the woman i beg you to protect me from his insults the officer was a gallant fellow he touched his hat and bowed with extreme politeness then he frowned on merry and that frown was terrible to behold he gripped frank by the collar gruffly saying youll have to come with me merry knew it was useless to attempt to explain under such circumstances every one of the assembled crowd would be a witness against him very well he said quietly i am quite willing to do so please do not twist my necktie off dont worry about your necktie advised the policeman giving it a still harder twist i know how to deal with chaps of your caliber now of a sudden ephraim gallup began to grow angry he did not fancy seeing his idol treated in such a manner and his fists were clenched while he glared at the officer as if contemplating hitting that worthy its a goldern shame he grated this jest makes my blood bile i dont wonder a bit piped the longnecked man misunderstanding the vermonter but the officer will take care of him now hell get what he deserves oh will he exploded gallup waal ef i was yeou id hire myself aout to some dime museum as the human bobber yeou teeter jest like a certun bird that i wont name wh a at squealed the individual addressed in great excitement this to me why ill i wish ter great goshfrey yeou would hissed ephraim glaring at him id jest like to hev yeou try it id give yeou a jolt thatd knock yeou clean inter the middle of next week why who is this fellow that seeks to create a disturbance blustered the little man his fiery whiskers beginning to bristle and squirm again he should be sat upon the country youth turned on him i wish yeoud tackle the job yeou condemned little redwhiskered runt he shot at the blusterer with such suddenness that the little man staggered back and put up his hands as if he had been struck yeou are another meddler id eat yeou an id never know id hed a bite this is very unfortunate madam purred the gallant man at the veiled womans side i am extremely sorry that you have had such an unpleasant experience now if that creature he designated ephraim by the final word and gallup cut him short right there yeoure the cheapest one of the hull lot old oilsmirk he flung at the speaker such fellers as yeou are more dangerous to real ladies than all the young mashers goin fer yeou are a hypocrite who pretends to be virtuous the man gasped and tried to say something but seemed stricken speechless now the cockeyed man was aroused once more he seemed on the point of making a swing at somebody or something he pushed his face up close to ephraim but still his rebellious eye seemed looking in quite another direction if you want any trouble here he said hoarsely ill attend to you i can do that very well ephraim looked at him began to smile broke into a grin and burst into a shout of laughter haw haw haw he roared i couldnt fight with yeou ef i wanted to fer id think yeou didnt mean me all the time but that yeou really ought to be fightin with some other feller yeou was lookin at yeoure the funniest toad in the hull puddle ill arrest the whole lot of you threatened the policeman quit that business come along to the police station if you want to make any complaints then he turned to the woman saying madam i presume you will make a complaint against this fellow indicating frank i certainly shall she promptly answered for it is my duty to teach him a lesson will you come to the station yes permit me to accompany you urged the gallant man you are very kind she said but i think i can get along i will follow at a distance all right nodded the officer once more gripping merriwells collar savagely march sir and then they started toward the station the bobbing man the little man the cockeyed man and the gallant man formed behind then the crowd fell in and away they went with the mysterious veiled woman following at a distance ephraim placed himself at franks side this is a goldarn outrage fumed the vermonter speaking to merry whut be yeou goin to do abaout it i shall have to do the best i can answered the unfortunate youth quietly but yeou wont be able to start for puelbo with the rest of the people it doesnt look that way now thats tough it is decidedly unfortunate but i hope to get off in time to join the company before the first performance tomorrow night haow did it happen i hardly know the woman stopped me and insisted that i should go somewhere to talk with her i explained that my time was limited but that seemed to make no impression on her when i tried to get away she flung her arms around me and screamed that brought a crowd together and then she declared i had assaulted her the policeman on the other side of frank laughed in ridicule although he said nothing it was plain he took no stock in franks story larf grated gallup under his breath yeou think yeou know so goldarned much that hush warned frank i do not wish you to get into trouble you must inform the others what has happened to me its purty goldarn hard to keep still declared ephraim i never see sich a set of natteral born fools in all my life how many of the craowd saw what happened tween yeou an the woman no one i think an ill bet a squash theyll all go up an swear to any kind of a story shell tell who is she i dont know thats queer wut was her little game dont know that by gum its some kind of a putup job i have a fancy there is something more than appears on the surface it is an attempt to make trouble for me thats right i hope to see the womans face at the police station yeou wont why not she wont show it perhaps the judge will request her to lift her veil not by a goldarned sight men are too big fools over women theyll take any old thing shell say abaout yeou an lock yeou up fer it shell give some kind of name and address an theyll let her go at that well unless i can get bail right away i shall be in a bad fix if kent carson were in town he would pull me out of it as he did before the officer pricked up his ears ha he exclaimed then you have been arrested in denver before this is a second offense i rather think youll not get off as easy as you did the first time oh yeou are enough to ephraim with that word frank cut gallup short in a short time they approached the police station i have been here before said merry quietly this is the station to which i was taken when leslie lawrence made his false charge against me entering he was taken before the desk of the sergeant the bobbing man the little man the cockeyed man and the gallant man following closely while others also came in the sergeant looked up ah brandon he said to the officer another one yes sir answered the policeman what is the charge insulting a lady on the street who was the lady she is coming she will be here directly to make the complaint against him then the sergeant took a good look at the accused he started bent forward and looked closer mr merriwell he exclaimed is it you yes sergeant bowed frank with a smile it seems to be my luck to cause you trouble once more trouble ejaculated the man behind the desk why this is very surprising and you are accused of insulting a lady i am was the quiet answer well well well it hardly seems possible i fail to understand why you should do such a thing it was very kind of you to send me tickets for your performance yesterday and i was fortunate to be able to attend i was greatly pleased both with your play and yourself to say nothing of your supporting company i see the papers have given you a great sendoff but it is no better than you merit thank you sir said frank simply the policeman began to look disturbed while the bobbing man the little man the gallant man and the cockeyed man all stared at frank and the sergeant in surprise you seem to recognize the offender sir said the officer who had arrested frank i recognize the gentleman brandon said the sergeant putting particular emphasis on the word gentleman he said he had been arrested before he was on a trumpedup charge and he was promptly dismissed by me the officer looked still more disturbed but this is no trumpedup charge he declared i have witnesses where are they here he motioned toward the men who had followed closely on entering the station whereupon the little man drew himself up stiffly as if he imagined he must be six feet tall at least the bobbing man bobbed in a reckless manner as if he had quite lost control of himself the gallant man lifted his hat and mopped the shiny spot on the top of his head with a silk handkerchief attempting to appear perfectly at ease and the cockeyed man made a desperate attempt to look the sergeant straight in the eye but came no nearer than the upper corner of the station window which was several yards away to the left and where is the lady who makes the charge demanded the man behind the desk where indeed it was time for her to appear but all looked for her in vain she must be here directly said the sergeant if she is coming at all oh she is coming hastily answered the officer she may be waiting outside hesitating about coming in said the sergeant you may go out and bring her in brandon the policeman hesitated an instant as if he feared to leave frank it is all right asserted the sergeant i will guarantee that mr merriwell is quite safe then brandon hurried out i believe you are going on the road with your play mr merriwell said the sergeant in a most friendly and affable manner i am answered frank if i succeed in getting started how is that well smiled merry i was due to take a train in one hour and thirty minutes when i was accosted by the unknown woman whom it is said i insulted i hardly think i shall be able to catch that train now the sergeant looked at his watch how much time have you now he asked frank consulted his timepiece just fortyone minutes he said will you kindly tell me what occurred on the street invited the sergeant but wait first i wish to know who witnessed this assault there was some hesitation as the official behind the desk looked the assembled crowd over come he cried sharply who knows anything about this affair i do asserted the man with the cockeye summoning courage to step forward a bit and here are others which ones him and him and him answered the crookedeyed man jabbing a pudgy and none too clean forefinger at the gallant man the little man and the bobbing man although he seemed to look at three entirely different persons from those he named the gallant man was perspiring and looked as if he longed to escape he also seemed anxious over the nonappearance of the veiled lady the bobbing man took a step backward but somebody pushed him from behind and he bobbed himself nearly double the little man tugged at his fluttering whiskers looking to the right and left as if thinking of dodging and attempting to escape in a hurry and these are the witnesses said the sergeant his eyes seeming to pierce them through and through their testimony against you shall be carefully heard mr merriwell and it will be well for them to be careful about giving it if i understand what is proper said the cockeyed man who seemed the only one who dared speak outright this is not the court and you are not the judge but he subsided before the piercing eyes of the sergeant so that his final words were scarcely more than a gurgle in his throat now mr merriwell said the sergeant i will listen to your story officer at the door take care that none of the witnesses depart until they are given permission frank told his story briefly concisely and convincingly barely had he finished when the officer who made the arrest came in looking crestfallen and disgusted where is the lady brandon asked the sergeant i cant find her sir confessed the policeman she is nowhere in the vicinity then it seems you have been very careless in permitting her to slip away now there is no one to make a charge against the prisoner the witnesses perhaps some of them will do so the sergeant turned sharply on the little man to whom he fired the question did you witness this assault on the unknown lady sir the little man jumped no sussussir he stammered but i that will do came sternly from the man behind the desk step aside the little man did so with alacrity plainly relieved then the sergeant came at the gallant man with the same question did you witness the assault on the lady sir i was not present when it took place but i that will do step aside the gallant man closed up and stepped next the bobbing man was questioned did you witness the assault on the lady sir i arrived just after it was committed but i can tell you nothing that will do step aside the cockeyed man folded his arms across his breast and glared fiercely at the window which seemed to offend him you are next said the sergeant what did you see i saw quite enough to convince me that the assault had been committed before i reached the spot but another but but me no buts there seems to be no one present who witnessed the assault and so no one can prefer a charge against mr merriwell mr merriwell you have now exactly thirty minutes in which to catch your train dont stop to say a word but git up and git you are at liberty and frank took the sergeants advice followed closely by ephraim chapter xviii at the last moment frank merriwells company had gathered at the railway station to take the train for puelbo all but merriwell and gallup were on hand havener had purchased the tickets hodge restlessly paced up and down the platform his face dark and disturbed there were inquiries for frank stella stanley came to havener and asked where is mr merriwell i do not know confessed the stage manager who had been deputized for the occasion by frank to look out for tickets and make necessary arrangements he hasnt come no but hell be here before the train pulls out you know he has a way of always appearing on time hodge stopped in his walk and stared at havener id like to know when he left the hotel said bart i called for him several times before coming here but each time i found he was not in his room and no one knew anything about him his bill was not settled either but his baggage came down with the others said havener because the hotel people permitted it as he was vouched for by mr carson who seems to be well known to everybody in this city you dont suppose anything has happened to detain him do you anxiously asked the actress i do hope we shall not make another bad start same as we did before agnes kirk says she knows something will happen for mr merriwell gave away the cat mascot agnes kirk is forever prophesying something dismal said hodge shes a regular croaker if she didnt have something to croak about she wouldnt know what to do she declared the cat a hoodoo in the first place but now she says well have bad luck because frank let it go she makes me a trifle weary hodge was not in a pleasant humor granville garland and lester vance came up its almost train time said garland where is our energetic young manager he will be along havener again asserted i hope so said vance i sincerely hope this second venture will not prove such a miserable fizzle as the first one everything depends on frank merriwell something depends on you flashed hodge who seemed easily nettled frank merriwells company did all it could to make the first venture a fizzle now they should do all they can to make this one a success hello thundercloud is lowering exclaimed garland save your epithets exclaimed bart my name is hodge my dear hodge said garland with mock politeness you must know it is but natural that we should feel a bit anxious i may feel as anxious as any of you but i do not go round croaking about it but our first failure there it is again im tired of hearing about that you and vance are dead lucky to be in this second company for you both joined in the attempted assault on merriwell when folansbee skipped and the company seemed to be stranded in puelbo if id been frank merriwell id sent you flying and you can bet i would not have taken you back then its fortunate for us that you were not frank merriwell garland sneered it is agreed hodge some people do not know when they are treated well that will do came sharply from havener this is no time to quarrel by jove its time for that train and merriwells not here perhaps hes backed out at the last minute and decided not to take the play out said vance it may be that his courage has failed him now that kind of talk makes me sick exploded hodge if you had any sense you wouldnt make it i like that snapped vance his face flushing im glad you do flung back bart didnt think you would hoped you wouldnt only a fool would suppose that after all this trouble and expense any man with an ounce of brains in his head would back out without giving a single performance of the play well where is merriwell again havener declared hell be here but here comes the train the train was coming there was activity and bustle at the station the platform was alive with moving human beings agnes kirk and cassie lee came out of the ladies waiting room the male members of the company got together quickly he has not come exclaimed agnes kirk her keen eyes failing to discover frank i feared it i knew it hodge half turned away grumbling something deep in his throat the actors looked at each other in doubt and dismay with a rush and a roar the train came in and drew up at the station passengers began to get off a heavily veiled woman in black came out of the ladies room and started for the train as she passed the group of actors some of their conversation seemed to attract her notice she paused an instant and looked them over and then she turned toward the steps of a car excuse me madam said hodge quickly you have dropped your handkerchief he picked it up and passed it to her as he did so he noticed the letters l f on one corner thank you she said in a low voice at that moment for the last time havener was reiterating i believe frank merriwell will be here all get onto the train he never gets left then the woman tossed her head a bit and laughed it was a scornful laugh and it attracted the attention of several of the group she turned quickly and stepped into the nearest car something tells me he will not arrive declared agnes kirk the hoodoo is still on this company will meet the same fate the other did dont talk so much about it advised havener rather rudely get onto the train everybody hodge was staring after the veiled woman wonder what made her laugh like that he muttered seems to me ive heard that laugh before it seemed full of scornful triumph i wonder he did not express his second wonder come hodge said havener get aboard follow the others ill be the last one said hodge im waiting for frank im afraid confessed havener beginning to weaken afraid of what hodge almost hissed it begins to look bad admitted the stage manager im afraid something has happened to frank if he doesnt come i dont go declared bart i shall stay and find out what has happened to him you must go you must sit on those croakers your place is with the company mine is with frank merriwell all aboard the conductor gave the warning whats this rattletebang on the dead jump a cab was coming along the street the cabman was putting the whip to his foaming horses hes coming said hodge with cool triumph putting his hands into his trousers pockets and waiting the approach of the cab something made him feel certain of it up to the platform dashed the cab the driver flinging the horses back and flinging himself to the platform to fling open the door dong dong the train was starting out of the cab leaped frank merriwell grip in hand at his heels ephraim gallup came sprawling bart was satisfied havener was delighted both of them sprang on board the train across the platform dashed frank and the vermont youth and they also boarded the moving cars well laughed merry easily that was what i call a close call ten dollars to the cabby did it and he earned his sawbuck i congratulate you cried havener i confess i had given you up but what happened to detain you nothing but a little adventure answered merry coolly ill tell you about it they followed him into the car several members of the company had been looking from the car window and the arrival of frank had been witnessed they gave a shout as he entered the car and all were on their feet welcome cried douglas dunton dramatically welcome most noble one methinks thou couldst not do it better in a play it was great stuff flying cab foaming horses moving train and all that make a note of it i believe he did it on purpose declared agnes kirk speaking to vance with whom she had taken a seat very likely admitted lester wanted to do something to attract attention i think it was mean he fooled us but several members of the company shook hands with frank and congratulated him i told you he would not get left said havener with triumph at the rear end of the car was a veiled woman who seemed to sink down behind those in front of her as if she sought to avoid detection somehow although her face could not be seen there was in her appearance something that betokened disappointment and chagrin of course frank was pressed for explanations but he told them that business had detained him he did not say what kind of business at length however with hodge havener and gallup for listeners all seated on two facing seats he told the story of his adventure with the veiled woman and his arrest which ended in a discharge that barely permitted him to leap into a cab race to the hotel get his grip pay his bill and dash to the station in time to catch the train as the story progressed hodge showed signs of increasing excitement when merry finished bart exclaimed how did the woman look i did not see her face how was she dressed describe her dont know as i can do the best you can frank did so and bart cried ive seen her what merry was astonished i am sure of it asserted bart i have seen that very same woman when today how long ago a very short time where at the station while we were waiting for you to appear is it possible how do you know it was her then bart told of the strange woman who had dropped her handkerchief of the initials he had seen when he picked it up and of her singularly scornful laugh when she heard havener declare that merriwell never got left all this interested frank very much bart concluded by saying that woman is on this very train waal may i be tickled to death by grasshoppers ejaculated the youth from vermont whut in thunder do yeou spose shes up to it may be the same one said frank it would be remarkable if it should prove to be the same one two women might look so much alike that the description of one would exactly fit the other especially if both were heavily veiled bart shook his head something tells me it is the same woman he persisted but why should she be on this train who can answer that why did she try such a trick on the street dont know admitted merry once i thought it might be that she was mashed on me but it didnt prove that way oh i dunno drawled gallup with a queer grin yeou turned her daown an that made her sore ef shed bin mashed on ye perhaps shed done jest as she did to git revenge fer bein turned daown no something tells me this was more than a simple case of mash said frank what do you make of it asked havener an attempt to bother me for what who knows havent i had enough troubles i should say so but i thought your troubles of this sort were over when you got rid of lawrence you left two of the assistants who saw him try to fire the theater to appear as witnesses against him oh i hardly think lawrence was in this affair in any way or manner i confess i do not know just what to make of it heretofore my enemies have been men but now there seems to be a woman in the case if this woman follows you what will you do i shall endeavor to find out who she is and bring her to time so she will drop the game see that you do advised hodge and dont be soft with her because she is a woman go look through the train and see if you can find the woman you saw directed frank if you find her come back here and tell me where she is ill do it exclaimed bart getting up at once that fellow is faithful to you said havener when bart had walked down the aisle but he is awfully disagreeable at times its nothing but his loyalty that makes me take any stock in him his heart is in the right place asserted merry nothing makes him doubt you why i believe he wanted to fight the whole company when you failed to appear an hes a fighter bgosh when he gits started declared gallup ive seen him plunk some critters an he plunked them in great style hodge was gone some little time but there was a grim look of triumph when he returned find her asked merry sure nodded bart where last car she did not get onto this one but i rather think she moved after you came on board that makes me all the more certain that it is the woman shes near the rear end of the car on the left side as you go down the aisle well said frank rising i think ill go take a look at her is she alone yes thats good and she cannot escape from the train till it stops if it should happen to be the right woman which i hope it is bart wished to accompany frank to point the woman out but merry objected no he said let me go alone i can show her to you if the woman i am looking for is in the car ill find her merry passed slowly through the train scanning each passenger as he went along he entered the last car in a few moments he would know if the mysterious veiled woman really were on that train if he found her he would be certain the strange encounter on the street had a meaning that had not appeared on the surface the train was flying along swiftly taking curves without seeming to slacken speed in the least franks progress through the car was rather slow as the swaying motion made it difficult for him to get along but when he had reached the rear of the car he was filled with disappointment not a sign of a veiled woman had he seen in the car more than that there was no woman in black who resembled the woman who had stopped him on the street in denver could it be hodge had been mistaken no something told him bart had made no mistake in the matter of seeing a woman who answered the description given by frank he had said she was in the last car she was not there when frank passed through the car then she had moved why was the woman aware that she was being watched had she moved to escape observation frank stopped by the door at the rear end of the car he looked out through the glass in the door some one was on the platform at one side of the door frank opened the door and looked out the person on the platform was a woman in black and she wore a veil chapter xix on the rear platform a feeling of exultant satisfaction flashed over merriwell and he quickly stepped out onto the platform closing the door behind him the woman turned and looked toward him the train was racing along the track seeming to fly away from beneath the last car it was a strange place for a woman to be out there on the rear platform and merrys first thought had been that it must be the woman he sought for had she not come out there to escape him she had fancied he would look through the car fail to find her and decide that she was not on the train it must be that she had seen hodge come in and had realized at once why he had entered the car when he departed to carry the information to frank the desperate woman had fled to the rear platform immediately on stepping out onto the platform however frank decided that his reasoning was at fault it was a veiled woman and she was in black but it was not the woman he sought it was not the woman who had caused his arrest in denver merry was disappointed the unknown looked at him and said nothing he looked at her and wondered the veil was thick and baffling madam he said this is a dangerous place she said nothing you are liable to become dizzy out here and meet with an accident he pursued if you should fall well you know what that would mean it is remarkable that you should come out here the air she murmured in a hoarse husky voice the car was stifling and i needed the air i felt ill in there all the more reason why you should not come out here declared frank solicitously you could have had a window opened and that would have given you air the window stuck it must be some of them would open if you will return ill endeavor to find you a seat by an open window very kind of you she said in the same peculiar husky voice think ill stay out here dont mind me then i trust you will permit me to remain and see that you do not meet with any misfortune no go leave me i had rather remain alone she seemed like a middleaged lady he observed that her clothes fitted her ill and her hands were large and awkward she attempted to hide them all at once with a suddenness that staggered him the truth burst on frank the woman was no woman at all it was a man in disguise merry literally gasped for a single instant but he recovered at once through his head flashed a thought this must be some criminal who is seeking to escape justice immediately frank resolved to remain on the platform at any hazard he would talk to the disguised unknown the motion of the train is rather trying to one who is not accustomed to it he said some people feel it quite as much as if they were on a vessel car sickness and seasickness are practically the same thing she looked at him through the concealing veil but did not speak i have traveled considerable he pursued but fortunately i have been troubled very little with sickness either on sea or land will you be kind enough to leave me came from behind the veil in accents of mingled imploration and anger i could not think of such a thing madam he bowed as gallantly as possible it is my duty to remain and see that you come to no harm i shall come to no harm you are altogether too kind your kindness is offensive i am very sorry you regard it thus but i know my duty if you knew half as much as you think you would go i beg your pardon it is because i do know as much as i think that i do not go the unknown was losing patience go he commanded and now his voice was masculine enough to betray him if frank had not dropped to the trick before no smiled merry really beginning to enjoy it not till you go in yourself madam the train lurched round a curve causing the disguised unknown to swing against the iron gate frank sprang forward as if to catch and save the person from going over but his real object was to apparently make a mistake and snatch off the veil the man seemed to understand all this for he warded off franks clutch crying i shall call for aid i shall seek protection it would not be the first time today that a veiled woman has done such a thing laughed frank the disguised man stared at him again merry fairly itched to snatch away the veil if you are seeking air madam he suggested you had better remove your veil it must be very smothering for it seems to be quite thick you are far too anxious about me snapped the disguised man i would advise you to mind your own business this amused merry still more the situation was remarkably agreeable to him in some instances he said politely your advice would be worth taking but an insane person should be carefully watched and that is why i am minding your business just now an insane person exactly do you mean that i am insane well i trust you will excuse me but from your appearance and your remarkable behavior it seems to me that you should be closely guarded that seemed to make the unknown still more angry but it was plain he found difficulty in commanding words to express himself youre a fool he finally snapped thank you smiled frank youre an idiot thank you again you are the one who is crazy still more thanks how have i acted to make you fancy me demented you are out here and you may be contemplating selfdestruction by throwing yourself from this train dont worry about that i am contemplating nothing of the sort but there are other evidences of your insanity oh there are yes as the disguised unknown did not speak merry went on the strongest evidence of your unbalanced state of mind is the illchosen attire you are wearing what do you mean why are you not dressed in the garments of your sex sir you are not a woman declared frank coolly but a man in the garments of a woman your disguise is altogether too thin it would not deceive anybody who looked you over closely you are frank got no further with a cry of anger the disguised unknown sprang at him grappled with him panted in his ear you are altogether too sharp frank merriwell this time you have overshot yourself this ends you then he tried to fling merry from the swiftly moving train frank instantly realized that it was to be a struggle for life and he met the assault as quickly and stiffly as he could but the disguised man seemed of a truth to have the strength of an insane person in his quick move the fellow had forced frank back against the gate and over this he tried to lift and hurl him no you dont came from merrys lips curse you panted the fellow i will do it yes you will i dont think in the desperate struggle both seemed to hang over the gate for a moment then frank slid back securing a firm grip and felt safe just then however the door of the car flew open and out sprang hodge bart saw what was happening in a moment and he leaped to merrys aid out on a high trestle that spanned a roaring torrentlike river rumbled the train bart clutched frank gave the disguised man a shove and just how it happened neither of them could tell afterward but over the gate whirled the man and down toward the seething torrent he shot up from that falling figure came a wild cry of horror that was heard above the fumbling roar of the train on the trestle bridge over and over the figure turned the skirts fluttering and then headlong it plunged into the white foam of the torrent disappearing from view on the rear platform of the last car two whitefaced horrified young men had watched the terrible fall they stared down at the swirling river looking for the unfortunate wretch to reappear off the bridge flew the train and no longer were they able to see the river hes gone came hoarsely from bart then you saw you knew it was a man cried frank yes i saw his trousers beneath the skirts as i came out the door this is terrible muttered frank he was trying to throw you over yes attempted to take me off my guard and hurl me from the train then the wretch has met a just fate declared bart but now it seemed that the struggle on the platform had been noticed by some one within the car there were excited faces at the glass in the door and a trainman came out demanding what is all this why are you out here they tell me a woman came out where is she with unusual readiness bart quickly answered shes gone jumped from the train jumped yes we both tried to save her just as i reached the door i saw my friend struggling to hold her but she was determined to fling herself over well this is a fine piece of business came angrily from the trainman what ailed her she must have been insane asserted bart she attacked my friend here and then tried to jump off he could not hold her i did not get hold of her in time what was he doing out here watching her you will admit it was rather queer for a woman to come out here on the platform and stand he thought so and so he came out to watch her well you can both come in off this platform growled the trainman in anything but a civil manner they did so the passengers swarmed round them when they entered the car literally flinging questions at them who was the woman what ailed her why did she go out there what did she do tell us about it again bart made the explanation and then there arose a babel i noticed her declared one i saw she looked queer i noticed her asserted another i saw she acted queer i saw her when she went out put in a third and i thought it was a crazy thing to do without doubt the woman was insane declared a pompous fat man she must have been instantly killed she jumped into the river then she was drowned who knows her she was all alone frank had been thinking swiftly all the while he regretted that bart had been so hasty in making his explanation and now he resolved to tell as near the truth as possible without contradicting hodge gentlemen and ladies he said i have every reason for believing that the person was a man then there were cries of astonishment and incredulity a man impossible never ridiculous but an elderly lady who wore goldbowed spectacles calmly said the young gentleman is correct i am quite sure the person in question sat directly in front of me and i discovered there was something wrong i felt almost certain it was a man before he got up and went out on the platform then there was excitement in the car a perfect torrent of questions was poured on frank merry explained that he had thought it rather remarkable that a woman should be standing all alone on the rear platform and after going out and speaking to the person he became convinced that it was a man in disguise then he told how the man on being accused had attacked him furiously and finally had seemed to fling himself over the iron gate it was a great sensation but no one accused either merry or bart of throwing the unknown over not a little to franks relief at last they got away and went forward into the car where the company was gathered havener and gallup had been holding the double seat and frank and bart sat down there well i fancy you failed to find the lady you were looking for said havener but whats the matter you look as if something has happened something has said frank grimly goldarned ef i dont blieve it exclaimed ephraim both yeou an hodge show it tell us abaout it frank did so in a very few words astonishing both ephraim and the stage manager waal said the vermonter the gal who tackled yeou in denver warnt no man not much said frank and it is remarkable that hodge should have mistaken a man for such a woman as i described didnt said bart but you have acknowledged that you believed this was a man yes but this man was not the veiled woman i saw wasnt not much by jove exclaimed frank the mystery deepens did you mistake this person for the veiled woman i meant sure thing and did not find another not a sign of one i do not believe there is another on the train well this is a mystery confessed hodge i saw nothing of the one i meant when i went to look for you it must be you saw no one but that man in the first place bart shook his head flushing somewhat do you think i would take that man for a woman with a perfect figure such as you described what in the world do you fancy is the matter with my eyes by gum drawled gallup this air business is gittin too thick fer me i dont like so much mystery a bit if that man was not the one you meant hodge said merry then the mysterious woman is still on this train thats so nodded bart find her urged frank i want to get my eyes on her more than ever surely you should be able to find her ill do it cried bart jumping up away he went frank remained with havener and gallup talking over the exciting and thrilling adventure and the mystery of it all till hodge returned at a glance merry saw that his college friend had not been successful well he said did you find her no confessed bart looking crestfallen i went through the entire train and i looked every passenger over the woman i meant is not on this train then it must be that your woman was the man who met his death in the river there is no other explanation of her disappearance you must give up now hodge but hodge would not give up although he could offer no explanation and the mystery remained unsolved there were numerous stops between denver and puelbo and it was nightfall before the train brought them to their destination the sun had dropped behind the distant rockies and the soft shades of a perfect spring evening were gathering when they drew up at the station in puelbo lights were beginning to twinkle in windows and the streets were lighted props had gone to look after the baggage and the company was gathered on the platform cabmen were seeking to attract fares of a sudden a cry broke from the lips of bart hodge there she is all were startled by his sudden cry they saw him start from the others pointing toward a woman who was speaking to a cabman that woman had left the train and crossed the platform and she was dressed in black and heavily veiled frank saw her recognized her by heavens it is the woman he exclaimed chapter xx man or woman into the cab sprang the woman slam the door closed behind her crack the whip of the driver fell on the horses and away went the cab stop shouted hodge cabby did not heed the command frank made a rush for another cab follow he cried pointing toward the disappearing vehicle i will give you five dollars ten dollars if you do not lose sight of that cab in shouted the driver ill earn that ten in frank plunged jerking the door to behind him the cab whirled from the platform with a jerk away it flew it will be worth twenty dollars to get a peep beneath that veil muttered frank merriwell the windows were open he looked out on one side he could see nothing of the cab they were pursuing back he dodged and out he popped his head on the other side there it is he felt that he was not mistaken the fugitive cab was turning a corner at that moment they were after it closely frank wondered where the woman could have been hidden on the train so that she had escaped observation he decided that she must have been in one of the toilet rooms but what about the veiled man who was disguised as a woman that man had known frank had spoken his name it was a double mystery the pursuit of the cab continued some distance at last the cab in advance drew up in front of a hotel and a man got out merriwell had leaped to the ground and cabby was down quite as swiftly saying there sir i followed em ten plunks please the door of the other cab had been closed and the man was paying the driver he wore no overcoat and carried no baggage fooled exclaimed frank in disappointment you have followed the wrong cab driver i followed the one you told me to follow declared the driver no you made a mistake now dont try that game on me growled the man its your way of attempting to get out of paying the tenner you promised no i shall pay you for you did the best you could it was not your fault that you made a mistake in the mass of carriages at the depot didnt make no mistake asserted the cabby sullenly well its useless to argue over it said merry as he gave the man the promised ten dollars i am sure you made a mistake think i couldnt follow bill dover and his spotted nigh hawse exploded the driver i couldnt have missed that hawse if id tried frank saw one of the horses attached to the other cab was spotted he had noticed that peculiarity about one of the horses attached to the cab the mysterious woman had entered its the same horse exclaimed merry course it is nodded the driver the man had paid his fare and was carelessly sauntering into the hotel as he disappeared through the doorway frank sprang to the door of the other cab flung it wide open and looked in more than half expecting to discover the woman still inside no woman was there frank caught his breath in astonishment and stood there staring into the empty cab hi there wot cher doin called the man on the box frank did not answer he reached into the cab and felt on the floor he found something brought it forth looked at it amazed it was a womans dress but where was the woman garment after garment frank lifted discovering that all a womans outer wearing apparel lay on the floor of that cab vanished he muttered disappeared gone what does it mean then he thought of the man who had left the cab and entered the hotel and he almost reeled that was the woman he had seen one woman change into a man on the train and here was another and no less startling metamorphosis driver he cried didnt you take a person on in womans clothes at the station and let one off in mans clothes just now none of yer business came the coarse reply i knows enough not ter answer questions when im paid ter keep still that was quite enough the driver might as well have answered for he had satisfied merriwell frank was astonished by the remarkable change that the woman had made while within the cab but now he believed he understood why she had not been detected while on the train she had been able to make a change of disguises in the toilet room and had passed herself off as a man hodge had looked for a veiled woman and he had looked for a veiled woman it was not strange that both of them had failed to notice a person in masculine attire who must have looked like a woman up the hotel steps frank leaped he entered the office he searched and inquired at last he found out that a beardless man had entered by the front door but had simply passed through and left by a side door given me the slip decided frank he realized that he had encountered a remarkably clever woman and the mystery was deeper than ever frank went to the hotel at which the company was to stop and found all save wynne had arrived hodge was on the watch for merry and eagerly inquired concerning his success in following the woman frank explained how he had been tricked well its plain this unknown female is mighty slippery said bart you have not seen the last of her i am afraid there are some things about this double mystery which will never be solved admitted frank for instance the identity of the man who fell into the river well be dead lucky if we do not have trouble over that affair said hodge how do you mean some fool is liable to swear out a warrant charging us with throwing the unknown overboard i thought of that nodded frank and that is why i took occasion on the train to straighten out your story somewhat it is always best bart to stick to the straight truth hodge flushed and looked resentful but plainly sought to repress his feelings as he said i am not the only person in the world who believes the truth should not be spoken at all times if one cannot speak the truth said merry quietly he had better remain silent and say nothing at all particularly in a case like this there is an old saying that the truth can afford to travel slowly but a lie must be on the jump all the time or it will get caught well i dont think this is any time to moralize came a bit sharply from bart if we were to go into an argument i rather think i could show logically that a white lie is sometimes more commendable than the truth in shielding another possibly admitted merry but never in shielding the one who tells it the more a person lies the more he has to lie for it becomes necessary to tell one falsehood to cover up another and after a while the unfortunate individual finds himself so ensnared in a network of fabrications that it is impossible for him to clear himself then disaster comes oh dont preach snapped bart lets go to your room and talk this matter of the veiled woman over there is trouble brewing for you and you must be prepared to meet it havener has registered for the company and all you have to do is call for your key so frank and bart went to the room of the former puelbo had been well papered the work was done thoroughly and every board every dead wall and every available window flaunted the paper of true blue the failure of for old eli was still fresh in the minds of the people of the city but neither had they forgotten frank merriwells plucky promise to bring the play back to that place and perform it successfully there the newspapers of the place had given him their support but frank was determined that extracts from the notices in the denver papers should reach the eyes of those who did not read the puelbo papers closely with this end in view he had the extracts printed on flyers as small bills are called and the flyers were headed in startling type five hundred dollars fine to this he added each and every person who reads the following clippings from denver newspapers will be fined five hundred dollars it is needless to say that nearly every one who could read was careful to read the clippings through to the end this manner of attracting attention was effective even though it may seem rather boyish in its conception his printing was done on the very night that he arrived in puelbo and the flyers were scattered broadcast the following day he obtained the names of a large number of prominent citizens to whom he sent complimentary tickets good for the first nights performance frank was determined to have a house even if it was made up principally of deadheads on the occasion of his former visit to puelbo he had received some free advertising through leslie lawrence who had circulated printed accusations against him he scarcely expected anything of the sort on this occasion and he was rather startled when on the morning following his arrival he discovered that a circular had been scattered broadcast which seemed to be even more malicious than the former attempt upon him in this circular he was plainly charged with the murder of an unknown woman shortly after leaving denver and it was said he had been aided in the crime by bartley hodge frank was calmly reading this bold accusation when hodge came bursting into the room in a manner that reminded merry of his entrance under similar circumstances on the former occasion seeing the paper in merrys hand bart hoarsely cried so youve got it then you know about it well now sir what do you think of that sit down hodge said frank calmly you seem all out of breath you are excited excited shouted the darkfaced youth well isnt that enough to excite a man of stone do you mean this yes that what in the name of creation do you suppose i meant i wasnt certain wasnt cert oh say thats too much what do you think what are you made of anyway now my dear fellow you must stop going on like this youll bring on heart disease if you keep it up hodge dropped down on a chair and stared at merry well ill be blowed he gasped you are nearly blowed now said frank you seem quite out of breath is it possible you have read that paper you hold in your hand asked bart with forced calmness yes i have read it well i do not understand you yet i thought i did but im willing to confess that i dont then he jumped up almost shouting why man alive dont you understand that we are charged with murder with murder yes said frank still unruffled it seems so by this and you take it like that what is the use to take it differently use use sometimes i think you havent a drop of good hot blood in your body if a person has plenty of good hot blood it is a good thing for him to cool it off with good cool brains hot blood is all right but it should be controlled it should not control the man i dont see how you can talk that way under such circumstances why we may be arrested for murder any moment we shall not shall not no why not because our unknown enemy does not dare come out into the open and make the charge against us what makes you think so this frank held up the accusing paper that yes why should that make you think so if our enemy had intended to come out and make the charge against us openly this would not have appeared it is simply an attempt to hurt us from under cover or to arouse others against us against me in particular bart could see there was logic in merrys reasoning but still he was fearful of what might happen well even you must acknowledge that the unknown enemy may succeed in his purpose said hodge there were a number of persons who saw something of the struggle on the train this may arouse some of them or one of them at least to do something it may you confess that yes didnt think you would i dont believe it will hodge i have a fancy that in this case same as in the other my enemy will overshoot the mark how something tells me that this warning intended to turn suspicion against me will serve as an advertisement of course it will be a most unpleasant notoriety to have but it may serve to bring people out to see me bart looked thoughtful i never thought of that he confessed hesitatingly i had far rather not had the notoriety admitted frank but that cant be helped now let the people turn out to see true blue perhaps ill get a chance at my enemy later the veiled woman is in it i fancy i believe there was some connection between the veiled woman and the veiled man the one who plunged from the train into the river i have thought of that but ive been unable to figure out what the connection could be why was the man veiled and disguised thus so that i would not recognize him then it must be that you would know him if you saw him face to face as he knew me he called me by name as he sprang upon me well hes done for but i believe the woman will prove the most dangerous something tells me she was the real mover in this business i fancy you are right hodge at first in denver i thought she had been piqued by the manner in which i replied to her but since all these strange things have happened i know it was more than a case of pique when you make a woman your enemy she is far more dangerous than a man for women are more reckless less fearful of consequences thats right nodded frank women know they will not be punished to the full extent of the law no matter what they do juries are easily hypnotized by pretty women where a woman and a man are connected in committing a crime and the woman is shown to be the prime mover a jury will let the woman off as easily as possible a jury always hesitates about condemning a woman to death no matter if she has committed a most fiendish murder in the east women adventuresses ply their nefarious arts and work upon the sympathies of the juries so that when called to the bar they are almost always acquitted it is remarkable that men should be so soft it is not gallantry it is softness the very man who would cry the loudest if he had been hit by an adventuress is the most eager to acquit the woman in case he happens to be on the jury to pronounce the verdict in her case well said hodge you are sound and level in that statement frank its plain you do not think true chivalry consists of acquitting female blackmailers and assassins dont let this little attempt to injure us frighten you hodge advised frank rising i think it will miscarry entirely weve got plenty of work for today and tonight i believe i shall be able to tell beyond a doubt whether true blue is a success or a failure i think the test will come right here in puelbo where we met disaster before chapter xxi gallup meets the mysterious woman the mechanical arrangements and special scenery had arrived and were moved into the theater supers had been engaged to attend rehearsal in the afternoon so that they might know their business when evening came frank attended to the details of much of the work of making ready although he had full confidence in havener and hodge who assisted him he saw that the mechanical effect representing the boat race was put up and tested making sure it worked perfectly he was anxious about this for any hitch in that scene was certain to ruin the whole play gallup proved valuable he worked about the stage and he was of great assistance to havener who wished merriwell to appoint him assistant stage manager of course everybody was anxious about the result but the majority of the company had confidence in merriwell and his play cassie lee perhaps was the only one who was never assailed by a doubt concerning the outcome i shall do my best tonight at any cost she told frank at that moment he did not pause to consider the real meaning of her words afterward he knew what she meant she still carried a tiny needle syringe and a phial that contained a certain dangerous drug that had so nearly wrought her ruin the various members of the company drifted into the theater by the stage entrance looked over their dressing rooms and the stage and drifted out again they had been engaged to act and they did not propose to work when it was not necessary gallup whistled as he hustled about the work havener directed him to do he made his long legs carry him about swiftly although he sometimes tripped over his own feet ephraim was arranging a mass of scenery so that every piece would be handy for use that night when the time came to use it while doing this he was surprised to see one of the dressingroom doors cautiously open and a person peer out gosh exclaimed the vermonter stepping back out of sight whos that again the person peered out of the dressing room as if to make sure the coast was clear i must be dreamin thought the vermont youth rubbing his eyes ive got em jest from hearin frank and hodge

there had been five hundred dollars in it but i notice you had curiosity enough to examine the contents of it came dryly from the stage manager ill just keep this it may prove to be a valuable clew to the womans identity everything possible was done for ephraims eyes but it was a long time before he was much relieved from the agony he was suffering then he was taken to the hotel with a bandage over his eyes and a doctor came to attend him the physician said he would do everything possible to get ephraim into shape to play that evening but he did not give a positive assurance that he would be able to do so as soon as frank heard of the misfortune which had befallen the vermont youth he hastened to the hotel and to the room where ephraim was lying on the bed gallup heard his step and recognized it when he entered im slappin glad yeouve come frank he exclaimed and i am terribly sorry you have met with such a misfortune ephraim declared merry so be i frank so be i but im goin ter

possession of it but i got him to leave it here so yeou might see it right away when yeou came frank found the purse and opened it from it he drew forth a crumpled and torn telegram smoothing this out he saw it was dated at castle rock the previous day it read as follows mrs hayward grace puelbo colo all right close call fell from train into river came near drowning but managed to swim out will be along on first train tomorrow keep track of the game p f frank jumped when he read that by jove he cried whut is it ephraim eagerly asked i believe i understand this do ye sure this was from the man who fell from the train into the river the man disguised as a woman who attacked me on the rear platform looks zif yeou might be right i am sure of it the fellow escaped with his life it is marvelous i shud say so he dispatched his accomplice the woman to let her know that he was living yeouve struck it frank and she was the one who got out the accusing flyers charging me with the crime of murder

possible waal im glad i done somethin though id bin a tarnal sight gladder if i hed ketched that woman frank carefully placed the purse and the telegram in his pocket where he knew it would be safe assuring ephraim that everything possible should be done for him he hastened out that afternoon the rehearsal took place with another person reading ephraims part it was feared that gallup would not be able to see to play when it came night but frank hoped that he could and the vermont youth vowed hed do it some way the rehearsal passed off fairly well although there were some hitches havener looked satisfied id rather it would go off this way than to have it go perfectly smooth he declared ive noticed it almost always happens that a good smooth rehearsal just before a first performance means that the performance will go bad and vice versa frank had not been long in the business but he also had observed that it often happened as havener had said the theater orchestra rehearsed with them getting all the cue music arranged and having everything in readiness for the specialties the night came at last and the company gathered at the theater wondering what the outcome would be gallup was on hand but he still had the bandage over his eyes he was wearing it up to the last minute so that he would give them as much rest as possible somebodyll hev ter make me up ternight he said i dont believe i kin see well enough ter do that havener agreed to look after that while the various members were putting the finishing touches on their toilet and makeup word came that people were pouring into the theater in a most satisfactory manner the orchestra tuned up for the overture frank went round to see that everybody was prepared he had fallen into that habit not feeling like depending on some one else to do it most of the men were entirely ready a few were making the last touches stella stanley and agnes kirk were all ready to go on where is cassie asked merry in the dressing room said stella she told us not to wait for her said she would be right out frank went to the dressing room the door was slightly open and through the opening he saw cassie she had thrust back the sleeve of her left arm and he saw a tiny instrument in her right hand he knew in a twinkling what she was about to do with a leap frank went into that room and caught her by the wrist cassie he cried guardedly you told me you had given it up you told me youd never use morphine again frank she whispered looking abashed i know i told you so i meant it but i must use it just once more just tonight i am not feeling at my best im dull and heavy you know how much depends on me if i dont do well i shall ruin everything it wont hurt me to use it just this once the success of true blue may depend on it if the success of true blue depended on it beyond the shadow of a doubt i would not let you use it cassie great heavens girl you are mad if you fall again into the clutches of that fiend nothing can save you but the play do you think i would win success with my play at the price of your soul no cassie lee if i knew it meant failure i would forbid you to use the stuff in that syringe here give it to me he took it from her and put it into his pocket now he said it is out of your reach you must play without it there goes the overture the curtain will go up in a few minutes all i ask of you is to do your best cassie let it mean success or failure chapter xxii the end of the rope the theater was packed under no circumstances had frank anticipated such an audience on the opening night he felt sure that the advertising given him through the effort of his enemies to injure him had done much to bring people out another thing had brought them there curiosity led many of them to the theater they remembered merriwells first appearance in puelbo and its outcome and they had not forgotten how in a speech from the stage he had vowed that he would bring the play back there and give a successful performance he had rewritten the piece and it had been played in denver to an invited audience every member of which went away highly pleased the denver papers had pronounced in favor of it puelbo people admired pluck and determination they could not help feeling admiration for the dogged persistency of frank merriwell and they really hoped he would make good his promise to give a successful performance franks first entrance was carefully worked up to in the play and he was astounded when he came laughing and singing onto the stage to be greeted by a perfect whirlwind of applause nor did the applause cease till he had recognized it by bowing then as everything quieted down and the play was about to move on again there came a terrible cry that rang through the house fire frank understood in a twinkling that it was a false alarm given for the purpose of producing a stampede and raising the performance after that cry for a moment everybody sat as if turned to stone it was the calm before the panic then franks voice rang out clear as a bell there is no fire keep your seats some had sprung up but his clear voice reached every part of the house and it checked the movement fire fire shrill and piercing was the cry in the voice of a woman arrest that woman cried frank she is trying to ruin this performance she is the one who circulated a lying and malicious circular charging me with the crime of murder it was a part of a plot to ruin me frank confessed afterward that he did not understand why the audience remained without stampeding after that second alarm it must have been that there was a magic something in his voice and manner that convinced them and held them at any rate there was no rush for the doors all at once there was a commotion in the first balcony from which the cries had come two policemen had seized a man and a woman and the arrested pair were taken from the theater quiet was restored and frank made a few soothing remarks to the audience after which the play proceeded and now he had the sympathy of every person in the great audience when an actor has once fairly won the sympathy of his audience he is almost sure of success the first act went off beautifully the storm and shipwreck at the close of the act took with the spectators there was hearty applause when the curtain fell frank had arranged that things should be rushed in making ready for the second act he wanted no long waits between acts for long waits weary the patience of the best audiences the second act seemed to go even better than the first if such a thing were possible the singing of the yale quartet proved a great hit and they were obliged to respond to encore after encore cassies dancing and singing were well appreciated and frank who was watching her decided that she could not have done better under any circumstances he did not know how hard she was working for success he did not know that she had actually prayed that she might do better than she had ever done before in all her life the discomfiture of spike dubad at the close of the second act was relished by all at last the curtain rose on the third act round which the whole plot of the play revolved now the interest of the audience was keyed up to the right pitch and the anxiety of the actors was intense the first scene went off all right and then came the change to the scene where the boat race was shown on the river everything worked perfectly and there was a tumult in that theater when the stage suddenly grew dark just as the yale boat was seen to forge into the lead and then in a few moments the distant sounds of cheering and the screaming of steam whistles seemed to burst out close at hand filling the theater with an uproar of sound then up flashed the lights and the open boathouse was shown with the river beyond the boats flashed in at the finish the yale cheer drowned everything else and frank merriwell was brought onto the stage in the arms of his college friends the curtain came down but the audience was standing and cheering like mad as if it had just witnessed the success of its favorite in a real college race the curtain went up for the tableau again and again but that audience would not be satisfied till frank merriwell came out and said something frank came at last and such an ovation as he received it brought a happy mist to his eyes there he is somebody cried he said he would come back here with his play and do the trick well he has done it cried another and he is the real frank merriwell who has shown us the kind of neversaydie pluck that has made yale famous the world over three cheers for frank merriwell they were given then all frank could say was a few choking words my friends i thank you from the bottom of my heart you cannot know how much was depending on the success or failure of this play perhaps all my future career depended on it i vowed i would win and you have shouted a voice it seems so again i thank you i am too happy to say more words are idle now he retired frank merriwell had won with his play true blue was a success in his happiness he forgot his enemies he forgot that two persons had been arrested in the balcony it was not till the next morning when he was invited by a detective to come to the jail to see the prisoners that he thought of them the detective accompanied him i have been on this fellows track for a long time he explained spotted him in the theater last night but was not going to arrest him till the show was over the woman with him created the disturbance and two policemen took them both in i dont want her for anything but i shall take the man back to chicago to answer to the charge of forgery i shall hold him here for requisition papers the jail was reached and first frank took a look at the woman he felt that she would prove to be the mysterious woman of the veil and he was right she looked up at him and laughed goodmorning mr merriwell she said pres and i have made things rather warm for you you must confess i reckon we made a mistake last night wed both been looking on the wine when it was red or wed not attempted to stampede the audience why it is the woman who claimed to be haveners wife cried frank here is the man said the detective frank turned to another cell he was face to face with philip scudder his oldtime enemy who had reached the end of his rope at last but in the hour of victory frank gave little heed to those who had made his path to this present success a hard and stormy one he was successful as a playwright and as an actor he had won the palm of victory the future seemed to promise all the rewards his energy and enterprise deserved he had started out from college with the determination to win wealth and fame he had left the scenes of his early triumphs and first misfortunes with the firm purpose to return honored and enriched by his own labors now he was on the eve of accomplishing that purpose and as he looked into the future the lines of will power and determination that had always marked his handsome countenance grew firmer as he murmured i will myself be true blue come what may let my paths for the next few months be as untoward as they ever have been difficulties shall but act as a spur to me in my purpose for i shall be soon i hope once more a son of old eli the end no of the merriwell series entitled
