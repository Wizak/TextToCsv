avdo and inge one the chill night wind off the tiber was from the north and carried with it the smell of snow from the distant apennines the sky was clear and full of stars and there was light enough to see the swirling of the dustdevils in the darkened streets and the paper cardboard and assorted detritus that blew about every which way the darkened filthy streets were not the result of the electrical and sanitation departments of the eternal city as was their peacetime wont staging one of their interminable strikes for this was not peacetime events in the mediterranean theatre had reached a delicate stage where rome no longer cared to advertise its whereabouts by switching on the street lights the sanitation department for the most part was some way off to the south fighting a war it didnt particularly care about petersen stopped outside a shop doorway the nature of its business was impossible to tell for the windows were neatly masked in regulation blackout paper and glanced up and down the via bergola it appeared to be deserted as were most streets in the city at that time of night he produced a hooded torch and a large bunch of peculiarly shaped keys and let himself in with a speed ease and dexterity which spoke well for whoever had trained him in such matters he took up position behind the opened door removed the hood from the torch pocketed the keys replaced them with a silenced mauser and waited he had to wait for almost two minutes which in the circumstances can be a very long time but petersen didnt seem to mind two stealthy footsteps then there appeared beyond the edge of the door the dimly seen silhouette of a man whose only identifiable features were a peaked cap and a hand clasping a gun in so purposeful a grip that even in the halflight the faint sheen of the knuckles could be seen the figure took two further stealthy steps into the shop then halted abruptly as the torch clicked on and the silencer of the mauser rammed none too gently into the base of his neck drop that gun clasp your hands behind your neck take three steps forward and dont turn round the intruder did as told petersen closed the shop door located the light switch and clicked it on they appeared to be in what was or should have been a jewellers shop for the owner a man with little faith in the occupying forces his fellowcountrymen or both had prudently and totally cleared all his display cabinets now you can turn round petersen said the man turned the set expression on the youthful face was tough and truculent but he couldnt do much about his eyes or the apprehension reflected in them i will shoot you petersen said conversationally if you are carrying another gun and dont tell me i have no other gun give me your papers the youngster compressed his lips said nothing and made no move petersen sighed surely you recognize a silencer i can just as easily take the papers off your body nobody will know a thing whats more to the point neither will you the youngster reached inside his tunic and handed over a wallet petersen flicked it open hans wintermann he read born august just nineteen and a lieutenant you must be a bright young man petersen folded and pocketed the wallet youve been following me around tonight and most of yesterday and the evening before that i find such persistence tedious especially when its so obvious why do you follow me you have my name rank regiment petersen waved him to silence spare me well im left with no option youre going to shoot me the truculence had left the youngsters face dont be stupid the hotel splendide was anything but but its dingy anonymity suited petersen well enough peering through the cracked and stained glass of the front door he noted with mild surprise that the concierge fat unshaven and well stricken in years was for once not asleep or at least wide enough awake to be able to tilt a bottle to his head petersen circled to the rear of the hotel climbed the fire escape let himself in to the thirdfloor passage moved along this turned into a lefthand corridor and let himself into his room with a skeleton key he quickly checked cupboards and drawers seemed satisfied shrugged into a heavy coat left and took up position on the fire escape despite the added protection of the coat his exposed position was considerably colder than it had been in the comparative shelter of the streets below and he hoped he would not have to wait too long the wait was even shorter than he had expected less than five minutes had passed when a german officer strode briskly along the corridor turned left knocked on a door knocked again this time peremptorily rattled the handle then reappeared frowning heavily there came the creaking and clanking of the ancient elevator a silence more creaking and clanking then the officer again hove into sight this time with the concierge who had a key in his hand when ten minutes had passed with no sign of either man petersen went inside eased his way along the passage and peered round the corner to his left halfway along the corridor stood the concierge obviously on guard just as obviously he was an experienced campaigner prepared for any contingency for as petersen watched he produced a hip flask from his pocket and was still savouring the contents his eyes closed in bliss when petersen clapped him heartily on the shoulder you keep a good watch my friend the concierge coughed choked spluttered and tried to speak but his larynx wasnt having any of it petersen looked past him and through the doorway and good evening to you colonel lunz everything is in order i trust ah good evening lunz was almost a lookalike for petersen himself medium height broad shoulders aquiline features grey eyes and thin black hair an older version admittedly but nevertheless the resemblance was startling he didnt seem in any way put out ive just this moment arrived and ah ah colonel petersen wagged a finger officers whatever their nationality are officers and gentlemen the world over gentlemen dont tell lies youve been here for exactly eleven minutes ive timed you he turned to the still redfaced and gasping concierge who was making valiant efforts to communicate with them and clapped him encouragingly on the back you were trying to say something you were out the convulsions were easing i mean you were in but i saw you go out eleven minutes you said i didnt see mean your key you were drunk at the time petersen said kindly he bent sniffed and wrinkled his nose you still are be off send us a bottle of brandy not that fearful rotgut you drink the french cognac you keep for the gestapo and two glasses clean glasses he turned to lunz you will of course join me my dear colonel naturally the colonel was a hard man to knock off balance he watched petersen calmly as he took off his coat and threw it on the bed lifted an eyebrow and said a sudden chill snap outside yes rome january no time to take chances with ones health its no joke hanging about those fire escapes i can tell you so thats where you were i should have exercised more care perhaps no perhaps about your choice of lookout true the colonel brought out a briar pipe and began to fill it i hadnt much choice you sadden me colonel you really do you obtain my key which is illegal you post a guard so that you wont be discovered breaking the law yet again you ransack my belongings ransack carefully examine i dont know what kind of incriminating evidence you were expecting to find none really you dont strike me as the kind of man who would leave and you had me watched earlier tonight you must have done otherwise you wouldnt have known that i had been out earlier without a coat saddens it shocks where is this mutual trust that should exist between allies allies he struck a match i hadnt thought about it very much in that way judging by his expression he still wasnt thinking very much about it in that way and more evidence of mutual trust petersen handed over the wallet he had taken from the young lieutenant together with a revolver im sure you know him he was waving his gun around in a very dangerous fashion lunz looked up from the papers the impetuous young lieutenant winterniann you were right to take this gun from him he might have done himself an injury from what i know of you i assume hes not resting at the bottom of the tiber i dont treat allies that way hes locked up in a jewellers shop of course lunz spoke as if he had expected nothing else locked up but surely he can not the way i tied him up you not only sadden me colonel you insult me why didnt you give him a red flag to wave or a drum to beat something that would really attract my attention lunz sighed young hans is well enough in a tank but subtlety is not really his metier i did not by the way insult you following you was entirely his own idea i knew what he was up to of course but i didnt try to stop him for hardly won experience a sore head is little enough to pay he hasnt even got that an ally you see pity it might have reinforced the lesson he broke off as a knock came to the door and the concierge entered bearing brandy and glasses petersen poured and lifted his glass to operation weiss prosit lunz sipped appreciatively not all gestapo officers are barbarians operation weiss so you know youre not supposed to lunz didnt seem at all put out i know lots of things that im not supposed to you surprise me lunzs tone was dry he sipped some more brandy excellent excellent yes you do have a penchant for picking up unconsidered and classified trifles which leads to your repeated use of the world ally which leads in turn to what you possibly regard as our undue interest in you you dont trust me youll have to improve on that injured tone of yours certainly we trust you your record and it is a formidable one speaks for itself what we and especially myself find difficult to understand is why such a man with such a record aligns himself with well im afraid i have to say it with a quisling i do not hurt your feelings youd have to find them first i would remind you that it was your fuhrer who forced our departed prince regent to sign this treaty with you and the japanese two years ago i assume hes the quisling youre talking about weak certainly vacillating perhaps cowardly and no man of action you cant blame a man for those things natures done its worst and theres nothing we can do about nature but no quisling he did what he thought was best for yugoslavia he wanted to spare it the horrors of war bolje grab nego rob you know what that means lunz shook his head the intricacies of your language better death than slavery thats what the yugoslav crowds shouted when they learned that prince paul had acceded to the tripartite pact thats what they shouted when he was deposed and the pact denounced what the people didnt understand was that there was no nego no than it was to be death and slavery as they found out when the fuhrer in one of his splendid rages obliterated belgrade and crushed the army i was one of those who were crushed well nearly if i might have some more of that excellent cognac lunz helped himself you dont seem greatly moved by your recollections who can live with all his yesterdays nor by the fact that you find yourself in the unfortunate position of having to fight your own countrymen instead of joining them and fighting you war makes for strange bedfellows colonel take yourselves and the japanese for instance hardly entitles you to a holierthanthou attitude a point but at least were not fighting our own people not yet i wouldnt bank on it god knows youve done it enough in the past in any event moralizing is pointless im a loyalist a royalist and when and if ever this damned war is over i want to see the monarchy restored a mans got to live for something and if thats what i choose to live for then thats my business and noone elses all to hell our own way lunz said agreeably its just that i have some difficulty in visualizing you as a serbian royalist what does a serbian royalist look like come to that what does a serbian look like lunz thought then said a confession petersen i havent the slightest idea its my name petersen said kindly and my background there are petersens all over theres a village up in the italian alps where every second surname starts with mac the remnants so im told of some scottish regiment that got cut off in one of those interminable medieval wars my greatgreatgreat grandfather or whatever was a soldier of fortune which sounds a lot more romantic than the term mercenary they use today like a thousand others he arrived here and forgot to go home again where was home i mean scandinavian anglosaxon what genealogy bores me and not only dont i care i dont know either ask any yugoslav what his ancestors five times removed were and he almost certainly wouldnt know lunz nodded you slavic people do have rather a chequered history and then of course just to complicate matters you graduated from sandhurst dozens of foreign countries have had their officers graduate from there in my cases what more natural my father was after all the military attache in london if hed been the naval attache in berlin id probably have ended up in kiel or murwik nothing wrong with sandhurst ive been there as a visitor only but a bit on the conservative side as far as the courses offered are concerned you mean nothing on guerrilla warfare nothing on espionage and counterespionage nothing on code and cypher breaking i understand youre a specialist on all three im selfeducated in some things im sure you are lunz was silent for some seconds savouring his brandy then said whatever became of your father i dont know you may even know more than i do just disappeared thousands have done so since the spring of disappeared i mean he was like you a royalist a cetnik petersen nodded and very senior senior officers dont just disappear he fell foul of the partisans perhaps perhaps anything is possible again i dont know petersen smiled if youre trying to suggest im carrying on a vendetta because of a blood feud youd better try again wrong country wrong century anyway you didnt come here to pry into my motives or my past and now you insult me i wouldnt waste my time youd tell me just as much as you wanted me to know and no rnore and you didnt come here to carry out a search of my belongings that was just a combination of opportunity and professional curiosity you came here to give me something an envelope with instructions for our commander another assault on what it pleases you to call titoland youre pretty sure of yourself im not pretty sure im certain the partisans have radio transceivers british they have skilled radio operators both their own and british and they have skilled codecrackers you dont daresend secret and important messages any more by radio so you need a reliable message boy theres no other reason why im in rome frankly i cant think of any other which saves any explanation on my part lunz produced and handed over an envelope this is in code naturally why naturally in our code so i believe stupid who do you think devised that code i dont think i know you did its still stupid why dont you give me the message verbally ive a good memory for this sort of thing and theres more i may be intercepted and then two things may happen either i succeed in destroying it in which case the message is useless or the partisans take it intact and decipher it in nothing flat petersen tapped his head a clear case for a psychiatrist lunz took some more brandy and cleared his throat you know of course of colonel general alexander von lohr the german commander in chief for southeastern europe of course never met him personally perhaps it is as well that you never do i dont think general von lohr would react too favourably to the suggestion that he is in need of psychiatric treatment nor does he take too kindly to subordinate officers and despite your nationality you can take it that he very definitely regards you as subordinate who question far less disobey his orders and those are his orders two psychiatrists one for von lohr one for the person who appointed him to his command that would be the fuhrer of course colonel lunz said mildly i do try to observe the essential civilities its not normally too difficult but bear in mind that i am a german regimental commander i dont forget it and no offence was intended protests are useless i have my orders i assume that this time i will not be going in by plane you are remarkably well informed not really some of your colleagues are remarkably garrulous in places where not only have they no right to be garrulous but have no right to be in the first place in this case i am not well informed but i can think unlike well never mind youd have to notify my friends if you were sending in a plane and that message could be just as easily intercepted and deciphered as any other you dont know how crazy those partisans could be they wouldnt hesitate to send a suicide commando behind our lines and shoot down the plane when its still at an altitude of fifty or a hundred metres which is an excellent way of ensuring that noone gets out of that plane alive petersen tapped the envelope that way the message never gets delivered so i go by boat when tomorrow night where a little fishing village near termoli what kind of boat you do ask a lot of questions its my neck petersen shrugged his indifference if your travel arrangements dont suit me ill make my own it wouldnt be the first time youd borrowed shall we say a boat from your ah allies only in the best interests of all of course an italian torpedo boat you can hear one of those things twenty kilometres away so youll be landing near ploce thats in italian hands as you know and even if you could be heard fifty kilometres away whats the difference the partisans have no radar no planes no navy nothing that could stop you so the adriatic is your pond the torpedo boat it is thank you i forgot to mention that youll be having some company on the trip across you didnt forget you just saved it for last petersen refilled their glasses and looked consideringly at lunz im not sure that i care for this you know i like to travel alone i know you never travel alone ah george and alex you know them then theyre hardly invisible they attract attention they have that look about them what look hired killers youre half right theyre different my insurance policy they watch my back im not complaining but people are always spying on me an occupational hazard lunzs airily dismissive gesture showed what he thought of occupational hazards i would be grateful if you would allow those two people i have in mind to accompany you more i would regard it as a personal favour if you would escort them to their destination what destination same as yours who are they two radio operator recruits for your cetniks carrying with them i may say the very latest in transceiver equipment thats not enough and you know it names background sarina and michael trained highly trained i might say by the british in alexandria with the sole intent of doing what they are about to do joining your friends let us say that we intercepted them en route what else male and female no yes no no what im a fairly busy person i dont like being encumbered and ive no intention of acting as a shipborne chaperon brother and sister ah petersen said fellow citizens of course then why cant they find their own way home because they havent been home for three years educated in cairo again the wave of a hand troubled times in your country my friend germans here italians there ustasa cetniks partisans everywhere all very confusing you know your way around your country in these difficult times better than any im told i dont get lost much petersen stood id have to see them first of course i would have expected nothing else lunz drained his glass rose and glanced at his watch ill be back in forty minutes george answered petersens knock despite lunzs unflattering description george didnt look a bit like a killer hired or otherwise genial buffoons or those who look like them never do with a pudgy jovial face crowned by a tangled thatch of greyblack hair george on the wrong side of fifty was immense immensely fat that was the studded belt strung tightly around what used to be his waist served only to emphasize rather than conceal his gargantuan paunch he closed the door behind petersen and crossed to the lefthand wall like many very heavy men as is so often seen in the case of overweight dancers he was quick and light on his feet he removed from the plaster a rubber suction cap with a central spike which was attached by a wire to a transformer and thence to a single earphone your friend seems to be a very pleasant man george sounded genuinely regretful pity we have to be on opposite sides he looked at the envelope petersen had brought aha operational orders no yes hotfoot you might say from the presence of colonel general von lohr himself petersen turned to the recumbent figure on one of the two narrow beds alex alex rose unlike george he had no welcoming smile but that meant nothing for alex never smiled he was of a height with george but there any resemblance ended his weight was about half georges as were his years he was thinfaced swarthy and had black watchful eyes which rarely blinked wordlessly for his taciturnity was almost on a par with the stillness of his face he took the envelope dug into a knapsack brought out a small butane burner and an almost equally small kettle and began to make steam two or three minutes later petersen extracted two sheets of paper from the opened envelope and studied the contents carefully when he had finished he looked up and regarded the two men thoughtfully this mil be of great interest to a great number of people it may be the depths of winter but things look like becoming very hot in the bosnian hills in the very near future george said code yes simple i made sure of that when i made it up if the germans never meant business before they certainly mean it now seven divisions no less four german under general liitters whom we know and three italian under general gloria whom we also know supported by the ustasa and of course the cetniks somewhere between ninety thousand and a hundred thousand troops george shook his head so many according to this its common knowledge of course that the partisans are stationed in and around bihac the germans are to attack from the north and east the italians from south and west the battle plan god knows is simple enough the partisans are to be totally encircled and then wiped out to a man simple but comprehensive and just to make certain both the italians and germans are bringing in squadrons of bomber and fighter planes and the partisans havent got a single plane even worse for them they dont have antiaircraft guns well a handful but they should be in a museum petersen replaced the sheets and resealed the envelope i have to go out in fifteen minutes colonel lunz is coming to take me to meet a couple of people i dont particularly want to meet two radio operator cetnik recruits who have to have their hand held until we get to montenegro or wherever or so colonel lunz says suspicion was one of the few expressions that alex ever permitted himself or so he says which is why i want you two to go out as well not with me of course behind me a little night air will do us good these hotel rooms get very stuffy george was hardly exaggerating his penchant for beer was equalled only by his marked weakness for evilsmelling black cigars car or foot i dont know yet you have your car either way tailing in a blackout is difficult chances are wed be spotted so youve been spotted a long time ago even if lunz or one of his men does pick you up its most unlikely that hell have you followed what he can do you can do pick up our tail you mean what do you want us to do youll see where im taken when leave find out what you can about those two radio operators a few details might help it would be nice to know who were looking for probably midtwenties brother and sister sarina and michael thats all i know no breaking down of doors george discretion thats whats called for tact diplomacy our specialities we use our carabinieri cards naturally when colonel lunz had said that the two young radio operator recruits were brother and sister that much petersen reflected had been true despite fairly marked differences in bulk and colouring they were unmistakably twins he was very tanned no doubt from all his years in cairo with black hair and hazel eyes she had the flawless peachcoloured complexion of one who had no difficulties in ignoring the egyptian sunshine closecropped auburn hair and the same hazel eyes as her brother he was stocky and broad she was neither but just how slender or well proportioned she might have been it was impossible to guess as like her brother she was clad in shapeless khakicoloured fatigues side by side on a couch where they had seated themselves after the introductions they were trying to look relaxed and casual but their overly expressionless faces served only to accentuate then wary apprehensiveness petersen leaned back in his armchair and looked appreciatively around the large livingroom my word this is nice comfort no luxury you two young people do yourselves well dont you colonel lunz arranged it for us michael said inevitably favouritism my spartan quarters are of your own choosing lunz said mildly it is difficult to arrange accommodation for a person who is in town for three days before he lets anyone know that hes here you have a point not mind you that this place is perfect in all respects take for instance the matter of cocktail cabinets neither my brother nor i drink sarinas voice was lowpitched and quiet petersen noticed that the slender interlaced hands were ivoryknuckled admirable petersen picked up a briefcase he had brought with him extracted a brandy bottle and two glasses and poured for lunz and himself your health i hear you wish to join the good colonel in montenegro you must then be royalists you can prove that michael said do we have to prove it i mean dont you trust us believe us youll have to learn and learn quickly and by that i mean now to adopt a different tone and attitude petersen was no longer genial and smiling apart from a handful of people and i mean a handful i havent trusted in or believed anyone for many years can you prove youre a royalist we can when we get there sarina looked at petersens unchanged expression and gave a helpless little shrug and know king peter at least i did as king peter is in london and london at the moment isnt taking any calls from the wehrmacht that would be rather difficult to prove from here and dont tell me you can prove it when we get to montenegro for that would be too late michael and sarina looked at each other momentarily at a loss for words then sarina said hesitatingly we dont understand when you say it would be too late too late for me if my back is full of holes bullet wounds stab wounds that sort of thing she stared at him colour staining her cheeks then said in a whisper you must be mad why on earth should we i dont know and im not mad its just by liking to live a little longer chat i manage to live a little longer petersen looked at them for several silent moments then sighed so you want to come to yugoslavia with me not really her hands were still clenched and now the brown eyes were hostile not after what youve just said she looked at her brother then at lunz then back to petersen do we have any options certainly any amount ask colonel lunz colonel not any amount very few and i wouldnt recommend any of them the whole point of the exercise is that you both get there intact and if you go by any other means the chances of your doing just that are remote if you try it on your own the chances dont exist with major petersen you have safe conduct and guaranteed delivery alive that is michael said doubt in his voice you have a great deal of confidence in major petersen i do so does major petersen he has every right to i may add its not just that he knows the country in a way neither of you ever will he moves as he pleases through any territory whether its held by friend or enemy but whats really important is that the fields of operations out there are in a state of constant flux an area held by the cetniks today can be held by the partisans tomorrow youd be like lambs in the fold when the wolves come down from the hills for the first time the girl smiled slightly and the major is another wolf more like a sabretoothed tiger and hes got two others who keep him constant company not mind you that ive ever heard of sabretoothed tigers meeting up with wolves but you take my point i hope they didnt say whether they took his point or not petersen looked at them both in turn and said those fatigues youre wearing theyre british they both nodded you have spares again they nodded in unison winter clothing heavy boots well no michael looked his embarrassment we didnt think we would need them you didnt think you would need them petersen briefly contemplated the ceiling then returned his gaze to the uncomfortable pair on the couch youre going up the mountains maybe two thousand metres in the depths of winter not to a garden party in high summer lunz said hastily i shouldnt have much trouble in arranging for these things by morning thank you colonel petersen pointed to two fairly large canvaswrapped packages on the floor your radios i take it british yes michael said latest models very tough spares lots all well ever need the experts say the experts have clearly never fallen down a ravine with a radio strapped to their backs youre britishtrained of course no american in cairo cairo is full of them this was a staff sergeant in the us marines an expert in some new codes he taught quite a few britishers at the same time seems fair enough well a little cooperation and we should get along just fine cooperation michael seemed puzzled yes if i have to give some instructions now and again i expect them to be followed instructions michael looked at his sister nobody said anything im saying something now i must express myself more clearly orders will be implicitly obeyed if not ill leave you behind in italy jettison you in the adriatic or just simply abandon you in yugoslavia i will not jeopardize my mission for a couple of disobedient children who wont do as theyre told children michael actually clenched his fists you have no right to he has every right to lunzs interruption was sharp major petersen was talking about garden parties he should have been talking about kindergartens youre young ignorant and arrogant and are correspondingly dangerous on all three counts whether youve been sworn in or not youre now members of the royal yugoslav army other rankers such as you take orders from officers they made no reply not even when petersen again regarded the ceiling and said and we ail know the penalty for the wartime disobedience of orders in lunzs staff car petersen sighed and said im afraid i didnt quite achieve the degree of rapport back there that i might have they were in a rather unhappy frame of mind when we left theyll get over it young as i said spoilt into the bargain aristocrats im told even some royal blood von karajan or something like that odd name for a yugoslav not really almost certainly from slovenia and the descendants of austrians be that as it may they come from a family thats clearly not accustomed to taking orders and even less accustomed to being talked to the way you did i daresay theyll learn very quickly i daresay they will half an hour after returning to his room petersen was joined by george and alex george said well at least we know their name so do i von karajan what else george was in no way put out the reception clerk very old but sharp told us hed no idea where theyd arrived from theyd been brought there by colonel lunz he gave us their room number no hesitation but said that if we wanted to see i hem hed have to announce us ask permission and then escort us then we asked him if either of the rooms next to i he number he had given us was vacant and when he told us those were their bedrooms we left you took your time about getting back we are accustomed to your injustices we went round to the back of the hotel climbed a fire escape and made our way along a narrow ledge a very narrow ledge no joke i can tell you especially for an old man like me perilous dizzying heights yes yes petersen was patient the von karajans had been staying on the first floor then there was a small balcony outside their room net curtains on their french windows you could see clearly and hear clearly young man was sending a radio message interesting hardly surprising though morse plain language what was he saying i have no idea could have been chinese for all i knew certainly no european language ive ever heard a very short message so we came back anyone see you on the fire escape ledge or balcony george tried to look wounded my dear peter petersen stopped him with an upraised hand not many people called him peter which was his first name but then not many people had been prewar students of georges in belgrade university where george had been the vastly respected professor of occidental languages george was known not reputed but known to be fluent in at least a dozen languages and to have a working knowledge of a considerable number more forgive me forgive me petersen surveyed georges vast bulk youre practically invisible anyway so tomorrow morning or perhaps even within minutes colonel lunz will know that you and alex have been around asking questions he would have expected nothing less of me but he wont know that young michael von karajan has been seen and heard to be sending radio messages soon after our departure i do wonder about the nature of that message george pondered briefly then said alex and i could find out on the boat tomorrow night petersen shook his head i promised colonel lunz that we would deliver them intact whats colonel lunz to us or your promise to him we want them delivered intact too george tapped his head the burden of too many years not at all george professorial absentmindedness two the wehrmacht did not believe in limousines or luxury coaches for the transportation of its allies petersen and his companions crossed italy that following day in the back of a vintage truck that gave the impression of being well enough equipped with tyres of solid rubber but sadly deficient in any form of springing the vibration was of the teethjarring order and the rattling so loud and continuous as to make conversation virtually impossible the hooped canvas covering was open at the back and at the highest point in the apennines the temperature dropped below freezing point it was in some ways a memorable journey but not for its creature comforts the stench of the diesel fumes would normally have been overpowering enough but on that particular day faded into relative insignificance compared to the aroma if that was the word given off by georges black cigars out of deference to his fellowtravellers sensibilities he had seated himself at the very rear of the truck and on the rare occasion when he wasnt smoking kept himself busy and contented enough with the contents of a crate of beer that lay at his feet he seemed immune to the cold and probably was nature had provided him with an awesome insulation the von karajans clad in their newly acquired winter clothing sat at the front of the lefthand unpadded wooden benchwithdrawn and silent they appeared no happier than when petersen had left them the previous night this could have been an understandable reaction to their current sufferings but more probably petersen thought their injured feelings had not yet had time to mend matters were not helped by the presence of alex whose totally withdrawn silence and dark bitter and brooding countenance could be all too easily misinterpreted as balefulness the von karajans were not to know that alex regarded his parents whom he held in vast respect and affection with exactly the same expression they stopped for a midday meal in a tiny village in the neighbourhood of corfinio after having safely if at times more or less miraculously negotiated the hazardous hairpin switchbacks of the apennine spine they had left rome at seven oclock that morning and it had taken over five hours to cover a hundred miles considering the incredibly dilapidated state of both the highway and the ancient wehraiacht truck unmarked as such and of italian make an average of almost twenty miles an hour was positively creditable not without difficulty for with the exception of georges the passengers limbs were stiff and almost frozen they climbed down over the tailboard and looked around them through the thinly falling snow there was miserably little to see the hamlet if it could even be called that it didnt as much as have a name consisted of a handful of stone cottages a post office store and a very small inn nearby corfinio if hardly ranking as a metropolis could have afforded considerably more in the way of comfort and amenities but colonel lunz apart from a professional nearmania for secrecy shared with his senior wehrmacht fellowofficers the common if unfair belief that all his italian allies were renegades traitors and spies until proved otherwise in the inn itself the genial host was far from being that he seemed diffident almost nervous a markedly unusual trait in mountain innkeepers a noticeably clumsy waiter civil and helpful in his own way volunteered only the fact that he was called luigi but thereafter was totally uncommunicative the inn itself was well enough both warmed and illuminated by a pine log fire in an open hearth that gave off almost as much in the way of sparks as it did heat the food was simple but plentiful and wine and beer into which george made his customary inroads appeared regularly on the table without having to be asked for socially however the meal was a disaster silence makes an uncomfortable table companion at a distant and small corner table the truck driver and his companion really an armed guard who travelled with a schmeisser under his seat and a luger concealed about his person talked almost continuously in low voices but of the five at petersens table three seemed afflicted with an almost permanent palsy of the tongue alex remote and withdrawn seemed as was his wont to be contemplating a bleak and hopeless future the von karajans who by their own admission had had no breakfast barely picked at their food had time and opportunity to talk but rarely ventured a word except when directly addressed petersen relaxed as ever restricted himself to pleasantries and civilities but otherwise showed no signs of wishing to alleviate the conversational awkwardness or indeed to be aware of it george on the other hand seemed to be acutely aware of it and did his talkative best to dispel it even to the point of garrulity his conversational gambit took the form of questions directed exclusively at the von karajans it did not take him long to elicit the fact that they were as petersen had guessed slovenians of austrian ancestry they had been to primary school in ljubljana secondary school in zagreb and thence to cairo university cairo george tried to make his eyebrows disappear into his hairline cairo what on earth induced you to go to that cultural backwater it was our parents wish michael said he tried to be cold and distant but he only succeeded in sounding defensive cairo george repeated he shook his head in slow disbelief and what may one ask did you study there you ask a lot of questions michael said interest george explained a paternal interest and of course a concern for the hapless youth of our unfortunate and disunited country for the first time sarina smiled a very faint smile it was true but enough to give some indication of what she could do if she tried i dont think such things would really interest you mrah just call me george how do you know what would interest me all things interest me economics and politics good god george clapped a hand to his forehead as a classical actor he would have starved as a ham actor he was a nonpareil good heavens girl you go to egypt to learn matters of such importance didnt they even teach you enough to make you realize that theirs is the poorest country in the middle east that their economy is not only a shambles but is in a state of total collapse and that they owe countless millions sterling dollars any currency you care to name to practically any country you care to name so much for their economy as for politics theyre no more than a political football for any country that wants to play soccer on their arid and useless desert sands george stopped briefly perhaps to admire the eloquence of his own oratory perhaps to await a response none was forthcoming so he got back to his headshaking and what one wonders did your parents have against our premier institute of learning i refer of course to the university of belgrade he paused as if in reflection one admits that oxford and cambridge have their points so for that matter does heidelberg the sorbonne padua and one or two lesser educational centres but no belgrade is best again the faint smile from sarina you seem to know a great deal about universities mr ah george george didnt smirk instead he achieved the near impossible he spoke with a lofty diffidence i have been fortunate enough for most of my adult life to be associated with academics among them some of the most eminent the von karajans looked at each other for a long moment but said nothing it was unnecessary for them to say that in their opinion any such association must have been on a strictly janitorial level they probably assumed that he had learned his mode of speech when cleaning out common rooms or it may have been while waiting on high table george gave no indication that he had noticed anything untoward but then he never did well george said in his best judicial tones far be it from me to visit the sins of the fathers upon their sons or come to that those of mothers upon their daughters abruptly he switched the subject you are royalists of course why of course michaels voice was sharp george sighed i would have hoped that that institute of lower learning on the nile hadnt driven all the native sense out of your head if you werent a royalist you wouldnt be coming with us besides major petersen told me sarina looked briefly at petersen this is the way you treat confidences i wasnt aware it was a confidence petersen gestured with an indifferent hand it was too unimportant to rate as a confidence in any event george is my confidant sarina looked at him uncertainly then lowered her eyes the rebuke could have been real implied or just imagined george said im just puzzled you see youre royalists your parents one must assume are the same its not unusual for the royal family and those close to them to send their children abroad to be educated but not to cairo to northern europe specifically to england the ties between the yugoslav and british royal families are very close especially the blood ties what place did king peter choose for his enforced exile london where he is now the prince regent prince paul is in the care of the british they say in cairo that hes a prisoner of the british michael didnt seem particularly concerned about what they said in cairo rubbish hes in protective custody in kenya hes free to come and go he makes regular withdrawals from a bank in london coutts its called it also happens to be the bank of the british royal family prince pauls closest friend in europe and his brotherinlaw is the duke of kent well he was until the duke was killed in a flyingboat accident last year and its common knowledge that very soon hes going to south africa whose general smuts is a particularly close friend of the british ah yes michael said you said youre puzzled im puzzled too this general smuts has two south african divisions in north africa fighting alongside the eighth army no yes against the germans george showed an unusual trace of irritation who else would they be fighting so our royal familys friends in north africa are fighting the germans were royalists and were fighting with the germans not against them i mean its all rather confusing im sure youre not confused again sarinas little smile petersen was beginning to wonder whether he would have to revise his first impression of her are you george no confusion george waved a dismissive hand simply a temporary measure of convenience and expediency we are fighting with the germans true but we are not fighting for them we are fighting for ourselves when the germans have served their purpose it will be time for them to be gone george refilled his beer mug drained half the contents and sighed either in satisfaction or sorrow we are consistently underestimated a major part as the rest of europe sees it of the insoluble balkan problem to me there is no problem just a goal he raised his glass again yugoslavia nobodys going to argue with that petersen said he looked at the girl speaking as george has been doing at some length of royalty you mentioned last night you knew king peter how well he was prince peter then not well at all once or twice on formal occasions thats about how it was for me i dont suppose weve exchanged more than a couple of dozen words bright lad pleasant should make a good king pity about his limp his what you know his left foot oh that yes ive wondered he doesnt talk about it all sorts of sinister stories about how he was injured all ridiculous a simple hunting accident petersen smiled i shouldnt imagine theres much of a diplomatic future for a courtier who mistakes his future sovereign for a wild boar he lifted his eyes and right arm at the same time the innkeeper came hurrying towards him the bill if you please the bill momentarily the innkeeper gave the impression of being surprised even taken aback ah the bill of course the bill at once he hurried off petersen looked at the von karajans sorry you didnt have a better appetite you know stoked the furnaces for the last part of the trip still its downhill now all the way and were heading for the adriatic and a maritime climate should be getting steadily warmer oh no it wont it was the first time alex had spoken since they had entered the inn and predictably it was in tones of dark certainty its almost an hour since we came in here and the wind has got stronger much stronger listen and you can hear it they listened they heard it a deep lowpitched ululating moaning that boded no good at all alex shook his head gravely an eastnortheaster all the way from siberia its going to be very cold his voice sounded full of gloomy satisfaction but it meant nothing it was the only way he knew how to talk and when the sun goes down its going to be very very cold jobs comforter petersen said he looked at the bill the innkeeper had brought handed over some notes waved away the proffered change and said do you think we could buy some blankets from you blankets the innkeeper frowned in some puzzlement it was after all an unusual request blankets weve a long way to go theres no heating in our transport and the afternoon and evening are going to be very cold there will be no problem the innkeeper disappeared and was back literally within a minute with an armful of heavy coloured woollen blankets which he deposited on a nearby empty table those will be sufficient more than sufficient most kind of you petersen produced money how much please blankets the innkeeper lifted his hands in protest i am not a shopkeeper i do not charge for blankets but you must i insist blankets cost money please the truck driver had left his table and approached them i shall be passing back this way tomorrow i shall bring them with me petersen thanked them and so it was arranged alex followed by the von karajans helped the innkeeper carry the blankets out to the truck petersen and george lingered briefly in the porch closing both the inner and outer doors you really are the most fearful liar george petersen said admiringly cunning devious ive said it before i dont think id care to be interrogated by you you ask a question and whether people say yes no or nothing at all you still get your answer when youve spent twentyfive of the best years of your life dealing with dimwitted students george shrugged as if there were no more to say im not a dimwitted student but i still wouldnt care for it you have formed an opinion about our young friends i have so have i ive also formed another opinion about them and that is that while michael is no intellectual giant the girl could bear watching i think she could be clever ive often observed this with brother and sister especially when theyre twins i share your opinion lovely and clever petersen smiled a dangerous combination not if shes nice ive no reason to think shes not nice youre just middleaged and susceptible the innkeeper apprehensive and unhappy he doesnt look like a man who should be apprehensive and unhappy he looks a big tough character who would be perfectly at home throwing big tough drunks out of his inn also he seemed caught offbalance when you offered to pay for the meal one got the unmistakable impression that there are some travellers who do not pay for their meals also his refusal to accept money for the blankets was out of character out of character for an italian i mean for ive never known of an italian who wasnt ready eager rather to make a deal on some basis or other peter my friend wouldnt even you be slightly nervous if you worked for or were forced to work for the german ss colonel lunz casts a long shadow the waiter the gestapo have fallen in my estimation when they send in an espionage agent in the guise of a waiter they should at least give him some training in the rudiments of tablewaiting i felt positively embarrassed for him george paused then went on you were talking about king peter a few minutes ago you introduced that subject thats irrelevant and dont hedge as a departmental head in the university i was regarded and rightly as being a man of culture prince paul was nothing if not a man of culture although his interests lay more in the world of art than in philology never mind we met quite a few times either in the university or at royal functions in the city more to the point i saw prince peter as he was then two or three times he didnt have a limp in those days he still doesnt george looked at him then nodded slowly and you called me devious petersen opened the outer door and clapped him on the shoulder we live in devious times george the second half of the trip was an improvement on the first but just marginally cocooned as they were to the ears in heavy blankets the von karajans were no longer subject to involuntary bouts of shivering and teethchattering but otherwise looked no happier and were no more communicative than they had been in the morning which meant that they were both totally miserable and silent they didnt even speak when george shouting to make himself heard above the fearful mechanical din offered them brandy to relieve their sufferings sarina shuddered and michael shook his head they may have been wise for what george was offering them was no french cognac but his own nearlethal form of slivovitz his native plum brandy some twelve kilometres from pescara they bore right off the route near chieti reaching the adriatic coast road at francavilla as a premature dusk was falling premature because of gathering banks of dark grey cloud which alex inevitably said could only presage heavy snow the coastal road route was an improvement over the apennines road it could hardly have failed to be otherwise and the relatively comfortable though still cacophonous ride to termoli took no more than two hours wartime termoli on a winters night was no place to inspire a rhapsody in the heart of the poet or composer the only feelings it could reasonably expect to give rise to were gloom and depression it was grey bleak bare grimy and seemingly uninhabitated except for a very few halfheartedly blackedout premises which were presumably cafes or taverns the port area itself however was an improvement on rome here was no blackout just a dimout which probably didnt vary appreciably from the normal as the truck stopped along a wharfside there was more than enough light from the shaded yellow overhead lamps to distinguish the lines of the craft alongside the wharf their transport to yugoslavia that it was a motor torpedo boat was beyond question its vintage was uncertain what was certain was that it had been in the wars it had sustained considerable though not incapacitating damage to both hull and superstructure no attempt had been made at repair noone had even thought it worthwhile to repaint the numerous dents and scars that pockmarked its side it carried no torpedoes for the sufficient reason that the torpedo tubes had been removed nor had it depthcharges for even the depthcharge racks had been removed the only armament if such it could be called that it carried was a pair of insignificant little guns singlebarrelled one mounted forard of the bridge the other on the poop they looked suspiciously like hotchkiss repeaters one of the most notoriously inaccurate weapons ever to find its mistaken way into naval service a tall man in a vaguely naval uniform was standing on the wharfside at the head of the mtbs gangway he wore a peaked badgeless naval cap which shaded his face but could not conceal his marked stoop and splendid snowwhite buffalo bill beard he raised his hand in halfgreeting halfsalute as petersen the others following close behind approached him good evening my name is pietro you must be the major we are expecting good evening and yes and four companions one a lady good you are welcome aboard i will send someone for your luggage in the meantime it is the commanding officers wish that you see him as soon as you arrive they followed him below and into a compartment that could have been the captains cabin a chartroom an officers messroom and was probably all three space is at a premium on mtbs the captain was seated at his desk writing as pietro entered without benefit of knocking he swung round in his swivelchair which was firmly bolted to the deck as pietro stood to one side and said your latest guests carlos the major and the four friends we were promised come in come in come in thank you pietro send that young ruffian along will you when hes finished loading the luggage thatll do pietro left the captain was a broadshouldered young man with thick curling black hair a deep tan very white teeth a warm smile and warm brown eyes he said im lieutenant giancarlo tremino call me carlos nearly everyone else does no discipline left in the navy he shook his head and indicated his white polo neck jersey and grey flannel trousers why wear uniform noone pays any attention to it anyway he extended his hand his left hand to petersen major you are very welcome i cannot offer you queen mary type accommodation peacetime accommodation that is but we have a very few small cabins washing and toilet facilities lots of wine and can guarantee safe transit to ploce the guarantee is based on the fact that we have been to the dalmatian coast many times and havent been sunk yet always a first time of course but i prefer to dwell on happier things you are very kind petersen said if its to be first name terms then mine is peter he introduced the other four each by their first name carlos acknowledged each introduction with a handshake and smile but made no attempt to rise he was quick to explain this seeming discourtesy and quite unembarrassed about doing so i apologize for remaining seated im not really illmannered or lazy or averse to physical exertion he moved his right arm and for the first time brought his glovesheathed right hand into view he bent and tapped his right hand against his right leg about halfway between knee and ankle the unmistakable sound of hollow metal meeting hollow metal made the onlookers wince he straightened and tapped the tips of his left fingers against the back of his right glove the sound was against unmistakable although different flesh meeting metal those metal appliances take some getting used to carlos was almost apologetic unnecessary movement well any movement causes discomfort and who likes discomfort i am not the noblest roman of them all sarina gnawed her lower lip michael tried to look as if he werent shocked but was the other three with eighteen months of vicious and bitter warfare in the yugoslav mountains behind them predictably showed no reaction petersen said right hand right leg thats quite a handicap just the right foot really blown off at the ankle handicap have you heard of the english fighter pilot who got both legs destroyed did he shout for a bathchair he shouted to get back into the cockpit of his spitfire or whatever he did too handicap i know of him most people do how did you come by those two um trifling scratches perfidious albion carlos said cheerfully nasty horrible british never trust them to think they used to be my best friends before the war sailed with them in the adriatic and the channel raced against them at cowes well never mind we were in the aegean going as the lawyers say about our lawful occasions and bothering noone dawn lots of heavy mist about when suddenly less than two kilometres away this great big british warship appeared through a gap in the mist carlos paused perhaps for effect and petersen said mildly it was my understanding that the british never risked their capital ships north of crete size like beauty is in the eye of the beholder it was in fact a very small frigate but to us you understand it looked like a battleship we werent ready for them but they were ready for us they had their guns already trained on us no fault of ours we had four men not counting myself on lookout they must have had radar we had none their first two shells struck the water only a few metres from our port side and exploded on contact didnt do our hull much good i can tell you two other light shells about a kilo each i should think pompoms the british call them scored direct hits one penetrated the engineroom and put an engine out of action regret to say its still out of action but we can get by without it and the other came into the wheelhouse a kilo of explosives going off in a confined space is not very nice petersen said you were not alone two others they were not as lucky as i was then i had more luck we ran into a fog bank carlos shrugged thats all the past is past a knock came at the door a very young sailor entered stood at attention saluted and said you sent for me captain indeed we have guests pietro tired thirsty guests right away captain the boy saluted and left petersen said whats all this you were saying about no discipline carlos smiled give him time hes been with us for only a month george looked puzzled he is a truant from school no hes older than he looks well at least three months older quite an age span you have aboard petersen said the elder pietro he cant be a day under seventy hes a great number of days over seventy carlos laughed the world seemed to be a source of constant amusement to him a socalled captain with only two out of four functioning limbs a beardless youth an old age pensioner what a crew just wait till you see the rest of them petersen said the past is past you say accepted one may ask a question about the present carlos nodded why havent you been retired invalided out of the navy or at very least given some sort of shore job why are you still on active service active service carlos laughed again highly inactive service the moment we run into anything resembling action i hand in my commission you saw the two light guns we have mounted fore and aft it was just pride that made me keep them there theyll never be used for either attack or defence for the perfectly adequate reason that neither works this is a very undemanding assignment and i do have one modest qualification for it i was born and brought up in pescara where my father had a yacht more than one i spent my boyhood and the ridiculously long university vacations sailing around the mediterranean and europe for part of the time but mainly off the yugoslav coast the adriatic coast of italy is dull and uninteresting with not an island worth mentioning between bari and venice the thousand and one dalmatian islands are a paradise for the cruising yachtsman i know them better than i know the streets of pescara or termoli the admiralty finds this useful on a black night petersen said no lighthouses no lit buoys no landbased navigational aids if i required those i wouldnt be much use to the admiralty would i ah help is at hand it took young pietro an heroic effort not to stagger under the weight of his burden a verticallysided flatbottomed wicker basket holding the far from humble nucleus of a small but wellstocked bar in addition to spirits wines and liqueurs pietro had even gone to the length of providing a soda syphon and a small icebucket pietro hasnt yet graduated to bartender and ive no intention of leaving this chair carlos said help yourselves please thank you pietro ask our two passengers to join us at their convenience the boy saluted and left two other yugoslavbound passengers i dont know their business as i dont know yours you dont know theirs and they dont know yours ships that pass in the night but such ships exchange recognition signals courtesy of the high seas petersen gestured at the basket from which george was already helping the von karajans to orange juice another courtesy of the high seas lessens the rigours of total war i must say my feeling exactly no thanks i may say to our admiralty who are as stingy as admiralties the world over some of the supplies come from my fathers wine cellars they would have your threestar sommeliers in raptures i can tell you some are gifts from foreign friends kruskovac george touched a bottle grappa pelinkovac stara sljivovica two excellent vintages from the neretva delta your foreign friends all from yugoslavia our hospitable and considerate young friend pietro clairvoyant he thinks we go to yugoslavia or has he been informed suspicion one would suppose is part of your stockintrade i dont know what pietro thinks i dont even know if he can think he hasnt been informed he knows carlos sighed the romance and glamour of the cloakanddagger sealedorders missions are not im afraid for us search termoli and you might find a person who is deaf dumb and blind although i much doubt it if you did he or she would be the only person in termoli who doesnt know that the colombo thats the name of this crippled greyhound plies a regular and so far highly dependable ferryservice to the yugoslav coast if its any consolation im the only person who knows where were going unless of course one of you has talked he poured himself a small scotch your health gentlemen and yours young lady we dont talk much about such things but about other things im afraid i talk too much george sounded sad but at once refuted himself university eh some kind of marine school some kind of medical school medical school with the air of a man treating himself for shock george poured some more grappa dont tell me youre a doctor im not telling you anything but i have a paper that says so petersen waved a hand then why this well you might ask momentarily carlos sounded as sad as george had done the italian navy any navy take a highly skilled mechanic obvious material for an equally highly skilled engineroomartificer what does he become a cook a cordon bleu chef a gunner he waved his hand much as petersen had done so in their allknowing wisdom they gave me this dr tremino ferryman first class considering the state of the ferry make that second class come in come in a knock had come on the door the young woman who stepped over the low coaming she could have been anything between twenty and thirtyfive was of medium height slender and dressed in a jersey jacket and skirt all in blue palecomplexioned without a trace of makeup she was grave and unsmiling her hair was black as night and swooped low like a ravens wing over the left forehead quite obscuring the left eyebrow the pockmarking for such it seemed to be high up on the left cheekbone served only to accentuate not diminish the classical timeless beauty of the features twenty years on just as conceivably thirty she would still be as beautiful as she was at that moment nor it seemed certain would time ever change the appearance of the man who followed her into the cabin but the sculpted perfection of features had nothing to do with this a tall solidly built fairhaired character he was irredeemably ugly nature had had no hand in this from the evidence offered by ears cheeks chin nose and teeth he had been in frequent and violent contact with a variety of objects both blunt and razoredged in the course of what must have been a remarkably chequered career it was withal an attractive face largely because of the genuine warmth of his smile as with carlos an almost irrepressible cheerfulness was never far from the surface this carlos said is lorraine and giacomo he introduced petersen and the other four in turn lorraines voice was soft and low in tone and timbre remarkably like that of sarina giacomos predictably was neither soft nor low and his handclasp fearsome except when it came to sarina her fingers he took in his finger and thumb and gallantly kissed the back of her hand such a gesture from such a man should have appeared both affected and stagey oddly enough it did neither sarina didnt seem to think so either she said nothing just smiled at him the first genuine smile petersen had seen from her it came as no surprise that her teeth would have been a dentists delight or despair depending upon whether aesthetic or financial considerations were uppermost in his mind help yourselves carlos gestured to the wicker basket giacomo leaving no doubt that he was decisive both as to cast of mind and action needed no second urging he poured a glass of pellegrino for lorraine evidence enough that this was not the first time he had met her and that she shared the von karajans aversion towards alcohol and then halffilled a tumbler with scotch topping it up with water he took a seat and beamed around the company health to all he raised his brimming glass and confusion to our enemies any particular enemies carlos said it would take too long giacomo tried to look sad but failed i have too many he drank deeply to his own toast you have called us to a conference captain carlos conference giacomo goodness me no it didnt require any great deductive powers petersen reflected to realize that those two had met before and not just that day why should i hold a conference my job is to get you where youre going and you cant help me in that after you land cant help you in whatever youre going to do nothing to confer about as a ferryman im a great believer in introductions people in your line of business are apt to react overquickly if rightly or wrongly they sense danger in meeting an unknown on a dark deck at night no such danger now and there are three things i want to mention briefly first accommodation lorraine and giacomo have a cabin each if you can call something the size of a telephone box a cabin only fair first come first served i have two other cabins one for three one for two he looked at michael you and yes sarina are brother and sister who told you michael probably didnt mean to sound truculent but his nervous system had suffered from his encounter with petersen and his friends and that was the way it came out carlos lowered his head briefly looked up and said not smiling the good lord gave me eyes and they say twins no problem giacomo bowed towards the embarrassed girl the young lady will do me the honour of switching cabins with me she smiled and nodded you are very kind second food you could eat aboard but i dont recommend it giovanni cooks only under duress and protest i dont blame him hes our engineer everything that comes out of that galley even the coffee tastes and smells of oil theres a passable cafe close by well barely passable but they do know me he halfsmiled at the two women in turn it will be a hardship and a sacrifice but i think ill join you third youre free to go ashore whenever you wish although i cant imagine why anyone should want to go ashore on a night like this except of course to escape giovannis cooking there are police patrols but then enthusiasm usually drops with the temperature if you do run into any just say youre from the colombo the worst that can happen is that theyll escort you back here to check i think ill take my chance on both weather and the police petersen said advancing years or too many hours in that damned truck or maybe both but im as stiff as a board back inside an hour please then well leave for the meal he looked at the bulkhead clock we should be back at ten we sail at one oclock in the morning not till then michael looked his astonishment why thats hours away why dont we we sail at am carlos was patient but the winds getting stronger it must be rough now itll be getting rougher it will not be too comfortable are you a bad sailor michael the words were sympathetic the expression not no yes i dont know i dont see i mean i cant understand michael it was petersen his voice gentle it really doesnt matter what you cant see or cant understand lieutenant tremino is the captain the captain makes the decisions noone ever questions the captain its very simple really it was noticeable that carlos spoke to petersen not michael the garrison that guard such port installations as they have at ploce are not firstline troops as soldiers go they are either superannuated or very very young in both cases theyre nervous and triggerhappy and the fact that they have radio notification of my arrival seems to have no effect on them experience and a few lucky escapes have taught me that the wisest thing is to arrive at sunrise so that even the most rheumy eyes can see that the gallant captain tremino is flying the biggest italian flag in the adriatic the wind as michael had said had indeed strengthened and was bitingly cold but petersen and his two companions were not exposed to it for long for georges homing instinct was unerring the tavern in which they fetched up was no more or less dingy than any other dockside tavern and it was at least warm a very short stroll for such stiff legs george observed nothing wrong with my legs i just wanted to talk what was wrong with our cabin carlos has more wine and grappa and slivovitz than he can possibly use colonel lunz as weve said has a long arm ah so a bug would you put anything past him this could be awkward alas im afraid i know what you mean i dont alex wore his suspicious expression carlos petersen said i know him rather i know who he is i knew his father a retired naval captain but on the reserve list almost certainly on the active list now a cruiser captain or such he became a reserve italian naval captain at the same time as my father became a reserve yugoslav army colonel both men loved the sea and both men set up chandlers businesses both were highly successful inevitably almost their paths crossed and they became very good friends they met frequently usually in trieste and i was with them on several occasions photographs were taken carlos may well have seen them if he has seen them george said let it be our pious hope that the ravages of time and the dissipation of years make it difficult for carlos to identify major petersen with the carefree youth of yesteryear alex said why is it so important i have known colonel petersen for many years george said unlike his son he is or was a very outspoken man ah a pity about carlos a great pity george sounded and may well have been profoundly sad an eminently likeable young man and you can say the same about giacomo except of course not so young an excellent pair to have by ones side one would have thought in moments of trouble and strife which are the only ones we seem to have he shook his head where oh where are my ivory towers you should be grateful for this touch of realism george exactly the counterbalance you academics need what do you make of giacomo an italian counterpart of the british commando giacomo has been savagely beaten up or savagely tortured or perhaps both at the same time commando material unquestionably but not italian montenegrin montenegrin you know montenegro george on occasion was capable of elaborate sarcasm an unfortunate gift honed and refined by a lifetime in the groves of academe a province in our native yugoslavia with that fair hair and impeccable italian fair hair is not unknown in montenegro and though his italian is very good the accent overlay is unmistakable petersen didnt doubt him for a moment georges ear for languages dialects accents and nuances of accent was in philological circles a byword far beyond the balkans the evening meal was more than passable the cafe more than presentable carlos was not only known there as he had said but treated with some deference lorraine spoke only occasionally and then to noone except carlos who sat beside her she too had it seemed been born in pescara predictably neither alex nor michael nor sarina contributed a word to the conversation but that didnt matter both carlos and petersen were relaxed and easy talkers but even that didnt matter very much when giacomo and george were in full cry more often than not at the same time even the possibility of a conversational hiatus seemed preposterous both men talked a great deal without saying anything at all on the way back to the ship they had to face not only a perceptibly stronger wind but a thinly driving snow carlos who had drunk little enough was not so sure on his feet as he thought or more likely would have others think after the second stumble he was seen to be walking arm in arm with lorraine who had taken whose arm could only be guessed at when they arrived at the gangway the colombo was rocking perceptibly at its moorings the harbour swell responsible bespoke much worse conditions outside to petersens surprise and an illconcealed irritation that amounted almost to anger five more men were awaiting their arrival down below their leader who was introduced as alessandro and for whom carlos showed an unusual degree of respect was a tall thin greyhaired man with a beaked nose bloodless lips and only the rudimentary vestiges of eyebrows three of his four men all about half his age were introduced as franco cola and sepp which names were presumably abbreviations for francesco nicholas and giuseppe the fourth was called guido like their leader they wore nondescript civilian clothes like their leader they gave the distinct impression that they would have been much happier in uniform like their leader they had cold hard expressionless faces petersen glanced briefly at george turned and left the cabin george following with alex inevitably close behind petersen had barely begun to speak when carlos appeared in the passageway and walked quickly towards them you are upset major petersen no peter the trace of anxiety was faint but it was there im unhappy it is true as i told michael that one never questions the captains decisions but this is a different matter entirely i take it those men are also passengers to ploce carlos nodded where are they sleeping we have a dormitory for five in the bows i did not think that worth mentioning any more than i thought their arrival worth mentioning i am also unhappy at the fact that rome gave me the distinct impression that we would be travelling alone i did not bargain for the fact that we would be travelling with five seven now people who are totally unknown to me i am unhappy about the fact that you know them or at least alessandro carlos made to speak but petersen waved him to silence im sure you wouldnt think me such a fool as to deny it its just not in your nature to show a deference amounting almost to apprehension towards a total stranger finally im unhappy about the fact that they have the appearance of being a bunch of hired professional assassins tough ruthless killers they are of course nothing of the kind they only think they are which is why i use the word appearance their only danger lies in their lack of predictability for your true assassin no such word as unpredictability exists in his vocabulary he does precisely what he intends to do and it is to be borne in mind when it comes to the far from gentle art of premeditated and authorized murder your true assassin never never never looks like one you seem to know a lot about assassins carlos smiled faintly i could be speaking to three of them preposterous george was incapable of snorting but he came close giacomo then one is left with the impression that giacomo is a oneman panzer division petersen said coldblooded stealth is not his forte he doesnt even begin to qualify you should know you know him much better than we do what makes you say that because acting isnt your forte so our school drama teacher said lorraine youre mad george spoke with conviction he doesnt mean you are petersen smiled just the suggestion classically beautiful women almost never have gentle eyes carlos confirmed what seemed to be the growing opinion that he was indeed no actor he was pleased and not obscurely he said if youre unhappy then i apologize for that although i really dont know why im apologizing i have orders to carry out and its my duty to follow orders beyond that i know nothing he still wasnt a very good actor petersen thought but there was nothing to be gained in saying so wont you come back to my cabin three hours before we sail yet ample time for a nightcap or two alessandro and his men as you say arent so ferocious as they look thank you petersen said but no i think well just take a turn on the upper deck and then retire so well say goodnight now the upper deck this weather youll freeze cold is an old friend of ours i prefer other company but as you wish gentlemen he reached out a steadying hand as the colombo lurched sharply a rather rough passage tonight im afraid torpedo boats may have their good points i may find one some day but they are rather less than seakindly i hope you are also on friendly terms with father neptune our next of kin george said that apart i can promise you a quiet and uneventful trip never had a mutiny yet in the lee of the superstructure petersen said well well george said heavily all is not well seven total strangers aboard this boat and the worthy young carlos seems to know all seven of them every mans hand against us not of course that thats anything new the tip of his nauseous cigar glowed redly in the gloom would it be naive of me to wonder whether or not our good friend colonel lunz is acquainted with the passenger list of the colombo yes we are of course prepared for all eventualities certainly which ones did you have in mind none we take turns to keep watch in our cabin of course if we stay in our cabin ah we have a plan we have no plan what do you think about lorraine charming speak unhesitatingly a delightful young lady ive told you before george about your advanced years and susceptibility that wasnt what i meant her presence aboard puzzles me i cant see that she belongs in any way to this motley bunch that carlos is transporting to ploce motley eh first time ive ever been called motley how does she differ because every other passenger on this vessel is up to no good or i strongly suspect them of being up to no good i suspect her of nothing my word george spoke in tones of what were meant to be genuine awe that makes her unique carlos let us know he could have been at pains to let us know that she too came from pescara do you think she comes frompescara george how the devil should i tell she could come from timbuktu for all i know you disappoint me george or wilfully misunderstand me i shall be patient your unmatched command of the nuances of all those european languages was she born or brought up in pescara neither but she is italian no so were back in yugoslavia again maybe you are im not im in england what england the overlay of what it pleases the british broadcasting corporation to call southern standard english is unmistakable george coughed modestly his smugness could occasionally verge on the infuriating to the trained ear of course three both alex and carlos had made predictions and both had turned out to be wrong or in alexs case half wrong he had said gloomily and accurately that it was going to be very very cold and at three am that morning none of the passengers on the colombo would have disagreed with him the driving snow so heavy as to reduce visibility to virtually zero had an uncommonly chilling effect on the torpedo boat which would have been of no concern to those in an adequately centralheated boat but on this particular one the centralheating unit as became practically everything else aboard was functioning at about only onethird degree efficiency and moreover had been of a pathetically ancient design in the first place so that for the shivering passengers and crew the snow had become a matter for intense concern alex had been wrong even if only slightly and what he had said had been a statement really not a fact when he spoke of an eastnortheast wind it was a northeast wind to a layman or indeed anybody not aboard an elderly torpedo boat a paltry twentythree degree difference in wind direction might seem negligible to a person actually aboard such a boat the difference is crucial marking as it did for those with inbuilt queasiness the borderline between the uncomfortable and the intolerable had the colombo been headon to wind and seas the pitching would have been uncomfortable had the seas been on the beam the rolling would have been even more uncomfortable but that night with the seas two points off the port bow the resultant wicked corkscrewing was for the less fortunate the last straw for some people aboard the torpedo boat that night the degree of seasickness ranged from the unpleasant to the acute carlos had predicted that the trip would be quiet and uneventful at least two people both at least outwardly immune to the effects of sea and cold did not share carlos confidence the door to the bosuns store which lay to the port hand of the stairway leading down to the engineroom had been hooked open and petersen and alex standing two feet back in the unlit store were only dimly visible there was just enough light to see that alex was carrying a semiautomatic machinepistol while petersen using one hand to steady himself on the lurching deck had the other in his coat pocket petersen had long ago learned that with alex by his side when confronting minimal forces it was quite superfluous for him to carry a weapon of any kind their little cabin almost directly opposite them on the starboard side of the ill but sufficiently lit passageway had its door closed george petersen knew was still behind that door and george petersen also knew would be as wide awake as themselves petersen looked at his luminous watch for just over ninety minutes he and alex had been on station with no signs of weariness or boredom or awareness of the cold and certainly with no signs of their relaxed vigilance weakening at any time a hundred times they had waited thus on the bleak and often icy mountains of bosnia and serbia and montenegro most commonly for much longer periods than this and always they had survived but that night was going to be one of their shorter and more comfortable vigils it was in the ninetythird minute that two men appeared at the forard end of the passageway they moved swiftly aft crouched low as if making a stealthy approach an attempt in which they were rather handicapped by being flung from bulkhead to bulkhead with every lurch of the colombo they had tried to compensate for this by removing their boots no doubt to reduce the noise level of their approach a rather ludicrous tactic in the circumstances because the torpedo boat was banging and crashing about to such a high decibel extent that they could have marched purposefully along in hobnailed boots without anyone being any way the wiser each had a pistol stuck in his belt more ominously each carried in his right hand an object that looked suspiciously like a handgrenade they were franco and cola and neither was looking particularly happy that their expressions were due to the nature of the errand on hand or to twinges of conscience petersen did not for a moment believe quite simply neither had been born with the call of the sea in his ear and from the lack of colour in their strained faces both would have been quite happy never to hear it again on the logical assumption that alessandro would have picked his two fittest young lieutenants for the job on hand petersen thought their appearance didnt say too much for the condition of those who had been left behind their cabin was right up in the bows of the vessel and in a corkscrewing sea that was the place to be avoided above all they halted outside the door behind which george was lurking and looked at each other petersen waited until the boat was on even keel bringing with it a comparative if brief period of silence dont move franco at least had some sense he didnt move cola on the other hand amply demonstrated petersens assertion that they werent hired assassins but only tried to look like ones by dropping his grenade he had to be righthanded reaching for his pistol and swinging round all in what he plainly hoped was one swift coordinated movement for a man like alex it was a scene in pathetically slow motion cola had just cleared the pistol from his left waistband when alex fired just once the sound of the shot shockingly loud in the metallic confines cola dropped his gun looked uncomprehendingly at his shattered right shoulder then back to the bulkhead he slid to the deck in a sitting position they never learn alex said gloomily alex was not one to derive childish pleasure from such childishly simply exercises maybe hes never had the chance to learn petersen said he relieved franco of his armoury and had just picked up colas pistol and grenade when george appeared in the cabin doorway he too carried a weapon but had had no expectation of using it he held his semiautomatic loosely by the stock its muzzle pointing towards the deck he shook his head just once resignedly but said nothing petersen said mind our backs george you are going to return those unfortunates to the bosom of their family petersen nodded a christian act theyre not fit to be out alone petersen and alex moved back up the passageway preceded by franco and cola the former supporting his stricken comrade they had taken only four steps when a door on the port side just aft of where george was standing opened and giacomo stepped out into the passageway brandishing a beretta put that thing away george said his machinepistol was still pointing at the deck dont you think there has been enough noise already thats why im here giacomo had already lowered his gun the noise i mean took your time didnt you i had to get dressed first giacomo said with some dignity he was clad only in a pair of khaki trousers displaying a tanned chest rather impressively crisscrossed with scars but i notice you are fully dressed so i take it you were expecting whatever did happen he looked in the direction of the quartet making their slow way along the passageway what exactly did happen alex has just shot cola good for alex if giacomo was moved by the news he hid it well hardly worth wakening a man for cola might view matters differently george coughed delicately you are not then one of them you must be mad not really i dont know any of you do i but you dont look like them youre very kind george and now we wont find out just by standing here they caught up with the others in just a matter of seconds which was easily enough done as the now moaning cola could barely drag his feet along a moment afterwards a door at the forard end of the passageway opened and an armed figure came or lurched into view it was sepp and he wasnt looking at all like the ruthless killer of a few hours ago it required no imagination to see the slightly greenish pallor on his face for slightly green he indisputably was time and the seaway had wrought its effect it was not difficult to understand why alessandro had selected franco and cola for the mission sepp petersens tone was almost kindly we have no wish to kill you before you can reach us you would have to kill your two friends franco and cola that would be bad enough wouldnt it sepp from sepps pallorand general demeanour of uncertainty it seemed that for him things were quite bad enough as they were even worse sepp before you could get around to killing the second of your friends you yourself would be dead drop that gun sepp whatever other parts of sepps physiology were in a state of temporary dysfunction there was nothing wrong with his hearing his elderly lee enfieid clattered to the deck who fired that shot carlos his habitual smile in momentary abeyance had come limping up behind them a pistol in hand what goes on it would help if you could tell us petersen looked at the gun in carlos hand you dont require that i require it as long as i am the master of this vessel i asked he broke off with an exclamation of pain as georges massive hand closed over his gunwrist he struggled to free his hand an expression of incomprehension spread over his face and he bit his lips as if to hold back another cry of pain george removed the gun from the suddenly nerveless fingers so thats it carlos said his face not without reason was pale so i was right you are the assassins it is your intention to take over my vessel perhaps goodness gracious no it was george who answered your forefinger has gone white at the knuckles precipitate action isnt going to help anyone he handed the pistol back to carlos and went on pontifically unnecessary violence never helped anyone carlos took the pistol hesitated stuck it in his waistband and began to massage his right wrist the demonstration of pacific intentions had had an unsettling effect he said uncertainly i still dont understand neither do we carlos petersen said neither do we thats what were trying to do at this moment understand perhaps you could help us those two men franco and cola cola im afraid is going to require your peacetime professional skills quite soon came to attack us perhaps they came to kill us but i dont think so they bungled it amateurs george said by way of explanation amateurs agreed but the effect of an amateur bullet can be just as permanent as a professional one i want to know why those two came for us in the first place perhaps you can help explain this carlos how should i be able to help you because you know alessandro i do but not well i have no idea why he should seek to do you harm i do not permit my passengers to carry out guerrilla warfare im sure you dont but im equally sure that you know who alessandro is and what he does i dont know i dont believe you i suppose i should sigh and say how much trouble it would save all round if you were to tell the truth not of course that you are telling lies youre just not telling anything well if you dont help us ill just have to help myself petersen raised his voice alessandro seconds passed without reply alessandro i have three of your men prisoner one of them badly injured i want to know why those men came to attack us alessandro made no reply and petersen went on you dont leave me any option in wartime people are either friends or enemies friends are friends and enemies die if youre a friend step out into the passageway if youre not then youll just have to stay there and die petersen didnt show any particular emotion but his tone sounded implacable enough carlos his pain forgotten laid a hand on petersens forearm people dont commit murder aboard my ship havent committed and murder is for peacetime in wartime we call it execution for those listening inside the cabin the tone of his voice could have lent little encouragement george alex help franco and sepp into the cabin keep out of any line of fire franco and sepp didnt need any kind of helping execution chamber or not they couldnt get inside it fast enough the door banged shut arid a watertight clip came down petersen examined the pearshaped object in his hand carlos said apprehensively whats that you can see a handgrenade of sorts george george didnt need telling what to do he never did he took up position by the cabin door his hand reaching up for the closed watertight clip with one hand petersen took a grip on the door handle with the other he pressed a lever on the bottom of the grenade as he glanced at george who immediately opened the clip petersen jerked open the door the requisite few inches dropped the grenade inside and banged shut the door as george closed the clip again they could have rehearsed it a hundred times jesus carlos face was white in that confined space he stopped his face puzzled now and said the explosion the bang gasgrenades dont go bang they go hiss reactions george george had taken his hand away from the clip five seconds and then whoever it was gave up quickacting stuff is it not carlos was still almost distraught whats the difference explosives or poison gas petersen spoke with patience it was not poison gas george he spoke a few words in the ear of his giant lieutenant who smiled and moved quickly aft petersen turned to carlos is it your intention to let your friend cola die hes not my friend and hes in no danger of dying he turned to the elder pietro who had just arrived on the scene get my medicine box and bring along two of your boys to petersen he said ill give a sedative a knockout one then a coagulant a few minutes later and ill bandage him up therell be a broken bone or bones it may be that his shoulder is shattered beyond repair but whatever it is theres nothing i can do about it in this seaway he glanced aft crossed his hand over his forehead and looked as if he would like to moan more trouble michael von karajan was approaching them closely followed by george michael was trying to look indignant and truculent but succeeded only in looking miserable and frightened george was beaming by heavens major theres nothing wrong with this new generation of ours youhave to admire their selfless spirit here we are with the good ship colombo trying to turn somersaults but does that stop our michael hi the polishing of his skills not a bit of it there he was crouched over his transceiver in this appalling weather headphones clamped over his ears petersen held up his hand when he spoke his face was as cold as his voice is this true von karajan no what i mean is youre a liar if george says its true its true what message were you sending i wasnt sending any message i george he wasnt transmitting any message when i arrived he would hardly have had time to giacomo said not between the time i left our cabin and when george got there he eyed the now visibly shaking michael with open distaste hes not only a coward hes a fool how was he to know that i wasnt going to return at any moment why didnt he lock his door to make sure that he wasnt disturbed petersen said what message were you going to transmit i wasnt going to transmit any that makes you doubly a liar who were you transmitting to or about to transmit to i wasnt going to oh do be quiet that makes you three times a liar george confiscate his equipment foe good measure confiscate his sisters as well you cant do that michael was aghast take away our radios theyre our equipment good god in heaven petersen stared at him in disbelief whether the disbelief were real or affected didnt matter the effect was the same im your commanding officer you young fool i can not only lock up your equipment i can lock you up too on charges of mutiny in irons if need be petersen shook his head cant he says cant another thing von karajan can it be that youre so stupid as not to know that in wartime at sea the use of radio by unauthorized personnel is a very serious offence he turned to carlos is that not so captain tremino petersens use of formal terms lent to his enquiry all the gravity of a courtmartial very much so im afraid carlos wasnt too happy to say it but he said it all the same is this young fellow authorized personnel no you see how it is von karajan the captain would also be justified in locking you up george put the sets in our cabin no wait a minute this is primarily a naval offence he looked at carlos do you think i have a very adequate safe in the office carlos said and i have the only key splendid george moved off a disconsolate michael trailing behind him passing by pietro bearing a black metal box and accompanied by two seamen carlos opened the medicine chest it appeared to be immaculately equipped and administered two injections to the hapless cola the box was closed and removed so was cola well now petersen said lets see what we have inside alex not without considerable effort managed to free the watertight clip when george heaved a watertight clip home it tended to stay heaved then levelled his machinepistol on the door giacomo did the same with his pistol clearly demonstrating that whoevers side if any he was on it clearly was not that of alessandro and his henchmen petersen didnt bother about any weapon although he had a luger on his person he just pushed the door open the guns were unnecessary the four men were not unconscious but on the other hand they werent very conscious either although they would be very soon no coughing no spluttering no tears running down their cheeks they were just slightly dazed slightly woozy slightly apathetic alex laid down his machinepistol collected the several weapons that were lying around then searched the four men thoroughly coming up with two more handguns and no fewer than four very unpleasant knives all these he threw out into the passageway well carlos was almost smiling that wasnt very clever of me was it i mean if you had wished to dispose of all of them youd have thrown cola in here too i missed that he sniffed the air professionally nitrous oxide id say you know laughing gas not bad for a doctor petersen said i thought that gas was confined only to dentists surgeries nitrous oxide a refined form of with this you dont come out of the anaesthetic with tears in your eyes laughing singing and generally making a fool of yourself normally you dont come out of it at all by which i mean youd just keep on sleeping until you woke up at your usual time quite unaware that anything untoward had happened to you but im told that if youve recently undergone some sort of traumatic experience immediately before youve been gassed the tendency is to wake up directly the effects of the gas have worn off they also say that if you had something weighing on your mind such as a nagging conscience the same thing happens carlos said thats a strange sort of thing for a soldier to know about im a strange sort of soldier alex take up your gun while i have a look around look around carlos did just that the cabin if one could call it such held five canvas cots and that was all there wasnt as much as even a cupboard for clothes theres nothing to look around for petersen didnt bother to reply he ripped blankets from the cots and flung them on the deck nothing had lain beneath the blankets he picked up a rucksack there were five of them in the cabin and unceremoniously dumped the contents on a cot they were innocuous among some clothes and a rudimentary toilet kit there was a considerable amount of ammunition some loose some in magazines but those too petersen considered innocuous he would have expected nothing else the second rucksack yielded the same results the third was padlocked petersen looked at alessandro who was sitting on the deck his ravaged face expressionless the effect was chilling even a hint of balefulness would have been preferable to this emptiness but petersen was not the man to be moved by expressions or lack of them well now alessandro that wasnt very clever was it if you want to hide a thing you do it inconspicuously a padlock is conspicuous the key alessandro spat on the deck and remained silent spitting petersen shook his head unpleasant for secondrate villains alex search him dont bother your knife alexs knife as one would have expected of alex was razor sharp it sliced through the tough canvas of the rucksack as if through paper petersen peered at the contents yes indeed twinges of conscience he extracted a very small butane burner and an equally small kettle the kettle had no top the spout had a screwed top petersen shook the kettle the glugging of water inside was unmistakable petersen turned to carlos doesnt say much for the hospitality of the colombo does it when a man has to bring along his own equipment for making tea or coffee or whatever carlos looked slightly puzzled any passenger aboard this ship can have as much tea or coffee or any other drink that he wants then his face cleared for shore use of course of course petersen tipped the remainder of the contents of the rucksack on to another cot rummaged briefly around then straightened although mind you its difficult to see how we can make any of those refreshing beverages without any tea or coffee to make them ive found out all i want to know even although i knew in advance anyway he turned his attention to the fourth rucksack carlos said if youve already found out what you want to know why keep on natural curiosity together with the fact that alessandro im afraid is not a very trustworthy man who knows this bag might contain a nest of vipers there were no vipers but there were two more gasgrenades and a walther with a screwedon silencer and a stealthy killer to boot petersen said ive always wanted one of those he put it in his pocket and opened up the last rucksack this yielded only a small metal case about half the size of a shoebox petersen turned to the nearest of his prisoners who happened to be franco you know whats inside this franco didnt say whether he did not not petersen sighed placed the muzzle of his luger against francos kneecap and said captain tremino if i pull the trigger will he walk again good god carlos was used to war but not this kind of war he might hell be a cripple for life petersen took two steps back franco looked at alessandro but alessandro wasnt looking at him franco looked at petersen and the levelled luger franco said i know open it franco released two brass clips and swung back the lid there was no explosion no release of gas carlos said why didnt you open it because the world is full of untrustworthy people lots of these boxes of tricks around if an unauthorized opener doesnt know where a secret switch or button is hes going to inhale a very nasty gas most of the latest safes incorporate some such device he took the box from franco the interior was shaped and lined with velvet and contained glass ampoules two round boxes and two small hypodermic syringes petersen took out one of the round boxes and shook it it rattled petersen handed the box to carlos should interest a medical man at a guess a variety of liquids and tablets to render the victim temporarily or permanently unconscious by which i mean dead seven ampoules you observe one green three blue three pink at a guess the green is scopolamine an aid to flagging memories as for the difference in colour in the other six ampoules there can be only one reason three are lethal three nonlethal wouldnt you agree captain its possible it was carlos night for being unhappy and petersen was no longer as surprised by his unhappiness as he had been earlier nor at the obvious apprehension in which he held alessandro theres no means of telling one from the other of course i wouldnt bet on that petersen said he turned round as george came through the doorway all is well a little trouble with the young lady george said she put up a surprisingly spirited resistance to the confiscation of her radio nothing surprising about that fortunately youre bigger than she is im hardly proud of that the radios are in the captains cabin george looked around the cabin which looked as if a small tornado had lately passed by untidy lot arent they i helped a little petersen took the box from carlos and handed it to george what do you make of that it is difficult to conceive of a beaming plump and cherubic face changing in an instant to one of graven stone but that was what happened to georges those are death capsules i know alessandros yes george looked at alessandro for some seconds nodded and turned back to petersen i think perhaps we should have a talk with our friend youre making a mistake carlos voice was not quite as steady as it could have been im a doctor you dont know human nature alessandro will never talk george faced him his expression hadnt changed and carlos visibly recoiled be quiet little man five minutes alone with me ten at the most and any man in the world will talk alessandro is a five minute man it may come to that petersen said it probably will but first things first apart from the capsules we picked up one or two other interesting objects this silenced gun for instance he showed george the walther two gasgrenades and a spirit burner and kettle and about two hundred rounds of ammunition what do you think the kettle was for one thing only he was going to gas us steal some real or imagined document steam open the envelope odd that he should be convinced that there was an envelope around study the contents reseal the envelope return it to our cabin gas us again wait a few seconds replace the envelope remove the gascanister and leave when we woke up in the morning we almost certainly wouldnt be aware that anything had happened thats the only way it could have happened or was intended to happen there are three questions why was alessandro so interested in us what were his future plans and who sent him well find all that out easily enough george said of course we will not aboard this ship carlos said george studied him with mild interest why not there will be no torture aboard any vessel i command the words sounded more resolute than the tone of the voice carlos petersen said dont make things any more difficult for yourself or us than you can help nothing easier than to lock you up with this bunch of villains youre not the only person who can find his way to ploce we dont want to nor do we intend to we realize you find yourself in an invidious situation through no fault of your own no torture we promise youve just said youll find out psychology drugs carlos was immediately suspicious injections neither subject closed i had another question but the answer is obvious why did alessandro choose to surround himself with such a bunch of incompetents camouflage a dangerous man might well be tempted to surround himself with other dangerous men alessandros too smart petersen looked around no heavy metal objects and only a cat could get out of that porthole carlos would you have one of your men bring us a sledgehammer or as near to it as you have aboard the suspicion returned what do you want a sledgehammer for to beat out alessandros brains george said patiently before we start asking questions to close this door from the outside petersen said the clips you understand ah carlos stepped into the passageway gave an order and returned ill go and have a look at the fallen hero not much i can do for him im afraid a favour carlos when we leave may we go up to your cabin or whatever you call the place we met you first certainly may one ask why if youd been standing frozen in that damned passageway for an hour and a half youd understand why of course restoratives help yourselves gentlemen ill step by and let you know how cola is he paused then added drily that should give you plenty of time to prepare your intensive interrogation of me he left almost immediately to be replaced by pietro bearing a small sledgehammer they closed the door and secured one of the eight watertight clips one was enough george struck it with one blow of the hammer that too was enough not even a gorilla could now have opened that clip from the inside they left the sledgehammer in the passageway and went directly to the engineroom which was unmanned as they had known it would be all controls were operated from the wheelhouse it took them less than a minute to find what they were looking for they made a brief excursion to the upper deck then repaired to carlos cabin a thirsty nights work george said he was on his second or it could have been third glass of grappa he looked at the von karajans radios on the deck beside him these would have been safer in our cabins why have them here theyd have been too safe in our cabins young michael would never have dared to try to get at them there dont try to tell me that he might try to get at them here unlikely i admit michael it is clear is not cast in the heroic mould he might of course be a consummate actor but i dont see him as an actor any more than a hero however if hes desperate enough and he must have been desperate to try to get off a message at the time and place he didhe might try but the radios will be in the safe as soon as carlos returns and carlos has the only key carlos might give him that key oh so thats the way our devious mind works so we keep an eye on our michael for the remainder of the night not that theres all that much left of it and if he does try to recover the radios what does that prove except that there is a connection between him and carlos thats all i want to prove i dont expect either would say or admit to anything they dont have to at least michael doesnt have to i can have him detained in ploce for disobedience of orders and suspicion of trying to communicate with the enemy you really suspect him of that good lord no but no question hes been trying to communicate with someone and that someone might as well be a spy itll look better on a charge sheet all i want to see is if theres any connection between him and carlos and if there is youre prepared to clap him into durance vile sure and his sister shes done nothing she can come along with us hang around ploce or join him in as you say durance vile up to her the very flower of chivalry george shook his head and reached for the grappa so we may or may not suspect a connection between carlos and michael but we do suspect one between carlos and alessandro i dont i do think that carlos knows a great deal more about alessandro than we do but i dont think he knows what alessandro is up to on this passage a very simple point if carlos were privy to alessandros plans then he alessandro wouldnt have bothered to bring along a kettle and burner hed just have gone to the galley and steamed the envelope open he turned round as carlos entered hows cola hell be all right well no danger his shoulder is a mess even if it were a flat calm i wouldnt touch it it needs a surgeon or an osteologist and im neither he unlocked a safe put the radio gear inside then relocked the door well no hurry for you gentlemen but i must return to the wheelhouse a moment please yes peter carlos smiled the interrogation no a few questions you could save us a lot of time and trouble what in interrogating alessandro you promised me no torture i still promise alessandro tried to assault us and steal some papers tonight did you do you know about this no i believe you carlos raised his eyebrows a little but said nothing you dont seem unduly concerned that your fellowitalian has been made a prisoner by a bunch of uncivilized yugoslavs do you if you mean does he mean anything personally to me no but his reputation does carlos said nothing you know something about his background his associations the nature of his business that we dont is that not so that could be you cant expect me to divulge anything of that nature not expect hope no hope you wouldnt break the geneva conventions to extract that information from me petersen rose certainly not thank you for your hospitality petersen was carrying a canvas chair and the metal box of capsules when he entered the cabin in which alessandro and his three men were imprisoned george was carrying two lengths of heaving line and the sledgehammer with which he had just released the outside clip alex was carrying only his machinepistol petersen unfolded the chair sat on it and watched with apparent interest as george hammered home a clip wed rather not have any interruptions you see petersen said he looked at franco sepp and guido get into that corner there if anyone moves alex will kill him take your jacket off alessandro alessandro spat on the floor take your jacket off george said pleasantly or ill knock you out of it alessandro not a man of a very original turn of mind spat again george hit him somewhere in the region of the solar plexus not a very hard blow it seemed but enough to make alessandro double up whooshing in agony george removed the jacket tie him up george set about tying him up when alessandro had recovered a little from his initial bout of gasping he tried to offer some resistance but an absentminded cuff from george to the side of the jaw convinced him of the unwisdom of this george tied him in such a fashion that both arms were lashed immovably to his sides his knees and ankles were bound together and then for good measure george used the second heaving line to lash alessandro to the cot no chicken was ever so securely trussed so immobile as alessandro was then george surveyed his handiwork with some satisfaction then turned to petersen isnt there something in the geneva conventions about this could be could be truth is ive never read them he opened the metal box and looked at alessandro in the interests of science you understand this shouldnt take any time at all the words were light enough but alessandro wasnt listening to the words he was looking at the implacable face above and not liking at all what he saw here we have three blue ampoules and three pink we think and captain tremino who is also a doctor agrees with us that three of these are lethal and three nonlethal unfortunately we dont know which is which and theres only one simple logical way to find out im going to inject you with one of these if you survive it then well know its a nonlethal ampoule if you dont well know its the other ones that are nonlethal petersen held up two ampoules one blue one pink which would you suggest george george rubbed his chin thoughtfully a big responsibility a mans life could hang on my decision well its not all that big a responsibility no loss to mankind anyway the blue one blue it shall be petersen broke the ampoule into a test tube inserted the needle of the hypodermic and began to withdraw the plunger alessandro stared in terrified fascination as the blue liquid seeped up into the hypodermic im afraid im not very good at this job petersens conversational calm was more terrifying than any sibilant threats could ever have hoped to be if youre careless an air bubble can get in and an air bubble in the blood stream can be very unpleasant i mean it can kill you however in your case i dont think its going to make very much difference one way or another alessandros eyes were staring his whitened lips drawn back in a rictus of terror petersen touched the inside of alessandros right elbow seems a suitable vein to me he pinched the vein and advanced the syringe no no no alessandros voice was an inhuman scream torn from his throat god no no youve nothing to worry about petersen said soothingly if its a nonlethal dose youll just slip away from us and come back in a few minutes if its a lethal dose youll just slip away he paused just a minute though he just might die in screaming agony he brought out a pad of white linen cloth and handed it to george just in case but watch your hand though when a dying mans teeth clench they stay clenched worse if he draws blood youll get infected too petersen pinched the vein between fingers and thumb alessandro screamed george applied the pad to his mouth after a few seconds at a nod from petersen he withdrew the pad alessandro had stopped screaming now and a weird moaning noise came from deep in his throat he was struggling insanely against his bonds his face was a mask of madness and a seizure a heart attack seemed imminent petersen looked at george the big mans face was masked in sweat petersen said in a quiet voice this is the killer dose isnt it alessandro didnt hear him petersen had to repeat the questions twice before the question penetrated the fearcrazed mind its the killer dose its the killer dose he repeated the words several times the words a babble of nearincoherent terror and you die in agony yes yes yes yes he was gasping for breath like a man in the final stages of suffocation agony agony which means you have administered this yourself there can be no pity alessandro no mercy besides you could still be telling a lie he touched the tip of the needle against the skin alessandro screamed again and again george applied the clamp who sent you twice petersen repeated the question before alessandro rolled his eyes george removed the pad cipriano the voice was a barely distinguishable croak major cipriano thats a lie no major could authorize this careful not to touch the plunger petersen inserted the tip of the needle just outside the vein alessandro opened his mouth to scream again but george cut him off before he could make a sound who authorized this the needles inside the vein now alessandro all i have to do is press the plunger who authorized this george removed the pad for a moment it seemed that alessandro had lost consciousness then his eyes rolled again granelli the voice was a faint whisper general granelli granelli was the muchfeared muchhated chief of italian intelligence the needle is still inside the vein my hand is still on the plunger does colonel lunz know of this no i swear it no general von lohr no then how did granelli know i was on board colonel lunz told him well well the usual trusting faith between the loyal allies what did you want from my cabin tonight a paper a message perhaps youd better withdraw that syringe george said i think hes going to faint or die or something what were you going to do with it alessandro the tip of the needle had remained where it was compare it with a message alessandro really did look very ill indeed my jacket peterson found the message in the inside pocket of the jacket it was the duplicate of the one he had in his cabin he refolded the paper and put it in his own inside pocket odd george said i do believe hes fainted ill bet his victims never had a chance to faint i wish petersen said with genuine regret that i had pressed that plunger no question our friend here is was a oneman extermination squad petersen sniffed at the testtube dropped it and the ampoule to the deck crushed them both beneath his heel and then squirted the contents of the hypodermic on the deck spiritbased petersen said it will evaporate quickly enough well thats it in the passageway george mopped his forehead i wouldnt care to go through that again neither im sure would alessandro me neither petersen said how do you feel about it alex i wish alex said morosely that you had pushed that plunger i could have shot him as easy as a wink that would have been an idea at least hed have gone without the agony in any event hes all washed up as an operative of any kind or will be as soon as he gets back to termoli or even to ploce lets fix this door all eight watertight clips were engaged and with each clip in turn to muffle sound alex held in position the pad that had been so lately used for another purpose while george hammered home the clip when the eighth had been so dealt with george said that should hold it for a while especially if we throw this hammer overboard lets make sure petersen said he left and returned within a minute with a gas cylinder a welders rod and a facemask petersen was at best but an amateur welder but what he lacked in expertise he made up in enthusiasm the completed result would have won him no prizes for finesse but that was unimportant what was important was that for all practical purposes that door was sealed for life what id like to do now petersen said is to have a word with carlos and michael but first i think a pause for reflection how does this sound petersen said he was seated at carlos desk a scotch in front of him and beside it a message he had just drafted well have michael send it off by and by plain language of course colonel lunz then his code number your wouldbe assassins andor exterminators a bunch of incompetents stop alessandro and other bunglers now confined fore cabin colombo behind welded steel door stop sorry cannot congratulate you general von lohr general granelli major cipriano on choice of operatives regards zeppo zeppo you may recall is my code name george steepled his fingers fair he said judicially fair not entirely accurate though we dont know that they are assassins andor etc how are they to know that we dont know should cause quite a stirring in the dovecote not too much billing and cooing wouldnt you think george smiled broadly colonel lunz and general von lohr are going to be fearfully upset alessandro said they knew nothing of this setup how are they to know that we didnt know petersen said reasonably theyll be fit to be tied and ready to assume anything id love to be listening in to the heated telephone calls among the named parties later on today nothing like spreading confusion dissension suspicion and mistrust among the loyal allies not a bad nights work gentlemen i think were entitled to a small nightcap before going to have a word with carlos the wheelhouse was lit only by the dim light from the binnacle and it had taken petersen and his two companions some time to adjust their eyes to the gloom carlos himself was at the wheel at a discreet word from petersen the helmsman had taken temporary leave of absence petersen coughed again discreetly and said i am surprised carlos i would almost say acutely distressed to find a simple honest sailorman like yourself associating with such notorious and unscrupulous characters as general granelli and major cipriano carlos hands on the wheel continued to gaze straight ahead and when he spoke his voice was surprisingly calm i have never met either after tonight i shall take care that i never shall orders are orders but i will never again carry one of granellis murderous poisoners they may threaten courtmartial but threats are as far as they will go i take it that alessandro has talked yes he is alive from the tone of his voice carlos didnt particularly care whether he were or not alive and well no torture as promised simple psychology you wouldnt and couldnt say so unless it were true ill talk to him by and by there was no hint of urgency in his voice yes well im afraid that to talk to him youll have to have yourself lowered in a bosuns chair to his cabin porthole doors locked you see whats locked can be unlocked not in this case we apologize for having taken liberties with an italian naval vessel but we thought it prudent to weld the door to the bulkhead ah so for the first time carlos looked at petersen his expression registering if anything no more than a polite interest welded unusual i doubt whether youll find an oxyacetylene lance in ploce i doubt it you might have to go all the way back to ancona to have them freed one would hope you are not sunk before you get there it would be a terrible thing if alessandro arid his friends were to go to a watery grave terrible weve taken another liberty you did have an oxyacetylene flame its at the bottom of the adriatic although he could see no gleam of white teeth petersen could have sworn that he was smiling four as the seas had remained rough throughout the crossing and had hardly moderated when they reached what should have been the comparative shelter of the neretva channel between the island of peljesac and the yugoslav mainland the seven passengers who were in a position to sit down to have breakfast did not in fact do so until they had actually tied up to the quay in ploce true to carlos prediction because they had arrived after dawn and were flying a ludicrously large italian flag the harbour garrison had refrained from firing at them as they made their approach towards the port that not even the most uninhibited of travel brochure writers would have described as the gem of the adriatic breakfast was unquestionably the handiwork of giovanni the engineer the indescribable mush of eggs and cheese seemed to have been cooked in diesel oil and the coffee made of it but the bread was palatable and the sea air lent an edge to the appetite more especially for those who had suffered during the passage giacomo pushed his halffinished plate to one side he was freshly shaven and despite the ghastly meal as cheerful as ever where are alessandro and his cutthroats they dont know what theyre missing maybe theyve had breakfast aboard the colombo before petersen said or already gone ashore nobodys gone ashore ive been on deck prefer their own company then a secretive lot giacomo smiled you have no secrets having secrets and being secretive are two different things but no no secrets too much trouble trying to remember who you are supposed to be and what you are supposed to be saying especially if like me you have difficulty in remembering start a life of deception and you end up by being trapped in it i believe in the simple direct life i could believe that giacomo said especially if last nights performance was anything to go by last nights performance sarina her face still pale from what had obviously been an unpleasant night looked at him in puzzlement what does that mean didnt you hear the shot last night sarina nodded towards the other girl lorraine and i both heard a shot she smiled faintly when two people think they are dying they dont pay much attention to a trifle like a shot what happened tetersen shot one of alessandros men an unfortunate lad by the name of cola sarina looked at petersen in astonishment why on earth did you do that credit where credit is due alex shot him with of course my full approval why he was being secretive thats why she didnt seem to have heard is he is he dead goodness me no alex doesnt kill people quite a number of ghosts would have testified to the contrary a damaged shoulder damaged lorraines dark eyes were cold the lips compressed do you mean shattered could be petersen lifted his shoulders in a very small shrug indeed im not a doctor has carlos seen him it was less a question than a demand petersen looked at her thoughtfully what good would that do carlos well she broke off as if in confusion well what why what could he do what could he hes the captain isnt he both a stupid answer and a stupid question why should he see him ive seen him and im certain ive seen many more gunshot wounds than carlos has youre not a doctor is carlos carlos how should i know because you do petersen said pleasantly every time you speak you tread deeper water you are not a born liar lorraine but you are a lousy one when first we practise to deceive you know deception again and its not your forte im afraid sure hes a doctor he told me he didnt tell you how did you know she clenched her fists and her eyes were stormy how dare you crossexamine me like this odd petersen said contemplatively you look even more beautiful when youre angry well some women are like that and why are you angry because youve been caught out thats why youre smug youre infuriating so calm so reasonable so sure so selfsatisfied mr clever knowall my my am i all those things this must be another lorraine talking why have you taken such offence but youre not so clever i do know he is a doctor she smiled thinly if you were clever youd remember the conversation in the cafe last night youd remember that it came up that i too was born in pescara why should i not know him lorraine lorraine youre not only treading deep water youre in over your head you were not born in pescara you werent born in italy youre not even italian there was silence petersens quiet statement carried complete conviction then sarina as angry as lorraine had been a few moments earlier said lorraine dont listen to him dont even talk to him cant you see what hes trying to do to needle you to trap you to make you say things you dont mean to say just to satisfy his great big ego i am making friends this morning petersen said sadly my great big ego notices that lorraine hasnt contradicted me thats because she knows that i know she also knows that i know shes a friend of carlos but not from pescara tell me if im wrong lorraine lorraine didnt tell him anything she just caught her lower lip and looked down at the table sarina said i think youre horrible if you equate honesty with horror then sure im horrible giacomo was smiling you certainly do know a lot dont you peter not really ive just learned to learn enough to stay alive giacomo was still smiling youll be telling me next that im not italian not if you dont want me to you mean im not italian how can you be if you were born in yugoslavia montenegro to be precise jesus giacomo was no longer smiling but there was neither rancour nor offence in face or tone then he started smiling again sarina looked bleakly at petersen then turned to giacomo and what else did this this monster petersen said helpfully this monster oh do be quiet what other outrage did this man commit last night well now giacomo linked his ringers behind his head and seemed prepared to enjoy himself it all depends upon what you call an outrage to start with after he had cola shot he gassed alessandro and three other men gassed them she stared at giacomo in disbelief gassed it was their own gas he used they deserved it you mean he killed them murdered them no no they recovered i know i was there simply he added hastily you understand as an observer then he took away their guns and ammunition and grenades and a few other nasty things then he locked them up thats all thats all sarina breathed deeply twice when you say it quickly it sounds like nothing doesnt it why did he lock them up maybe he didnt want them to have breakfast how should i know ask him he looked at petersen a pretty fair old job of locking up if i may say so i just happened along that way as we were coming into port ah ah indeed giacomo looked at sarina you didnt smell any smoke during the night did you smoke yes we did she shuddered remembering we were sick enough already when we smelled it that was really the end why that was your friend peter and his friends at work they were welding up the door of alessandros cabin welding up the door a faint note of hysteria had crept into her voice with alessandro and his men inside why on earth she was suddenly at a loss for words i guess he didnt want them to get out the two girls looked at each other in silence there was nothing more to say petersen cleared his throat in a brisk fashion well now thats everything satisfactorily explained the two girls turned their heads in slow unison and looked at him in total incredulity the past as they say is prologue well be leaving in about half an hour or whatever time it takes to obtain some transport time to brush your teeth and pack your gear he looked at giacomo you and your friend coming with us lorraine you mean got any other friends aboard dont stall all depends where youre going same place as you dont be cagey where are you going up the neretva well come petersen made to rise when carlos entered a piece of paper in his hand like giacomo he was shaven brisk and apparently cheerful he didnt look like a man who hadnt slept all night but then in his business he probably slept enough during the day good morning youve had breakfast our compliments to the chef that paper for me it is radio signal just come in code so it doesnt make any sense tome petersen glanced at it doesnt make any sense to me either not until i get the code book he folded the paper and put it in an inside pocket alight it not be urgent carlos said its from rome ive invariably found that whenever rome thinks something is urgent its never urgent to me lorraine said weve just heard that a man has been shot is he badly hurt cola carlos didnt sound very concerned about colas health he thinks he is i dont anyway ive sent for an ambulance should have been here by now he looked out of the small window no ambulance but a couple of soldiers approaching the gangway if that is you could call them soldiers ones about ninety the other ten probably for you well see carlos had exaggerated the age disparity between the two soldiers but not by much the younger was indeed a beardless youth the older well stricken in years the latter saluted as smartly as his arthritic bones would permit captain tremino you have a yugoslav army officer among your passengers carlos waved a hand major petersen thats the name the ancient saluted again commandants compliments sir and would you be so kind as to see him in his office you and your two men do you know why the commandant does not confide in me sir how far is it a few hundred metres five minutes right away petersen stood and picked up his machinepistol george and alex did the same the older soldier coughed politely the commandant doesnt like guns in his office no guns there is a war in progress this is a military post and the commandant doesnt like guns he looked at george and alex then slipped off his machinepistol hes probably in his dotage lets humour him they left carlos watched through the window as they descended the gangway to the quayside he sighed i cant bear it i cant as an italian i cant bear it its like sending a toothless old hound and a frisky puppy to round up three timber wolves sabretoothed tigers more like he raised his voice giovanni sarina said hesitatingly are they really like that i mean i heard a man in rome yesterday call them that ah my old friend colonel lunz no doubt you know the colonel there was surprise in her voice i thought well everybody seems to know everything around here except me of course i know him he turned as the lean dyspeptic looking engineerchef appeared in the doorway breakfast giovanni if you would giacomo said wonderingly you can really eat that stuff atrophied tastebuds a zinclined stomach a little imagination and you could be in maxims sarina one does not approach me at the quayside at termoli jerk a thumb towards the east and ask for a lift to yugoslavia do you think youd be aboard the colombo if i didnt know the colonel do you have to be suspicious about everyone im suspicious about our major petersen i dont trust him an inch thats a fine thing to say about a fellowcountryman carlos sat and buttered bread honest and straightforward sort of fellow one would have thought one would have look weve got to go up into the mountains with that man he seems to know his way around in fact i know he does you should reach your destination all right oh im sure whose destination his or ours carlos looked at her in mild exasperation do you have any option no then why dont you stop wasting your breath carlos how can you talk to her like that lorraines voice was sharp enough to bring a slightly thoughtful look to giacomos face shes worried of course shes worried im worried too were both going up into the mountains with that man youre not she was either nervous or had a low temper flashpoint its all very well for you sitting safe and sound here aboard the colombo oh come now giacomo said easily i dont think thats being too fair im quite sure carlos that she didnt mean what she implied he looked at lorraine in mockreproval im sure carlos would willingly leave his safe and sound ship and accompany you into the mountains but there are two inhibiting factors duty and a tin leg i am sorry she was genuinely contrite and put her hand on carlos shoulder to show it carlos who was addressing himself to the confection that giovanni had just brought looked up at her and smiled amiably giacomos right she said of course i didnt mean it its just that well sarina and i feel so helpless giacomo is in the same position he doesnt look in the slightest bit helpless to me she shook his shoulder in exasperation please you dont understand we dont know whats going on we dont know anything he seems to know everything he peter who else would i be talking about for so patricianlooking a lady she could be very snappish perhaps i can shake you out of your complacency do you know that he knows where giacomo and i are going do you know that he seems to know about my background do you know that he knows im not italian that he knows that you and i knew each other in the past but not in pescara if carlos was shaken he concealed it masterfully peter knows a great number of things that you wouldnt expect him to or so colonel lunz tells me for ail i know colonel lunz told him about you and giacomo although that wouldnt be like the colonel he may have expected you aboard he didnt seem annoyed by your presence he was annoyed enough by alessandros presence he wouldnt know about alessandro alessandro is controlled by another agency she said quickly how do you know that he peter told me she removed her hand and straightened so you and peter have your little secrets too she turned to sarina we can trust everybody cant we giacomo said carlos youre beginning to look like a henpecked husband im beginning to feel like one too my dear girl i only learnt this during the night what did you expect me to do come hammering on your cabin door at four in the morning to announce this earthshaking news to you and sarina he looked up as the dyspeptic engineerchef appeared again in the doorway breakfast has been served carlos thank you giovanni he looked at lorraine and before you start getting suspicious of giovanni he only means that hes given food to our friends in the fore cabin i thought the door was locked oh dear oh dear carlos laid down knife and fork suspicious again the door is locked breakfast was lowered in a bucket to their cabin porthole when are you going to see them when im ready when ive had breakfast carlos picked up his knife and fork again if i get peace to eat it that is george said took a bit of a risk back there didnt you chanced your arm as they say pretending you knew all about their plans and backgrounds when you knew nothing credits all yours george just based on a couple of remarks of yours about ethnic background couldnt very well tell them that though besides lorraine gave away more than i extracted i dont think shed make a very good espionage agent they were threading their way through cranes trucks both army and civilian and scattered dock buildings a few yards behind the two italian soldiers the snow had stopped now the rilic hills were sheltering them from the northeast wind but the temperature was still below freezing point there were few enough people around the early hour and the cold were not such as to encourage outdoor activity the soldiers as carlos had said were either reservists or youths the few civilians around were in the same age categories there didnt seem to be a young or middleaged man in the port at least george said youve established a kind of moral ascendancy over them well over the young ladies anyway giacomo doesnt lend himself to that sort of thing that paper carlos gave you a message from our roman allies yes we are requested to remain in ploce and await further orders ridiculous isnt it you think sending that cablegram was wise we might have expected this i did i hoped to precipitate exactly this we know what to expect and weve got the initiative if wed got clear of the port without trouble and then were stopped by a couple of tanks up the valley road wed have lost the initiative our two guards in front there theyre not very bright are they you mean they didnt search us for handguns ones too old to care the others too inexperienced to know besides look at our honest faces the two guards led the way to a low wooden hut obviously a temporary affair up some steps and after knocking into a small room about as spartan and primitive as the exterior of the hut cracked linoleum on the floor two metal filing cabinets a radio transceiver a telephone a table and some chairs the officer behind the table rose at their entrance he was a tall thin man middleaged with pebble glasses which explained clearly enough why he wasnt at the front he peered at them myopically over the tops of his glasses major petersen yes glad to meet you commandant oh i see i wonder he cleared his throat i have just received a detention order ssh petersen had a finger to his lips he lowered his voice are we alone we are quite sure quite sure in that case put your hands up carlos pushed his chair back and rose excuse me i must have a look at that cabin door lorraine said you mean you havent seen it yet no if peter says its welded then it is i should imagine one welded door looks very much like another curiosity really he was back in just over a minute a welded door is a welded door and the only way to open it is with an oxyacetylene flamecutter ive sent pietro ashore to try and find one i dont have much hope we had one but peter and his friends dropped it over the side lorraine said you dont seem worried about it i dont get worried about trifles and if you cant get them out theyll have to stay there till we get back to termoli plenty of facilities there you could be sunk before you get there have you thought of that yes that would upset me well thats better a little compassion at least it would upset me because ive really grown quite fond of this old boat i would hate to think it would be alessandros tomb carlos face and voice were cold compassion compassion for that monster compassion for a murderer a hired assassin a poisoner who travels with hypodermics and ampoules of lethal liquids compassion for a psychopath who would just love to inject you or sarina there and giggle his evil head off as you screamed your way to death peter spared him i wish hed killed him compassion he turned and walked out and now youve upset him giacomo said nag nag nag its bloody marvellous people well peter and carlos tried judged and condemned when you dont have the faintest idea what youre talking about i didnt mean anything she seemed bewildered its not what you mean its what you say you could always try watching your tongue he rose and left lorraine stared at the empty doorway her face woebegone two large tears trickled slowly down her cheeks sarina put her arm around her shoulders its all right she said it really is they dont understand i do tenminutes later petersen and his two companions arrived petersen was driving an elderly truck civilian not army with a hooped canvas roof and canvas flaps at the rear petersen jumped down from the driving seat and looked at the five on the deck of the colombo carlos giacomo lorraine michael and sarina the last four with their rucksacks and radios beside them well were ready when you are petersen said he seemed in excellent spirits well just come aboard for our gear no need carlos said the two pietros are bringing that and our guns i wouldnt want you to feel undressed carlos led the way down the gangway how did things go couldnt have been better very friendly cooperative and helpful he produced two papers a military pass and a permit for me to drive this vehicle only as far as metkovic but it will at least get us on the way both signed by major massamo would you two young ladies come up front with me its much more comfortable and the cab is heated the back is not thank you lorraine said id rather sit in the back oh no she wouldnt sarina said im not putting up with this walking inquisition all by myself she took lorraines arm and whispered in her ear while petersen lifted patient eyes to heaven at first lorraine shook her head vigorously then reluctantly nodded they shook hands with carlos thanked him and said goodbye all except lorraine she just stood there her eyes on the dockside carlos looked at her in exasperation then said all right you upset me and i forgetting that im supposed to be an officer and a gentleman upset you he put his arm round her shoulders gave her a brief hug and kissed her none too lightly on the cheek thats by way of apology and goodbye petersen started up the rather asthmatic engine and drove off the elderly guard at the gate ignored petersens proffered papers and lackadaisically waved them on he probably didnt want to leave the brazier in his sentrybox as he drove on petersen glanced to his right lorraine at the far end of the seat was staring straight ahead her face was masked in tears petersen frowning leaned forward and sideways but was brought up short by a far from gentle elbow in the ribs sarina too was frowning and giving an almost imperceptible shake of the head petersen looked at her questioningly got a stony glance in return and sat back to concentrate on his driving in the back of the truck already heavily polluted by georges cigars giacomo kept glancing towards the tarpaulincovered heap in the front eventually he tapped george on the arm george yes have you ever seen a tarpaulin moving of its own accord cant say that i have well i can see one now george followed the direction of the pointing finger i see what you mean my goodness i hope theyre not suffocating under that lot he pulled back the tarpaulin to reveal three figures lying on their sides securely bound at wrists and ankles and very effectively gagged theyre not suffocating at all just getting restless the light inside the back of the truck was dim but sufficient to let giacomo recognize the elderly soldier and his very junior partner who had come aboard earlier in the morning to collect petersen and the other two and whos the other person major massamo commandant deputy commandant i believe of the port michael seated with alex on the opposite side of the truck said who are those people what are they doing here why are they tied up the questions didnt betray any real interest the voice was dull as befitted one still in a state of dazed incomprehension they were the first words he had spoken that day seasickness and the traumatic experience he had undergone during the night had wrought their toll to the extent that he had not even been able to face breakfast the port commandant and two of his soldiers george said they are here because we couldnt very well leave them behind to raise the alarm the moment we were gone and we couldnt very well shoot them could we and theyre bound and gagged because we couldnt very well have them raising a song and dance on the way out of the harbour you do ask stupid questions michael this is the major massamo that major petersen mentioned how did you manage to get him to sign those permits you have you michael have a suspicious mind it doesnt become you he didnt sign them i did there were lots of notices in his room all signed by him you dont have to be a skilled forger to copy a signature whats going to happen to them we will dispose of them at a convenient time and place dispose of them theyll be back in ploce safe and unharmed this evening good heavens michael you dont go around shooting your allies michael looked at three bound and gagged men yes i see allies they were stopped at roadblocks at the next two villages but the questioning was very perfunctory and routine at the third village bagalovic petersen pulled up by a temporary army filling station descended gave some papers to the corporal in attendance waited until the truck had been fuelled gave the corporal some money for which he was rewarded by a surprised salute then drove off again sarina said they dont look like soldiers to me they dont behave like soldiers they seem soso what is the word apathetic a marked lack of enthusiasm agreed their behaviour doesnt show them up in the best of light does it the italians can in fact be very very good soldiers but not in this war they have no heart for it in spite of mussolinis stirring martial speeches the people didnt want this war in the first place and they want it less and less as time goes by their frontline troops fight well enough but not from patriotism just professional pride but its convenient for us what were those papers you gave to that soldier diesel coupons major massamo gave them to me major massamo gave them to you free fuel of course that tip you handed to the soldier i suppose major massamo gave you the money as well of course not we dont steal just trucks and fuel coupons or have you just borrowed those temporarily the truck anyway which of course you will return to major massamo petersen spared her a glance youre supposed to be apprehensive nervous not full of nosey questions i dont much care to be crossexamined were supposed to be on the same side remember as for the truck im afraid the major wont be seeing it again they drove on in silence and after another fifteen minutes ran into the town of metkovic petersen parked the truck in the main street and stepped down to the roadway sarina said forgotten something havent you what your keys youve left them in the ignition please dont be silly petersen crossed the street and disappeared into a store lorraine spoke for the first time since leaving ploice what did he mean by that what he says he knows so much that he probably knows i cant drive anyway certainly not this rackety old monster even if i could what place would i have to drive to she touched the back of the cab wood i couldnt get five yards that fearful alex could shoot through that she looked and sounded doleful in the extreme lorraine said wouldnt it be nice to see him just once make a mistake do something wrong id love it but i dont think we should want it i have the feeling that what is good for major petersen is good for us and vice versa twenty minutes elapsed before petersen returned for a man who might have been regarded as being on the run he was in no hurry he was carrying a large wicker basket its contents covered with brown paper this he took round to the back of the truck moments later he was back in the driving seat he seemed in good humour well go on he said ask away sarina made a moue but curiosity won the basket an army marches on its stomach stretch a point and you might regard us as part of an army provisions what else would i have been buying in a food store bread cheese hams various meats goulash fruits vegetables tea coffee sugar a spirit stove kettle and stewpan i promised colonel lunz to deliver you in fairly good condition in spite of herself she smiled faintly you sound as if you wanted to deliver us in prime condition at a slave market overlooked your fat friend didnt you my first purchase george had the top off a litre flask of beer within five seconds wine too they cleared the outskirts of the town sarina said i thought the permit took you only as far as metkovic i have two permits i showed only one to carlos half an hour later petersen recrossed the neretva and pulled up at a fairly large garage on the outskirts of capljina petersen went inside and returned in a few minutes just saying hallo to an old friend they passed through the village of trebizat and not long afterwards petersen pulled off the highway and turned up a secondary road climbing fairly steeply as they went from this they turned on to yet another road which was no more than a grass track still climbing until they finally rounded and came to a halt about fifty yards from a low stone building they could approach no further because the road ended where they were they dismounted from the cab and went round to the back of the truck petersen tweaked back one of the canvas flaps lunch he said perhaps a minute passed without any signs of activity sarina and lorraine looked at each other in a puzzled apprehension which was in no way lessened by petersens air of relaxed calm when george ties a knot petersen said cryptically it takes a fair deal of untying suddenly the flaps were parted and major massamo and his two soldiers untied and ungagged were lowered from the tailboard massamo and the older soldier collapsed dramatically immediately on touching the ground who have we here and what have the wicked petersen and his evil friends done to those poor men petersen said the young soldier had now joined the two others in a sitting position on the ground well the officer is major massamo the port commandant and the other two you have already seen we have not broken their legs or anything like that theyre just suffering from a temporary loss of circulation the other four men in the back of the truck had now jumped to the ground walk them around a bit will you petersen said george lifted the major giacomo the young soldier and michael the elderly soldier but the last was not only old but fat and didnt seem at all keen to get to his feet sarina gave petersen what was probably intended to be a withering glance and moved to help her brother petersen looked at lorraine and then at george what shall we do his voice was low stab her or club her not a muscle flickered in georges face he appeared to ponder either plenty of ravines hereabouts lorraine looked at them in perplexity serbocroat evidently was not her language petersen said i can understand now why the boyfriend is along bodyguard and interpeter i know who she is so do i lorraine could be irritated and imperious at the same time and she was good at being both what are you two talking about it is bad manners you know in another day and age she would have stamped her foot it is our native language no offence my dear lorraine you would make life so much easier for yourself if you stopped being suspicious of everyone and yes we were talking about you i thought as much but her voice was a shade less assertive just try to trust people occasionally petersen smiled to rob his words of any offence were as much lookerafterers as your giacomo is will you please understand that we want to take care of you if anything were to happen to you jamie harrison would never forgive us jamie harrison you know jamie harrison her eyes had widened and a halfsmile touched her lips i dont believe it you know captain harrison jamie to you jamie she looked at george do you know him tush tush suspicions again if peter says he knows him then i must know him isnt that so he smiled as colour touched her cheeks my dear i dont blame you of course i know him tall very tall lean brown beard he didnt have a brown beard when i knew him he has now and a moustache brown hair anyway and as they say in english hes terribly terribly english wears a monocle sports it i should say claims he needs it but he doesnt just english she smiled it couldnt be anyone else major massamo and his two men their grimaces bespeaking their still returning circulation were now at least partially mobile petersen retrieved the heavy wicker basket from the back of the truck and led the way up grasscut steps to the stone hut and produced a key sarina looked at the key then at petersen but said nothing petersen caught her glance i told you friends the combination of the creaking hinges as the door swung open and the musty smell from within was indication enough that the place hadnt been used for months the single room which made up the entire hut was icy bleak and sparsely furnished a deal table two benches a few rickety wooden chairs a stove and a pile of cordwood be it ever so humble petersen said briskly first things first he looked at george who had just extracted a bottle of beer from the basket you have your priorities right i have a savage thirst george said with dignity i can slake that and light a stove at the same time youll look after our guests i have a call to make half an hour i hope it was an hour later when petersen returned george was no believer in doing things by half and by that time the hut was a great deal more than pleasantly warm the top of the stove glowed a bright cherry red and the room was stiflingly hot petersen pointedly left the door open and set on the table a second wicker basket he had brought with him more provisions sorry im late we werent worried george said foods ready when you are weve eaten he peered inside the basket petersen had brought tookyou all that time to get that i met some friends sarina said from the doorway wheres the truck round the corner among trees cant be seen from the air you think theyre carrying out an air search for us no one doesnt take chances he sat at the table and made himself a cheese and salami sandwich anyone who needs some sleep had better have it now im going to have some myself we didnt have any last night two or three hours besides i prefer to travel at night and i prefer to sleep at night george said he reached out for another bottle let me be your trusty guard enjoy yourself we did after giovannis cooking anyone would be ravenous petersen set about proving that he was no exception after a few minutes he looked up looked around and said to george where have those pesky girls gone to just left for a walk i suppose petersen shook his head my fault i didnt tell you he rose and went outside the two girls were about forty yards away corne back he called they stopped and turned around he waved a peremptory arm come back they looked at each other and slowly began to retrace their steps george was puzzled whats wrong with a harmless walk petersen lowered his voice so that he couldnt be heard inside the hut ill tell you whats wrong with a harmless walk he told him briefly and george nodded he stopped talking as the girls approached sarina said what is it whats wrong petersen nodded to a small outhouse some yards from the cabin if thats what youre looking for no just a walk whats the harm get inside if you say so sarina smiled at him sweetly would it kill you to tell us why other ranks dont talk to officers in that tone the fact that youre females doesnt alter a thing sarina had stopped smiling petersens own tone was not such as to encourage levity ill tell you why because i say so because you cant do anything without my permission because youre babes in the woods and because ill trust you when you trust me the two girls looked at each other in incomprehension then went inside without a word a bit harsh i would have thought george said you and your middleaged susceptibility sure it was a bit harsh i just wanted them to get the message that they dont wander without permission they could have made it damned awkward for us i suppose so of course i know they could but they dont know they could have for them youre just a big bad bullying wolf and a nasty one to boot irrational they think you are orders for orders sake never mind peter when they come to appreciate your sterling qualities they may yet come to love you inside the hut petersen said nobody is to go outside please george and alex of course and yes giacomo giacomo seated on a bench by the table lifted a drowsy head from his folded arms giacomos not going anywhere michael said not me no then why giacomo petersen was curt youre not giacomo petersen woke two hours later and shook his head to clear it as far as he could tell only the indefatigable george a beaker of beer to hand and the three captives were awake petersen got up and shook the others were going shortly time for tea coffee wine or what you will and then were off he started to feed cordwood into the stove major massamo who had kept remarkably quiet since his gag had been taken off said were going with you youre staying here bound but not gagged you can shout your heads off but noone will hear you he raised a hand to forestall a protest no you wont perish of cold during the long watches of the night youll be more than warm enough until help comes about an hour after we leave ill phone the nearest army post its only about five kilometres from here and tell them where you are they should be here within fifteen minutes of getting the call youre very kind im sure massamo smiled wanly its better than being shot out of hand the royal yugoslav army takes orders from noone and that includes germans and italians when our allies prove to be obstructive were forced to take some action to protect ourselves but we dont shoot them were not barbarians a short time later petersen looked at the three freshlybound captives the stove is stoked theres no possibility of sparks so you wont burn to death youll certainly be freed inside an hour and a half goodbye none of the three prisoners said goodbye to him petersen led the way down the grassy steps and round the first corner the truck was standing in a small clearing without a tree near it sarina said ooh a new truck ooh a new truck petersen mimicked which is exactly what you would have said when youd come back to the hut after finding it its as i say you cant trust babes in the woods major massamo would just have loved to hear you say that he would then have known that we had ditched the old truck and would have called off the hunt for the old truck there must be a search under way by now and when freed ask for a search for another missing truck and broadcast its details its most unlikely but it could have happened and then id have been forced to lumber myself with massamo again giacomo said someone might stumble across the old one not unless someone takes it into his head to go diving into the freezing neretva river and why on earth should anyone be daft enough to do that i drove it off only a very small cliff but the water is deep there a local fisherman told me can it be seen underwater no at this time of year the waters of the neretva are brown and turgid in a few months time when the snow in the mountains melts then the river runs green and clear who worries about what happens in a few months time george said what kindly soul gave you this nice new model not i take it the italian army hardly my fisherman friend who also happens to be the proprietor of the garage i stopped at on the way up here the army has no local repair facilities here and he does the occasional repair job for them he had a few civilian trucks he could have offered me but we both thought this was much more suitable and official wont your friend be held answerable for this not at all weve already wrenched off the padlock at the rear of the garage just in case some soldier happens by tomorrow which is most unlikely as it is sunday come monday morning as a good collaborator should hell go to the italian army authorities and report a case of breaking entering and theft of one army motor vehicle no blame will attach to him the culprits are obvious who else could it be but us sarina said and come monday morning when the search starts come monday morning this truck will probably have joined the old one whatever happens well be a long way away from it by then you are devious youre being silly again this is what you call forward planning get inside the new truck was rather more comfortable and much quieter than the old one as they drove off sarina said im not carping or criticizing but well you do have rather a cavalier attitude towards the property of your allies petersen glanced at her then returned his attention to the road our allies what oh yes of course our allies petersen kept looking ahead he could have become suddenly thoughtful but it was impossible to tell petersens expression did what he told it to do he said that mountain inn yesterday lunchtime remember what george said remember how could i he says so much all the time said about what our allies vaguely vaguely he clucked his tongue in disapproval this augurs ill a radio operator any operative should remember everything that is said our alliance is simply a temporary measure of convenience and expediency we are fighting with the italians george said germans but its the same thing not for them we are fighting for ourselves when they have served their purpose it will be time for them to be gone in the meantime a conflict of interests has arisen between the italians and the germans on the one hand and us on the other our interests come first pity about the trucks but the loss of one or two isnt going to win or lose the war there was a short silence then lorraine said who is going to win this dreadful war major petersen we are id rather youd just call me peter as long as youre otherwise civil that is the two girls exchanged glances if petersen saw the exchange he gave no signs in capljina in the deepening dusk they were halted at an army roadblock a young officer approached shone his torch at a piece of paper in his hand switched it to the trucks plates then played it across the windscreen petersen leaned out of the window dont shine that damned light in our eyes he shouted angrily the light beam dipped immediately sorry sir routine check wrong truck he stepped back saluted and waved them on petersen drove off i didnt like that sarina said what happens when your luck runs out and why did he let us through so easily a young man with taste sensibility and discretion petersen said who is he he said to himself to interfere with an army officer carrying on a torrid affair with two beautiful young ladies the hunt however is on the paper he held had the number of the old truck then he checked driver and passengers a most unusual thing he had been warned to look out for three desperadoes anyone can see that im perfectly respectable and neither of you could be confused with a fat and thin desperado but they must know were with you no must about it they will soon enough but not yet the only two people who knew that you were aboard the ship were the two who are still tied up in the hut back there somebody may have asked questions at the colombo possibly i doubt it even if they had no member of the crew would divulge anything without carlos okay he has that kind of relationship with them sarina said doubtfully carlos might tell them carlos wouldnt volunteer anything he might have a struggle with his conscience but it would be a brief one and duty would lose out hes not going to sell his old girlfriend down the river especially as is like enough there would be shooting lorraine leaned forward and looked at him whos supposed to be the girlfriend me a flight of fancy you know how i ramble on twice more they were stopped at roadblocks both times without incident some minutes after the last check petersen pulled into a layby td like you to get in the back now please its colder there but my fisherman friend did give me some blankets sarina said why because from now on you might be recognized i dont think it likely but lets cater for the unlikely your descriptions will be out any minute now how can they be out until major massamo she broke off and looked at her watch you said youd phone the army post at capljina in an hour that was an hour and twenty minutes ago those men will freeze why did you lie if you cant think and you obviously cant at least shut up just a little white necessary lie what would have happened if i phoned now or had done in the past twenty minutes theyd have sent out a rescue party that all what else heaven help yugoslavia theyd have traced the call and know roughly where i am the call was sent on the hour by my friend from gruda on the capljinaimotski road away to the northwest of here what more natural than we should be making for imotski an italian division is headquartered there so theyll concentrate their search on the imotski area theres an awful lot of places buildings storehouses trucks where a person can hide in a divisional headquarters and as the italians like the germans about as much as they like the yugoslavs and the order for my detention comes from the german hq in rome i dont suppose theyll conduct the search with any great enthusiasm they may have doubleguessed i dont think theyd even bother trying but go in the back anyway petersen descended saw them safely hoisted aboard the rear of the truck returned to the cab and drove off he passed two more roadblocks in both cases he was waved on without stopping before arriving at the town of mostar he drove into the middle of the town crossed the river turned right by the hotel bristol and two minutes later pulled up and stopped the engine he went round to the back of the truck please remain inside he said i should be back in fifteen minutes giacomo said are we permitted to know where we are certainly in a public car park in mostar isnt that rather a public place it was inevitably sarina the more public the better if you really want to hide theres no place like hiding in the open george said you wont forget to tell josip that ive had nothing to eat or drink for days i dont have to tell him hes always known that when petersen returned it was in a small fourteenseater fiat bus which had seen its heyday in the middle twenties the driver was a small lean man with a swarthy complexion a ferocious black moustache glittering eyes and a seemingly boundless source of energy this is josip petersen said josip greeted george and alex with great enthusiasm they were obviously acquaintances of old standing petersen didnt bother to introduce him to the others get your stuff into the bus were using the bus because josip doesnt care too much to have an italian army lorry parked outside the front door of his hotel hotel sarina said were going to stay in a hotel when you travel with us george said expansively you may expect nothing but the best the hotel when they arrived there didnt look like the best the approach to it could not have been more uninviting josip parked the bus in a garage and led the way along a narrow winding lane that was not even wide enough to accommodate a car fetching up at a heavy wooden door back entrance petersen said josip runs a perfectly respectable hotel but he doesnt care to attract too much attention by bringing so many people in at once they passed through a short passage into the reception area small but bright and clean now then josip rubbed his hands briskly he was that kind of man if youll just bring your luggage ill show you to your rooms wash and brush up then dinner he spread his hands no ritz but at least you wont go to bed hungry i cant face the stairs yet george said he nodded towards an archway i think ill just go and rest quietly in there barmans off tonight professor youll have to help yourself i can take the rough with the smooth this way ladies in the corridor upstairs sarina turned to petersen and said in a low voice why did your friend call george professor lots of people call him that a nickname you can see why hes always pontificating dinner was rather more than josip had promised it would be but then bosnian innkeepers are renowned for their inventiveness and resourcefulness not to mention acquisitiveness considering the ravaged and warstricken state of the country the meal was a near miracle dalmatian ham grey mullet with an excellent posip white wine and astonishingly venison accompanied by one of the renowned neretva red wines george after remarking darkly that one never knew what the uncertain future held for them thereafter remained silent for an unprecedented fifteen minutes no mean trencherman at the best of times his current exercise in gastronomy bordered on the awesome apart from george his two companions and their host marija josips wife was also at the table small dark and energetic like her husband she was in other ways in marked contrast to him he was intense she was vivacious he was taciturn she was talkative to the point of garrulity she looked at michael and sarina seated some distance away at one small table and at giacomo and lorraine seated about the same distance away at another and lowered her voice your friends are very quiet george swallowed some venison its the food theyre talking all right petersen said you just cant hear them over the champing noise george is making but youre right they are talking very softly josip said why why do they have to murmur or whisper theres nothing to be afraid of here nobody can hear them except us you heard what george said they dont know what the future holds for them this is a whole new experience for them not of course for giacomo but for the other three theyre apprehensive and from their point of view they have every right to be for all they know tomorrow may be their last day on earth it could be yours too josip said the word in the marketplace we hoteliers spend a lot of time in the marketplace is that groups of partisans have bypassed the italian garrison at prozor moved down the rama valley and are in the hills overlooking the road between here and jablanica they may even be astride the road theyre crazy enough for anything what are your plans for tomorrow if i may add hastily one may ask why ever not well have to take to the mountains by and by of course but those three young people dont look much like mountain goats to me so well stick as long as possible to the truck and the road the road to jablanica that is and if you run into the partisans tomorrow can look after itself at the end of the meal giacomo and lorraine rose and crossed to the main table lorraine said i tried to have a walk stretch my legs this afternoon but you stopped me id like to have one now do you mind yes i mean i do mind at the moment this is very much a frontier town youre young beautiful and the streets as the saying goes are full of licentious soldiery even if a patrol stops you you dont speak a word of the language besides its bitterly cold since when did you begin to worry about my health she was back to being her imperious self again giacomo will look after me what you mean is you still dont trust me well yes theres that to it also what do you expect me to do run away report you to to the authorities what authorities there is nothing i can do i know that im concerned solely with your own welfare beautiful girls are not much given to snorting in disbelief but she came close thank you ill come along with you no thank you i dont want you you see george said she doesnt even like you he pushed back his chair but everyone likes george big cheerful likeable george ill come along with you i dont want you either petersen coughed josip said the major is right you know young lady this is a dangerous town after dark your giacomo looks perfectly capable of protecting anyone but there are streets in this town where even the army police patrols wont venture i know where its safe to go and where it isnt she smiled you are very kind sarina said mind if we come too of course not all five michael included buttoned up in their heavy coats and went out leaving petersen and his two companions behind george shrugged his shoulders and sighed to think i used to be the most popular person in yugoslavia that was before i met you of course shall we retire so soon through the archway i meant george led the way and ensconced himself behind the bar counter strange young lady lorraine that is i muse aloud why did she sally forth into the dark and dangerous night she hardly strikes one as a freshair fiend or fitness fanatic neither does sarina two strange young ladies george reached for a bottle of red wine let us concede that the vagaries of womankind especially young womankind are beyond us and concentrate more profitably on this vintage alex said suddenly i dont think theyre all that strange petersen and george gave him their attention alex spoke so seldom far less ventured an opinion that he was invariably listened to when he did speak george said can it be alex that you have observed something that has escaped our attention yes you see i dont talk as much as you do the words sounded offensive but werent meant to be they were simply by way of explanation when youre talking i look and listen and learn while youre listening to yourselves talking the two young ladies seem to have become very friendly i think theyve become too friendly too quickly maybe they really like each other i dont know what i do know is that they dont trust each other i am sure that lorraine went out to learn something i dont know what i think sarina thought the same thing and wanted to find out so shes gone to watch george nodded a judicious head a closely reasoned argument what do you think they both went out to learn how should i know alex sounded mildly irritable i just watch youre the ones who are supposed to think the two girls and their escorts were back even before the three men had finished their bottle of wine which meant that they had returned in very short order indeed the two girls and michael were already slightly bluish with cold and lorraines teeth were positively chattering pleasant stroll petersen said politely very pleasant lorraine said clearly she hadnt forgiven him for whatever sin he was supposed to have committed ive just come to say goodnight what time do we leave in the morning six oclock six oclock if thats too late she ignored him and turned to sarina coming in a moment lorraine left and george said for a nightcap sarina i can recommend this maraschino from zadar after a lifetime she ignored him as lorraine had ignored petersen to whom she now turned and said you lied to me dear me what a thing to say george here his nickname the professor because you said he was loquacious i did not pontificated was the word i used dont quibble nickname dean of the faculty of languages and professor of occidental languages at belgrade university my word petersen said admiringly you are clever how did you find out she smiled i just asked josip well done for you must have come as a shock i mean you had him down as the janitor didnt you she stopped smiling and a faint colour touched her cheeks i did not and why did you lie no lie really its quite unimportant its just that george doesnt like to boast of his modest academic qualifications hes never reached the dizzying heights of a degree in economics and politics in cairo university she coloured again more deeply then smiled a faint smile but a smile i didnt even qualify i didnt deserve that thats true sorry she turned to george but what are you doing i mean a common soldier behind the bar george drew himself up with dignity im a very uncommon soldier yes but i mean a dean a professor george shook his head sadly hurling pluperfect subjunctives at the enemy trenches never won a battle yet sarina stared at him then turned to petersen what on earth does he mean hes back in the groves of academe wherever were going she said with conviction i dont think were going to get there youre mad both of you quite mad five it was threethirty in the morning when petersen woke his watch said so he should not have been able to see his watch because he had switched the light off before going to sleep it was no longer off but it wasnt the light that had wakened him it was something cold and hard pressed against his right cheekbone careful not to move his head petersen swivelled his eyes to take in the man who held the gun and was sitting on a chair beside the bed dressed in a wellcut grey suit he was in his early thirties had a neatly trimmed black moustache of the type made famous by ronald colman before the war a smooth clear complexion an engaging smile and very pale blue very cold eyes petersen reached across a slow hand and gently deflected the barrel of the pistol you need to point that thing at my head with three of your fellowthugs armed to the teeth there were indeed three other men in the bedroom unlike their leader they were a scruffy and villainous looking lot dressed in vaguely paramilitary uniforms but their appearance counted little against the fact that each carried a machinepistol fellow thugs the man on the chair looked pained that makes me a thug too only thugs hold pistols against the heads of sleeping men oh come now major petersen you have the reputation of being a highly dangerous and very violent man how are we to know that you are not holding a loaded pistol in your hand under that blanket petersen slowly withdrew his right hand from under the blanket and turned up his empty palm its under my pillow ah so the man withdrew the gun one respects a professional how did you get in my door was locked signer pijade was most cooperative pijade was josips surname was he now you cant trust anyone these days ive found that out too i begin to believe what people say of you youre not worried are you youre not even concerned about who i might be why should i be youre no friend thats all that matters tome i may be no friend or i may idont honestly know yet im major cipriano you may have heard of me i have yesterday for the first time i feel sorry for you major i really do but i wish i were elsewhere im one of those sensitive souls who feel uncomfortable in hospital wards in the presence of the sick i mean sick cipriano looked mildly astonished but the smile remained me im as fit as a fiddle physically no doubt otherwise a cracked fiddle and one sadly out of tune anyone who works as a hatchetman for that evil and sadistic bastard general granelli has to be sick in the mind and anyone who employs as his hatchetman the psychopathic poisoner alessandro has to be himself a sadist a candidate for a maximumsecurity lunatic asylum ah so alessandro cipriano was either not a man easily to take offence or if he did too clever to show it he gave a message for you you surprise me i thought your poisoner and poisonous friend was in no position to give messages you have seen him then unfortunately no hes still welded up in the fore cabin of the colombo one has to admit major petersen that you are not a man to do things by halfmeasures but i spoke to him he says that when he meets you again youll take a long time to die he wont ill gun him down as i would a mad dog with rabies i dont want to talk any more about your psycho friend what do you want of me im not quite sure yet tell me why do you keep referring to alessandro as a poisoner you dont know i might if i knew what you were talking about you know that he carried knockoutgasgrenades with him yes you knew that he carried a nice little surgical kit with him along with hypodermics and liquids in capsules that caused unconsciousness some form of scopolamine i believe yes do you know that he also carried capsules which when injected led to the victims dying in screaming agony cipriano had stopped smiling thats a lie may i get out of bed cipriano nodded petersen crossed to his rucksack extracted the metal box he had taken from alessandro handed it to cipriano and said take that back to rome or wherever and have the contents of those capsules analyzed i would not drink or selfinject any of them if i were you i threatened to inject your friend with the contents of the missing capsule and he fainted in terror i know nothing about this that i believe where would alessandro get hold of such lethal poison i dont know that either that i dont believe well what do you want of me just come along with us cipriano led the way to the diningroom where petersens six companions were already assembled under the watchful eye of a young italian officer and four armed soldiers cipriano said remain here i know youre too professional to try anything foolish we wont be long george inevitably was relaxed in a carver chair a tankard of beer in his hand alex was looking quietly murderous giacomo just looked thoughtful sarina was tightlipped and pale while the mercurial lorraine oddly enough was expressionless petersen shook his head well well were a fine lot major cipriano has just said i was a professional if that was major cipriano george said thats what he says a fast mover he doesnt look like a major cipriano he doesnt talk like one either as i was about to say george if i were a professional id have posted a guard a patrolling sentry mea culpa i thought we were safe here safe sarina spoke with a wealth of contempt well no harm done lets hope no harm done petersen spread his hands there are always compensations you and lorraine wanted to see me in what shall we say a disadvantaged position well you see it now how do you like it there was no reply two things im surprised they got you alex you can hear a leaf fall they had a gun at sarinas head ah and where is our good friend josip your good friend sarina said acidly will be helping cipriano and his men to find whatever theyre looking for my goodness what a low opinion what an immediate low opinion of my friend who tipped them off that we were here who let them in who gave them the keys or the master key to the bedrooms one of these days petersen said mildly someones going to clobber you young lady youve a waspish tongue and youre far too ready to judge and condemn if that soldier with the gun at your head had taken the second necessary to pull the trigger hed be dead now so of course would you but alex didnt want you to die nobody let them in josip never locks his front door once in getting the keys would be no trouble i dont know who tipped them off ill find out it could even have been you me she stared at him at first stunned and then furious noones above suspicion youve said more than once that i dont trust you if you said that you must have had reasons to think that i have reservations about you what reasons you must be out of your mind she wasnt mad any more just bewildered youve turned pale very suddenly why have you turned pale leave my sister alone michaels voice was an angry shout shes done nothing leave her alone sarina a criminal a traitor shes right you must be out of your mind stop tormenting her who the hell do you think you are an army officer who wouldnt hesitate to instruct a very raw enlisted man boy i should say in the elements of discipline mind you a show of spirit at last but im afraid its mistimed and misplaced meantime you should rest content with the knowledge that you are not under suspicion im supposed to be pleased with that while sarina is under suspicion i dont care whether youre pleased or not look here petersen tetersen whos petersen major petersen to a ranker or sir michael made no reply youre not under suspicion because after youd transmitted this message to rome yesterday morning i rendered your radio inoperable you could have used your sisters tonight but you wouldnt have had the guts not after being caught out the previous night i know youre not very bright but the inference is obvious alex a word with you as brother and sister looked at each other in mingled apprehension incomprehension and dismay alex crossed the room and listened as petersen began talking to him stop the young italian officers voice was sharp petersen looked at him patiently stop what stop talking why ever should i you just let me talk to that young man and girl i understood that i dont understand serbocroat your lack of education doesnt concern me to compound your ignorance were not talking serbocroat but a slavonic dialect understood only by this soldier here the fat gentleman with the beer glass and myself you think perhaps that we are planning a suicidal attack on you three unarmed men against four machineguns and a pistol you cant possibly be so crazy as to think were so crazy what rank are you lieutenant he was a very stiff very correct and very young lieutenant lieutenants dont give orders to majors youre my prisoner i have yet to be informed of that even if i were which legally im not id be major ciprianos prisoner and he would regard me as a very important one and one not to be molested or harmed in any way so dont bother looking at your men if any of them comes over to try to stop or separate us ill take his gun from him and break it over his head and then you might shoot me youd be courtmartialled cashiered and then by the stipulations of the geneva conventions face a firing squad but you know that of course petersen hoped the lieutenant didnt for he himself had no idea but apparently the young man didnt either for he made no further attempt to pursue the matter petersen talked to alex for no more than a minute went behind the bar picked up a wine bottle and glass this without even a raised eyebrow from the young lieutenant who might have been wondering how many men it took to constitute a firing squad and sat down at the table with george they talked in low and seemingly earnest tones and were still talking when cipriano returned with his three soldiers josip and his wife marija cipriano not only looked less buoyant and confident than he had done when he had left the diningroom he was still smiling because he was an habitual smiler but the smile was of such a diminished quality that he looked positively morose i am glad to see that you are enjoying yourselves we might be just a little justifiably annoyed at having our sleep disturbed petersen replenished his glass but we are of a forgiving nature happy and relaxed in our carefree conscience you will join us in a nightcap im sure it would help you to frame a more graceful apology no nightcap thank you but you are correct in saying that an apology is in order i have just made a telephone call to the wise men of your intelligence hq of course yes how did you know where else does all the misinformation come from we as you know are in the same line of business and it happens to us all the time i am genuinely sorry to have inconvenienced you all over a stupid false alarm what false alarm tapers missing from our rome hq some misguided genius on general granellis staff dont know yet who it was but ill find out before the day is over decided that they had fallen if thats the word into the hands of either yourself or one of your group very important papers very topsecret all missing papers are topsecret i have some papers with me myself but i assure you theyre not stolen and how topsecret or important they may be i dont know i know about those papers cipriano waved a dismissive hand and smiled as youre probably well aware those other and much more important papers have never left their safe in rome a topsecret filing clerk careless about filing topsecret documents may one ask what they are about you may and thats all the answer youd get i dont know and even if i did i couldnt tell you i wish you an undisturbed night or whats left of it again my apologies goodbye major petersen goodbye petersen took the extended hand my regards to colonel lunz i will cipriano frowned i hardly know the man in that case my regards to alessandro ill give him more than that he turned to josip and took his hand many thanks signor pijade you have been most helpful we will not forget it was sarina nothing if not resilient who broke the conversational hiatus that followed the departure of cipriano and his men thank you signor pijade most helpful signor pijade we wont forget signor pijade josip looked at her in puzzlement then turned to petersen is the young lady talking to me i think shes addressing the company i dont understand i dont think she does either the young lady as you call her is under the ridiculous impression that you notified major cipriano one assumes she thinks it was by telephone of our presence and then took him and his men on a guided tour of the premises distributing keys where necessary she may of course be trying to divert from herself the suspicion that she is the guilty party sarina made to speak but an outraged marija gave her no chance three quick steps and she was before the suddenly apprehensive sarina the ivoryknuckled fists and arms held rigidly by her sides spoke eloquently of her outrage her eyes were stormy and her clenched teeth remained that way even when she spoke such a beautiful face my dear it is difficult not to hiss when ones teeth are clenched such a delicate complexion and i have long nails should i tear your face because you insult the honour of my husband or would a few slaps hard slaps be enough for a creature like you in the technique of expressing contempt marija pijade had nothing to learn from anyone sarina said nothing the apprehensive expression on her face had given way to one of near shock a soldier not the major hes a civilized man and was not there pointed a gun at me like this dramatically she swung up her right arm and pressed her forefinger against her neck not pointed pushed pushed hard three seconds he said for my husband to hand over the master key i am sure he would not have fired but josip handed over the key at once do you blame him for that slowly dumbly sarina shook her head but do you still think josip betrayed you no i dont know what to think but i dont think that any more i just dont know what to think im sorry marija im truly sorry she smiled wanly a soldier threatened me with a gun too he pressed it in my ear maybe that doesnt make for very clear thinking the cold fury in marijas face gave way to speculation then softened into concern she took an impulsive step forward put her arms round the girl and began to stroke her hair i dont think any of us is thinking very clearly george this over sarinas shoulder what are you thinking of sljivovica george said decisively the universal specific if you read the label on a pellegrino bottle george right away josip rubbed a blue and unshaven chin if sarina and i are not the culprits then were no nearer to an answer who did talk have you no suspicions peter none i dont need any i know who it is you know josip turned to the bar picked up a bottle of sljivovica from a tray george was preparing filled a small glass drained it in two gulps and when hed finished coughing and spluttering said who im not prepared to say at the moment thats not because im intending to prolong anxiety increase tension give the villain enough rope to hang him or herself or anything stupid like that its because i cant prove it yet im not even sure i want to prove it perhaps the person i have in mind was misguided or the action may have been unintentional accidental inadvertent or even done from the best motives from of course the viewpoint of the person concerned unlike sannia here i dont go in much for premature judgements and condemnation peter marijas voice held a warning almost peremptory note she still had an arm around sarinas shoulders sorry marija sorry sarina just my natural nastiness surfacing by the way if you people want to go to bed well of course go but no hurry now change of plan we wont be leaving until the late forenoon tomorrow certainly not before giacomo could i have a quiet word with you have i any option certainly you can always say no giacomo smiled his broad smile stood up and put his hand in his pocket josip if i could buy a bottle of that excellent red wine josip was mildly affronted peter petersens friends pay for nothing in my hotel maybe im not his friend i mean maybe hes not my friend giacomo seemed to find the thought highly amusing thanks all the same he picked up a bottle and two glasses from the bar led the way to a distant table poured wine and said admiringly that marija quite a girl not quite a tartar but no shrinking violet changes her mind a bit quick doesnt she mercurial youd say thats the word seems to know you pretty well has she known you long she does and she has petersen spoke with some feeling twentysix years three months and some days the day she was born my cousin why do you ask curiosity i was beginning to wonder if you knew everyone in the valley well on with the inquisition incidentally i would like to say that im honoured to be the prime suspect andor the chosen villain youre neither a suspect nor villain wrong casting if you wanted say to dispose of george or alex or myself or get your hands on something you thought we had youd use a heavy instrument surreptitious phone calls or secret tipoffs are not in your nature deviousness is not part of your stockintrade well thank you its a disappointment though i take it you want to ask some questions if i may about myself of course fire away no dont fire away let me give you my curriculum vitae behind me lies a blameless existence my life is an open book youre right im montenegrin vladimir was my given name i prefer giacomo in england they called me johnny i still prefer giacomo you lived in england i am english sounds confusing but not really before the war i was a second officer in the merchant navy the yugoslav one i mean i met a beautiful canadian girl in southampton so i left the ship he said it as if it had been the most natural thing in the world to do and petersen could readily understand that for him it had been there was a little difficulty at first at staying on in england but id found an excellent and very understanding boss who was working on a diving contract for the government and who was one experienced diver short id qualified as a diver before joining the merchant marine by and by i got married same girl same girl i became naturalized in august and joined the services on the outbreak of war the following month because i had a masters oceangoing ticket and was a qualified diver who could have been handy at things like sticking limpet mines on to warships in enemy harbours and was a natural for the navy it was inevitable i suppose that they put me into the infantry i went to europe came back by dunkirk then went out to the middle east and youve been in those parts ever since no home leave no home leave so you havent seen your wife in two years family twin girls one stillborn the other died at six months polio giacomos tone was matteroffact almost casual in the early summer of my wife was killed in a luftwaffe attack on portsmouth petersen nodded and said nothing there was nothing to say one wondered why a man like giacomo smiled so much but one did not wonder long i was with the eighth army longrange desert group then some genius finally discovered that i was really a sailor and not a soldier and i joined jellicoes special boat service in the aegean both those hazardous services called for volunteers petersen knew it was pointless to ask giacomo why he had volunteered then the same genius found out some more about me that i was a yugoslav and i was called back to cairo to escort lorraine to her destination and what happens when youve delivered her to her destination when youve delivered her you mean responsibility over from here on i just sit back and relax and go along for the ride they thought i was the best man for the job but they werent to know i was going to have the good luck to meet up with you giacomo poured some more wine leaned back in his chair and smiled broadly i havent a single cousin in the whole of bosnia if its luck i hope it holds my question giacomo of course afterwards id happily turn back now conscience clear but ive got to get a receipt or something from this fellow mihajlovic i think they want me to take up diving again not hard to guess why must have been the same genius who found out that i was an exsailor as michael said in that mountain inn its a funny old world i spent over three years fighting the germans and in a couple of weeks ill be doing the same thing this interlude where im more or less fighting with the germans although i dont expect ill ever see a german in yugoslavia dont like one little bit you heard what george said to michael no point in rehashing it a very brief interlude giacomo you bid your charge a tearful farewell trying not to smile then heighho for the aegean trying not to smile he considered the contents of his glass well perhaps yes and no if this is a funny old world shes a funny young girl in a funny old war mercurial like your cousin temperamental patricianlooking young lady but sadly deficient in patrician sangfroid cool aloof even remote at one moment she can be friendly even affectionate the next the affectionate bit has escaped me so far a certain lack of rapport between you two has not escaped me either she can be sweet and badtempered at the same time which is no small achievement most unenglish i suppose you know shes english you seem to know quite a bit about her i know shes english because george told me so he also told me you were from montenegro ah our professor of languages remarkable linguist with a remarkable ear he could probably give you your home address she tells me you know this captain harrison shes going to work for i know him well so does she used to work for him before peacetime rome he was the manager of the italian branch of an english ballbearing company she was his secretary thats where she learned to speak italian she seems to like him a lot she seems to like men a lot period you havent fallen into her clutches yet giacomo no again the broad smile but im working on it well thanks petersen stood if youll excuse me he crossed to where sarina was sitting td like to talk to you alone i know that sounds ominous but it isnt really what about thats a silly question if i want to talk to you privately i dont talk publicly she rose and michael did the same he said youre not going to talk to her without me george sighed rose wearily to his feet crossed to where michael was standing put his two hamlike hands on the young mans shoulders and sat him in his chair as easily as he would have done a little child michael youre only a private soldier if you were in the american army youd be private soldier second class im a regimental sergeantmajor temporary mind you but effective i dont see why the major should have to be bothered with you i dont see why should have to be bothered with you why should you bother us youre not a boy any more he reached behind him picked up a glass of maraschino from the table and handed it to michael who took it sulkily but did not drink if sarinas kidnapped well all know who did it petersen took the girl up to her room he left the door ajar looked around but not with the air of one expecting to find anything and sniffed the air sarina looked at him coldly and spoke the same way what are you looking for what are you sniffing for everything you do everything you say is unpleasant nasty overbearing superior humiliating oh come on im your guardian angel you dont talk to your guardian angel that way guardian angel you also tell lies you were telling lies in the diningroom you still think i sent a radio message i dont and didnt youre far too nice for anything underhand like that she looked at him warily then almost in startlement as he put his hands lightly on her shoulders but did not try to flinch away youre quick youre intelligent unlike your brother but thats not his fault and ive no doubt you can or could be devious because your face doesnt show much except for the one thing that would disqualify you from espionage youre too transparently honest thats a kind of lefthanded compliment she said doubtfully left or right its true he dropped to his knees felt under the foot of the rather illfitting door stood extracted the key from the inside of the lock and examined it you i locked your door last night of course what did you do with the key i left it in the lock halfturned that way a person with a duplicate key or a master cant push your key through or on to a paper thats been pushed under the door they taught us that in cairo spare me your instructor was probably a tenyearold schoolboy see those two tiny bright indentations on either side of the stem of the key she nodded made by an instrument much prized by the betterclass burglar whos too sophisticated to batter doors open with a sledgehammer a pair of very slender pincers with tips of either carborundum or titanium stainless steel turn any key in a lock you had a visitor during the night somebody took my radio somebody sure enough used it could have been here thats impossible certainly i was tired last night but im not a heavy sleeper maybe you were last night how did you feel when you woke up this morning when you were woken i mean well she hesitated i felt a bit sick really but i thought i was perhaps overtired and hadnt had enough sleep or i was scared im not a great big coward but im not all that brave either and it was the first time anyone had ever pointed a gun at me or perhaps i just wasnt used to the strange food you felt dopey in other words yes you probably were doped i dont suggest flannelfoot crept stealthily in and applied a chloroform pad or anything of the kind for the smell of that lingers for hours some gas that was injected through the keyhole from a nozzled canister that may well have come from the chemists joker shop where alessandro buys his toys in any event i can promise you that you wont be disturbed again tonight and you rest easy in the knowledge that youre not on anyones black list not judged not condemned not even suspected you might at least have the grace to say that im not such an awful monster as you thought she smiled faintly maybe youre not even a monster at all youre going to sleep now she nodded so he said goodnight and closed the door behind him almost an hour elapsed before petersen george and josip were left together in the diningroom the others had been in no hurry to depart the nights events had not been conducive to an immediately renewed slumber and besides they were secure in the knowledge that there would be no early morning start george who had returned to his red wine was making steady inroads on his current uncounted bottle looked and spoke as if he had been on mineral water all the time there was unfortunately not the same lack of evidence about his cigarsmoking an evilsmelling blue haze filled the upper half of the room your friend major cipriano didnt overstay his welcomejosip said hes no friend of mine petersen said never seen him before appearances mean nothing but he seems a reasonable enough character for an intelligence agent that is have you known him long he has been here twice as a bonafide traveller hes no friend thanking me for my help was just an attempt to divert suspicion from whoever tipped him off a feeble attempt he must have known it would fail but probably the best he could think up at the time what was his object in coming here no mystery about that both the germans and italians are suspicious of me i have a message to deliver to the leader of the cetniks on the boat coming across from italy one of his agents an unpleasant character called alessandro tried to get this message from me he wanted to see if it was the same as a copy he was carrying he failed so cipriano got worried and came across to ploce he was tipped off as to our whereabouts came up here almost certainly by light plane and when we were herded down here went through our possessions steamed open the envelope containing my message found that it was unchanged and resealed it exit cipriano baffled but satisfied for the moment anyway george said sarina someone got into her room in the early hours of this morning that was after she had been doped her radio was used to call up cipriano sarina says she trusts me now i dont believe her it is as always george said mournfully every mans and womans hands are against us doped josip was incredulous in my hotel how can anyone be doped in my hotel how can anyone be doped anywhere who was this villain villainess lorraine lorraine that beautiful girl maybe her mind is not as beautiful as the rest of her sarina now lorraine george shook his head sadly the monstrous regiment of women josip said but how do you know simple arithmetic elimination lorraine went for a walk tonight and returned very hurriedly she didnt go for the walks sake she went for something else information you went with her josip do you recall her doing or saying anything odd she didnt do anything just walked and she said very little that should make it easy to remember well she said it was odd that i didnt have the name of the hotel outside i told her i hadnt yet got around to putting it up and that it was the hotel eden she also said it was funny that there were no streets signs up so i gave her the name of the street ah so she got the name and address no yes petersen rose bed i trust youre not going to stay here for the remainder of the night george certainly not george fetched a fresh bottle from behind the bar but we academics must have our moments for meditation at noon that day petersen and his six companions had still not left the hotel eden instead they were just sitting down to a lunch which josip had insisted they have a meal that was to prove to be on a par with the dinner they had had the previous evening but there was one vacant seat josip said where is the professor george petersen said is indisposed in bed acute stomach pains he thinks it must have been something he had to eat last night something he had to eat josip was indignant he had exactly the same to eat as anyone else last night except of course a great deal more of it and nobody else is stricken my food indeed know what ails the professor when i came down early this morning just about two hours after you went to bed the professor was still here still as he said meditating that might help to account for it that might have accounted for it but it didnt account for georges appearance some ten minutes after the meal had commenced he tried to smile wanly but he didnt look wan sorry to be late the major will have told you i was unwell however the cramps have eased a little and i thought i might try a little something to settle the stomach you understand by one oclock georges stomach seemed to have settled in a most remarkable fashion in the fifty minutes that had intervened since his joining the company he had consumed twice as much as anyone else and effortlessly disposed of two large bottles of wine congratulations are in order george giacomo said one moment at deaths door and now well an incredible performance it was nothing george said modestly in many ways i am an incredible man petersen sat on the bed in georges room well satisfactory in one way not well there were two items that one would not have looked for in such an aristocratic young ladys luggage one was a very small leather case with a few highly professional burglarious tools the other was a small metal box with some sachets inside the sachets containing a liquid when squeezed the liquid turned into a gas i sniffed only a very tiny amount an anaesthetic of some kind thats certain the interesting thing is that this little box though smaller than alessandros was made of and lined with the same materials what do we do with this young charmer leave her be shes not dangerous if she were she wouldnt have made so amateurish a mistake you said you knew the identity of the miscreant shes going to wonder why you havent disclosed it let her wonder whats she going to do about it theres that george said theres that six it was snowing heavily and the temperature was below freezing when petersen drove the stolen italian truck out of mostar shortly after two oclock that afternoon the two girls beside him were silent and withdrawn a circumstance that affected petersen not at all relaxed and untroubled he drove as unhurriedly as a man with all the time in the world and after passing unhindered through a checkpoint at potoci slowed down even more an action dictated not by any change of mood but by the nature of the road it was narrow twisting and brokensurfaced and urgently in need of the attentions of road repair gangs who had not passed that way for a long time more importantly they had begun to climb and climb quite steeply as the neretva valley narrowed precipitously on either side of the river which sank further and further below the tortuous road until there was an almost sheer drop of several hundred feet to the foaming river that lay beneath them given the unstable nature of the road the fact that there were no crashbarriers or restraining walls to prevent their sliding off the slippery road and the fact that the river itself increasingly disappeared in the thickening snow squalls it was not a route to lighten the hearts of those of an imaginative or nervous disposition judging by the handclenching and highly apprehensive expression of petersens two frontseat companions they clearly came well within that category petersen had neither comfort or cheer to offer them not through any callous indifference but because on the evidence of their own eyes they wouldnt have believed a word he said anyway their relief was almost palpable when petersen abruptly turned off the road into a narrow gully which suddenly and to the two girls miraculously appeared in the vertical cliffside to their right the road was no road at all just a convoluted rutted track that offered only minimal traction for the almost constantly spinning rear wheels but at least there was no way they could fall off it high walls of rock pressed in closely on both sides perhaps five minutes after leaving the main road petersen stopped cut the engine and dropped down this is as far as we go he said as far as we can go in this truck anyway stay here he walked round to the back of the truck parted the curtains repeated his words and disappeared into the swirling snow he was back within a few minutes sitting beside the driver of a peculiar open vehicle which looked as if it might once have been a small truck that had had both its top and rear sliced off the driver clad in british warm a thick khaki woollen overcoat could have been of any nationality with a fur cap pulled down to eyebrow level a luxuriant black beard and moustache and a pair of hornrimmed sunglasses there wasnt a single distinguishable feature of his face to be seen except for a nose that could have belonged to anyone petersen stepped down as the vehicle came to a halt this is dominic he said hes come to help us along a bit thats a fourwheeldrive vehicle hes got there it can go places where this truck cant but even then it cant go very far perhaps a couple of kilometres dominic will take the two young ladies all our gear and all our blankets i can assure you were going to need those tonight as far as he can then come back for the rest of us well start walking sarina said you mean to tell us you expected this friend of yours to meet us here and at just this time give or take a few minutes i wouldnt be much of a tour guide would i if i got all my connections wrong this truck giacomo said youre surely not going to leave it here why ever not i thought it was your custom to park unwanted italian trucks in the neretva i saw some lovely parking spots in the godawful ravine we just came through a sinful waste besides we might even want it again what matters of course is that our friend major cipriano already knows we have it how would he know that how would he not know it you mean has it not occurred to you that the informer who tipped him off to our presence in the hotel eden would also have given him all the details of our trip from the torpedo boat including those of this vehicle either by radio or before being apparently dragged from an hotel bedroom it doesnt matter we passed through a checkpoint at potoci about an hour ago and the guard didnt even bother to slow us down odd one might think except that he had already been given details of our vehicle recognized it at once and obeyed orders to let us through lets get that stuff out quickly its turned even colder than i thought it would be it had indeed a southeast wind had sprung up a wind from which they would have been sheltered in the neretva valley and was steadily strengthening this would not normally have been a cold wind but this was a wind that paid no attention to meteorological norms it could have been blowing straight from siberia the fourwheeldrive vehicle was loaded with passengers and gear and drove off in a remarkably short time there could be no doubt that dominics sunglasses were in effect snowglasses the five men set out on foot and were picked up some fifteen minutes later by the returning dominic the ride along an even more bumpy and deteriorating track was because of the increase in snow depth and incline uncomfortable and haphazard to a degree and only marginally better and faster than walking none of the passengers was sorry when the truck pulled up at the tracks end outside a ramshackle wooden hut which proved to be its garage inside the two girls were sheltering from the snow they were not alone there were three men boys rather in vaguely paramilitary uniforms and five ponies sarina said where on earth are we home sweet home petersen said well an hour and a half s gentle ride and well be there this is the mountain of prenj more of a massif really the neretva river makes a big uturn here and runs around three sides of it which makes prenj in defensive terms an ideal place to be only two bridges cross the river one to the northwest at jablanica the other to the northeast at konjik and both of those are easily guarded and defended its open to the southeast but no danger threatens from that direction gentle ride you said do those horses canter or gallop i dont like horses theyre ponies not horses and no they dont canter or gallop not on this occasion anyway they wouldnt be stupid enough to try its all uphill and pretty steeply uphill i dont think im going to enjoy this climb youll enjoy the view it was half an hour later and she was enjoying neither the climb nor the view the climb though not impossibly steep was a difficult enough one and the view remarkable though it was engendered in her only a feeling that lay halfway between fascinated horror and paralysed terror the path barely two metres in width and sometimes noticeably less had been gouged out of the side of a slope so steep as to be virtually a cliffside and ascended it by a series a seemingly endless series of hairpin twists and turns with every step the pony took the floor of the narrow valley when it could be seen at all through the driving snow seemed more remotely and vertically distant only she and lorraine had been mounted the other three ponies carried all their securely strapped gear and blankets lorraine was on foot now clutching giacomos arm as if he was her last faint hope on earth petersen walking beside sarinas pony said im afraid youre not enjoying this as much as i would like you to enjoying it she shuddered uncontrollably not with cold back in the hotel i told you i wasnt a great big coward well i am i am im terrified i keep on telling myself its silly its stupid but i cant help it petersen said matteroffactly youre not a coward its been like this since you were a child like what what do you mean vertigo is what i mean anyone can suffer from it some of the bravest men i know some of the most fearsome fighters ive ever met wont climb a stepladder or set foot in a plane yes yes always do you know about it i dont get it but ive seen it too often not to know about it dizziness loss of equilibrium an almost uncontrollable desire to throw yourself over the edge and in the present cases a conviction on your part that your pony is about to jump out into space at any moment thats about it isnt it she nodded dumbly petersen refrained from saying that if shed known about her condition and the yugoslav mountains she should have stayed in cairo instead he moved round the head of the horse and took her stirrupleather in these ponies are more surefooted than we are and by a long way even if it should suffer from a bout of vertigo now and ponies never do i would be the first over the edge and even if you felt like throwing yourself over you cant because im between you and the cliff edge and id stop you and catch you and ill change sides at every corner that way well be sure to make it to the top i wont be so silly as to tell you to sit back and relax all i can say is that youll be feeling a lot better in fifteen minutes or so well be away from this cliff by that time the tremor was still in her voice we will we will they wouldnt be but by that time it would be so dark that she would be unable to see the valley below it was quite some time after dark when they passed through the perimeter of what seemed to be a permanent camp of sorts there were a large number of huts and tents all close together and nearly all illuminated not brightly illuminated for at that remote altitude there was no central power grid and the only small generator available was reserved for the headquarters area for the rest the great majority of the guerrilla soldiers and the inevitable campfollowers there was only the light to be had from oil tallow or coke braziers then there came a quite uninhabited and gently rising slope of perhaps three hundred metres before their small cavalcade fetched up at a large hut with a metal roof and two windows which gave out a surprising amount of light well here we are petersen said home or what youd better call home until you find a better word for it he reached up his hands and swung the shivering girl to the ground she clung to him as if she were trying to prevent herself from falling to the ground which was what she was indeed trying to do my legs feel all funny her voice was low and husky but at least the tremor had gone sure they do ill bet youve never been on a horse before youd win your bet but its not that the way i hung on to that horse clung to it she tried to laugh but it was a poor enough attempt ill be surprised if that poor pony doesnt have bruised ribs for days to come you did very well very well im ashamed of myself i hope you wont go around telling everyone that youve met up with the most cowardly radio operator hi the balkans i wont i wont because i dont go around telling lies i think you may be the bravest girl i ever met after that performance especially after that performance she was still clinging to him clearly still not trusting her balance was silent for a few moments then said i think you may be the kindest man ive ever met good god he was genuinely astonished the strain has been too much after all youve said about me especially after everything i said about you she was still holding him although now only tentatively when they heard the sound of a heavy fist banging on a wooden door and georges booming voice saying open up in the name of the law or common humanity or whatever we have crossed the burning sands and are dying of thirst the door opened almost immediately and a tall thin figure appeared framed in the rectangle of light he came down the two steps and thrust out a hand it cannot be he had an excruciatingly languid oxbridge accent it is george took his hand enough of the formalities at stake there is nothing less than the sacred name of british hospitality goodness gracious the man screwed a monocle an oddlyshaped oval one into his right eye advanced towards lorraine took her hand swept it up in a gesture of exquisite gallantry and kissed it goodness gracious me lorraine chamberlain t he seemed about to embark upon a speech of some length caught sight of petersen and went to meet him peter my boy once again all those dreadful trials and tribulations lie behind you my word i cant tell you how dull and depressing its been here during the two weeks youve been gone dreadful i tell you utterly dreadful petersen smiled hello jamie good to see you again things should improve now george quite illicitly of course has brought you some presents quite a lot of presents they almost broke the back of one of the ponies coming up here presents that go clink he turned to sarina may i introduce captain harrison captain harrison he added with a straight face is english jamie this is sarina von kara jan harrison shook her hand enthusiastically delighted delighted if only you knew how we miss even the commonest amenities of civilization in these benighted parts not of course he added hastily that theres anything common about you my goodness i should say not he looked at petersen the harrisons ill luck runs true to form again we were born under an evil and accursed star do you mean to tell me that you have had the great fortune the honour the pleasure of escorting those two lovely ladies all the way from italy neither of them think there was any fortune honour or pleasure about it i didnt know you had the pleasure of knowing lorraine before giacomo had a sudden but very brief paroxysm of coughing which petersen ignored oh my goodness yes indeed old friends very old worked together once dont you know tell you some time your other new friends petersen introduced giacomo and michael whom harrison welcomed in what was his clearly customary effusive fashion then said well inside inside cant have you all freezing to death in this abominable weather ill have your goods and chattels taken in inside inside inside was surprisingly roomy warm welllit and by guerrilla standards almost comfortable there were three bunks running the length of each side of the room some tall articles of furniture that could have been either cupboards or wardrobes a deal table half a dozen pine chairs the unheard luxury of a couple of rather scruffy armchairs and even two strips of worn and faded carpet at either end of the room were two doors that led presumably to further accommodation harrison closed the outside door behind him have a seat have a seat the captain was much given to repeating himself george if i may suggest ah foolish of me i might have known that any such suggestion was superfluous george had indeed lost no time in doubling in his sparetime role of barman harrison looked around him with an air of proprietorial pride not bad although i say it myself not bad at all you wont find many such havens in this strifetorn land i regret to say that we live in accommodation such as this all too infrequently but when we do we make the best of it electric light if you please you cant hear it but we have the only generator in the base apart from the commander need it for our big radios he pointed to two sixinch diameter pipes angling diagonally upwards along either wall to disappear through the roof central heating of course actually theyre only the stovepipes from our coke and wood stove outside would have it inside but wed all be asphyxiated in minutes and what do we have here george he inspected the contents of a glass george had just handed him george shrugged and said diffidently nothing really highland malt whisky highland malt whisky harrison reverently surveyed the amber liquid sipped it delicately and smiled in rapture where on earth did you get this george friend of mine in rome god bless your roman friends this time assuming his beatific expression in advance harrison sipped again well thats about all the mod cons that door to the left leads to my radio room some nice stuff in there but unfortunately we cant take most of it with us when we travel which again unfortunately is most of the time the other door leads to what i rather splendidly call my sleeping quarters its about the size of a couple of telephone boxes but it does have two cots harrison took another sip from his glass and went on gallantly those quarters naturally i will gladly vacate for the night for the two young ladies you are very kind sarina said doubtfully but i we were supposed to report to the colonel nonsense not to be thought of you are exhausted by your travels your sufferings your privations one has only to look at you i am sure the colonel will gladly wait until the morning is that not so peter tomorrow will be time enough of course well we castaways marooned on a mountain top are always eager for news of the outside world what of the past fortnight my friend petersen put down his untouched glass and rose george will tell you hes a much better raconteur than i am well yes you do rather lack his gift for dramatic embellishment duty calls petersen nodded ah the colonel who else i wont be long when petersen returned he was not alone the two men accompanying him were like himself covered in a heavy coating of snow while they were brushing this off harrison rose courteously and introduced them good evening gentlemen we are honoured he turned to the newcomers let me introduce major rankovic major metrovic two of the colonels senior commanders you venture forth on a wild night gentlemen you mean of course why have we come the speaker major metrovic was a man of medium height dark thickset and cheerful curiosity of course peters movements are always shrouded in mystery and heaven knows we see little enough of new faces from the outer world peter didnt also mention that two of those new faces were young female and speak as a detached observer of course rather extraordinarily goodlooking he may have done he may have done metrovic smiled again you know how it is with my colleague and myself our minds are invariably preoccupied with military matters isnt that so marino marino major rankovic a tall thin darkbearded and rather gloomy character who looked as if he let metrovic do all the smiling for both of them didnt say whether it was so or not he seemed preoccupied and the source of his preoccupation was unquestionably giacomo i asked them along petersen said i felt it was the least i could do to bring some relief into their cheerless lives well welcome welcome harrison looked at his watch wont be long you said what do you call short i wanted to give george a chance to finish his story besides i was detained much questioning and i stopped by at my radio hut to see if youd made off with anything during my absence it seems not perhaps you mislaid the key the radio hut sarina glanced at the door at the end of the room but we heard nothing i mean my radio hut is fifty metres away no mystery there are three radios in the camp one for the colonel one for captain harrison one for me you will be assigned to the colonel lorraine comes here you arranged that i arranged nothing i take orders just like anyone else the colonel arranged it lorraines assignation here was arranged weeks ago theres no secret about it the colonel for reasons that may seem obscure to you but which i understand very well prefers that captain harrisons radio operator like captain harrison himself should not speak or understand serbocroat the basis of the colonels security beliefs is that one should trust nobody you must have a lot in common with the colonel i think thats rather unfair young lady it was metrovic again and he was still smiling i can confirm what the major has said im the gobetween the translator if you like for the colonel and captain harrison like the major i was partly educated in england enough harrison said let us put unworthy thoughts to one side and concentrate on more important things such as hospitality george said such as hospitality as you say be seated please what is your choice gentlemen and ladies of course they all told him what they wanted all that is except major rankovic he crossed to where giacomo was seated and said may i ask what your name is giacomo lifted his eyebrows in slight puzzlement smiled and said giacomo thats an italian name isnt it yes giacomo what just giacomo just giacomo rankovics voice was deep and gravelly it suits you to be mysterious it suits me to mind my own business whats your rank thats my business too ive seen you before not in the army though rijeka split kotor some place like that its possible giacomo was still smiling but the smile no longer extended to his eyes its a small enough world i used to be a sailor youre a yugoslav giacomo petersen was aware could easily have conceded the fact but he knew he wouldnt rankovic was an able soldier but no psychologist im english youre a liar petersen stepped forward and tapped rankovic on the shoulder if i were you marino id quit while i was ahead not mind you that i think you are ahead rankovic turned what do you mean i mean that youre still intact and in one piece keep on like this and youll wake up in hospital wondering if you fell under a train i can vouch for giacomo he is english hes got so long and so distinguished a war record that he puts any man in this room to shame while youve been pottering around the mountains hes been righting in france and belgium and north africa and the aegean and usually on assignments so dangerous that you couldnt even begin to wonder what they were like look at his face marino look at it and youll look into the face of war rankovic studied giacomo closely im not a fool i never questioned his qualities as a soldier i was curious that is all and maybe like the colonel and yourself i am not much given to trusting anyone i did not intend to give offence and i didnt intend to take any giacomo said his good humour had returned youre suspicious im touchy a bad mix let me suggest a good mix or rather no mix at all you never mix malt whisky with anything do you george not even water sacrilege you were right on one count major i am english but i was born in yugoslavia let us drink to yugoslavia a toast no man could quarrel with rankovic said there were no handshakes no protestations of eternal friendship it was at best a truce rankovic no actor still had his reservations about giacomo petersen for his part had none considerably later in the evening an understandably much more relaxed and mellowed atmosphere had descended upon the company some of them had paid a brief visit to a mess four hundred metres distant for an evening meal sarina and lorraine had pointblank and as it turned out wisely refused to brave the near blizzard that was now sweeping by outside michael inevitably had elected to remain with them and giacomo after a quick exchange of glances with petersen had announced that he was not hungry giacomo did not have to have it spelt out to him that even among his own people petersen was suspicious of practically everybody in sight compared to josip pijades midday offerings the meal was a gastronomic disaster it was no fault of the cetnik cooks as elsewhere through that ravaged country food was at a premium and fine food almost wholly unobtainable still it was a sad comedown from the fleshpots of italy and mostar and even george could manage no more than two platefuls of the fatty mutton and beans which constituted the main and only course of the evening they had left as soon as decency permitted back in harrisons radio hut their relative sufferings were soon forgotten theres no place like home harrison announced to nobody in particular although it would have been unfair to call him inebriated it would have been fair to pass the opinion that he wasnt stone cold sober either he bent an appreciative gaze on the glass in his hand nectar emboldens me george has given me a very comprehensive account of your activities over the past two weeks he has nothowever told me why you went to rome in the first place nor did you seek to enlighten me on your return thats because i didnt know myself harrison nodded sagely that makes sense you go all the way to rome and back and you dont know why i was just carrying a message i didnt know the contents is one permitted to ask if you know the contents now one is permitted i do ah is one further permitted to know the contents in your own language jamie i dont know whether im permitted or not all i can say is that this is purely a military matter strictly i am not a military man a commander of troops im an espionage agent espionage agents dont wage battles were far too clever for that or cowardly harrison looked at metro vie and rankovic in turn youre military men if im to believe half you tell me you wage battles metrovic smiled were not as clever as peter you know the contents of the message of course peters discretion does him credit but its not really necessary within a couple of days the news will be common knowledge throughout the camp we the germans italians ourselves and the ustasa are to launch an allout offensive against the partisans we shall annihilate titoland the germans have given the name of the attack operation weiss the partisans will doubtless call it the fourth offensive harrison seemed unimpressed he said doubtfully that means of course that youve made three other offensives already those didnt get you very far did they metrovic was unruffled i know its easy to say but this time really will be different theyre cornered theyre trapped theyve no way out no place left to go they havent a single plane fighter or bomber we have squadrons upon squadrons they havent a tank not even a single effective antiaircraft gun at the most they have fifteen thousand men most of them starving weak sick and untrained we have almost a hundred thousand men welltrained and fit and titos final weakness his achilles heel you might say is his lack of mobility he is known to have at least three thousand wounded men on his hands it will be no contest i dont say i look forward to it but it will be a massacre are you a betting man james not against odds like that im not like peter here i lay no claim to being a military man never even saw a uniform until three years ago but if the action is so imminent why are you drinking wine at your leisured ease instead of being hunched over your war maps sticking flags in here flags in there drawing up your battle plans or whatever youre supposed to be doing in cases like this metrovic laughed three excellent reasons first the offensive is not imminent its two weeks away yet second all the plans have already been drawn up and all the troops are already in position or will be in a few days third the main assault takes place at bihac where the partisan forces are at present centred and thats over two hundred kilometres northwest of here were not taking part in that were staying just where we are in case the partisans are so foolish or optimistic or suicidal to try to break out to the southeast stopping them from crossing the neretva in the remote possibility of a few stragglers getting as far as here would be only a formality he paused and gazed at a darkened window there may well be a fourth possibility if the weather worsens or even continues like this the best laid plans of the high command could well go wrong a postponement would be inevitable nobodys going to be moving around the mountains in those impossible weather conditions for days to come thats for sure days might well become weeks well yes harrison said one sees why you face the future with a certain resigned fortitude on the basis of what you say the chances are good that you wont even become involved at all for myself i hope your prognosis is correct as ive said im no man of war and ive become quite attached to these rather comfortable quarters and do you peter expect to hibernate along with us no if the colonel has nothing for me in the morning and he gave no indication tonight that he would have then i shall be on my way the following morning provided of course that were not up to our ears in snowdrifts whither away if one is permitted to ask yes a certain italian intelligence officer is taking an undue amount of interest in me hes trying either to discredit me or hamper me in my operations has tried i should say i would like to find out why metrovic said in what way has he tried peter he and a gang of his thugs held us up in a mostar hotel in the early hours of this morning looking for something i suppose whether they found it or not i dont know shortly before that on the boat coming from italy some of his minions tried to carry out a night attack on us they failed but not for the want of trying for they were carrying syringes and lethal drugs which they were more than prepared to use goodness me harrison looked suitably appalled what happened it was all quite painless really george said with satisfaction we welded them up in a cabin on the boat last heard of they were still there harrison looked reproachfully at george missed this out in your stirring account of your activities didnt you discretion discretion this italian intelligence officer metrovic said is of course an ally with some allies as we know you dont need enemies when you meet up with this ally what are you going to do question him or kill him the major seemed to regard that as a very natural query kill him sarina looked and was shocked that nice man kill him ithought you rather liked him liked him hes reasonable personable smiling openfaced has a firm handshake and looks you straight in the eye anyone can tell at once that hes a member of the criminal classes he was prepared to kill me by proxy mind you through his hatchetman alessandro which if anything makes it an even more heinous intention on his part so why shouldnt i be prepared to preempt him but i wont at least not right away i just want to ask him a few questions but but you might not even be able to find him ill find him and if he refuses to answer hell answer there was the same chilling certainty in the voice she touched her lips with the back of her hand and fell silent metrovic his face thoughtful said youre not the man to ask questions unless youre pretty certain of the answers in advance youre after confirmation of something could you not have obtained this confirmation at the hotel you mentioned certainly but i didnt want the place littered with corpses not all of which might have been theirs id promised to deliver this lot intact first everything in its due turn confirmation i want confirmation of why italy is planning to pull out of this war that they want out i dont for a moment doubt their people never wanted this war their army navy and air force never wanted it remember when wavells army in north africa overwhelmed the italians there was a picture taken ust after the last battle a picture that was to become worldfamous it showed about a thousand italian prisoners being marched off to their barbed wire cages escorted by three british soldiers the sun was so hot that the soldiers had given their rifles to three of the prisoners to carry that about sums up the italian attitude to the war given a cause that is close to their hearts the italians can fight as gallantly as any people on earth this cause is not close to their hearts it couldnt be further away from it this is germanys war and they dont like fighting germanys war because basically they dont like the germans it has been repeatedly claimed both by the italians and the british that the italians are at bottom probritish the truth is of course that theyre just proitalian noone is more acutely aware of this than the italian high command but theres more to it of course than just patriotism theres no lack of firstclass minds in the italian high command and its my belief that they are convinced even at this early stage that the germans are going to lose the war petersen looked round the room it may not be your belief it may not be my belief but thats irrelevant what matters is that im convinced it is their belief and that they are even now figuring out a way to arrive at an accommodation for want of a better word with the british and americans this accommodation of course would take the form of a fullscale surrender but of course it would be nothing of the sort it would involve fullscale cooperation upon the part of the italians with every aspect of the british and american forces just short of the frontline engagement of their troops in the front line you seem very sure about this peter metrovic said how can you be so sure because i have access to sources and information that none of you has i am in constant touch with both italian and german forces in this country and as you know im a frequent visitor to italy and have talked to literally hundreds of italians there both military men and civilians i am neither literally deaf nor figuratively dumb i know for instance that italian intelligence and german intelligence are barely on civil speaking terms with each other and most certainly do not trust each other round the nearest corner in the street general granelli head of italian intelligence and ciprianos boss cipriano is this intelligence major i was talking about is an evil and warped character but outandout brilliant he knows the situation and the options as well as anyone and is in no doubt that the germans are going to go down in dust and flames and has no intention of joining them there hes also pretty certain that i know quite well what the true situation is and that if i start voicing my doubts my convictions rather out loud i could be a positive danger to him i think hes been twice on the point of having me eliminated and has twice changed his mind at the last minute i know theres going to be a third time which is one reason why i want to get out of here before cipriano or some other comes in the guise of a loyal ally naturally and arranges for an accident to happen to me but the main reason of course for my departure is to get to their linkman before he gets to me linkman linkman harrison shook his head in bafflement you speak in riddles peter a riddle with a childishly easy answer if the germans go down who else is going to go down with them ahha as youve just said ahha all those who have fought with them thats who including us if you were general granelli and with granellis keen eye to the future which of the opposing forces in yugoslavia would you back good lord harrison sounded slightly stunned he looked around the room the others if not quite stunned looked for the most part deeply pensive not least rankovic and metrovic what you are saying is that granelli and this major cipriano are working handinhand with the partisans and that cipriano is the master doubleagent petersen rubbed his chin with his hand glanced briefly at harrison sighed poured himself some more red wine and did not deign to answer petersens radio shack did not begin to compare in magnificence with harrisons which they had left only a few moments previously a premature departure arising directly from the conversational hiatus that had ensued immediately after harrisons last words a lacuna that went on and on and on harrison and the two cetnik officers were sunk in profound reverie sarina and lorraine by their expressions not by words had made it clear that their aversion to petersen had not only returned but was in fuller flood than ever and alex and michael as ever had nothing to say those two master conversationalists george and giacomo had battled bravely but only briefly on it was a lost cause the hut would have been big enough to serve as a onecar garage if the car were small enough three beds a table three chairs a cooking stove and that was all the radio room was a tiny office next door i am sad and disturbed george said profoundly disturbed he poured himself a large glass of wine and drank half of it in one apparently endless gulp just to show how profoundly disturbed he was sad perhaps is a better word the realization that ones life and ones lifework has been a failure is a bitter pill to swallow the damage to ones pride and selfesteem is irreparable the effect overall is crushing i know what you mean petersen said sympathetically ive felt that myself george might not have heard him you will not have forgotten the days when you were my student in belgrade who could ever as you said yourself not more than a hundred times a walk with you through the rosearboured groves of academe was an experience to remain with one always remember the precepts i preached the eternal verities i cherished honour honesty straightforwardness the pure in mind the open heart the outright contempt for deceit deception dishonesty we were remember to go through the darkness of this world guided solely by the light of the everlasting flame of truth yes george i am a broken man im sorry george seven there were six of them in all and six tougher looking and more villainous characters it would have been almost impossible to imagine far less find there was a curious likeness about them they were all just over medium height all lean and broadshouldered all clad exactly alike khaki trousers tucked into high boots belted khaki canvas jacket over a khaki tunic and khaki forage caps they carried no badges no identification marks all were armed in precisely the same fashion machinepistols in hands a revolver at waist level and hunting knives stuck into a sheath on the right boot their faces were dark and still their eyes quiet and watchful they were dangerous men surprise had been complete resistance even the thought of a token resistance unthinkable the same company as had been in harrisons hut the previous evening had been there just a few minutes before eight that evening when the outside door had burst open and three men had been inside the door with levelled guns before anyone could even react now there were six inside and the door was closed one of the intruders a little shorter and a little broader than the others took a pace forward my name is crai it was the serbocroat word for black you will take off your weapons one by one and place them on the floor he nodded at metrovic you begin within a minute every gun in the room at least every visible gun was lying on the floor crni beckoned lorraine pick up those guns and put them on that table there you will not of course be so stupid as to even think of firing any of them lorraine had no thought of firing any of them her hands were shaking so much that she had some difficulty in picking them up when they were on the table crni said are either of you two young ladies armed theyre not petersen said i guarantee it if you find a weapon on their persons or in their bags you can shoot me crni looked at him almost quizzically reached under his canvas jacket and produced a piece of paper from his tunic whats your name petersen ah major peter petersen at the very top of the list one can see theyre not carrying a weapon on their persons but their bags ive searched them the two girls momentarily stopped being apprehensive and exchanged indignant glances crni smiled slightly you should have told them i believe you if any man here is carrying a gun on his person and conceals the fact then if i find it ill shoot him through the heart crnis matteroffact tone carried an unpleasant degree of conviction theres no need to go around making all those ludicrous threats george said complainingly if its cooperation you want im your man he produced an automatic from the depths of his clothing and nudged alex in the ribs dont be foolish i dont think this fellow crni has any sense of humour alex scowled and threw a similar automatic on the table thank you crni consulted his list you of course have to be the learned professor number two on our list he looked up at alex and you must be number three it says here alex brackets assassin not much of a character reference well bear that in mind he turned to one of his men edvard those coats hanging there search them no need petersen said just the one on the left thats mine righthand pocket you are cooperative crni said im a professional too i know that i know quite a lot about you rather ive been told quite a lot he looked at the gun edvard had brought him i didnt know they issued silenced lugers to the royal yugoslav army they dont a friend gave it to me of course i have five other names on this list he looked at harrison you must be captain james harrison why must i there are two officers in yugoslavia who wear monocles and you must be giacomo just the one name giacomo same question description giacomo smiled flattering no just accurate he looked at michael and you by elimination must be michael von karajan two ladies he looked at lorraine youre lorraine chamberlain yes she smiled wanly you have my description too sarina von karajan bears a remarkable resemblance to her twin brother crni said patiently you eight are coming with me george said may i ask a question no i think thats downright uncivil george said plaintively and unfair what if i wanted to go to the toilet i take it you are the resident comedian crni said coldly i hope your sense of humour bears with you in the days to come major im going to hold you personally responsible for the conduct of your group petersen smiled if anyone tries to run away youll shoot me i wouldnt have put it as crudely as that major major this major that major crai captain crni captain he said briefly i prefer crni do i have to be an they dont send a messboy to bring in apparently notorious criminals nobodys said youre a criminal not yet he looked at the two cetnick officers your names metrovic said im major metrovic this is major ranked ive heard of you he turned to petersen you eight will be taking your baggage with you thats nice george said what is well george said reasonably if were taking our baggage with us its hardly likely that youre going to shoot us out of hand to be a comedian is bad enough to be a buffoon insufferable he turned back to petersen how many of the eight have their baggage here men and women i mean five three of us have our baggage in a hut about fifty yards away myself and those two gentlemen here slavko sava this to two of his men this man alex will show you where the hut is bring the baggage back search it very carefully first and be just as careful in watching this man he has an appalling record for a fleeting moment the expression on alexs face made crnis statement more than credible hurry nothing watch everything he looked at ms watch we have forty minutes left in less than half that time all the luggage had been packed and collected george said i know im not allowed to ask a question so may i make a statement oh thats a question too i want to make a statement im thirsty i see no harm thank you george had opened a bottle and downed a glass of wine in what appeared nearimpossible time try that other bottle crni suggested george blinked frowned but willingly did what he was told seems satisfactory my men could do with a specific against the cold seems satisfactory george stared at him you suggest that i could have doctored some bottles poisoned bottles against just such an impossible eventuality me a faculty dean a learned academic a a some academics are more learned than others youd have done the same three of his men took a glass the other two held their unwavering guns there was a discouraging certainty about everything crni said and did he seemed to take the minutest precautions against anything untoward including as george had said the impossible eventuality metrovic said what happens to major rankovic and myself you remain behind dead alive bound and gagged but alive we are not cetniks we do not murder helpless soldiers far less helpless civilians nor do we of course not those thousands of muslims who perished in south serbia died by their own hands cowards were they not metrovic made no reply and how many more thousand serbians men women and children were massacred in croatia with the most bestial atrocities ever recorded in the balkans just because of their religion we had no hand in that the ustasa are no soldiers just undisciplined terrorists the ustasa are your allies just as the germans are your allies remember kragujevac major where the partisans killed ten germans and the germans rounded up and shot five thousand yugoslav citizens marched the children out of schools and shot them in droves until even the execution squads were sickened and mutinied your allies remember the retreat from uzice where the german tanks rolled backwards and forwards over the fields until all the wounded partisans lying there had been crushed to death your allies the guilt of your murderous friends is your guilt too much as we would like to treat you in the same fashion we will not i have my orders and besides you are at least technically our allies crnis voice was heavy with contempt metrovic said you are partisans god forbid the revulsion in crnis face was momentary but unmistakable do we look like guerrilla rabble we are paratroopers of the murge division the murge was the best italian division then operating in southeast europe your allies as i said crni gestured towards the eight prisoners you harbour a nest of vipers you cant recognize them as such far less know what to do with them we can do both metrovic looked at petersen i think i owe you an apology peter last night i didnt know whether to believe your assessment or not it seemed so fantastic not any more you were right much good thats done me my forecast i mean i was twentyfour hours out tie them up crni said immediately after leaving the hut to nobodys surprise they were joined by two other soldiers crni was not the man to spend almost an hour inside any place without having a guard posted outside that those were elite troops was beyond question it was a bitter night with driving snow a biting wind and zero visibility but crni and his men not only put up with the extreme conditions but seemed positively to revel in them metrovii had been wrong more than once the previous night he had said that nobody was going to be moving around the mountains in those impossible weather conditions for days to come crni and his men were there to prove him wrong once they were well clear of the camp crni and his men produced torches the prisoners were arranged so that they trudged on in single file through the deepening snow it was already almost kneehigh while four of the guards walked on either side of them by and by at a command from crni they halted crni said here im afraid we have to tie you up your wrists behind your backs im surprised you havent done it before petersen said im even more surprised that you want to do it now you have in mind to kill us all perhaps explain yourself we are at the head of that track leading down the mountainside to the valley floor how do you know because the wind hasnt changed since yesterday you have ponies two only for the ladies that was all you required yesterday you are very well informed and the rest of us are to have our hands bound behind our backs just in case we feel tempted to give you or one of your men a brisk shove over the precipice mistake captain crni mistake out of character indeed two reasons the surface of that rock is broken and slippery with either ice or hardpacked snow if a man slips on that surface how is he with his hands tied behind his back going to grab at the ground to stop himself sliding over the edge and hows he going to be able to maintain his balance in the first place with his hands tied to keep your balance you have to be able to stretch both arms wide you should know that its as good as sending people to their deaths second reason is that your men dont have to be anywhere near the prisoners four of them well in advance four well behind the prisoners maybe with a couple of torches in the middle what positive action could the prisoners take then except commit suicide by jumping off the precipice i can assure you that none of them is in the least suicidally inclined i am not a mountaineer major petersen i take your point another request if i may let giacomo and myself walk alongside the young ladies ponies im afraid the young ladies dont care too much for heights i dont want you even the prospect of the descent had brought a note of hysteria into sarinas voice i dont want you she doesnt want you crni said drily she doesnt know what shes saying its just a personal opinion of mine she suffers severely from vertigo what have i to gain by saying so nothing that i can see as they lined up by the clifftop giacomo leading a pony brushed by petersen and said sotto voce that major was quite a performance he vanished into the snow with petersen looking thoughtfully after him a steep descent in treacherous conditions is always more difficult and dangerous than a steep ascent and so it was to prove in this case it is also slower and it took them all of forty minutes to reach the valley floor but reach it they did without incident sarina spoke for the first time since they had left the plateau we are down safe and sound as ever was she gave a long quavering sigh thank you you dont need to hold my horse any more tony whatever you say i was getting quite attached to the old lady im sorry she said quickly i didnt mean it that way its just that youre soso awful and so kind no im the person who is awful youre the person theyre after as is only fitting my rank theyre going to kill you arent they kill me what a thought why should they a little discreet questioning perhaps you said yourself that general granelli is an evil man general granelli is in rome havent you given any thought as to what is going to happen to you no i havent her voice was dull i dont think i care whats going to happen to me that said petersen is what is known as a conversation stopper they moved on in silence the still heavily falling snow now at their backs until crni called a halt he had the beam of his torch directed at the italian army truck petersen had stolen two days previously it was thoughtful of you major to leave transport so conveniently at hand if we can help our allies you couldnt arriveby this it was thoughtful but not necessary crni moved the beam of the torch another even larger italian truck was parked close by all of you into that truck edvard come with me the eight prisoners were ushered into the larger truck and made to sit on the floor crowded up against the cab five soldiers followed them and sat on side benches towards the rear five torch beams were directed forwards and in the light of the beams it was possible to see that an equal number of machinepistol barrels were pointed in the same direction the engine started up and the truck jolted off five minutes later they turned right on to the main neretva road ah harrison said bound for the bright lights of jablanica i see on this road where else petersen said after that the road divides we could be going anywhere i would guess that jablanica is as far as we go its getting late even crni and his men have to sleep shortly afterwards the driver stopped both the truck and the engine i dont see any bright lights around here harrison said what are those devils up to now nothing that concerns us petersen said our driver is just waiting for crni and his friend edvard to join him up front why they have their own transport had its in the neretva now that lad who met us yesterday you remember dominic the driver with the sunglasses would not have failed to note the make and number of the truck when and if rankovic and metrovic are discovered and freed which may not be for hours yet the proverbial hue and cry may be raised may i say i doubt it the colonel is not a man to publicize the security gaps in his forces but crni doesnt strike me as a man to take the slightest chance objection giacomo said if your friend cipriano is the man behind this he already knows the description of the truck so whats thepoint in destroying the truck giacomo you sadden me we dont know that cipriano is the man behind this but if he is he wouldnt want to leave any clue that would point a finger at him in connection with the abduction remember that officially he and the colonel are sworn allies faithful unto death voices came from up front a door banged the engine started again and the truck moved off that must be the way of it giacomo said to noone in particular pity about the truck though they jolted on through the snowfilled night torch beams and barrels still pointed at them until suddenly harrison said at last civilization its a long time since ive seen city lights harrison as was his custom was exaggerating to a considerable extent a few dim lights appeared occasionally through the opened back of the truck but hardly enough to lend the impression that they were driving through a metropolis by and by the truck pulled off on to a side road climbed briefly then stopped the guards apparently knew where they were and did not wait for orders they jumped down lined up torches and guns as before and were joined by crni down he said this is as far as we go tonight they lowered themselves to the ground and looked around them as far as could be judged from the light of the beams the building before them appeared to be standing alone and seemed vaguely to be shaped like a chalet but in the darkness and the snow it could have been just any building crni led the way inside the hallway presented a pleasant contrast to the swirling cold of the wintry night outside the furnishings were sparse enough just a table a few chairs and a dresser but it was warm a small log fire burned in a low hearth and warmly if not brightly lit electric power had not yet reached this part of jablanica and suspended oil lamps were the norm door to the left is a bathroom crni said can be used anytime there will of course he added unnecessarily be a guard in the hall all the time the other door to the left leads to the main quarters of the house and does not concern you neither do those stairs he led the way to an opened door on the far right and ushered them inside your quarters for the night the room was unmistakably such as one would only find in a chalet it was long wide and low with beamed ceiling knotted pine walls and an oak parquet floor cushioned benches ran both sides of the room there was a table several armchairs a very commodious dresser some cupboards and shelves and best of all a rather splendid log fire several times the size of the one in the hallway the only immediately incongruous note was struck by some canvas cots blankets and pillows stacked neatly in one corner it was george inevitably who discovered the second and not so immediately incongruous note he pulled back the curtains covering one of the two windows and examined with interest the massive bars on the outside it is part of the general malaise of our times he said sadly with the onset of war the deterioration of standards is as immediate as it is inevitable the rules of honour decency and common law go by default and moral degeneracy rears its ugly head he let fall the curtains a wise precaution very wise one feels sure that the streets of jablanica are infested by burglars housebreakers footpads and other criminals of that ilk crni ignored him and looked at petersen who was inspecting the bedding yes major i can count too only six cots we have a room upstairs for the two young ladies considerate you were very sure of yourself werent you captain crni oh no he wasnt george said disgustedly a blind man could drive a coach and four with bells on through mihajlovics perimeter for a second time crni ignored him he had probably come to the conclusion that this was the only way to treat him we may or may not move on tomorrow it certainly wont be early depends entirely on the weather from now on our travel will be mainly on foot should you be hungry theres food in that cupboard there the contents of that high dresser will be of more interest to the professor ah george opened the doors and looked appreciatively at what was in effect a comprehensively stocked miniature bar the window oars are superfluous captain crni i shall not be moving on tonight even if you could where would you go when you ladies want to sleep let the guard know and ill show you your room i may or may not wish to interrogate you later it depends on a call i have to make you surprise me petersen said i thought the phone system had ceased to work radio of course we do have one in fact we have four the other three being yours and those two very modern sets belonging to the von karajans i expect the code books will also prove to be useful he left behind him a profound and fairly lengthy silence interrupted only by the sound of a cork being extracted from a bottle michael was the first to speak radios he said bitterly code books he looked accusingly at petersen you know what this means dont you nothing crni was amusing himself all it means is that we will be put to the trouble of getting ourselves a new tode what else do you think theyll do after they discover the books are missing they will do this of course not to protect themselves against their enemies but against their friends the germans have twice broken the code that we use among ourselves he looked at harrison who had seated himself crosslegged in an arm chair before the fire and was contemplating a glass of wine that george had just handed him for a man who has just been driven from house and home jamie or snatched from it which comes to the same thing you dont look all that downcast to me im not harrison said comfortably no reason to be never thought id find quarters better than my last one but i was wrong i mean look a real log fire carpe diem as the man says what peter do you think the future holds for us i wouldnt know how to use a crystal ball pity it would have been nice to think that i might see the white cliffs of dover again i dont see why not no ones after your blood i mean you havent been up to anything have you jamie such as sending clandestine radio messages in codes unknown to us to parties also unknown to us certainly not harrison was unruffled im not that kind of person i dont have any secrets and im useless with a radio anyway so you think i might see the white cliffs again do you think ill be seeing the old homestead on mount prenj again i should think it highly unlikely well now a fairly confident prediction and without a crystal ball for that i dont need a crystal ball a person who has occupied the ah delicate position you have done will never again be employed in that capacity after hes been captured by the enemy torturing brainwashing reconversion to a doubleagent that sort of thing standard practice youd never be trusted again i say thats a bit thick isnt it a blameless stainless reputation its hardly my fault that ive been captured it wouldnt have happened if you people had looked after me a bit better thank you george i will have a little more now that im happily out of that place ive no intention of ever returning to it not unless im dragged forcibly back to it kicking and screaming in the accepted fashion he raised his glass your health peter you have taken an aversion to the people the cetniks the colonel myself a profound aversion well not to you although i must admit i dont care overmuch for what might be called your military politics youre a total enigma to me peter but id rather have you on my side than against me as for the rest i despise them an extraordinary position for an ally to find himself in is it not sl think ill have some wine too george if i may well yes jamie its true you have made your discontent might even say displeasure rather guardedly evident from time to time but i thought you were doing no more than exercising every soldiers inalienable right to complain loudly and at length about every conceivable aspect of army life he sipped his wine thoughtfully one gathers there was something a littlemore to it than that a little more there was a great deal more harrison sipped his wine and gazed at the burning logs a man relaxed at peace with himself in spite of the fact that the future looks somewhat uncertain in some ways i owe our captain cmi a favour hes done no more than to preempt my decision my intention to leave mount prenj and its miserable inhabitants at the first convenient opportunity had it not been for the unexpected happening of the past couple of hours youd have discovered that id already made an official request for an official recall but of course as matters stood before the appearance of captain crni i wouldnt have made any such disclosures anyway i could have misjudged you jamie indeed you could he looked around the room to see if there was anyone else misjudging him but there was noone thinking along those lines a magnet to the iron filings he had the undivided attention of every person in the room so you didnt dont like us i should have thought that i had made that abundantly clear i may be no soldier and the good lord knows that im not but im no clown either all appearances to the contrary im educated after a fashion in practically any intellectual field that matters the average soldier is a virtual illiterate im not educated in the way george is i dont float around in cloudcuckooland or wander among the groves of academe george looked profoundly hurt and reached for the wine bottle i have been educated in a more practical fashion wouldnt you agree lorraine i would she smiled and said as if by rote bsc msc amiee amimeche oh hes educated all right i used to be jamess secretary well well well petersen said the world grows even smaller giacomo covered his face with his hand bachelor of science master of science we understand george said as for the rest it sounds as if he was coming down with a terminal illness associate member of the institute of electrical engineers lorraine said associate member of the institute of mechanical engineers its unimportant harrison was impatient point is ive been trained to observe evaluate and analyze ive been out here less than two months but i can tell you it took only a fraction of that time and a minimum of observation evaluation and analysis to realize that britain was backing the wrong horse in the yugoslav stakes i speak as a british officer i dont want to sound overly dramatic but britain is locked literally in mortal combat with germany how do we defeat the germans by fighting them and killing them how should we judge our allies or potential allies what yardstick should we use one only one are they fighting and killing germans is mihajlovic is he hell hes fighting with the germans alongside the germans tito every german soldier caught in the sights of a partisan rifle is a dead man yet those fools and dolts and idiots in london keep sending supplies to mihajlovic a man who is in effect their sworn enemy i am ashamed for my own people the only possible reason for this god knows its no excuse is that britains war as far as the balkans is concerned is being run by politicians and soldiers and politicians are almost as naive and illiterate as soldiers george said you speak harsh words about your own people james shut up no sorry george i didnt mean that but in spite or maybe because of your vast education youre just as naive and illiterate as any of them harsh but true how does this extraordinary situation come about mihajlovic is a near machiavellian genius in international diplomacy tito is too busy killing germans to have any time for any such thing as far back as september mihajlovic and his cetniks instead of fighting the germans were busy establishing contacts with your precious royalist government in london yes peter petersen precious i said and precious i did not mean they dont give a damn about the unimaginable sufferings of the yugoslav people all they want to do is to regain royal power and if its over the bodies of one or two millions of their countrymen so much the worse for their countrymen and of course mihajlovic when contacting king peter and his socalled advisers could hardly help contacting the british government as well what a bonus and naturally at the same time he contacted the british forces in the middle east for all i know the dunderheaded brass hats in cairo may still regard the colonel as the great white hope for yugoslavia he gestured towards sarina and michael in fact the dunderheads unquestionably still do look at this gullible young couple here specially trained by the british to come to the aid and comfort of the gallant cetniks were not gullible sarinas voice was strained her hands twisted together and she could have been close to either anger or tears we werent trained by the british we were trained by the americans and we didnt come to give aid and comfort to the cetniks there are no american radio operator schools in cairo only british if you received american training it was because the british wanted it that way harrisons tone was as cool and discouraging as his face i think youre gullible i think you tell lies and i believe you came to help the cetniks i also think youre a fine actress good for you jamie petersen said approvingly you got one thing right there she is a fine actress but shes not gullible she doesnt tell lies well maybe one or two little white ones and she didnt come to help us both harrison and sarina stared at him in astonishment harrison said how on earth can you say that intuition intuition harrison was for harrison being heavily sardonic if your intuition is on a par with your judgement you can mothball the two of them together and dont try to sidetrack me hasnt it struck you as ironic that when you and your precious cetniks harrison was very fond of the word precious and used it always in its most derogatory sense with telling effect were receiving arms and payments from the germans italians and nedics quisling serb regime that you were simultaneously receiving arms and payments from the western allies this mark you at a time when you were fighting along with the germans italians and ustasa in an attempt to destroy the partisans britains only real allies in yugoslavia have some more wine jamie thank you george harrison shook his head i confess myself to being totally baffled and when i say that i mean baffled all round by you cetniks and by my own people cant really be that there are none so blind as will not see are you so gagged and blinkered by your allconsuming and wholly misguided sense of patriotism by your blind allegiance to a discredited royalty that your myopic eyes are so reduced to a tendegree field of tunnel vision that you have no concept of the three hundred and fifty degree of peripheral vision that lies beyond are my people in london similarly affected they have to be they have to be for what else could explain the inexplicable the incomprehensible idiocy of keeping on sending supplies to mihajlovic when they have before them incontrovertible evidence that he is actively collaborating with the germans ill bet you couldnt say that again petersen said admiringly all the big words i mean as you say jamie its all probably reduced to a factor of vision what lies in the eye of the beholder he rose crossed over to the fireplace and sat down beside sarina this is not really a switch were talking about the same thing how did you enjoy your teteatete with the colonel this morning teteatete i didnt have any teteatete with him michael and i just reported to him you told us to or have you forgotten ive forgotten nothing but i think you have walls have ears not original but still true she glanced quickly at michael then back again i dont know what youre talking about walls also have eyes stop browbeating my sister michael shouted browbeating asking a simple question is browbeating if thats what you call browbeating maybe i should start beating you about the brow you were there too of course you got anything to tell me you have you know i already know what your answer should be your truthful answer ive got nothing to tell you nothing nothing at all youre a lousy actor also youre too vehement by half ive had enough of you petersen michael was breathing quickly and shallowly enough of your bullying my sister and me he jumped to his feet if you think im going to stand youre not going to stand michael george had come up behind michael and laid his hands on his shoulders youre going to sit michael sat if you cant keep quiet ill have to tie and gag you major petersen is asking questions good lord harrison was or seemed outraged this is a bit thick george a bit highhanded i must say peter i dont think youre any longer in a position to and if you dont keep quiet george said with a trace of weariness in his voice ill do the same thing to you to me no question this time the outrage was genuine me an officer a captain in the british army by god giacomo youre an englishman i appeal to you appeal is denied i wouldnt hurt an officers feelings by telling him to shut up but i think the major is trying to establish something you may not like his military philosophy but at least you should keep an open mind and i think sarina should too i think youre both being foolish harrison muttered my god twice and subsided petersen said thanks giacomo sarina if you think im trying to hurt you or harm you then you are as giacomo says being foolish i couldnt and wouldnt i want to help did you and the colonel have or not have a private conversation we talked if thats what you mean of course you talked if i sound a bit exasperated its pardonable what did you talk about me no yes i mean among other things among other things he mimicked what other things just other things just generally thats a lie you talked just about me and maybe a bit about colonel lunz remember walls can have both ears and eyes and you cant remember what you said when you sold me down the river which is where i am now how many pieces of silver did the good colonel give you i never did she was breathing quickly now and there were patches of red high up on her cheeks i didnt betray you i didnt i didnt and all for a little piece of paper i hope you got your due you earned your thirty pieces you didnt know that id picked up the paper later did you he brought a piece of paper out from his tunic and unfolded it this one she stared at it dully looked at him equally dully put her elbows on her knees her face in her hands i dont know whats going on her voice was muffled i dont know any more i know youre a bad man a wicked man but i didnt betray you i know you didnt he reached out a gentle hand and touched her shoulder but i know whats going on i have done all along im sorry if i hurt you but i had to get you to say it why couldnt you have admitted it in the first place or have you forgotten what i said only yesterday morning forgotten what she took her hands from her face and looked at him it was difficult to say if the hazel eyes were still dull for there were tears in them that youre far too nice and too transparently honest to do anything underhand there were three pieces of paper the one i gave to the colonel this one id made out before leaving rome never picked anything up after your talk with him and the one colonel lunz had given to you you are clever arent you shed wiped the tears from her eyes and they werent dull any more just mad cleverer than you are anyway petersen said cheerfully for some inexplicable reason lunz thought that i might be some kind of spy or double agent and change the message forge a different set of orders but i didnt did i the message i gave the colonel was the one i received and it checked with the copy lunz had given you paradoxically of course you being a woman this annoyed you if i had been a spy a sort of reconverted renegade who had gone over to the other side you would have been no end pleased wouldnt you you might have respected me even liked me a little well i remained an unreconstructed cetnik you were aware of course that if i had changed the orders that mihajlovic would have had me executed a little colour drained from her face and she touched her hand to her lips of course you were unaware not only are you incapable of doubledealing not only are you incapable of thinking along doubledealing lines youre not even capable of thinking of the consequences to the doubledealer who has overplayed his hand how an otherwise intelligent girl well never mind as ive said before in this nasty espionage world leave the thinking to those who are capable of it why did you do it sarina why did i do what all of a sudden she seemed quite defenceless she said almost in a monotone what am i going to be accused of now nothing my dear i promise you nothing i was just wondering although im sure i know why how it came about that you went along with this underground deal with colonel lunz something so completely alien to your nature it was because it was your only way into yugoslavia if you had refused hed have refused you entrance so ive answered my own question petersen rose wine george wine all this talk is thirsty work what is not common knowledge george said is that listening is even thirstier work petersen lifted his replenished glass and turned towards harrison to your health jamie as a british officer of course yes yes of course clutching his glass harrison struggled to his feet of course your health ah well extenuating circumstances old boy how was i and a gentleman of course of course he was still confused a gentleman were you being a gentleman jamie when you called her a gullible liar and an aider and comforter to us miserable lot this lovely and charming lady is not only not that shes something youve been looking for something to gladden your patriotic heart a true blue loyalist and not a true blue royalist a patriot in your best sense of the word what you would call a yugoslav as dedicated a partisan as one can be who has never seen a partisan in her life thats why she and her brother came back to this country the hard way to give as you would put it in your customary stirring language jamie their services to their country ie the partisans harrison put down his glass crossed to where sarina was sitting stooped low lifted the back of her hand and kissed it your servant maam thats an apology george said for an english officer petersen said that is as an english officer would say a jolly handsome apology hes not the only one whos due to make an apology michael wasnt actually shuffling his feet but he looked as if he would have liked to major petersen i have no apology michael petersen said hastily no apology if id a sister like that i wouldnt even talk to her tormentor in this case me id clobber him over the head with a two by four so if i dont apologise to your sister for what ive done to her dont you apologize to me thank you very much sir he hesitated may i ask how long youve known that sarina and i were well what you say we are from the first time i saw you rather let me say i suspected something was far wrong when i met you in that rome apartment you were both stiff awkward ill at ease reserved even truculent no smile on the lips no song in the heart none of the eagerness the youthful enthusiasm of those marching off into a glorious future ultracautious ultrasuspicious wrong attitude altogether if youd been flying red flags you couldnt have indicated more clearly that something was weighing heavily on your minds your pasts were so blameless so your concern was obviously with future problems such as became evident quite soon how you were going to transfer yourselves to the partisan camp after you had arrived at our hq your sister lost little time in giving you away it was in the mountain inn when she tried to convince me of her royalist sympathies told me she was a pal of king peters prince as he was then i never did her indignation was unconvincing i just met him a few times sarina the tone was mildly reproving she said nothing how often must i tell you oh all right she said shes never met him in her life she sympathized with me about his club foot young lads as fit as a fiddle wouldnt know a club foot if he saw one well all this is of interest but im afraid only academic interest oh i dont know giacomo said its of more than academic interest to me he was as always smiling but in the circumstances it was difficult to say what he was smiling about however as a matter of academic interest im totally in agreement with those kids sorry i mean sarina and michael i dont want to fight mean i dont want to fight in those damned mountains the aegean and the royal navy will do me very nicely thank you but if i have to itll be with the partisans youre like jamie petersen said if youre going to fight anybody its going to be the germans i think i made that pretty clear to you back in the hotel eden you did its still only a matter of academic interest what are you going to do about it how do you intend going about joining your guerrilla friends giacomo smiled ill wait for a break you could wait for ever peter there was a note of appeal almost desperation in harrisons voice i know you owe us nothing that you have no responsibility for us any more but there must be a way however different our philosophies were all in this together come on peter we could settle our differences afterwards meantimewell a man of your infinite resources and jamie petersen said gently cant you see the fence down the middle of this room george alex and i are on one side you five are on the other well you the von karajans and giacomo are i dont know about lorraine its a mile high that fence jamie and not for climbing i see his point captain harrison giacomo said the fence is not for climbing besides my pride wouldnt let me try it i must say major its not like you to leave loose ends lying around lorraine here doesnt she fit into a category for our edification i mean category i dont know and not to give you offence lorraine but i dont really care now it doesnt matter not any more he sat down glass in hand and said no more as far as anyone could tell major petersen had for the first time in their experience lapsed into a brooding silence it was a silence punctuated only by the occasional glugglug as george topped empty wineglasses that stretched on and uncomfortably on until lorraine said suddenly and sharply whats wrong please whats wrong speaking to me petersen said yes youre staring at me you keep on staring at me being on the wrong side of a fence doesnt stop a man from having good taste giacomo said i wasnt aware of it petersen said he smiled besides as giacomo said its no hardship im sorry i was a long long way away thats all and speaking of staring giacomo said cheerfully sarinas no slouch at it either her eyes havent left your face since you started your rodin the thinker bit there are deep currents hereabouts do you know what i think i think shes thinking oh do be quiet giacomo she sounded positively cross well i suppose were all thinking one way or another petersen said heaven knows weve plenty to think about you jamie youre sunk in a pretty profound gloom the bright lights no the white cliffs no ah the lights of home harrison smiled and said nothing whats she like jamie whats she like harrison smiled again shrugged and looked at lorraine jennys wonderful lorraine said quietly i think shes the most wonderful person in the world shes my best friend and james doesnt deserve her shes worth ten of him harrison smiled like a man who was wellpleased with himself and reached for his wineglass if he was wounded he hid it well petersen looked away until his eyes lighted casually on giacomo who nodded almost imperceptibly petersen smiled slightly and looked away twenty more minutes passed partly in desultory conversation but mainly in silence before the door opened and edvard entered major petersen petersen rose giacomo made to speak but petersen forestalled him dont say it thumbscrews he was back inside five minutes giacomo looked disappointed no thumbscrews no thumbscrews i would like to say that theyre bringing out a rack and that youre next no rack but youre next giacomo left harrison said what was it like what did they want very humane very civilized what you would expect of crni lots of questions some very personal but i just gave them name rank and regiment which is all youre legally required to give they didnt press the matter giacomo was back in even less time than petersen disappointing he said very disappointing theyd never have made the spanish inquisition the courtesy of your presence captain harrison harrison was away a little longer than either but not much he returned looking very thoughtful youre next lorraine me she stood and hesitated well if i dont go i suppose theyll come for me it would be most unseemly petersen said weve survived whats a lions den to an english girl like you she nodded and left but left reluctantly petersen said how was it jamie an urbane lot as you say seemed to know a surprising amount about me no questions that had any military bearing that i could see lorraine was absent for at least fifteen minutes when she returned she was rather pale and although there were no tears on her cheeks it seemed clear that she had been crying sarina looked at petersen harrison and giacomo shook her head and put her arm round lorraines shoulders theyre a gallant lot arent they lorraine chivalrous concerned she gave them a withering glance maybe theyre just shy whos next they didnt ask to see anyone what did they do to you lorraine nothing do you mean no no they didnt touch me it was just some of the questions they asked her voice trailed off please sarina id rather not talk about it maraschino george said authoritatively he took her by the arm seated her and proffered a small glass she took it smiled gratefully and said nothing crni came in accompanied by edvard he was for the first time anyone had seen relaxed and smiling i have some news for you i hope you will find it good news youre not even armed george said how do you know we wont break every bone in your bodies better still use you as hostage to escape we are desperate men would you do that professor no some wine thank you professor good news at least i think its good news for the von karajans captain harrison and giacomo i am sorry that we have been guilty of a small deception but it was necessary in the circumstances we are not members of the murge division we are thank heavens not even italians we are just commonorgarden members of a partisan reconnaissance group partisans there was no excitement in sarinas voice just incomprehension tinged with disbelief crni smiled its true partisans harrison shook his head pon my soul partisans well now i mean yes he shook his head then his voice rose an octave partisans is it true sarina had crni by the arms and was actually shaking him is it true of course its true she searched his eyes as if searching for the truth then suddenly put her arm around him and hugged him she was very still for a moment then released him and stepped back im sorry she said i shouldnt have done that he smiled theres no regulation that says that a young recruit female may not hug an officer not of course to make a practice of it theres that too of course she smiled uncertainly theres something else no not really were terribly glad to see you glad harrison said glad the initial shock absorbed he was in a state bordering on euphoria nothing less than a merciful providence has sent you our way it wasnt a merciful providence captain harrison it was a radio message when my commanding officer says move i move thats the something else you wouldnt talk about miss von karajan your fears are groundless military regulations dont allow me to shoot my boss your boss she looked at him then petersen then back at crni i dont understand crni sighed youre quite right peter you too giacomo no espionage material among this lot if there were they wouldnt have to be hit over the head with the obvious were both partisans were both in intelligence i am the ranking subordinate officer he is the deputy chief im sure that makes everything clear perfectly george said he handed crni a glass your wine ivan he turned to sarina he doesnt really like being called crni and dont clench your fists all right all right this is life in a nutshell decisions decisions do you kiss him or do you hit him the bantering note left georges voice if youre mad because youve been fooled then youre a fool there was no other way you and your hurt pride youve got your partisans and he hasnt to face a firing squad dont you know how to be glad girl or is there no room for emotions like relief and gratitude in the minds of you spoilt young aristocrats george she was shocked less because of the words than the tone she had never heard before george i am so selfish never his good humour instantly restored he squeezed her shoulders its just that i thought it would rather spoil the flavour of the moment if you were to give peter a black eye he glanced sideways harrison his forehead on his forearms on the table was softly pounding the table with his fist and muttering to himself you are not well captain harrison my god my god my god the pounding with the fist continued a sljivovica george said harrison lifted his head and the awful thing is that i am cursed with total recall that he added irrelevantly was why i was so good at passing exams i can remember every word i said in that stirring speech about patriotism and duty and loyalty and myopic idiocy and cant go on i cant you mustnt reproach yourself jamie petersen said think what it did for our morale if there was any justice any compassion in this world harrison said this floor would open up beneath me at this very moment a british officer i called myself thereby meaning there was no other a highly skilled observer evaluator analyzer good god total recall i tell you total recall its hell im sorry i missed that speech crni said pity petersen said still youve heard about jamie s total recall he can repeat it toy you verbatim any time you want spare the vanquished harrison said i heard what you said to sarina george but i remain bitter fooled fooled fooled and doubly bitter because peter didnt trust me but you trusted giacomo didnt you he knew i told giacomo nothing petersen said he guessed hes a soldier and im not well thats for sure how did you guess giacomo i heard what you heard i heard the major telling suggesting rather to captain crni that his intention to rope us up before descending that cliff path was dangerous captain crni is not the man to take an order or suggestion from anyone so then i knew of course i missed it so you didnt trust any of us did you peter i didnt i had to know where i stood with you all lots of odd things have been happening in rome and ever since we left rome i had to know youd have done the same me i wouldnt have noticed anything odd in the first place when did you come to the decision that you were free to talk and why did you decide to talk my god when i come to think of it when have you ever been free to talk my word i cant imagine it i just cant can you sarina living the life of a lie surrounded by enemies one false move one unconsidered slip one careless word and pouf and he spent almost half his time with us ah but i spent the other half with our own people holiday you might say oh god holiday i knew and i havent known you long that you were something different but this but this it passes my comprehension and you a man like you youre only the deputy chief id love to meet the man you call chief i dont call him chief i call him lots of other things but not that as for loving to meet him you dont have to bother youve already met him in fact youve described him big fat clown naive and illiterate who spends his time floating around in cloudcuckooland or was it the groves of academe i dont remember harrison spilled the contents of his glass on the table he looked dazed i dont believe it nobody does im his right arm only in charge of field operations as you know he seldom accompanies me this mission was different but then this was an unusually important mission couldnt be trusted to bunglers like me michael approached george a certain awed incredulity in his face but in mostar you told me you were a sergeant major a tiny prevarication george waved his hand in airy dismissal inevitable in this line of business tiny prevarications i mean but i did say it was a temporary not substantive rank general major good god michael was overcome i mean sir its too much harrison didnt even notice when george courteously refilled his glass its really too much too much for the reeling mind to encompass maybe i havent such a mind after all tell me next that im adolph hitler and id seriously consider the possibility he looked at george shook his head and drained half his glass you see before you a man trying to find his way back to reality now where was i ah yes i was asking you when you came to the decision you were free to talk when you told me or lorraine did about your jenny ah yes of course jenny i see it was plain that harrison was quite baffled he suddenly physically shook himself what the hell has jenny got to do with this nothing directly ah jenny lorraine the question that captain crni asked me through there lorraine said in a quiet voice what question james he asked me if i knew giancarlo tremino you know carlos of course i said yes i knew him very well he looked down at his glass perhaps i shouldnt have answered i mean they werent torturing me or anything maybe i dont have such a mind after all it wasnt your fault james lorraine said you werent to know besides theres been no harm done how do you know theres been no harm done lorraine sarina sounded bitter i know it wasnt captain harrisons fault and i know it wasnt really captain crni who asked the question dont you know that major petersen always finds out what he wants are we still to regard ourselves as prisoners in this room captain crni good god no as far as im concerned the house is yours anyway you dont ask me major petersen is in charge or you george she smiled faintly sorry im not used to the general major yet quite frankly neither am i george is fine he smiled and wagged a finger at her dont try to spread dissension in the ranks outside my head office which at the moment is a disused shepherds hut up near bihac peter is in sole charge i just point in the general direction and then get out of the way if you know youre not in his class as im wise enough to know you dont interfere with the best field operative there is could i speak to you major in the hall ominous he said and picked up his glass very ominous he followed her out and closed the door behind them well she hesitated i dont know quite how to say this i think if you dont know what to say and youre still at the thinking stage why waste my time in this really melodramatic fashion its not silly its not dramatic and youre not going to make me mad what youve just said sums you up superior cutting contemptuous never making allowances for peoples faults and weaknesses and at the same time you can be the most thoughtful and kind person i know its not just that youre unbearable youre unknowable jekyll and hyde the dr jekyll bit i like and admire youre brave george thinks youre brilliant you take incredible risks that would destroy a person like me and best of all youre very good at looking after people anyway i knew last night that you couldnt belong to those people petersen smiled i wont give you the chance of telling me again how nasty i am so i wont say youre being wise after the event youre wrong she said quietly it was something that major metrovic said last night about titos achilles heel his lack of mobility his three thousand wounded men in any civilized war if there is such a thing those men would be left to the enemy who would treat them in hospital this is no civilized war they would be massacred you could never be a party to that i have my points but you did not bring me out here to point those out i did not its the mr hyde side oh i dont want to lecture but i dislike that side it hurts me and it baffles me that a man so physically kind can in other ways be so cold detached uncaring to the point of not being quite human oh dear or as jamie would put it i say i say its true in order to gain your own ends you can be you are indifferent to peoples feelings to the point of cruelty lorraine yes lorraine well well i thought it was axiomatic that two lovely ladies automatically disliked each other she seized his upper arms dont change the subject i must tell alex about this tell him what she said warily he thinks you detest one another tell alex hes a fool shes a lovely person and you are tearing her to pieces petersen nodded shes being torn to pieces all right but im not the person whos doing the tearing she looked closely at him her eyes moving from one of his to the other as if hoping that would help her find the truth then who is if i told you youd just go and tell her she said nothing just kept up her intense scrutiny of his face she knows who is but i dont want her to think that its public knowledge she looked away two things maybe deep down you do have some finer feelings after all she looked at his eyes again and halfsmiled and you dont trust me id like to try shes a good honest patriotic british citizen and shes working for the italian secret service specifically for major cipriano and she may well be responsible however indirectly for the deaths of an untold number of my fellow countrymen i dont believe it i dont believe it her eyes were wide and full of horror and her voice shook i dont i dont i dont i know you dont he said gently thats because you dont want to believe it i didnt want to believe it myself i do now i can prove it do you think im so stupid as to say i can prove a thing when i cant or dont you believe me either i dont know what to believe she said wildly yes i do i do i do know what to believe i dont believe lorraine could be like that too lovely a person too honest too good too true yes yes thats what i believe thats what i believed too thats what i still believe her grip on his arms tightened and she looked at him almost beseechingly please please dont make fun of me shes being blackmailed blackmailed blackmailed how could anyone blackmail lorraine she looked away was silent for some seconds then looked back again its something to do with carlos isnt it yes indirectly he looked at her curiously how did you know that because shes in love with him sarina said impatiently how do you know that this time he was openly surprised because im a woman ah well yes i suppose that explains it and because you had captain crni ask her about carlos but i knew before that anyone could see it heres one who didnt he thought well hindsight retrospect yes but i said only indirectly nobody would be stupid enough to use carlos as a blackmail weapon theyd find themselves with a doubleedged sword in their hands but sure hes part of it well shed actually arrived at the stage where she had started shaking him no mean feat with a person of petersens bulk whats the other part of it i know or i think i know the other part of it but i havent any proof tell me what you think you think because shes honest and good and true that she has led a blameless life that she cant possibly have any guilty secrets goon i dont think shes got any guilty secrets either unless you call having an illegitimate child a guilty secret which i dont she took her right hand away from his arm and touched her lips she was shocked not by what he had said but because of its implications carlos is a doctor he sounded tired and for the first time since she had met him he looked tired he qualified in rome lorraine lived with him during the time she was jamie harrisons secretary they have a son aged two and a half its my belief that hes been kidnapped ill find out for sure when i have a knife at ciprianos throat she stared at him in silence two tears trickled slowly down her cheeks eight at nine oclock the next morning jablanica looked so much like an idealized christmas postcard that it was almost unreal untrue in its breathtaking beauty the snow had stopped the clouds were gone the sun shone from a clear pale blue sky and the air on the windless slopes where the trees hung heavy with snow was crisp and pellucid and very cold it required only the sound of sleighbells to complete the illusion but peace on earth and goodwill to all men were the last considerations in the thoughts of those gathered around the breakfast table that morning petersen his chin on his hand and his coffee growing cold before him was obviously lost in contemplation harrison who showed remarkably little aftereffects from the considerable amount of wine he had found necessary to drown his chagrin and bring himself once more face to face with reality said a penny for them peter my boy my thoughts theyd be worth a lot more than that to the people im thinking about not may i add hastily that they include any of those sitting around the table and not only do you look pensive harrison went on but i detect a slight diminution in the usual early morning ebullience the sparkling cheer you found sleep hard to come by the change of beds perhaps as i sleep in a different bed practically every night in life that would hardly be a factor otherwise id be dead by this time fact is i was up nearly all night with either george or ivan in the radio room you couldnt possibly have heard it but there was a long and violent thunderstorm during the night thats why we have cloudless skies this morning and both transmission and reception were close on impossible ah that explains it would it be in order to ask who you were talking to during the long watches of the night certainly no secrets no secrets harrisons expression of disbelief was only fleeting and he made no comment we had of course to contact our hq in bihac and warn them of the impending attack that alone took almost two hours you should have used my radio michael said its got a remarkable range we did it was no better than the other oh then perhaps you should have used me after all i do know that equipment of course you do but then our people in bihac dont know navajo which is the only code you are familiar with michael looked at him his mouth fallen slightly open how on earth did you know that i mean ive got no code books he tapped his head its all up here you sent a message just after colonel lunz and i had been talking to you you may be a good radio operator michael but otherwise you shouldnt be allowed out without a minder sarina said dont forget i was there also two minders ill bet you never even checked to see if the room was bugged good god michael looked at his sister bugged did you how could you have known we were going to stay it could have been bugged it wasnt george was listening on the balcony george you talked in plain language george said it wasnt any european language hed ever heard you had an american instructor the americans labour under the happy delusion that navajo is unbreakable now you tell me george said he seemed in no way upset sorry busy i forgot peters expertise in espionage is matched only by his expertise in codes the two go handinglove makes up codes at the time breaks them too remember he said the germans had twice broken the cetnik code they didnt peter gave them the information not that they know that nothing like spreading dissension among allies harrison said how do you know the germans didnt monitor and break your transmission last night impossible only two people know my codes me and the receiver never use the same code twice you cant break a code on a single transmission thats fine but not trying to be awkward old boy will this information be of any use to your partisans wont the germans know that youve been kidnapped or disappeared or whatever and might pass this message on if they did surely they would change their plan of attack dont you think i have considered this jamie you simply dont even begin to know the balkans how could you after less than a couple of months what do you know of the deviousness the plotting and counterplotting the rivalries the jealousies the selfseeking the total regard for ones own power base the distrusts the obsession for personal gain the vast gulf between the occidental and byzantine minds i dont think theres even a remote chance of the germans finding out consider who knows ive got the plans as far as the colonel is concerned there are only two plans hes got both and ive never seen a copy why should he think so metrovic will have given him the name of cipriano but ill bet the colonel has never heard of him and even if he has whats he going to tell him even if he did tell him cipriano would be too smart to believe it was the murge division a commando unit like ivans never discloses their true identity again apart from the fact that the colonels pride would probably stop him anyway from letting anyone know that his defences have been breached he could be machiavellian enough to want the germans to be taken by surprise not of course in order that they should be defeated but that they should suffer severe casualties sure he wants the partisans destroyed but when and if it happens he wants the germans out of the country basically theyre both his natural enemies and even if the germans did eventually find out so what its too late to change plans and anyway there are no other plans they could make there is no alternative i have to agree harrison said theyll go ahead as planned forewarned one takes it is forearmed a satisfactory nights work no it was unimportant they would almost certainly have found out in any case we have a considerable number of reliable contacts throughout the country in the areas held by the germans italians cetniks and ustasa and thats most of the country there are reliable solid citizens or are so regarded by the germans italians cetniks and ustasa who while cheerfully collaborating with the enemy send us regular and uptodate reports of the latest enemy troop movements in other words they are partisan spies their reports are far from complete but enough to give tito and his staff a fair indication of the enemys intentions i suppose that happens in every war harrison said but i didnt know the partisans had spies in the enemys camp we have had from the very beginning we couldnt have survived otherwise what took up most of our time last night was the distressing discovery well we first suspected it about ten weeks ago that the enemy have spies in our camp even more distressing was the discovery that they had spies in the partisan hq in retrospect it was naive of us we should have suspected the possibility and taken precautions long ago in fairness to us we werent complacent we were just under the fond misapprehension that every partisan was a burning patriot some alas burn less brightly than others this and not acting as message boys for general von lohr is what has been occupying george alex and myself in italy in the past two weeks it was a matter of such vital importance that george was actually sufficiently motivated to drag himself away from his snug retreats in bihac and mount prenj those spies in our camp had become a major threat to our security we were trying to uncover the italian connection that there was and is an italian connection is beyond dispute not german not cetnik not ustasa specifically italian for it has been the italian murge division firstclass mountain troops that have been causing us all the trouble our partisans are as good probably even better mountain troops but hundreds of them have been killed by the murge division in the past few months never in pitched battle invariably in isolated oneoff incidents a patrol a localized troop movement a transfer of wounded to a supposedly safer area a reconnaissance group behind enemy lines it came to the stage where none of those was immune to a lightning strike by specialized murge units who apparently knew always exactly where to strike when to strike how to strike they even seemed to know the number and composition of the partisan groups they would be attacking even the approximate number of the groups themselves our smallscale guerrilla movements were becoming very hampered almost paralysed and a partisans armys survival depends almost exclusively on mobility flexibility and longrange reconnaissance the murge of course were receiving precise advance information of our movements the information had to be coming from a person or persons in the neighbourhood of our hq those secret messages messages which led hundreds of men to their deaths were not of course written down addressed to the enemy and dropped in the nearest letterbox they were sent by radio petersen broke off as if to collect his thoughts his eyes wandering unseeingly as it seemed round the table lorraine he could see was unnaturally pale sarina had her hands clasped tightly together petersen appeared to notice nothing ill carry on for a moment george said at this time you must understand that peter has been overcome by his habitual modesty peter couldnt believe that the traitors could be any longserving partisans neither could i peter suggested that we check the approximate dates of the first transmissions the times of the first unexpected swoops by the murge units with the time of the arrival of the latest recruits to the partisans we did and found that this checked with the arrival of an unusually high number of excetniks cetniks regularly desert to us and its quite impossible to check out the credentials and good faith of all of them or even a fraction of them peter and some of his men checked on a small number of those and found two who had access to longrange transmitters hidden in a forest on a hillside they wouldnt talk and we dont torture they were executed thereafter the number of unexpected attacks by the murge fell off rapidly but they still continued at sporadic intervals which of course could only mean that there were still some traitors around george helped himself liberally to some beer it was but breakfast time but george claimed to be allergic to both tea and coffee so we went to italy the three of us why because we are or were cetnik intelligence officers and naturally associated with our italian counterparts why because we were convinced that the messages were being relayed through italian intelligence why because a fighting division has neither the facilities the ability the organization nor the cash to mount such an operation but italian intelligence has all of these in abundance amidst the welter of whys george harrison said why the cash its as peter said george said sadly you havent got the balkan mentality come to that i doubt whether you have the universal mentality the cetnik agents like agents and doubleagents the world over are not motivated simply by altrusim patriotism or political conviction the little gears in their minds only mesh efficiently under the influence of the universal lubricant money they are rather highly paid and considered dispassionately deserve to be luck what happened to those two unfortunates unmasked by peter petersen rose walked to the window and stood there gazing down the gentle valley that sloped away from their chalet he seemed to have lost interest in the conversation all in all harrison said a fair nights work that wasnt quite all of it george said we have located cipriano cipriano none other lorraine my dear you look so pale are younot well i feel i feel a little faint maraschino george said unhesitatingly sava this to one of crnis soldiers who rose at once and crossed to the liquor cupboard yes indeed the worthy major himself but how on earth we have our little methods george said complacently we have as peter told you our reliable solid citizens everywhere incidentally you can now forget all that peter told you thank you my boy just give it to the lady all he told you about cipriano working handinglove with the partisans im afraid he grossly maligned the poor man but at the moment he deemed it prudent to divert any suspicions that majors metrovic and rankovic might have been harbouring from himself to an absent person cipriano was conveniently absent our peter is a very convincing actor no hes a very convincing liar sarina said oh tush hurt pride again were just mad because he fooled you too anyway ciprianos in imotski doubtless closeted with the murge brigade commander there and hatching fresh devilish schemes against our poor partisans i shouldnt have to explain any of this you will remember that peter said in mount prenj that he wanted to get to the linkman cipriano because he was aiding and abetting the partisans what he meant to say was he wanted to get at the linkman because he was a deadly enemy of the partisans but he couldnt very well say that could he in front of metrovic and rankovic come come my children you disappoint me you had all night long to work out something as simple and obvious as that george yawned behind a massive hand excuse me now that im breakfasted and am once more at peace with myself i intend to retire and rest lightly for two or three hours we will not be moving out until the afternoon at the earliest we await an urgent communication from bihac but it will take some time to collect and collate the information we want meantime how do you people propose to spend the morning he raised his voice peter those people are free to come and go as they want inside and out arent they of course captain crni smiled and said may i suggest that you put on your coats and ill show you around our little town theres not much to show so it would be a short walk and hardly exhausting apart from the fact that its a lovely morning i know where we can get the best coffee in bosnia far better than that awful swill weve just had sarina said that way we can still be watched cant we captain crni bowed gallantly it would always be a pleasure to watch you and miss chamberlain if however you wish to go alone and report to the nearest italian command post that we are partisans and have designs on a certain italian intelligence major then you are by all means free to do so that miss von karajan is the extent to which we trust you i am sorry she reached out an impulsive hand and caught his forearm that was a terrible thing to say two or three days in this country and i find i cant trust anyone not even myself she smiled besides youre the only one who knows where the coffee shop is they left without giacomo who had elected to remain behind shortly afterwards petersen said wearily she doesnt trust anyone god knows i dont blame her george i am a hypocritical liar even when i say nothing im a hypocritical liar i know what you mean peter sometimes a tiny voice reaches down to my conscience god knows how it ever finds it and says exactly the same thing the clarion call to duty strikes a pretty cracked note at times sava general go to the window in the front room and watch the road if they return unexpectedly call me ill be upstairs ill let you know when you can stop the watch shouldnt be more than a few minutes after lunch a very refreshedlooking petersen hed had four hours sleep crossed to where lorraine sat with sarina on a bench seat by a window and said lorraine please dont start getting worried because there is no need to george and i would like to talk to you she bit her lip i knew you would can can sarina come certainly he looked at sarina provided of course that you dont say oh and ah and monster and clench your fists promise promise petersen ushered them to an upstairs room where george was already seated a large tankard on the table before him and a crate presumably for emergency on the floor beside him petersen said george george shook his head positively would you come between a man and his thirst i would have thought you slaked that pretty thoroughly at lunch this is a postprandial beer george said with dignity pray proceed this will be short and painless petersen said to lorraine im not a dentist and you dont have to tell lies as you must have guessed we know everything i can promise you and george will confirm that neither retribution nor punishment waits for you youre a victim and not a villain and acted under extreme duress besides you didnt even know what you were doing all transmissions were not only in code but in yugoslav code and you dont understand a word of serbocroat georges word of course carries immense weight in the war councils almost totally so in cases such as this and they listen to me a bit too no harm will come to you or carlos or mario she nodded almost composedly you know about our son of course yes when was he kidnapped six months ago you have no idea where he is being held no well vaguely she was no longer composed in this country i know major cipriano wanted him out of italy i dont know why i can understand there are certain things that even cipriano cant do in italy how do you know hes in this country they let carlos see him twice that was twice when i said i wasnt going to work for them any more because i was sure he was dead but i dont know where he is yes i see it doesnt matter it doesnt matter she was no longer composed and her eyes were masked in tears george took his evilsmelling cigar from his mouth what peter means is that cipriano will tell him cipriano will tell she broke off nodded and shivered involuntarily we have your code books lorraine we searched your room when you were out this morning you searched her room sarina said indignantly what right petersen rose and opened the door outside im sorry i forgot i you promised dont you ever give anyone a second chance petersen didnt answer he closed the door sat down and said false bottoms to kit bags are really dreadfully passe these days but then i dont suppose either you or cipriano ever dreamed that you would come under suspicion no names in your book but we dont need them there are code numbers callup signs and callup times it will take us little enough time to trap them and then george removed his cigar again dont ask silly questions tell me lorraine you had no idea why you had been sent to mount prenj oh you knew what you were to do but not why well cipriano knew that you knew jamie harrison and that he trusted you completely after all you were his confidential secretary so that he would never suspect you of doubledealing transferring messages from our diehard cetnik friends in bihac to him in rome or wherever messages which he could retransmit to the murge regiment but the real reason of course is that we had destroyed the only two longrange transmitters they had with shortrange transmitters their contacts with rome could only be sporadic at best but mount prenj is only two hundred kilometres from bihac it would be an awfully short range transmitter that couldnt reach there petersen paused and considered well thats all no one more thing he smiled yes one more thing purely personal where did you first meet carlos isle of wight where i was born he was sailing at cowes of course of course he told me that he often went sailing there before the war well i hope youll both go sailing there again after the war will will carlos be all right major petersen if you can refer to a general major as george you can refer to a major as peter why shouldnt he be hes in the clear under both italian military and civilian law he has committed no criminal offence aided and abetted noone with any luck we might see him later on tomorrow what carlos her face was transformed petersen looked at sarina yes you were right no question he didnt say what she had been right about certainly carlos he hasnt been up to any aiding or abetting yet but tomorrow he will she didnt seem to hear him or if she did her mind was elsewhere hes still in ploce yes he hasnt gone back to italy alas no some disaffected citizen has put sugar in his diesel oil she looked at him for a long moment then smiled slowly it wouldnt have been one of those solid reliable citizens you talk about would it he smiled back at her i am not responsible for the actions of solid reliable citizens at the foot of the stairs sarina took petersens arm and held him back thank youshe said thank you very much that was very kind he looked at her in amazement what else did you expect me to do nothing i suppose but it was wonderful especially about carlos today im not an ogre not a monster she smiled and shook her head and tomorrow when i have to find out where the little boy is do you understand what i mean she stopped smiling petersen shook his head sadly souventfemme varie bien fol est qui sy fie what is that meant to mean picked it up from george something king francis i scratched with a diamond on a pane of glass at chambord often does woman change and very foolish is he who trusts her pfui she said but she was smiling again towards the middle of the afternoon petersen and crni walked into the lounge carrying several machinepistols and handguns replacement equipment ivan here took ours away so its only fair that he should replace them well be leaving shortly ivan edvard and sava are coming with us he glanced at his watch twenty minutes shall we say i want to get through the nasty bit of the neretva gorge in daylight but not to arrive at bur destinadon until its dark for the usual reasons im not looking forward to that sarina said have no fear im not driving sava is hes a truck driver in civilian life what destination harrison said ah i forgot a new acquaintance for you jamie but an old friend of ours the proprietor of the hotel eden in mostar one josip pijade a solid and reliable citizen lorraine said a very solid very reliable citizen you have a faraway look on your face george what are you thinking of venison nine and venison it was josip and marija had excelled themselves and achieved the seemingly impossible the venison tasted even marginally better than the last time george excelled himself in a corresponding fashion but failed to achieve the impossible halfway through his third massive helping of venison he had to admit defeat sleep that night unlike the last occasion was undisturbed by unwelcome visitors breakfast was a late and leisurely meal i wish wed had you up in the damned mount prenj for the past two months harrison said to josip after the meal but its been worth the wait i wish someone would station me here for the duration he directed his attention towards petersen are we permitted to know our plans well your plans for the day of course theyre concerned primarily though not entirely with one person cipriano his apprehension and interrogation the bihac affair we can consider as being virtually a closed matter as you know we failed to make contact yesterday but ivan and i had better luck during the small hours reception as you know is always better at night theyve come up with no fewer than sixteen cetnikturnedpartisan suspects there cant be more than two at the most three we send out a coded message at a certain hour on a certain wavelength and note will be taken as to which of the sixteen is absent at the time he will not of course be apprehended until the other one or two have been similarly trapped routine forget it that the words were tantamount to a death sentence was evident to everyone except apparently petersen cipriano giacomo said still at imotski he is we have two men up there on a twentyfour hour watch were in radio contact spoke to them last an hour ago ciprianos up and around but shows no sign yet of moving on hes got quite an entourage with him he looked at alex you might be interested in hearing the description of one of them alessandro alex said hopefully no other ah just for once alex registered a trace of expression it was as near to a happy smile as alex would ever come plus im almost certain from the description alessandros three henchmen seems that carlos must have found a flamecutter somewhere we dont of course know which way the fox is going to jump there are several different exit routes he can take from imotski but well be told immediately that is known he could of course be taking a back road to ploce and hitchhiking a lift home with carlos if the colombos diesel lines have been cleared out but i think that unlikely i think hell be heading for the military airfield just outside the town here and the fast way back to rome ivan and i are just going out to the airport to check check what harrison asked whether theres air transport standing by for him wont the airfield be guarded we are two italian officers ive just promoted myself to colonel and will probably outrank anyone there well just walk in and ask them that wont be necessary peter josip pijade said my cousin who owns a garage just outside the airport works there as a parttime repair and maintenance engineer not unfortunately on the planes but on the plant otherwise the italian air force would be experiencing mysterious crashes i have but to lift the phone thank you josip josip left lorraine said another solid and reliable citizen yugoslavia is full of them josip was back in two minutes there is an italian plane on standby and its reserved for major cipriano thank you he nodded to the small transceiver on the table ill take this with me call up if you hear from imotski were almost certain of the route cipriano will take into town so ivan and i will go and select an ambush spot we may take your car josip take me too i know the perfect spot sarina said we can go into town i think so i wont be needing you until nightfall the only attention youre liable to attract is wolfwhistles from the licentious italian soldiery he looked at giacomo id feel happier if you went along no sacrifice too great giacomo said sarina smiled we need protection only from the licentious soldiery the call came inevitably enough when they were halfway through lunch marija came in and said theyve just left theyre heading for posusje the mostar road excuse us petersen said he rose as did alex crni and edvard george said i wish i were coming with you but everyone knows im not a man of action what he means petersen said coldly is that his jaws havent even got out of second gear yet and hes barely touched his first litre of beer sarina said you will be careful wont you petersen smiled and said coming giacomo certainly not thats a public bar through there the licentious soldiery might come in any moment theres your answer about being careful sarina if giacomo thought there was the slightest chance of shooting an italian full of holes hed be the first aboard the truck he knows theres no hope but thanks all the same alex white handkerchief in hand stood on a low knoll in the rough grazing field opposite the treelined lane which led off the main listicamostar road in the lane itself with engine running petersen sat in the cab of the italian army truck which was parked only feet from the entrance to the road alex raised the handkerchief high above his head petersen engaged first gear and waited clutch depressed accelerator at halfthrottle alex brought the handkerchief sharply down and clutch released the truck moved forward under full throttle three seconds later petersen jammed on the brakes bringing the truck to an abrupt halt fair and square across the width of the main highway the italian army command car which fortunately for its occupants was travelling at only a moderate speed had no chance even as the driver stamped on the footbrake he must have realized that his options were limited indeed he could either keep to the road and hit the side of the truck headon or swerve to his right into the field where alex was a swerve to the left would have fetched him up against the trees lining the lane prudently he chose the latter course locked tyres screeching on the tarmac the car bust through a low wooden fence broke into the field while balanced on only two wheels teetered for a couple of seconds then came to rest as it fell over on its left side wheels still spinning slowly in the air within seconds rule butts had smashed in the righthand windows of the car but the need for haste was not there the five occupants unhurt except for cuts about their faces were too dazed to recognize the presence of their assailants far less offer resistance when they did recover some sense of awareness the sight of the four machinepistol muzzles only inches from their heads made the thought of offering any resistance too ludicrous for contemplation when petersen and crni returned to the hotel they found george and his companions inevitably in georges case in the bar equally inevitably george was presiding behind the counter good afternoon gentlemen george was at his affable best youve finished lunch then petersen said and it wasnt bad not bad at all what shall it be beer beer is fine arent you going to ask him what happened sarina said indignantly ah alex and edvard have been cut off in their prime theyre in the truck and the truck is in the car park thats what i like solicitude making sure that the prisoners are not doing themselves an injury when do you propose to bring them inside when its dark i cant very well march them through the streets bound and gagged in broad daylight can i true george yawned and slid off his stool siesta i know petersen said sympathetically go go go all the time wears a man down george left in dignified silence sarina said doesnt go in much for congratulations does he he postponed his siesta that shows hes deeply moved so you got major cipriano what do you think of that lorraine i suppose i should be weeping for joy i am glad im terribly glad but i knew he would i never for a moment doubted it did you no its very irritating souvent femme varie petersen said sadly josip would you send someone with your hotel wagon to pick up the prisoners luggage and take it upstairs no not upstairs i can examine it just as well down here he turned to sarina and you keep quiet i didnt say anything you were about to tell me that that was something else i was very good at examining other peoples luggage i mean the five prisoners were brought in by the back entrance as soon as it was reasonably dark the hotel doors were locked cipriano alessandro and the three others were settled in chairs and their gags removed their wrists remained bound behind their backs the normally tranquil and civilized major cipriano had undergone a radical transformation his eyes glared and his face was suffused in anger what is the meaning of this this abominable outrage petersen have you gone mad stark raving mad untie me at once im an officer an italian officer an allied officer youre a murderer your rank and nationality is of no importance not when youre a mass murderer untie me youre crazy by god petersen if its the last thing i do has it occurred to you that you may already have done your last thing on earth cipriano stared at petersen his lack of understanding was total suddenly he noticed josip for the first time pijade pijade you you are a party to this monstrous outrage cipriano was so clearly nearly bereft of reason that he struggled futilely with his bonds by god pijade you shall pay for this treachery treachery petersen laughed without mirth speak of treachery while you may cipriano because youre going to die for it pijade will pay will he how will he do that cipriano petersens voice was very soft your eternal curses from the bottom of hell where youll surely be before midnight tonight youre all mad cipriano whispered the anger had drained from his face he had suddenly become aware that he was in mortal danger petersen went on in the same gentle tone hundreds of my comrades he dead because of you you are mad his voice was almost a scream you must be mad ive never touched a cetnik in my life i am not a cetnik im a partisan a partisan cipriano was back to his husky whispering again a partisan colonel lunz suspected should have listened he broke off and then his voice strengthened i have never harmed a partisan in my life come in petersen called lorraine entered do you still deny cipriano that you have masterminded the deaths of hundreds of my fellowpartisans lorraine has told me everything cipriano everything he produced a small black book from his tunic lorraines code book in your own handwriting or perhaps you dont recognize your handwriting cipriano im sure you never thought that you would be signing your own death warrant with your own handwriting i find it ironic cipriano i hope you do too but irony isnt going to bring all those hundreds back to life is it even although the last of your spies will have been trapped and executed by the end of the week those men will still be dead wont they cipriano wheres the little boy lorraines little boy wheres mario cipriano cipriano made a noise in his throat a harsh and guttural and meaningless sound and struggled to his feet giacomo glanced at petersen correctly interpreted the nod and with evident satisfaction hit cipriano none too gently in the solar plexus cipriano collapsed into his chair harsh retching noises coming deep from his throat petersen said george george emerged from behind the bar carrying two pieces of rope in his hand he ambled across the saloon dropped one piece to the floor and secured cipriano firmly to his chair with the other then he picked up the second rope already noosed and dropped it over alessandros chest before the man realized what was happening seconds later and he was trussed like the proverbial turkey cipriano isnt going to tell me because cipriano knows that hes going to die whatever happens but youll tell me where the little boy is wont you alessandro alessandro spat on the floor oh dear petersen sighed those disgusting habits are difficult to eradicate arent they he reached behind the bar and produced the metal box of syringes and drugs he had taken from alessandro aboard the colombo alex alex produced his razorsharp knife and slit alessandros left sleeve from the shoulder to where the ropes bound him at the elbow level no alessandros voice was a scream of pure terror no no no cipriano leaned forward and struggled against his bonds his face suffused dark red as he tried to force words through his still constricted throat giacomo tapped him again to ensure his continued silence im afraid i cut him a little alex said apologetically he was hardly exaggerating alessendros arm was indeed quite badly gashed no matter petersen picked up the syringe and selected a phial at apparent random save the trouble of searching for a vein ploce alessandros whispered his voice was strangled with fear his breath coming and going faster than once every second ploce i can take you there fra spalato i swear it i can take you there petersen replaced the syringe and phials and closed the lid he said to the girls alessandro im afraid was psychologically disadvantaged but i never laid a finger on him did i both girls stared at him then looked at each other as it by some telepathic signal they shuddered in unison when alessandros arm had been bandaged and cipriano recovered they made ready to leave as alex approached him with a gag cipriano looked at petersen with empty eyes and said why dont you kill me here difficult to dispose of the body but no trouble in the adriatic is it a few lengths of chain nobodys going to dispose of you cipriano not permanently we never had any intention of killing you i knew alessandro would crack but i didnt want to waste time over it a bit of a pragmatist is our alessandro and he had no intention of sacrificing his life for a man he believed to be already as good as dead we have every moral justification for killing you but no legal justification spies are shot all the time spymasters never geneva conventions say so it does seem unfair no cipriano you are going into durance vile a prisoner of war for however long the war lasts british intelligence are just going to love to have a chat with you cipriano had nothing to say which was perhaps understandable when the reprieve comes along just as die guillotine is about to be tripped suitable comment is hard to come by petersen turned to his cousin as ciprianos gag was being fastened marija i would like you to do me a favour would you look after a little boy for a day or two mario lorraine said you mean mario what other little boy would i be talking about well marija peter her voice was full of reproach well i had to ask he kissed her on the cheek the bane of my life but i love you so we part once more jossip said sadly when do we meet again dinner time george is coming back for the rest of that venison he couldnt finish last night so am i edvard stopped the truck several hundred yards short of the entrance to the docks alex and sava dropped down from the back of the truck followed by a now unbound and ungagged alessandro they were in the main street and there were a number of people around the three men turned without any undue haste down an unlit sidestreet crni seated up front with petersen said do you anticipate any trouble at the control gate no more than usual the guards are old inefficient not really interested and very susceptible to arrogant and illtempered authority thats us ciprianos wrecked command car is bound to have been found some time ago and the people in charge at the airport must be wondering where hes got to if a yugoslav found it it will have made his day and he would have driven by without stopping whether the airport was expecting him i dont know cipriano seems an unpredictable fellow who does very much what he wants even if its accepted by now that hes genuinely missing where are they going to start looking pieces about as unlikely a place as any and so it proved the sentry didnt even bother to leave his box beyond the gate the docks were deserted the days work was over and the freezing temperatures were hardly calculated to encourage nighttime strollers even so petersen told edvard to stop two hundred metres short of where the colombo was berthed left the cab went round to the back called lorraines name and helped her down see that light there thats the colombo go and tell carlos to switch off his two gangway lights yes she said oh yes she ran a few steps then halted abruptly as petersen called her walk you clown no one in ploce ever runs three minutes later the gangway lights went out two minutes after that the prisoners had made their unobserved way up the unlighted gangway and the truck had disappeared the gangway lights came on again carlos sat in his usual chair in his cabin his good left hand tightly held in both of lorraines the expression on his face not so much uncomprehending and stunned but comprehending and still stunned let me see whether ive got this right or whether im just imagining it carlos said youre going to lock up my crew and myself abscond with lorraine and mario imprison cipriano and his men aboard and steal my ship i couldnt have put it more succinctly myself except of course that i wouldnt have used the word abscond only of course if you consent the decision is entirely up to you and lorraine too but i think lorraine has already made up her mind yes i have there was no hesitation in her voice ill be dismissed from the navy carlos said gloomily no i wont ill be courtmartialled and shot nothing will happen to you there is not a chance in the world george and i have gone over it time and again my crew will talk and talk talk what about theyre sitting in the messroom with machinepistols at their heads if you had a machinepistol at your head would you have any doubt whatsoever chat your ship had been taken over by force cipriano what of cipriano even if he survives his captivity which he unfortunately probably will as the british dont shoot prisoners theres nothing he can do there is no way your version and that of the crew and this will become the official version can be disproved and he would never dare lay a personal charge against you by the time peace comes you can call for the testimony of several solid and respected citizens of yugoslavia who will testify to the fact that cipriano kidnapped your son the penalty in italy for kidnapping is life imprisonment oh do come on carlos lorraine said impatiently its not like you to dillydally there is no other way she gently touched his chin so that his eyes came round to hers weve got mario back true true he smiled at her thats all that matters to you isnt it not all she smiled in return youre back too that matters a little whats the alternative carlos peter doesnt want to kill cipriano and if cipriano is free our life is finished he has to be imprisoned in a safe place and that means in british hands and the only way to get him there is in this boat peter doesnt make mistakes correction sarina said sweetly peter never makes mistakes souventfemme varie petersen said oh do be quiet if im locked up carlos said when will i and my crew be released tomorrow an anonymous
