the red stockade we was on the southern part of the china station when the george ranger was ordered to the straits of malacca to put down the pirates that had been showing themselves of late it was in the forties when ships was ships not ironkettles full of wheels and other devilments and there was a chance of handtohand fighting not being blown up in an iron cellar by you dont know who ships was ships in them days there had been a lot of throatcutting and scuttling for them devils stopped at nothing some of us had been through the straits before when we was in the polly phemus seventyfour going to the china station and although we had never come to quarters with the malays we had seen some of their work and knew what kind they was so when we had left singapore in the george ranger for that was our saucy little thirtyeightgun frigate the place wasnt in them days what it is now many and many s the yarn was told in the focsle and on the watches of what the yellow devils could do and had done some of us took it one way and some another but all save a few wanted to get into handgrips with the pirates for all their kreeses and their stinkpots and the devils engines what they used there was some that didnt mind cold steel of an ordinary kind and would have faced cutlasses and boardingpikes any day for a holiday but that didnt like the idea of those knives like crooked flames and that sliced a man in two and hacked through the bowels of him naturally we didnt take much stock of this kind and manys the joke we had on them and some of them cruel enough jokes too you may be sure there was good stories with plenty of cutting and blood and tortures in them told in their watches and nigh the whole ships crew was busy day and night remembering and inventing things thatd make them gasp and grow white i think that somehow the captain and the officers must have known what was goin on for there came tales from the wardroom that was worse nor any of ours the midshipmen used to delight in them like the ships boys did and one of them that had a kreese used to bring it out when he could and show how the pirates used it when they cut the hearts out of men and women and ripped them up to the chins it was a bit cruel at times on them poor whitelivered chaps a man cant help his liver i suppose but anyhow theres no place for them in a warship for theyre apt to do more harm by living where theres men of all sorts than they can do by dying so there wasnt any mercy for them and the captain was worse on them than any captain wynyard was him that commanded the corvette sentinel on the china station and was promoted to the george ranger for cutting up a fleet of junks that was hammering at the rajah from canton racing for southampton with the first of the seasons tea he was a man if you like a bulldog full of hellfire when he was on for fighting he wouldnt have a white liver at any price god hates a coward he said once and under her britannic majesty im here to carry out gods will trice him up and give him a dozen at least thats the story they tell of him when he was round shanghai and one of his men had held back when the time came for boarding a firejunk that was coming down the tide and with that he went in and steered her off with his own hands well the captain knew what work there was before us and that it werent no time for kid gloves and hairoil much less a bokey in your buttonhole and a tophat and he didnt mean that there should be any funk on his ship so you take your davy that it wasnt his fault if things was made too pleasant aboard for men what feared fallin into the clutches of the malays now and then he went out of his way to be nasty over such folk and boy or man he never checked his tongue on a hard word when any ones face was pale before him there was one old chap on board that we called old lands end for he came from that part and that had a boy of his on the billy ruffian when he sailed on her and after got lost one night in cutting out a greek sloop at navarino in we used to chaff him when there was trouble with any of the boys for he used to say that his boy might have been in that trouble too and now when the chaff was on about bein afeered of the malays we used to rub it into the old man but he would flame up and answer us that his boy died in his duty and that he couldnt be afeered of nought one night there was a row on among the midshipmen for they said that one of them tempest by name owned up to being afraid of being kreesed he was a rare bright little chap of about thirteen that was always in fun and trouble of some kind but he was softhearted and sometimes the other lads would tease him he would own up truthfully to anything he thought or felt and now they had drawn him to own something that none of them would no matter how true it might be well they had a rare fight for the boy was never backward with his fists and by accident it came to the notice of the captain he insisted on being told what it was all about and when young tempest spoke out and told him he stamped on the deck and called out ill have no cowards in this ship and was going on when the boy cut in im no coward sir im a gentleman did you say you were afraid answer me yes or no yes sir i did and it was true i said i feared the malay kreeses but i did not mean to shirk them for all that henry of navarre was afraid but all the same he henry of navarre be damned shouted the captain and you too you said you were afraid and that let me tell you is what we call a coward in the queens navy and if you are one you can at least have the grace to keep it to yourself no answer to me to the masthead for the remainder of the day i want my crew to know what to avoid and to know it when they see it and he walked away while the lad without a word ran up the maintop some way the men didnt say much about this the only one that said anything to the point was old lands end and says he that may be a coward but id chance it that he was a boy of mine as we went up the straits and got the sun on us and the damp heat of that kettle of a place lor bless ye ye steam there all day and all night like a copper at the galley we began to look around for the pirates and there wasnt a man that got drowsy on the watch we coasted along as we went up north and took a look into the creeks and rivers as we went it was up these that the malays hid themselves for the fevers and such that swept off their betters like flies didnt seem to have any effect on them there was pretty bad bits i tell you up some of them rivers through the mango groves where the marshes spread away mile after mile as far as you could see and where every thing that is noxious both beast and bird and fish and crawling thing and insect and tree and bush and flower and creeper is most at home but the pirate ships kept ahead of us or if they came south again passed us by in the night and so we ran up till about the middle of the peninsula where the worst of the piracies had happened there we got up as well as we could to look like a ship in distress and sure enough we deceived the beggars for two of them came out one early dawn and began to attack us they was ugly looking craft too long low hull and lateen sails and a double crew twice told in every one of them but if the crafts was ugly the men was worse for uglier devils i never saw swarthy yellow chaps some of them and some with shaven crowns and white eyeballs and others as black as your shoe with one or two white men more shame among them but all carrying kreeses as long as your arm and pistols in their belts they didnt get much change from us i tell you we let them get close and then gave them a broadside that swept their decks like a hailstorm but we was unlucky that we didnt grapple them for they managed to shift off and ran for it our boats was out quick but we darent follow them where they ran into a wide creek with mango swamps on each side as far as the eye could reach the boat came back after a bit and reported that they had run up the river which was deep enough but with a winding channel between great mudbanks where alligators lay in hundreds there seemed some sort of fort where the river narrowed and the pirates ran in behind it and disappeared up the bend of the river then the preparations began we knew that we had got two craft at any rate caged in the river and there was every chance that we had found their lair our captain wasnt one that let things go asleep and by daylight the next morning we was ready for an attack the pinnace and four other boats started out under the first lieutenant to prospect and the rest that was left on board waited as well as they could till we came back that was an awful day i was in the second boat and we all kept well together when we began to get into the narrows of the mouth of the river when we started we went in a couple of hours after the floodtide and so all we saw when the light came seemed fresh and watery but as the tide ran out and the big black mudbanks began to show their heads above everywhere it wasnt nice i can tell you it was hardly possible for us to tell the channels for everywhere the tide raced quick and it was only when the boat began to touch the black slime that you knew that you was on a bank twice our boat was almost caught this way but by good luck we pulled and pushed off in time into the ebbing tide and hardly a boat but touched somewhere one that was a bit out from the rest of us got stuck at last in a nasty cut between two mudbanks and as the water ran away the boat turned over on the slope despite all hercrew could do and we saw the poor fellows thrown out into the slime more than one of them began to swim toward us but behind each came a rush of something dark and though we shouted and made what noise we could and fired many shots the alligators was too close and with shriek after shriek they went down to the bottom of the filth and slime oh man it was a dreadful sight and none the better that it was new to nigh all of us how it would have taken us if we had time to think about it i hardly know but i doubt that more than a few would have grown cold over it but just then there flew amongst us a hail of small shot from a fleet of boats that had stolen down on us they drove out from behind a big mudbank that rose steeper than the others and that seemed solider too for the gravel of it showed as the scour of the tide washed the mud away we was not sorry i tell you to have men to fight with instead of alligators and mudbanks in an ebbing tide in a strange tropical river we gave chase at once and the pinnace fired the twelvepounder which she carried in the bows in among the huddle of the boats and the yells arose as the rush of the alligators turned to where the malay heads bobbed up and down in the drift of the tide then the pirates turned and ran and we after them as hard as we could pull till round a sharp bend of the river we came to a narrow place where one side was steep for a bit and then tailed away to a wilderness of marsh worse than we had seen the other side was crowned by a sort of fort built on the top of a high bank but guarded by a stockade and a mudbank which lay at its base from this there came a rain of bullets and we saw some guns turned toward us we was hardly strong enough to attack such a position without reconnoitring and so we drew away but not quite quick enough for before we could get out of range of their guns a round shot carried away the whole of the starboard oars of one of our boats it was a dreary pull to the ship and the tide was agin us for we all got thinking of what we had to tell one boat and crew lost entirely and a set of oars shot away and no work done the captain was furious and in the wardroom and in the focsle that night there was nothing that wasnt flavored with anger and curses even the boys of all sorts from the cabinboys to the midshipmen was wanting to get at the malays however sharp was the order and by daylight three boats was up at the stockaded fort making an accurate survey i was again in one of the boats and in spite of what the captain had said to make us all so angry and he had a tongue like vitriol i tell you we all felt pretty down and cold when we got again amongst those terrible mudbanks and saw the slime that shone on them bubble up when the gray of the morning let us see anything we found that the fort was one that we would have to take if we wanted to follow the pirates up the river for it barred the way without a chance there was a gut of the river between the two great ridges of gravel and this was the only channel where there was a chance of passing but it had been staked on both sides so that only the center was left free why from the fort they could have stoned any one in the boats passing there only that there wasnt any stone that we could see in their whole blasted country when we got back with two cases of sunstroke among us and reported the captain ordered preparations for an attack on the fort and the next morning the ball began it was ugly work we got close up to the fort but as the tide ran out we had to sheer away somewhat so as not to get stranded the whole place swarmed with those grinning devils they evidently had some way of getting to and from their boats behind the stockade they did not fire a shot at us not at first and that was the most aggravating thing that you can imagine they seemed to know something that we did not and they only just waited as the tide sank lower and lower and the mudbanks grew steeper and the sun on them began to fizzle a steam arose that nigh turned our stomachs why the sight of them alone would make your heart sink the slime shimmered in all kinds of colors like the water when theres tarring work on hand and the whole place seemed alive with all that was horrible the alligators kept off the boats and the banks close to us but the thick water was full of eels and watersnakes and the mud was alive with waterworms and leeches and horrible gaudycolored crabs the very air was filled with pests flies of all kinds and a sort of bigstriped insect that they call the tiger mosquito which comes out in the daytime and bites you like redhot pincers it was bad enough i tell you for us men with hair on our faces but some of the boys got very white and pale and they was all pretty silent for a while all at once the crowd of malays behind the stockade began to roll their eyes and wave their kreeses and to shout we knew that there was some cause for it but couldnt make it out and this exasperated us more than ever then the captain sings out to us to attack the stockade so out we all jumped into the mud we knew it couldnt be very deep just there on account of the gravel beneath we was kneedeep in a moment but we struggled and slipped and fell over each other and when we got to the top of that bank we was the queerest filthiestlooking crowd you ever see but the mud hadnt took the heart out of us and the malays with their necks craned over the stockade and with the nearest thing to a laugh or a smile that the devil lets them have drew back and fell one on another when they heard our cheer between them and us there was a bit of a dip where the water had been running in the ebbtide but which seemed now as dry as the rest and the foremost of our men charged down the slope and then we knew why they had kept silent and waited we was in a regular trap the first ranks disappeared at once in the mud and ooze in the hollow and those next were up to their armpits before they could stop then those malay devils opened on us and while we tried to pull our chaps out they mowed us down with every kind of small arm they had and they had a queer assortment i tell you it was all we could do to get back over the slope and to the boats again what was left of us and as we hadnt hands enough left even to row with full strength we had to make for the ship as fast as we could for their boats began to pass out in a cloud through the narrow by the stockade but before we went we saw them dragging the live and dead out of the mud with hooks on the end of long bamboos and there was terrible shrieks from some poor fellows when the kreeses gashed through them we darent wait but we saw enough to make us swear revenge when we saw them devils stick the bleeding heads of our comrades on the spikes of the stockade there was nigh a mutiny because the captain wouldnt let us go back and have another try for it he was cool enough now and those of us that knew him and understood what was in his mind when the smile on him showed the white teeth in the corners of his mouth felt that it was no good days work that the pirates had done for themselves when we got back to the ship and told our tale it wasnt long till the men was all on fire and nigh every man took a turn with the grindstone at his cutlass till they was all like razors the captain mustered every one on board and detailed every man to his work in the boats ready for the next time and we knew that by daylight we were to have another slap at the pirates we got sixpounders and twelvepounders in most of the boats for we was to give them a dose of big shot before we came to close quarters when we got up near the stockade the tide had turned and we thought it better to wait till dawn for it was bad work among the mudbanks at the ebb in the dark so we hung on a while and then when the sky began to lighten we made for the fort when we got nigh enough to see it there wasnt a man of us who didnt want to have some bloody revenge for there on the spikes of the stockade were the heads of all the poor fellows that we had lost the day before with a cloud of mosquitoes and flies already beginning to buzz around them in the dawn but beyond that again they had painted the outside of the stockade with blood so that the whole place was a crimson mass you could smell it as the sun came up well that day was a hard one we opened fire with our guns and the malays returned it with all they had got a fleet of boats came out from beyond the fort and for a while we had to turn our attention to these the small guns served us well and we made a rare havoc among the boats for our shot went crashing through them and quite a half of them were sunk the water was full of bobbing heads but the tide carried them away from us and their cries and shrieks came from beyond the fort and then died away the other boats recognized their danger and turned and ran in through the narrow and let us alone for hours after then we went at the fort again we turned our guns at the piles of the stockade and of course every shot told but their fire was at too close quarters and with their rifles and matchlocks and the rest they picked us off too fast and we had to sheer off where our heavy metal could tell without our being within their range before we sheered off we could see that the hole we had knocked in the stockade was only in the outer work and that the real fort was within we had to go down the river as we couldnt go far enough across without danger from the banks and this only gave us a side view and do what we would we couldnt make an impression at least any that we could see that was a long and awful day the sun was blazing on us like a furnace and we was nigh mad with heat and flies and drouth and anger it was that hot that if you touched metal it fairly burned you when the tide was near the flood the captain ordered up the boats in the wide water now opposite the fort and there for a while we got a fair chance till when the ebb began we should have to sheer off again by this time our shot was nearly run out and we thought that we should have to give over but all at once came order to prepare for attack and in a few minutes we was working for dear life across the river straight for the stockade the men set up a cheer and the pirates showed over the top of the stockade and waved their kreeses and more than one of them sliced off pieces of the heads on the spikes and jeered at us as much as to say that they would do the same for us in our turn when we got close up every one of them had disappeared and there was a silence of the grave we knew that there was something up but what the move was we could not tell till from behind the fort came rushing again a fleet of boats we turned on them and like we did before we made mincemeat of them this time the tide made for us and the bobbing heads went by us in dozens now and then there was a wild yell as an alligator pulled some one down into the mud this went on for a little and we had beaten them off enough to be able to get our grappling irons ready for climbing the stockade when the second lieutenant who was in the outer boat called out back with the boats back quick the tide is falling and with one impulse we began to shove off then in an instant the place became alive again with the malays and they began firing on us so quickly that before we could get out into the whirl of tide there was many a dead man in our boats there was no use trying to do any more that day and after we had done what could be done for the wounded and patched up our boats for there was plenty of shotholes to plug we pulled back to the ship the alligators had had a good day and as we went along and the mudbanks grew higher and higher with the falling of the tide we could see them lie out lazily as if they had been gorged aye and there was enough left for the groundsharks out in the offing for the men on board told us that every while on the ebb something would go along bobbing up and down in the swell till presently there would be a swift ripple of a fin and then there was no more pirate well when we got aboard the rest was mighty anxious to know what had been done and when we began with the heads on spikes of the red stockade the men ground their teeth and old lands end up and says he the red stockade well not forget the name itll be our turn next and then well paint it inside this time and so it was that we came to know the place by that name that night the captain was like a man that would do murder his face was like steel and his eyes was as red as flames he didnt seem to have a thought for any one and everything he did was as hard as though his heart were brass he ordered all that was needful to be done for the wounded but he added to the doctor and mind you get them well as soon as you can were too shorthanded already up to now we all had known him treat men as men but now he only thought of us as machines for fighting true enough he thought the same of himself twice that very night he cut up rough in a new way of course the men was talking of the attack and there was lots of brag and chaff for all they was so grim earnest and some of the old fooling went on about blood and tortures the captain came on deck and as he walked along he saw one of the men that didnt like the kreeses and he didnt evidently like the looks of him for he turned on his heel and said savagely send the doctor here so the doctor came and the captain he says to him cold as ice and as polite as you please dr fairbrother there is a sick man here look at his pale face something wrong with his liver i suppose its the only thing that makes a seamans face white when theres fighting ahead take him down to sick bay and do something for him id like to cut the accursed white liver out of him altogether and with that he went down to his cabin well if we was hot for fighting before we was boiling after that and we all came to know that the next attack on the red stockade would be the last one way or the other we had to wait two more days before that could come off for the boats and tackle had to be made ready and there wasnt going to be any mistakes made this time it was just after midnight when we began to get ready every man was to his post the moon was up and it was lighter nor a london day and the captain stood by and saw every man to his place and nothing escaped him by and by as no boat was filling and before the officer in charge of it got in came the midshipman young tempest and when the captain saw him he called him up and hissed out before all the crew why are you so white whats wrong with you anyway is your liver out of order too true enough the boy was white but at the flaming insult the blood rushed to his face and we could see it red in the starlight then in another moment it passed away and left him paler than ever and he said with a gentle voice though standing as straight as a ramrod i cant help the blood in my face sir if im a coward because im pale perhaps you are right but i shall do my duty all the same and with that he pulled himself up touched his cap and went down into the boat old lands end was behind me in the boat with him number five to my six and he whispered to me through his shut teeth too rough that he might have thought a bit that hes only a child and he came all the same even if he was afeerd we stole away with muffled oars and dropped silently into the river on the floodtide if any man had had any doubts as to whether we was in earnest at other times he had none then anyhow it was a pretty grim time i tell you for the most of us felt that whether we won or not this time there would be many empty hammocks that night in the george ranger but we meant to win even if we went into the maws of the sharks and crocodiles for it when we came up close on the flood we lost no time but went slap at the fort at first of course we had crawled up the river in silence and i think that we took the beggars by surprise for we was there before the time they expected us howsomever they turned out quick enough and there was soon music on both sides of the stockade we didnt want to take any chance on the mudbanks this time so we ran in close under the stockade at once and hooked on we found that they had repaired the breach we had made the last time they fought like devils for they knew that we could beat them hand to hand if we could once get in and they sent round the boats to take us on the flank as they had done each time before but this time we wasnt to be drawn away from our attack and we let our boats outside tackle them while we minded our own business closer home it was a long fight and a bloody one they was sheltered inside and they knew that time was with them for when the tide should have fallen if we hadnt got in we should have our old trouble with the mudbanks all over again but we knew it too and we didnt lose no time still men is only men after all and we couldnt fly up over a stockade out of a boat and them as did get up was sliced about dreadful they are handy workmen with their kreeses and no doubt we was so hot on the job we had on hand that we never took no note of time at all and all at once we found the boat fixed tight under us the tide had fallen and left us on the bank under the red stockade and the best half of the boats was cut off from us we had some thirty men left and we knew we had to fight whether we liked it or not it didnt much matter anyhow for we was game to go through with it the captain when he seen the state of things gave his orders to take the boats out into midstream and shell and shot the fort whilst we was to do what we could to get in it was no use trying to bridge over the slobs for the masts of an old seventyfour wouldnt have done it we was in a tight place then i can tell you between two fires for the guns in the boats couldnt fire high enough to clear us every time without going over the fort altogether and more than one of our own shots did some of us a harm the cutter came into the game and began sending the warrockets from the tubes the pirates didnt like that i tell you and more betoken no more did we for we got as much of them as they did till the captain saw the harm to us and bade them cease but he knew his business and he kept all the fire of the guns on the one side of the stockade till he knocked a hole that we could get in by when this was done the malays left the outer wall and went within the fort proper this gave us some protection since they couldnt fire right down on us and our guns kept the boats away that would have taken us from the riverside but it was hot work and we began dropping away with stray shots and with the stinkpots and handgrenades that they kept hurling over the stockade on to us so the time came when we found that we must make a dash for the fort or get picked out one by one where we stood by this time some of our boats was making for the opening and there seemed less life behind the stockade some of them was up to some move and was sheering off to make up some other devilment still they had their guns in the fort and there was danger to our boats if they tried to cross the opening between the piles one did and went down with a hole in her within a minute so we made a burst inside the stockade and found ourselves in a narrow place between the two walls of piles anyhow the place was drier and we felt a relief in getting out of up to our knees in steaming mud there was no time to lose and the second lieutenant webster by name told us to try to scale the stockade in front it wasnt high but it was slimy below and greasy above and do what we would we couldnt get no nigher a shot from a pistol wiped out the lieutenant and for a moment we thought we was without a leader young tempest was with us silent all the time with his face as white as a ghost though he done his best like the rest of us suddenly he called out here lads take and throw me in im light enough to do it and i know that when im in youll all follow neer a man stirred then the lad stamped his foot and called again and i remember his young high voice now seamen to your duty i command here at the word we all stood at attention just as if we was at quarters then jack pring that we called the giant for he was six feet four and as strong as a bullock spoke out its no duty sir to fling an officer into hell the lad looked at him and nodded volunteers for dangerous duty he called and every man of the crowd stepped out all right boys says he now take me up and throw me in well get down that flag anyhow and he pointed to the black flag that the pirates flew on the flagstaff in the fort then he took the small flag of the float and put it on his breast and says he thisll suit better wont i do sir said jack and the lad laughed a laugh that rang again oh my eye says he has any one got a crane to hoist in the giant the lad told us to catch hold of him and when jack hesitated says he weve always been friends jack and i want you to be one of the last to touch me so jack laid hold of him by one side and old lands end stepped out and took him by the other the rest of us was by this time kicking off our shoes and pulling off our shirts and getting our knives open in our teeth the two men gave a great heave together and they sent the boy clean over the top of the stockade we heard across the river a cheer from our boats as we began to scramble there was a pause within the fort for a few seconds and then we saw the lad swarm up the bamboo flagstaff that swayed under him and tear down the black flag he pulled our own flag from his breast and hung it over the top of the post and he waved his hand and cheered and the cheer was echoed in thunder across the river and then a shot fetched him down and with a wild yell they all went for him while the cheering from the boats came like a storm we never knew quite how we got over that stockade to this day i cant even imagine how we done it but when we leaped down we saw something lying at the foot of the flagstaff all red and the kreeses was red too the devils had done their work but it was their last for we came at them with our cutlasses there was never a sound from the lips of any of us and we drove them like a hailstorm beats down standing corn we didnt leave a living thing within the red stockade that day and we wouldnt if there had been a million there it was a while before we heard the shouting again for the boats was coming up the river now that the fort was ours and the men had other work for their breath than cheering between us we made a rare clearance of the pirates nest that day we destroyed every boat on the river and the two ships that we was looking for and one other that was careened we tore down and burned every house and jetty and stockade in the place and there was no quarter for them we caught some of them got away by a path they knew through the swamp where we couldnt follow them the sun was getting low when we pulled back to the ship it would have been a merry enough homecoming despite our losses all but for one thing and that was covered up with a union jack in the captains own boat poor lad when they lifted him on deck and the men came round to look at him his face was pale enough now and one and all we felt that it was to make amends as the captain stooped over and kissed him on the forehead well bury him tomorrow he said but in blue water as becomes a gallant seaman at the dawn next day he lay on a grating sewn in his hammock with the shot at his feet and the whole crew was mustered and the chaplain read the service for the dead then he spoke a bit about him how he had done his duty and was an example to all and he said how all loved and honored him then the men told off for the duty stood ready to slip the grating and let the gallant boy go plunging down to join the other heroes under the sea but old lands end stepped out and touched his cap to the captain and asked if he might say a word say on my man said the captain and he stood with his cocked hat in his hand whilst old lands end spoke mates yeve heerd what the chaplain said the boy done his duty and died like the brave gentleman he was and we wish he was here now but for all that we cant be sorry for him or for what he done though it cost him his life i had a lad once of my own and i hoped for him what i never wanted for myself that he would win fame and honor and become an admiral of the fleet as others have done before but so help me god id rather see him lying under the flag as we see that brave boy lie now and know why he was there than id see him in his epaulettes on the quarterdeck of the flagship he died for his queen and country and for the honor of the flag and what more would you have him do
