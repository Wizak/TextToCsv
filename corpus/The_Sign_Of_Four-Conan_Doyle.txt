famous private detective in london he helped to solve crimes and catch criminals when people were in trouble or needed help they came to holmes sometimes the police came to holmes and asked for help in catching a criminal sherlock holmes did not care if his clients were rich or poor he enjoyed solving their interesting problems he was very happy when he was working it was the most important thing in his life one afternoon i was reading a book and holmes was standing by the window in our sittingroom usually he was very busy and active but this afternoon he did not seem very happy i was worried about my friend whats the matter with you today holmes i asked come and stand at the window watson holmes said look out into the street see how uninteresting london is today it was winter the street outside was almost empty everyone was at home in front of their warm fires i need some work watson said holmes impatiently i cannot live without interesting problems and mysteries thats why i became a private detective i love my work it keeps my brain active but when there are no crimes and no mysteries to solve ah then life becomes very boring for me he turned sadly away from the window at that moment there was a knock at the door our housekeeper came into the room she was carrying a small white card on a silver tray holmes picked up the card miss mary morstan he read aloud i dont know anyone of that name please ask the lady to come in perhaps it is a new client a few moments later miss morstan entered the room she was young and not very tall with blonde hair and blue eyes her

but without success i never saw my dear father again miss morstan began to cry holmes opened his notebook what was the date that your father disappeared he asked it was rd december nearly ten years ago what happened to his luggage it was still at the hotel replied miss morstan the cases contained some books and clothes and some paintings and ornaments from the andaman islands the andaman islands what are they i asked a small group of islands near the coast of india said miss morstan there is a prison on one of the islands my father was one of the officers in charge of the prisoners he worked there for many years did your father have any friends in london asked holmes only one major sholto he was also in charge of the prisoners in the andaman islands the major had retired from the army some time before my father disappeared he was living in london and of course i went to see him but he didnt know that my father had arrived in england your story is very interesting said holmes rubbing his hands together once more please go on four years after my father disappeared continued miss morstan i saw an advertisement in the newspaper the date was th may to my surprise the advertisement asked for the address of miss mary morstan it said that if i advertised my address i would receive some very good news what did you do asked holmes i advertised my address in the same newspaper the next day i received a small cardboard box inside the box was a lovely pearl and i have received another five pearls since that day they arrive every year on the same day look she opened a flat box and showed us six beautiful pearls there was no letter with the pearls asked holmes nothing at all replied miss morstan then she continued but the strangest thing of all happened this

yes i said major sholto had retired from the army he was living in london when captain morstan disappeared but he did not know that morstan was in england well said holmes i have just been to the offices of the times newspaper i looked through the old copies of the newspaper and i discovered that major sholto died on th april perhaps i am very stupid holmes but i dont see why this discovery is interesting listen holmes said captain morstan disappeared he had one friend in london major sholto but major sholto said that he didnt know that captain morstan was in london four years later on th april sholto died a few days later on th may captain morstans daughter saw the advertisement in a newspaper then she received a valuable present these presents came every year why do the presents arrive on that day they must have something to do with sholtos death i was still puzzled but sholto died six years ago i said why did miss morstan receive that letter today six years later the letter speaks of telling her the truth what can it mean i hope that well find the answers to these questions tonight watson said holmes seriously are you ready its six oclock and here is miss morstan miss morstan entered the room she was wearing a dark cloak and hat she did not seem afraid but her beautiful face was very pale i picked up my hat and my heaviest stick i noticed that holmes took his gun from his drawer and put it into his pocket we got into a cab and were soon on our way to the lyceum theatre in the cab miss morstan took a piece of paper out of her bag mr holmes i forgot to show you this this note was found in my fathers luggage it is very strange i dont know what it means perhaps it isnt very important but i wanted you to see it holmes unfolded the note carefully and spread it on his knee he took a magnifying glass out of his pocket and examined the paper this paper was made in india he remarked have a look at it watson i took the note and studied it carefully the paper was thin and old there was a drawing on the paper it looks like the plan of a large building i said somebody has made a mark to show a certain place in the building but what are these names at the bottom and what is the meaning of the sign of four i dont understand what this note means said holmes but it might be important i will keep it he sat back in the cab miss morstan and i talked quietly together but holmes did not say anything i knew he was thinking hard it was getting dark and the people in the streets were hurrying home from work i was feeling a little afraid i wondered what kind of person we would meet at the lyceum theatre there were many people outside the theatre everyone was meeting friends and going in to see the play the letter had told us to stand outside on the left we waited suddenly a small dark man appeared are you miss morstan and her friends he asked yes she said you must promise me that these men are not policemen said the stranger they are not policemen replied miss morstan then come with me said the man he led us quickly across the street to another cab and opened the door we went inside the man closed the door and jumped up onto the drivers seat of the cab the horse moved off quickly we passed through so many streets that was very soon lost had no idea where we were going i was feeling nervous and miss morstans face looked white sherlock holmes was calm our strange driver did not turn round or speak to us the only sound was the noise of the horses hooves at last we stopped we were outside a house in a dark quiet street it had only one small light in the kitchen window there were no lights in any of the other houses in the street we knocked at the door it was opened immediately by an indian servant the indian was wearing a bright yellow turban on his head he had white clothes and a yellow belt it was very strange to see such brightly colored clothes in this quiet street in london my master is waiting for you said the servant as he spoke we heard a mans voice it came from one of the rooms inside the house bring them in to me the voice called bring them straight in to me chapter four the death of major sholto we followed the indian servant into the house he stopped in front of an open door come in come in said the voice we entered holmes miss morstan and myself and were astonished the room in which we were standing was full of indian paintings and ornaments the carpet was soft and very thick there were two large tigerskins on the walls in the centre of the room stood a strange little man with a bald head he was smiling but he seemed very nervous my name said the baldheaded man is thaddeus sholto you are miss morstan of course and these two gentlemen this is mr sherlock holmes and this is doctor watson a doctor cried thaddeus sholto excitedly oh please could you listen to my heart i am very worried about my heart i listened to his heart beating but i could hear nothing wrong with it there is nothing wrong with your heart i told him im so glad said thaddeus sholto miss morstan your father had a very weak heart if his heart had been stronger he would have been alive today miss morstan sat down and her face turned very white i knew that he was dead she said there were tears in her eyes i was very angry with thaddeus sholto he did not notice how much he had upset miss morstan please tell us why we have been brought here said miss morstan so thaddeus sholto began his strange story and we listened my father sholto said was major sholto of the indian army he retired from the army about eleven years ago he bought a house in north london he called the house pondicherry lodge my brother bartholomew and i were his only children we knew that captain morstan miss morstans father and our father had been very good friends in india when we heard that captain morstan had disappeared we were very upset my brother bartholomew and i also knew that our father was afraid of something he never went out alone he often spoke about a man with a wooden leg who followed him he seemed very afraid of this man did he tell you why he was afraid asked holmes no he didnt thaddeus sholto replied then he continued with his story one day in our father received a letter from india this letter upset him very much he became ill every day he grew weaker at last he was dying he asked to see me and my brother bartholomew we went to his room he told us to lock the door and come over to the bed then he held our hands and spoke to us he said that he wanted to tell us the truth about captain morstans death he was the only person who knew this terrible secret when father was in india with captain morstan they found a great treasure it was called the great agra treasure the jewels in this treasure were worth more than a million pounds father brought the agra treasure back to england morstan followed him and came at once to the house to ask for his share but the treasure had made father greedy he did not want to give any of it to morstan he wanted to keep it all for himself morstan became very angry they had a terrible argument father knew that morstans heart was weak suddenly the color of morstans face changed father saw at once that morstan was dead he did not know what to do he had not killed morstan but he was afraid that people would believe that he had killed morstan he decided to say nothing he hid the body and he also hid the great agra treasure soon the news of morstans disappearance spread through london only our father knew the terrible truth he told us as he was dying that he had been a wicked and greedy man he said that he had acted very wrongly but that he had paid for his crime the agra treasure never brought him happiness only fear and guilt then he told us that captain morstan had a daughter called mary he asked us to listen carefully then he began to tell us where he had hidden the treasure at that moment a terrible change came over our fathers face he pointed at the window and cried out in a voice full of fear keep him out keep him out my brother and i stared at the window we saw a horrid face looking in through the window it was wild and had a black beard and cruel eyes we rushed to the window but the man had gone when we went back to the bed father was dead what did you do then asked holmes we ran out into the garden replied sholto we looked everywhere but we found nothing in the morning we went to our fathers room we found that someone had been in the room during the night there was a piece of paper on the bed beside my fathers body and on this paper some words were written these words were the sign of four chapter five the great agra treasure holmes miss morstan and i looked at each other in surprise my body felt cold with fear the same words the sign of four were written on that strange note in captain morstans luggage said holmes what can it mean i whispered miss morstan turned to thaddeus sholto why did you send me the pearls she asked on the table beside our fathers bed was a gold cup sholto answered it was decorated with six pearls our father had told us that this cup was part of the agra treasure he had wanted us to share the treasure with you so we found your address and sent you the pearls one by one that was very kind of you mr sholto said miss morstan not at all said sholto but now i am going to tell you something very exciting yesterday my brother and i found the great agra treasure you found the treasure we repeated in astonishment yes our father had died before he told us where it was hidden my brother bartholomew and i searched for the treasure for six years yesterday we found it that is why we sent you the letter miss morstan we have found the treasure but half of it belongs to you where is the treasure now asked holmes at my fathers house pondicherry lodge replied sholto my brother bartholomew lives there now we must go there immediately so that miss morstan can see the treasure and claim her share bartholomew is expecting us miss morstan tonight you will be a rich woman miss morstan was going to be very rich i should have been very happy but i did not feel happy at all i had fallen in love with miss morstan but i did not have very much money if she became rich i could not ask her to marry me thaddeus sholto put on his coat come he said i have a cab waiting outside it will take us to pondicherry lodge we must not be late it was a long drive to pondicherry lodge the night was cold and the moon was shining brightly as we sat in the cab thaddeus sholto continued to talk holmes miss morstan and i listened my brother bartholomew is a very clever man he said he knew that the treasure was somewhere in the house he had an idea he measured the height of the house outside it was seventyfour feet high then he measured the height of the rooms inside the house he added the heights of the rooms together the total was only seventy feet there was extra space under the roof my brother made a hole in the ceiling of the room on the top floor he found a secret room inside this little room the treasure chest was standing last night i helped bartholomew to lower the chest down into the room below we opened the chest with a key which we found beside it thaddeus sholtos voice became excited inside the treasure chest were hundreds of beautiful jewels diamonds rubies sapphires and many others they shone so brightly that they hurt our eyes miss morstan the agra treasure is really wonderful but here is pondicherry lodge we have arrived soon you will see the treasure for yourself it was now nearly eleven oclock pondicherry lodge was a big house with a high wall around it everything was black and silent there was no light except the moonlight this is very strange thaddeus sholto said nervously i dont understand why there are no lights my brother bartholomew is expecting us but the house is dark we walked up to the house suddenly we heard a noise coming from inside that great black house it was the sound of a woman crying the only woman in the house is the housekeeper said sholto something is wrong we hurried to the door and knocked a tall old woman opened it her face was white with fear oh mr thaddeus im glad you have come she said im very frightened come into the house mr thaddeus oh im glad that you are here something terrible has happened to your brother chapter six a terrible murder thaddeus sholto began to shake with fear his face was very white what do you mean he asked the housekeeper what is the matter with my brother he locked himself in his room he was there all day when i knocked on the door he would not answer me she said i knew that something must be wrong a short time ago i went upstairs i looked through the keyhole of the door of his room i saw your brothers face mr thaddeus it looks terrible you must go up mr thaddeus and see for yourself the housekeeper started to cry again you must all go upstairs said miss morstan ill stay here and look after this poor woman we left the two women miss morstan and the housekeeper downstairs holmes took the lamp and led the way thaddeus sholto and i followed him we climbed up the stairs there was a passage at the top of the stairs at the end of the passage was a door thaddeus sholto pointed to this door thats the door of my brothers room he whispered we hurried forwards holmes turned the handle but the door was locked then he bent down and looked through the keyhole he stood up again quickly my god he cried its the work of the devil i bent down and put my eye to the keyhole i felt very sick and afraid the bright moonlight was shining into the room i could clearly see a face this face was looking straight at me it did not move there was a horrible smile on the face this is terrible i said to holmes what shall we do we must break down the door he replied we threw ourselves at the door and it broke with a sudden crack we were inside bartholomew sholtos room bartholomew sholto was dead he was sitting in a chair by a table his body was stiff and cold i could see that he had been dead for many hours the dead mans body was twisted with pain there was a horrible smile on his face there was a piece of paper on the body holmes picked it up and read it look he said in the light of the lamp i read with horror the sign of four what does it mean i asked it means murder holmes replied he pointed to bartholomew sholtos ear look i looked i saw something sticking in the dead mans skin near his ear it looks like a thorn i said it is a thorn said holmes you can take it out but be careful it is poison i took the thorn between my finger and thumb i pulled it away easily from the dead mans skin i looked at it it was hard and sharp i saw that it had poison on it so this is how bartholomew sholto died i said what a terrible death but who killed him and why we had forgotten about thaddeus sholto he was still standing in the doorway suddenly he gave a cry the treasure has gone he cried they have stolen the treasure look do you see that hole in the ceiling we lowered the treasure down through that hole last night after i had helped my brother with the treasure i left him here in this room i was the last person to see my brother alive i heard him lock the door as i came downstairs what time was that asked holmes it was ten oclock and now my brother bartholomew is dead and the great agra treasure has gone chapter seven the tiny footprints go to the police station mr sholto said holmes ask the police to come quickly doctor watson and i will wait here thaddeus sholto turned away we heard him going downstairs now watson said holmes we have some work to do before the police arrive we must find out how the murderer got into the room the door was locked but what about the window he carried the lamp to the window and examined the window sill carefully look he said someone has come in by the window here is the print of a foot on the windowsill and here is a round mark and look on the floor here is another footprint and another mark and again by the table see here watson i looked at the marks some were footprints but some were in the shape of small circles those are not footprints i said no replied holmes they are the marks made by someone with a wooden leg someone with a wooden leg i said holmes thaddeus sholto told us that his father was afraid of a man with a wooden leg yes said holmes but the woodenlegged man was not alone someone else has been here too look outside we both went to the window and looked down we are very high up said holmes a man with a wooden leg would not be able to climb here by himself two people came into this room we will call them number one and number two number two is the woodenlegged man but who is number one and how did he get in i looked round the room i thought quickly then suddenly i knew the answer in the ceiling of the room was a hole thaddeus sholto had told us that his brother had made this hole the agra treasure had been hidden in the secret room above the two sholto brothers had lowered the treasure chest through this hole the night before a set of steps was standing beneath the hole on the floor by the set of steps was a rope number one must have looked through the hole in the ceiling i said he saw bartholomew sholto sitting on the chair below him he killed sholto with a poisoned thorn then he must have taken the rope opened the window and thrown the end of the rope down into the garden his friend number two the woodenlegged man must have been waiting below number two climbed up the rope with the help of number one the murderers then lowered the treasure chest to the ground with the rope number two climbed down the rope number one got out of the room through the hole in the ceiling excellent watson said holmes we shall now go up and have a look at the secret room perhaps we can find out more information about number one we climbed the steps and found ourselves in a small dark room without any windows there was thick dust on the floor it was here that the treasure had been hidden for so many years look said holmes there is a small door in the roof that is how number one got in then holmes shone the lamp down at the floor by the light of the lamp i saw that the floor was covered with many footprints they showed very clearly in the thick dust they were the prints of bare feet but they were not the footprints of an ordinary man they were extremely small suddenly a horrible thought came into my mind holmes i whispered a child has done this terrible thing holmes did not answer he was still studying the tiny footprints finally he spoke no he said slowly i dont think it was a child look at this footprint look at the marks of the toes they are very wide apart it is not a childs footprint it is a mans they are the prints of a tiny man do you mean a dwarf i asked in surprise i will show you replied holmes lets go into the room again lets examine once more the poisoned thorn which killed bartholomew sholto in the room below i picked up the thorn i held it carefully between my fingers i felt afraid it was long and sharp now then said holmes what do you think about this thorn is it an english thorn no i said it certainly is not you see said holmes already we begin to know many things about murderer number one he is a very small man in other words a pygmy from some foreign land he is very strong and can climb great heights easily he is also extremely dangerous he kills people by shooting them with poisoned thorns chapter eight inspector jones makes an arrest i looked at holmes in astonishment how strange i said why are a pygmy and a wooden legged man working together who are these people holmes and why did they kill bartholomew sholto they wanted the treasure of course answered holmes last night bartholomew sholto was sitting in this room with the treasure the pygmy came in through the roof and saw him the only way to get the treasure was to kill sholto and what about the paper with the sign of four i asked it must mean revenge holmes answered remember that a paper from the sign of four was also found on the dead body of major sholto i dont know why someone wants revenge on the sholto family but we know that someone wanted revenge they also wanted the treasure and they were prepared to kill the sholtos father and son to get the treasure holmes took out his magnifying glass and started to examine the room again there were some bottles and tubes in one corner of the room bartholomew sholto must have been interested in chemistry a glass tube had broken and a dark liquid had spilt onto the floor holmes gave a loud cry of joy come here watson he said what can you smell i walked over suddenly i smelt something very strong and unpleasant the smell was coming from the dark liquid on the floor it smells like tar i said it is similar to tar holmes answered it is creosote he was smiling and rubbing his hands together why are you so pleased i asked holmes pointed to the floor i saw a clearly marked small footprint i realized that the pygmy had stepped in the creosote i know a dog which loves the smell of creosote it will follow this smell for miles and miles said holmes well catch these murderers now just then we heard footsteps and loud voices outside the room its the police said holmes as he spoke a fat man in a grey suit entered the room his face was red and his eyes were small and bright he was followed by a policeman in uniform and by thaddeus sholto i had never seen the fat man before but holmes seemed to know him well good evening inspector jones said holmes politely dont you remember me the fat man stopped and stared he was not very pleased to see holmes why yes of course he said you are mr sherlock holmes the private detective yes i remember you well this is an interesting crime mr holmes a man has been murdered and jewels worth a million pounds are missing what do you think happened well began holmes but inspector jones did not want to listen to my friend he thought his own ideas were better listen mr holmes i will tell you what i think he said importantly this man thaddeus sholto tells me that he was with his brother last night they discovered the treasure together he was the last person to see his brother alive now i think that thaddeus sholto killed his brother then he ran off with the jewels oh no it isnt true cried thaddeus sholto what about the poisoned thorn in the dead mans skin asked holmes and the paper with the sign of four the thorn belongs to thaddeus sholto replied jones quickly i dont think the paper is very important perhaps its a trick but wait a moment whats that up there i see a hole in the ceiling i must have a look inspector jones went quickly up the steps we heard him moving about noisily in the room above then he came down again he was hot and dusty i know everything now he cried i have found a door which leads out onto the roof that was how thaddeus sholto escaped but the footprints began holmes inspector jones was not listening he had not noticed the tiny footprints he turned to thaddeus sholto the poor man was shaking with fear mr sholto said jones i arrest you for the murder of your brother i didnt do it thaddeus said please mr holmes believe me dont worry mr sholto said holmes i know that you didnt kill your brother i will find the murderer inspector jones turned to holmes angrily listen mr holmes he said this is a matter for the police it has nothing to do with you goodnight gentlemen inspector jones and the policeman took thaddeus sholto away a few minutes later the house was quiet again chapter nine the dog that loved creosote the police dont want my help watson said holmes as soon as the inspector had gone inspector jones thinks he has solved the crime and caught the murderer but they have arrested the wrong man i agreed with holmes i was sure that thaddeus sholto was not the murderer we must be quick watson said holmes i want you to do two things first take miss morstan home second go to this address pinchin lane ask for mr sherman he has an old dog called toby i want you to bring toby here meet me here in two hours time i took miss morstan home in thaddeus sholtos cab she was very upset by what had happened and spoke very little i promised that would visit her the next day then i went to the address which holmes had given me it was the middle of the night and the streets of london were black and silent as the cab went along i thought about everything that had happened we had discovered the truth about some things the death of captain morstan the sending of the pearls to miss morstan the advertisement the letter all these things were clear now there were other mysteries which we had to solve where was the indian treasure what was the plan found in morstans luggage who wanted bartholomew sholto to die where were the pygmy and the woodenlegged man what did all these things mean and what was the mysterious sign of four i hoped that sherlock holmes would discover the answer to these questions soon i arrived in pinchin lane the address where holmes had sent me it was a very poor street and the houses were old and dirty i found house number three and knocked on the door after some time a face looked out from a window above it was not a friendly face who are you said the face angrily what do you want come down and open the door i said i have something to ask you go away at once said the face if you dont ill let out fifty dogs upon you my friend mr sherlock holmes i began at these words the window suddenly shut and a few minutes later the door opened i saw an old man with grey hair and a beard holding a candle in his hand come in sir he said im mr sherman im sorry that i was rude i didnt know that you were a friend of sherlock holmes i went into the small dirty house and stopped in astonishment there were cages everywhere i looked all the cages contained different kinds of animals i could see their eyes shining in the candlelight what does mr holmes want asked the old man a dog called toby i answered toby is my best dog said mr sherman he loves to follow strong smells especially the smell of creosote thats his favourite thats why mr holmes wants him i said wait here ill go and get him the old man came back after a few minutes he was pulling a dog on a lead the dog looked very strange it had very long ears and very short legs and its eyes were large and sad this is toby said mr sherman hell go with you hes a friendly dog the dog licked my hand and wagged its tail i put some money into mr shermans hand and the old man gave me tobys lead when i got back to pondicherry lodge i found sherlock holmes standing outside the door he was smoking his pipe excellent watson he said when he saw me you have done well good dog toby come here good dog holmes took a handkerchief out of his pocket and gave it to toby to smell the handkerchief was covered with creosote the dog went mad with excitement his sad eyes shone with happiness and his tail wagged see how he loves the smell said holmes we wont have any problems now holmes pointed at a drain pipe which went down from the roof of the house while you were away watson he said i went up onto the roof and discovered how the pygmy climbed up and climbed down again he used that drainpipe the drainpipe ran all the way down from the roof to the garden below there was a large barrel full of water under the end of the drainpipe he climbed down that drainpipe and onto the barrel beneath said holmes it was very easy to follow his trail he left marks everywhere he also dropped this holmes put his hand in his pocket and took out a small bag made of dried grass i looked inside to my horror i saw five or six long dark thorns they were the same as the one which killed bartholomew sholto the murderer has lost these said holmes lets hope that he doesnt have any more dont touch them watson they are poisoned but come wheres toby we must begin holmes took tobys lead and pulled the dog to the bottom of the water barrel toby smelled all round carefully suddenly he began to bark excitedly he had found his favourite smell the smell of creosote then he started to pull at his lead hes on the trail cried holmes lets go chapter ten the hunt begins toby pulled at his lead and ran quickly through the grass he ran so quickly that it was difficult to follow him the sky was beginning to get light now toby ran along the paths in the garden under the trees and bushes then he reached the garden wall and ran along beside it finally he stopped at a place in the wall where the bricks were loose this is the place where they got into the garden said holmes it is easy to climb up and down here look do you see this mark it is the print of a mans hand he pointed at a flat stone i saw a dirty hand print on the stone holmes picked up the dog and climbed over the wall i followed toby soon found the trail again toby did not look to the right or the left he ran straight ahead with his nose to the ground he loved the smell of creosote nothing could stop him from following it as we hurried along i thought about the woodenlegged man and the pygmy i wondered what would happen when we found them i knew that they were dangerous i wished that i had brought my gun with me toby was still following the trail now we were passing through small narrow streets the people were just beginning to wake up the men were going on their way to work the women were opening the windows and cleaning their houses suddenly toby ran down a path this path led straight down towards the river thames soon the river appeared in front of us toby ran faster and faster the path went down to the waters edge it ended at a small wooden jetty toby stopped he ran backwards and forwards trying to find the smell he looked up at us sadly with his large eyes he did not know what to do they have got into a boat here said holmes there was a small house beside the jetty a notice was hanging from one of the windows on it was written in large letters mordecai smith boats and steam launch for hire there was no one on the jetty several small boats were near the jetty on the bank of the river holmes looked at these boats i wonder where the steam launch is he said i think we must ask a few questions he knocked loudly at the door of the house a large woman with a red face opened it a child was crying somewhere inside the house i saw that the woman was very upset about something she had been crying good morning said holmes politely are you mordecai smiths wife yes replied the woman what do you want could speak to your husband please asked holmes no you

aurora but you look tired watson lets go home and have breakfast it was now nearly eight oclock in the morning i did feel very tired i was glad to go home to baker street when i had had a bath and changed my clothes i came downstairs to breakfast holmes was drinking coffee and reading a newspaper look watson he said here is a report about the murder of bartholomew sholto at pondicherry lodge and about the arrest of thaddeus sholto by inspector jones last night i took the paper and read the report i felt sorry for thaddeus sholto inspector jones had made a stupid mistake by arresting him i knew that sholto was not guilty of the murder of his brother i hoped that we would be able to help thaddeus but would we be able to find the murderers suddenly there was a loud knock on the door a few minutes later twelve children ran into the room their clothes were dirty and ragged they had no shoes on their feet their hair was untidy and their faces had not been washed for a very long time but they seemed happy and cheerful good morning mr holmes said the children together who are these children holmes i asked in astonishment holmes laughed these are my agents he said i sent a message for them to come look at them they can go anywhere see everything hear everything nobody is afraid of children holmes gave each of the children some money then he told them what he wanted them to do you must find a steam launch called the aurora he said it is on the river somewhere and belongs to mordecai smith the aurora is black with two red stripes down each side it has a black funnel with a white stripe you must find it now go the children ran out of the room all talking together they went down the stairs and out into the street my agents will find mordecai smith and the aurora said holmes now we must wait chapter twelve inspector jones receives a telegram we had not slept all night and i was very tired i went to bed and woke late in the afternoon i felt much better i went downstairs holmes

street i went to bed but i could not sleep i was thinking about miss morstan i wanted to ask her to marry me all night i heard holmes walking up and down in his room next morning he looked tired and ill my agents cannot find the aurora he said impatiently they have searched the whole river the aurora has disappeared we waited all that day but there was no news the next day i woke early it was still dark to my surprise sherlock holmes was standing by my bed he was dressed and ready to go out i have had an idea watson he said i am going up the river myself perhaps i can find the launch you must stay here there may be some messages holmes left without another word that day the time passed very slowly i picked up a book but was unable to read it i was thinking all the time about the woodenlegged man and the pygmy where were they why could holmes not find them i was worried about my friend i knew that he was a clever detective but perhaps this time he would not be able to catch the murderers at three oclock in the afternoon i had a visitor it was inspector jones the police officer i was astonished inspector jones had changed completely two days ago he had been very rude to holmes he had not wanted his help now he was very quiet and polite good afternoon doctor watson said inspector jones im afraid that i made a bad mistake i have had to let thaddeus sholto go sholto has proved that he was at a friends house when his brother died inspector jones looked so sad that i began to feel sorry for him ive received a telegram from sherlock holmes the inspector went on here it is i took the telegram and read it inspector jones go to baker street at once wait for me there i know where sholtos murderers are hiding come with us tonight if you want to catch them holmes thats

together i know where the aurora is holmes replied it wasnt on the river at all the aurora has been hidden in a boatyard near the river for two days i knew the launch at once mordecai smith the owner was there too he was talking to someone and he was speaking very loudly he said that he had to have the aurora ready for eight oclock tonight his two gentlemen were leaving for america their ship was waiting for them out at sea and they must not be late i knew immediately what they were planning to do went on holmes and i know what we must do inspector jones will you help me i was wrong before and

three of us inspector jones holmes and i went down to the river both holmes and i had guns in our pockets inspector jones had promised to let us use the police launch this launch was now waiting four strong men were on board the launch soon we were moving quickly down the river thames the police launch was very fast we passed all the other boats on the river without difficulty this pleased holmes very much by eight oclock we had arrived opposite the boatyard where the aurora was hidden it was now dark we waited ten minutes passed suddenly a launch came out of the boatyard it was black with two red stripes it was moving very quickly thats the aurora cried holmes follow it quickly faster faster we must catch them we were going so fast that the police launch started to shake but we could not get near to the aurora the chase became more and more exciting we went in and out between other boats many times i closed my eyes i was sure that we would hit something at last we got closer to the aurora inspector jones turned on a light and shone it on the aurora stop he said stop we are the police in the lamplight we could see some men on board the aurora one man was sitting at the back of the launch beside him was a strange dark shape we could also see mordecai smith the owner of the aurora he was working as hard as he could he was trying to make the engine of the launch go faster inspector jones shouted again stop suddenly the man at the back of the aurora stood up he shouted at us angrily he was a big strong man then i noticed that his right leg was missing there was a wooden stump in its place this was the woodenlegged man at the sound of the mans voice the strange dark shape beside him moved it was a small dark man the smallest man i have ever seen but the pygmys head was large his face was hard and cruel as soon as holmes saw the pygmy he took out his gun i did the same shoot him if he moves his hand said holmes at that moment the pygmy put a short piece of wood to his lips we fired our guns together the pygmy fell backwards into the water with a terrible cry the woodenlegged man turned the aurora towards the bank of the river as soon as the aurora touched the bank of the river he jumped out it happened so quickly that we were not able to slow down and stop the police launch the man had landed in the soft wet mud of the river bank but his wooden leg had stuck in the mud he could not move we managed to turn the police launch round we went towards the woodenlegged man and threw him a rope then we pulled him up over the side of our launch mordecai smith was still on the aurora but he did not try to escape we tied the aurora to our launch the chase was over on the deck of the aurora there was a big heavy chest we were sure that it contained the agra treasure we carried the heavy box onto the police launch suddenly holmes stopped and pointed look he said i looked where holmes was pointing i saw one of the pygmys poisoned toms it was fixed in the wood where holmes and i had been standing the poisoned thorn had passed through the air between us holmes was smiling but i felt cold and sick we had escaped a horrible death as we went back up the river we shone our light on the water we were looking for the body of the pygmy but we saw nothing his body still lies somewhere at the bottom of the river thames chapter fourteen the treasure is lost the woodenlegged man was our prisoner he was sitting in the police launch opposite the treasure chest he was about fifty years old he had black curly hair and a black beard he did not look angry any more he was not interested in anything whats your name holmes asked him jonathan small replied the man jonathan small repeated holmes he took out the piece of paper which had been found in captain morstans luggage holmes read out what was written on the piece of paper jonathan small mahomet singh abdullah khan dostakbar the sign of four give me that paper said the man holmes gave it to him yes

watson would you take the treasure to miss morstan i shall be pleased to do that i said but i was not speaking the truth i did not want to take the treasure to miss morstan i did not want her to become a rich woman inspector jones and i will take our prisoner to baker street said holmes well meet you there watson then holmes turned to jonathan small but where is the key of the treasure chest at the bottom of the river replied jonathan small why did you throw it away cried inspector jones angrily you have made things very difficult for us jonathan small did not speak he did not care what jones said when we got to the jetty i got out of the launch with the treasure chest i found a cab and drove to miss morstans house miss morstan was sitting by the window she was wearing a pretty white dress and her hair was shining brightly in the lamplight how nice to see you she said when she saw me do you have any news i have brought something better than news i said trying to speak happily i have brought the agra treasure i put the heavy chest down on the table miss morstan did not look very excited so this is the famous agra treasure she said yes i replied half of it belongs to you and half to thaddeus sholto you are a rich woman now miss morstan the treasure can wait she said first i want to hear all about your adventures please sit down and tell me everything so i told her everything that had happened i told her how holmes found the aurora i told her about inspector jones and thaddeus sholto i told her about the chase on the river the death of the pygmy and how we had caught jonathan small how brave you are she said didnt know that you were in such terrible danger its finished now i said lets open the treasure chest there isnt a key how can we open the chest miss morstan left the room and came back with a heavy metal bar i took the bar and put it under the lid of the chest then i turned it and the lid opened it lifted up the lid my hands were shaking we both looked inside then we looked at each other in astonishment the chest was empty the chest was made of very thick iron this was why it was so heavy the treasure is lost said miss morstan quietly thank god i said why do you say thank god asked miss morstan because now i can ask you to marry me i replied holding her hand because i love you mary now you are not going to be rich so i can tell you my feelings that is why i said thank god then i say thank god too she whispered chapter fifteen the sign of four then i got back to baker street holmes inspector jones and the prisoner jonathan small were all waiting for me i showed them the empty treasure chest small began to laugh where is the treasure small shouted jones angrily the agra treasure belongs to the sign of four said small quietly no one else will have it i threw it all to the bottom of the river we all stood astonished the great treasure of agra was lost forever the agra treasure is unlucky said small it has never brought happiness to anyone it brought death to captain morstan it brought fear and guilt to major sholto bartholomew sholto was murdered because of it and to me and the other members of the sign of four it has brought prison for the rest of our lives you must tell us your story said holmes what is the sign of four jonathan small began his strange story and we listened i went to india as a soldier in the british army said small one day soon after i arrived i had an accident and lost my leg after that i could not fight any more then there was terrible fighting between the indians and the british the british all hid in an old fortress at agra they shut themselves inside the walls of this fortress were very thick the indians could not get in i also went to agra i had three indian friends who had fought for the british they came to agra with me these men were mahomet singh abdullah khan and dost akbar when we were in the agra fortress we heard a strange story it was about a great treasure which had been hidden in the fortress it had been hidden for many years the four of us decided to look for this treasure and one day we found it it was hidden under the floor in a secret room we were astonished by what we had found we had never seen so many beautiful jewels the four of us decided not to say anything about what we had found we decided to leave the treasure hidden in the secret room in the fortress when the fighting was finished we would be able to take the treasure away with us we made a promise to each other we agreed that we would always work together we would share the treasure between us we became the sign of four but a terrible thing happened two british soldiers were killed in a fight we had not killed them but we were arrested for their murder we were sent to prison in the andaman islands is that where you met major sholto and captain morstan asked holmes yes said small sholto and morstan were the officers in charge of the prisoners there we were in a terrible situation we knew where the agra treasure was but we were not able to go and get it we were prisoners also we were afraid that someone else might find the treasure we did not know what to do at last we told sholto and morstan about the great treasure we asked them to help the four of us to escape when we were free we would get the treasure and share it with them but sholto said that he did not believe us he said he did not know if we were speaking the truth sholto did not know if the treasure would be there he said he would go to india if he found the treasure he would come back he would help us escape from prison sholto asked the four of us to give him a plan of the fortress at agra we did not want to give sholto the plan i didnt trust him but in the end we had to agree we gave one plan to sholto and another to morstan sholto went to india but he never came back he found the treasure and took it to england he stole it from the sign of four and also from his friend morstan and from that day i decided to have revenge on sholto small was silent for a few moments he was thinking about what sholto had done then he went on with his story i made friends with one of the people of the andaman islands he said the people there are pygmies they are very small but they are very brave one day i found one of these pygmies lying under a tree he was very ill i looked after him he slowly got better he became my friend his name was tonga tonga helped me to escape from the islands he had a small boat one dark night we put lots of food into the boat and we sailed together from the andaman islands holmes had been listening carefully while small told his story now he spoke ah i understand he said major sholto received a letter what was written in the letter frightened him to death it must have been the news of your escape which killed him small went on with his story at last tonga and i reached london but i was too late to have revenge on sholto sholto was dying he saw my face at the window that night i got into his room and left a message it was from the sign of four tonga and i waited six years we watched pondicherry lodge and bartholomew sholto carefully when bartholomew sholto found the treasure we knew about it immediately with tongas help i got into his room tonga killed bartholomew sholto with a poisoned thorn we took the treasure left the paper and went i had paid mordecai smith to take us to a ship we were planning to go to america but now everything has changed tonga is dead and i am your prisoner and the agra treasure is lost forever we were all silent we were thinking of the great treasure which was lost in the mud at the bottom of the river thames perhaps it was better there doctor watson said holmes when inspector jones had taken small away that is the end of our adventure yes i said but i have some very good news miss morstan and i are going to get married excellent said holmes the agra treasure has at last brought happiness to someone the end
