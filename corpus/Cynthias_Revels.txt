 introduction the greatest of english dramatists except shakespeare the first literary dictator and poetlaureate a writer of verse prose satire and criticism who most potently of all the men of his time affected the subsequent course of english letters such was ben jonson and as such his strong personality assumes an interest to us almost unparalleled at least in his age ben jonson came of the stock that was centuries after to give to the world thomas carlyle for jonsons grandfather was of annandale over the solway whence he migrated to england jonsons father lost his estate under queen mary having been cast into prison and forfeited he entered the church but died a month before his illustrious son was born leaving his widow and child in poverty jonsons birthplace was westminster and the time of his birth early in he was thus nearly ten years shakespeares junior and less well off if a trifle better born but jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage his mother married beneath her a wright or bricklayer and jonson was for a time apprenticed to the trade as a youth he attracted the attention of the famous antiquary william camden then usher at westminster school and there the poet laid the solid foundations of his classical learning jonson always held camden in veneration acknowledging that to him he owed all that i am in arts all that i know and dedicating his first dramatic success every man in his humour to him it is doubtful whether jonson ever went to either university though fuller says that he was statutably admitted into st johns college cambridge he tells us that he took no degree but was later master of arts in both the universities by their favour not his study when a mere youth jonson enlisted as a soldier trailing his pike in flanders in the protracted wars of william the silent against the spanish jonson was a large and rawboned lad he became by his own account in time exceedingly bulky in chat with his friend william drummond of hawthornden jonson told how in his service in the low countries he had in the face of both the camps killed an enemy and taken opima spolia from him and how since his coming to england being appealed to the fields he had killed his adversary which had hurt him in the arm and whose sword was ten inches longer than his jonsons reach may have made up for the lack of his sword certainly his prowess lost nothing in the telling obviously jonson was brave combative and not averse to talking of himself and his doings in jonson returned from abroad penniless soon after he married almost as early and quite as imprudently as shakespeare he told drummond curtly that his wife was a shrew yet honest for some years he lived apart from her in the household of lord albany yet two touching epitaphs among jonsons epigrams on my first daughter and on my first son attest the warmth of the poets family affections the daughter died in infancy the son of the plague another son grew up to manhood little credit to his father whom he survived we know nothing beyond this of jonsons domestic life how soon jonson drifted into what we now call grandly the theatrical profession we do not know in marlowe made his tragic exit from life and greene shakespeares other rival on the popular stage had preceded marlowe in an equally miserable death the year before shakespeare already had the running to himself jonson appears first in the employment of philip henslowe the exploiter of several troupes of players manager and fatherinlaw of the famous actor edward alleyn from entries in henslowes diary a species of theatrical account book which has been handed down to us we know that jonson was connected with the admirals men for he borrowed pounds of henslowe july paying back s d on the same day on account of his share in what is not altogether clear while later on december of the same year henslowe advanced s to him upon a book which he showed the plot unto the company which he promised to deliver unto the company at christmas next in the next august jonson was in collaboration with chettle and porter in a play called hot anger soon cold all this points to an association with henslowe of some duration as no mere tyro would be thus paid in advance upon mere promise from allusions in dekkers play satiromastix it appears that jonson like shakespeare began life as an actor and that he ambled in a leather pitch by a playwagon taking at one time the part of hieronimo in kyds famous play the spanish tragedy by the beginning of jonson though still in needy circumstances had begun to receive recognition francis meres well known for his comparative discourse of our english poets with the greek latin and italian poets printed in and for his mention therein of a dozen plays of shakespeare by title accords to ben jonson a place as one of our best in tragedy a matter of some surprise as no known tragedy of jonson from so early a date has come down to us that jonson was at work on tragedy however is proved by the entries in henslowe of at least three tragedies now lost in which he had a hand these are page of plymouth king robert ii of scotland and richard crookback but all of these came later on his return to henslowe and range from august to june returning to the autumn of an event now happened to sever for a time jonsons relations with henslowe in a letter to alleyn dated september of that year henslowe writes i have lost one of my company that hurteth me greatly that is gabriel spencer for he is slain in hogsden fields by the hands of benjamin jonson bricklayer the last word is perhaps henslowes thrust at jonson in his displeasure rather than a designation of his actual continuance at his trade up to this time it is fair to jonson to remark however that his adversary appears to have been a notorious fireeater who had shortly before killed one feeke in a similar squabble duelling was a frequent occurrence of the time among gentlemen and the nobility it was an impudent breach of the peace on the part of a player this duel is the one which jonson described years after to drummond and for it jonson was duly arraigned at old bailey tried and convicted he was sent to prison and such goods and chattels as he had were forfeited it is a thought to give one pause that but for the ancient law permitting convicted felons to plead as it was called the benefit of clergy jonson might have been hanged for this deed the circumstance that the poet could read and write saved him and he received only a brand of the letter t for tyburn on his left thumb while in jail jonson became a roman catholic but he returned to the faith of the church of england a dozen years later on his release in disgrace with henslowe and his former associates jonson offered his services as a playwright to henslowes rivals the lord chamberlains company in which shakespeare was a prominent shareholder a tradition of long standing though not susceptible of proof in a court of law narrates that jonson had submitted the manuscript of every man in his humour to the chamberlains men and had received from the company a refusal that shakespeare called him back read the play himself and at once accepted it whether this story is true or not certain it is that every man in his humour was accepted by shakespeares company and acted for the first time in with shakespeare taking a part the evidence of this is contained in the list of actors prefixed to the comedy in the folio of jonsons works but it is a mistake to infer because shakespeares name stands first in the list of actors and the elder knowell first in the dramatis personae that shakespeare took that particular part the order of a list of elizabethan players was generally that of their importance or priority as shareholders in the company and seldom if ever corresponded to the list of characters every man in his humour was an immediate success and with it jonsons reputation as one of the leading dramatists of his time was established once and for all this could have been by no means jonsons earliest comedy and we have just learned that he was already reputed one of our best in tragedy indeed one of jonsons extant comedies the case is altered but one never claimed by him or published as his must certainly have preceded every man in his humour on the stage the former play may be described as a comedy modelled on the latin plays of plautus it combines in fact situations derived from the captivi and the aulularia of that dramatist but the pretty story of the beggarmaiden rachel and her suitors jonson found not among the classics but in the ideals of romantic love which shakespeare had already popularised on the stage jonson never again produced so fresh and lovable a feminine personage as rachel although in other respects the case is altered is not a conspicuous play and save for the satirising of antony munday in the person of antonio balladino and gabriel harvey as well is perhaps the least characteristic of the comedies of jonson every man in his humour probably first acted late in the summer of and at the curtain is commonly regarded as an epochmaking play and this view is not unjustified as to plot it tells little more than how an intercepted letter enabled a father to follow his supposedly studious son to london and there observe his life with the gallants of the time the real quality of this comedy is in its personages and in the theory upon which they are conceived ben jonson had theories about poetry and the drama and he was neither chary in talking of them nor in experimenting with them in his plays this makes jonson like dryden in his time and wordsworth much later an author to reckon with particularly when we remember that many of jonsons notions came for a time definitely to prevail and to modify the whole trend of english poetry first of all jonson was a classicist that is he believed in restraint and precedent in art in opposition to the prevalent ungoverned and irresponsible renaissance spirit jonson believed that there was a professional way of doing things which might be reached by a study of the best examples and he found these examples for the most part among the ancients to confine our attention to the drama jonson objected to the amateurishness and haphazard nature of many contemporary plays and set himself to do something different and the first and most striking thing that he evolved was his conception and practice of the comedy of humours as jonson has been much misrepresented in this matter let us quote his own words as to humour a humour according to jonson was a bias of disposition a warp so to speak in character by which some one peculiar quality doth so possess a man that it doth draw all his affects his spirits and his powers in their confluctions all to run one way but continuing jonson is careful to add but that a rook by wearing a pied feather the cable hatband or the threepiled ruff a yard of shoetie or the switzers knot on his french garters should affect a humour o it is more than most ridiculous jonsons comedy of humours in a word conceived of stage personages on the basis of a ruling trait or passion a notable simplification of actual life be it observed in passing and placing these typified traits in juxtaposition in their conflict and contrast struck the spark of comedy downright as his name indicates is a plain squire bobadills humour is that of the braggart who is incidentally and with delightfully comic effect a coward brainworms humour is the finding out of things to the end of fooling everybody of course he is fooled in the end himself but it was not jonsons theories alone that made the success of every man in his humour the play is admirably written and each character is vividly conceived and with a firm touch based on observation of the men of the london of the day jonson was neither in this his first great comedy nor in any other play that he wrote a supine classicist urging that english drama return to a slavish adherence to classical conditions he says as to the laws of the old comedy meaning by laws such matters as the unities of time and place and the use of chorus i see not then but we should enjoy the same licence or free power to illustrate and heighten our invention as they the ancients did and not be tied to those strict and regular forms which the niceness of a few who are nothing but form would thrust upon us every man in his humour is written in prose a novel practice which jonson had of his predecessor in comedy john lyly even the word humour seems to have been employed in the jonsonian sense by chapman before jonsons use of it indeed the comedy of humours itself is only a heightened variety of the comedy of manners which represents life viewed at a satirical angle and is the oldest and most persistent species of comedy in the language none the less jonsons comedy merited its immediate success and marked out a definite course in which comedy long continued to run to mention only shakespeares falstaff and his rout bardolph pistol dame quickly and the rest whether in henry iv or in the merry wives of windsor all are conceived in the spirit of humours so are the captains welsh scotch and irish of henry v and malvolio especially later though shakespeare never employed the method of humours for an important personage it was not jonsons fault that many of his successors did precisely the thing that he had reprobated that is degrade the humour into an oddity of speech an eccentricity of manner of dress or cut of beard there was an anonymous play called every woman in her humour chapman wrote a humourous days mirth day humour out of breath fletcher later the humourous lieutenant and jonson besides every man out of his humour returned to the title in closing the cycle of his comedies in the magnetic lady or humours reconciled with the performance of every man out of his humour in by shakespeares company once more at the globe we turn a new page in jonsons career despite his many real virtues if there is one feature more than any other that distinguishes jonson it is his arrogance and to this may be added his selfrighteousness especially under criticism or satire every man out of his humour is the first of three comical satires which jonson contributed to what dekker called the poetomachia or war of the theatres as recent critics have named it this play as a fabric of plot is a very slight affair but as a satirical picture of the manners of the time proceeding by means of vivid caricature couched in witty and brilliant dialogue and sustained by that righteous indignation which must lie at the heart of all true satire as a realisation in short of the classical ideal of comedy there had been nothing like jonsons comedy since the days of aristophanes every man in his humour like the two plays that follow it contains two kinds of attack the critical or generally satiric levelled at abuses and corruptions in the abstract and the personal in which specific application is made of all this in the lampooning of poets and others jonsons contemporaries the method of personal attack by actual caricature of a person on the stage is almost as old as the drama aristophanes so lampooned euripides in the acharnians and socrates in the clouds to mention no other examples and in english drama this kind of thing is alluded to again and again what jonson really did was to raise the dramatic lampoon to an art and make out of a casual burlesque and bit of mimicry a dramatic satire of literary pretensions and permanency with the arrogant attitude mentioned above and his uncommon eloquence in scorn vituperation and invective it is no wonder that jonson soon involved himself in literary and even personal quarrels with his fellowauthors the circumstances of the origin of this poetomachia are far from clear and those who have written on the topic except of late have not helped to make them clearer the origin of the war has been referred to satirical references apparently to jonson contained in the scourge of villainy a satire in regular form after the manner of the ancients by john marston a fellow playwright subsequent friend and collaborator of jonsons on the other hand epigrams of jonson have been discovered and variously charging playwright reasonably identified with marston with scurrility cowardice and plagiarism though the dates of the epigrams cannot be ascertained with certainty jonsons own statement of the matter to drummond runs he had many quarrels with marston beat him and took his pistol from him wrote his poetaster on him the beginnings of them were that marston represented him on the stage footnote the best account of this whole subject is to be found in the edition of poetaster and satiromastrix by j h penniman in belles lettres series shortly to appear see also his earlier work the war of the theatres and the excellent contributions to the subject by h c hart in notes and queries and in his edition of jonson here at least we are on certain ground and the principals of the quarrel are known histriomastix a play revised by marston in has been regarded as the one in which jonson was thus represented on the stage although the personage in question chrisogonus a poet satirist and translator poor but proud and contemptuous of the common herd seems rather a complimentary portrait of jonson than a caricature as to the personages actually ridiculed in every man out of his humour carlo buffone was formerly thought certainly to be marston as he was described as a public scurrilous and profane jester and elsewhere as the grand scourge or second untruss that is satirist of the time joseph hall being by his own boast the first and marstons work being entitled the scourge of villainy apparently we must now prefer for carlo a notorious character named charles chester of whom gossipy and inaccurate aubrey relates that he was a bold impertinent fellowa perpetual talker and made a noise like a drum in a room so one time at a tavern sir walter raleigh beats him and seals up his mouth that is his upper and nether beard with hard wax from him ben jonson takes his carlo buffone ie jester in every man in his humour sic is it conceivable that after all jonson was ridiculing marston and that the point of the satire consisted in an intentional confusion of the grand scourge or second untruss with the scurrilous and profane chester we have digressed into detail in this particular case to exemplify the difficulties of criticism in its attempts to identify the allusions in these forgotten quarrels we are on sounder ground of fact in recording other manifestations of jonsons enmity in the case is altered there is clear ridicule in the character antonio balladino of anthony munday pageantpoet of the city translator of romances and playwright as well in every man in his humour there is certainly a caricature of samuel daniel accepted poet of the court sonneteer and companion of men of fashion these men held recognised positions to which jonson felt his talents better entitled him they were hence to him his natural enemies it seems almost certain that he pursued both in the personages of his satire through every man out of his humour and cynthias revels daniel under the characters fastidious brisk and hedon munday as puntarvolo and amorphus but in these last we venture on quagmire once more jonsons literary rivalry of daniel is traceable again and again in the entertainments that welcomed king james on his way to london in the masques at court and in the pastoral drama as to jonsons personal ambitions with respect to these two men it is notable that he became not pageantpoet but chronologer to the city of london and that on the accession of the new king he came soon to triumph over daniel as the accepted entertainer of royalty cynthias revels the second comical satire was acted in and as a play is even more lengthy elaborate and impossible than every man out of his humour here personal satire seems to have absorbed everything and while much of the caricature is admirable especially in the detail of witty and trenchantly satirical dialogue the central idea of a fountain of selflove is not very well carried out and the persons revert at times to abstractions the action to allegory it adds to our wonder that this difficult drama should have been acted by the children of queen elizabeths chapel among them nathaniel field with whom jonson read horace and martial and whom he taught later how to make plays another of these precocious little actors was salathiel pavy who died before he was thirteen already famed for taking the parts of old men him jonson immortalised in one of the sweetest of his epitaphs an interesting sidelight is this on the character of this redoubtable and rugged satirist that he should thus have befriended and tenderly remembered these little theatrical waifs some of whom as we know had been literally kidnapped to be pressed into the service of the theatre and whipped to the conning of their difficult parts to the caricature of daniel and munday in cynthias revels must be added anaides impudence here assuredly marston and asotus the prodigal interpreted as lodge or more perilously raleigh crites like aspermacilente in every man out of his humour is jonsons selfcomplaisant portrait of himself the just wholly admirable and judicious scholar holding his head high above the pack of the yelping curs of envy and detraction but careless of their puny attacks on his perfections with only too mindful a neglect the third and last of the comical satires is poetaster acted once more by the children of the chapel in and jonsons only avowed contribution to the fray according to the authors own account this play was written in fifteen weeks on a report that his enemies had entrusted to dekker the preparation of satiromastix the untrussing of the humorous poet a dramatic attack upon himself in this attempt to forestall his enemies jonson succeeded and poetaster was an immediate and deserved success while hardly more closely knit in structure than its earlier companion pieces poetaster is planned to lead up to the ludicrous final scene in which after a device borrowed from the lexiphanes of lucian the offending poetaster marstoncrispinus is made to throw up the difficult words with which he had overburdened his stomach as well as overlarded his vocabulary in the end crispinus with his fellow dekkerdemetrius is bound over to keep the peace and never thenceforward malign traduce or detract the person or writings of quintus horatius flaccus jonson or any other eminent man transcending you in merit one of the most diverting personages in jonsons comedy is captain tucca his peculiarity has been well described by ward as a buoyant blackguardism which recovers itself instantaneously from the most complete exposure and a picturesqueness of speech like that of a walking dictionary of slang it was this character captain tucca that dekker hit upon in his reply satiromastix and he amplified him turning his abusive vocabulary back upon jonson and adding an immodesty to his dialogue that did not enter into jonsons conception it has been held altogether plausibly that when dekker was engaged professionally so to speak to write a dramatic reply to jonson he was at work on a species of chronicle history dealing with the story of walter terill in the reign of william rufus this he hurriedly adapted to include the satirical characters suggested by poetaster and fashioned to convey the satire of his reply the absurdity of placing horace in the court of a norman king is the result but dekkers play is not without its palpable hits at the arrogance the literary pride and selfrighteousness of jonsonhorace whose ningle or pal the absurd asinius bubo has recently been shown to figure forth in all likelihood jonsons friend the poet drayton slight and hastily adapted as is satiromastix especially in a comparison with the better wrought and more significant satire of poetaster the town awarded the palm to dekker not to jonson and jonson gave over in consequence his practice of comical satire though jonson was cited to appear before the lord chief justice to answer certain charges to the effect that he had attacked lawyers and soldiers in poetaster nothing came of this complaint it may be suspected that much of this furious clatter and giveandtake was pure playing to the gallery the town was agog with the strife and on no less an authority than shakespeare hamlet ii we learn that the childrens company acting the plays of jonson did so berattle the common stagesthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither several other plays have been thought to bear a greater or less part in the war of the theatres among them the most important is a college play entitled the return from parnassus dating in it a muchquoted passage makes burbage as a character declare why heres our fellow shakespeare puts them all down aye and ben jonson too o that ben jonson is a pestilent fellow he brought up horace giving the poets a pill but our fellow shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him bewray his credit was shakespeare then concerned in this war of the stages and what could have been the nature of this purge among several suggestions troilus and cressida has been thought by some to be the play in which shakespeare thus put down his friend jonson a wiser interpretation finds the purge in satiromastix which though not written by shakespeare was staged by his company and therefore with his approval and under his direction as one of the leaders of that company the last years of the reign of elizabeth thus saw jonson recognised as a dramatist second only to shakespeare and not second even to him as a dramatic satirist but jonson now turned his talents to new fields plays on subjects derived from classical story and myth had held the stage from the beginning of the drama so that shakespeare was making no new departure when he wrote his julius caesar about therefore when jonson staged sejanus three years later and with shakespeares company once more he was only following in the elder dramatists footsteps but jonsons idea of a play on classical history on the one hand and shakespeares and the elder popular dramatists on the other were very different heywood some years before had put five straggling plays on the stage in quick succession all derived from stories in ovid and dramatised with little taste or discrimination shakespeare had a finer conception of form but even he was contented to take all his ancient history from norths translation of plutarch and dramatise his subject without further inquiry jonson was a scholar and a classical antiquarian he reprobated this slipshod amateurishness and wrote his sejanus like a scholar reading tacitus suetonius and other authorities to be certain of his facts his setting and his atmosphere and somewhat pedantically noting his authorities in the margin when he came to print sejanus is a tragedy of genuine dramatic power in which is told with discriminating taste the story of the haughty favourite of tiberius with his tragical overthrow our drama presents no truer nor more painstaking representation of ancient roman life than may be found in jonsons sejanus and catiline his conspiracy which followed in a passage in the address of the former play to the reader in which jonson refers to a collaboration in an earlier version has led to the surmise that shakespeare may have been that worthier pen there is no evidence to determine the matter in we find jonson in active collaboration with chapman and marston in the admirable comedy of london life entitled eastward hoe in the previous year marston had dedicated his malcontent in terms of fervid admiration to jonson so that the wounds of the war of the theatres must have been long since healed between jonson and chapman there was the kinship of similar scholarly ideals the two continued friends throughout life eastward hoe achieved the extraordinary popularity represented in a demand for three issues in one year but this was not due entirely to the merits of the play in its earliest version a passage which an irritable courtier conceived to be derogatory to his nation the scots sent both chapman and jonson to jail but the matter was soon patched up for by this time jonson had influence at court with the accession of king james jonson began his long and successful career as a writer of masques he wrote more masques than all his competitors together and they are of an extraordinary variety and poetic excellence jonson did not invent the masque for such premeditated devices to set and frame so to speak a court ball had been known and practised in varying degrees of elaboration long before his time but jonson gave dramatic value to the masque especially in his invention of the antimasque a comedy or farcical element of relief entrusted to professional players or dancers he enhanced as well the beauty and dignity of those portions of the masque in which noble lords and ladies took their parts to create by their gorgeous costumes and artistic grouping and evolutions a sumptuous show on the mechanical and scenic side jonson had an inventive and ingenious partner in inigo jones the royal architect who more than any one man raised the standard of stage representation in the england of his day jonson continued active in the service of the court in the writing of masques and other entertainments far into the reign of king charles but towards the end a quarrel with jones embittered his life and the two testy old men appear to have become not only a constant irritation to each other but intolerable bores at court in hymenaei the masque of queens love freed from ignorance lovers made men pleasure reconciled to virtue and many more will be found jonsons aptitude his taste his poetry and inventiveness in these byforms of the drama while in the masque of christmas and the gipsies metamorphosed especially is discoverable that power of broad comedy which at court as well as in the city was not the least element of jonsons contemporary popularity but jonson had by no means given up the popular stage when he turned to the amusement of king james in volpone was produced the silent woman in the alchemist in the following year these comedies with bartholomew fair represent jonson at his height and for constructive cleverness character successfully conceived in the manner of caricature wit and brilliancy of dialogue they stand alone in english drama volpone or the fox is in a sense a transition play from the dramatic satires of the war of the theatres to the purer comedy represented in the plays named above its subject is a struggle of wit applied to chicanery for among its dramatis personae from the villainous fox himself his rascally servant mosca voltore the vulture corbaccio and corvino the big and the little raven to sir politic wouldbe and the rest there is scarcely a virtuous character in the play question has been raised as to whether a story so forbidding can be considered a comedy for although the plot ends in the discomfiture and imprisonment of the most vicious it involves no mortal catastrophe but jonson was on sound historical ground for volpone is conceived far more logically on the lines of the ancients theory of comedy than was ever the romantic drama of shakespeare however repulsive we may find a philosophy of life that facilely divides the world into the rogues and their dupes and identifying brains with roguery and innocence with folly admires the former while inconsistently punishing them the silent woman is a gigantic farce of the most ingenious construction the whole comedy hinges on a huge joke played by a heartless nephew on his misanthropic uncle who is induced to take to himself a wife young fair and warranted silent but who in the end turns out neither silent nor a woman at all in the alchemist again we have the utmost cleverness in construction the whole fabric building climax on climax witty ingenious and so plausibly presented that we forget its departures from the possibilities of life in the alchemist jonson represented none the less to the life certain sharpers of the metropolis revelling in their shrewdness and rascality and in the variety of the stupidity and wickedness of their victims we may object to the fact that the only person in the play possessed of a scruple of honesty is discomfited and that the greatest scoundrel of all is approved in the end and rewarded the comedy is so admirably written and contrived the personages stand out with such lifelike distinctness in their several kinds and the whole is animated with such verve and resourcefulness that the alchemist is a new marvel every time it is read lastly of this group comes the tremendous comedy bartholomew fair less clear cut less definite and less structurally worthy of praise than its three predecessors but full of the keenest and cleverest of satire and inventive to a degree beyond any english comedy save some other of jonsons own it is in bartholomew fair that we are presented to the immortal caricature of the puritan zealintheland busy and the littlewits that group about him and it is in this extraordinary comedy that the humour of jonson always open to this danger loosens into the rabelaisian mode that so delighted king james in the gipsies metamorphosed another comedy of less merit is the devil is an ass acted in it was the failure of this play that caused jonson to give over writing for the public stage for a period of nearly ten years volpone was laid as to scene in venice whether because of the success of eastward hoe or for other reasons the other three comedies declare in the words of the prologue to the alchemist our scene is london cause we would make known no countrys mirth is better than our own indeed jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for collected publication in his folio of he transferred the scene of every man in his humour from florence to london also converting signior lorenzo di pazzi to old knowell prospero to master welborn and hesperida to dame kitely dwelling i the old jewry in his comedies of london life despite his trend towards caricature jonson has shown himself a genuine realist drawing from the life about him with an experience and insight rare in any generation a happy comparison has been suggested between ben jonson and charles dickens both were men of the people lowly born and hardly bred each knew the london of his time as few men knew it and each represented it intimately and in elaborate detail both men were at heart moralists seeking the truth by the exaggerated methods of humour and caricature perverse even wrongheaded at times but possessed of a true pathos and largeness of heart and when all has been said though the elizabethan ran to satire the victorian to sentimentality leaving the world better for the art that they practised in it in the year of the death of shakespeare jonson collected his plays his poetry and his masques for publication in a collective edition this was an unusual thing at the time and had been attempted by no dramatist before jonson this volume published in a carefully revised text all the plays thus far mentioned excepting the case is altered which jonson did not acknowledge bartholomew fair and the devil is an ass which was written too late it included likewise a book of some hundred and thirty odd epigrams in which form of brief and pungent writing jonson was an acknowledged master the forest a smaller collection of lyric and occasional verse and some ten masques and entertainments in this same year jonson was made poet laureate with a pension of one hundred marks a year this with his fees and returns from several noblemen and the small earnings of his plays must have formed the bulk of his income the poet appears to have done certain literary hackwork for others as for example parts of the punic wars contributed to raleighs history of the world we know from a story little to the credit of either that jonson accompanied raleighs son abroad in the capacity of a tutor in jonson was granted the reversion of the office of master of the revels a post for which he was peculiarly fitted but he did not live to enjoy its perquisites jonson was honoured with degrees by both universities though when and under what circumstances is not known it has been said that he narrowly escaped the honour of knighthood which the satirists of the day averred king james was wont to lavish with an indiscriminate hand worse men were made knights in his day than worthy ben jonson from to the close of the reign of king james jonson produced nothing for the stage but he prosecuted what he calls his wonted studies with such assiduity that he became in reality as by report one of the most learned men of his time jonsons theory of authorship involved a wide acquaintance with books and an ability as he put it to convert the substance or riches of another poet to his own use accordingly jonson read not only the greek and latin classics down to the lesser writers but he acquainted himself especially with the latin writings of his learned contemporaries their prose as well as their poetry their antiquities and curious lore as well as their more solid learning though a poor man jonson was an indefatigable collector of books he told drummond that the earl of pembroke sent him pounds every first day of the new year to buy new books unhappily in his library was destroyed by fire an accident seriocomically described in his witty poem an execration upon vulcan yet even now a book turns up from time to time in which is inscribed in fair large italian lettering the name ben jonson with respect to jonsons use of his material dryden said memorably of him he was not only a professed imitator of horace but a learned plagiary of all the others you track him everywhere in their snowbut he has done his robberies so openly that one sees he fears not to be taxed by any law he invades authors like a monarch and what would be theft in other poets is only victory in him and yet it is but fair to say that jonson prided himself and justly on his originality in catiline he not only uses sallusts account of the conspiracy but he models some of the speeches of cicero on the roman orators actual words in poetaster he lifts a whole satire out of horace and dramatises it effectively for his purposes the sophist libanius suggests the situation of the silent woman a latin comedy of giordano bruno il candelaio the relation of the dupes and the sharpers in the alchemist the mostellaria of plautus its admirable opening scene but jonson commonly bettered his sources and putting the stamp of his sovereignty on whatever bullion he borrowed made it thenceforward to all time current and his own the lyric and especially the occasional poetry of jonson has a peculiar merit his theory demanded design and the perfection of literary finish he was furthest from the rhapsodist and the careless singer of an idle day and he believed that apollo could only be worthily served in singing robes and laurel crowned and yet many of jonsons lyrics will live as long as the language who does not know queen and huntress chaste and fair drink to me only with thine eyes or still to be neat still to be dressed beautiful in form deft and graceful in expression with not a word too much or one that bears not its part in the total effect there is yet about the lyrics of jonson a certain stiffness and formality a suspicion that they were not quite spontaneous and unbidden but that they were carved so to speak with disproportionate labour by a potent man of letters whose habitual thought is on greater things it is for these reasons that jonson is even better in the epigram and in occasional verse where rhetorical finish and pointed wit less interfere with the spontaneity and emotion which we usually associate with lyrical poetry there are no such epitaphs as ben jonsons witness the charming ones on his own children on salathiel pavy the childactor and many more and this even though the rigid law of mine and thine must now restore to william browne of tavistock the famous lines beginning underneath this sable hearse jonson is unsurpassed too in the difficult poetry of compliment seldom falling into fulsome praise and disproportionate similitude yet showing again and again a generous appreciation of worth in others a discriminating taste and a generous personal regard there was no man in england of his rank so well known and universally beloved as ben jonson the list of his friends of those to whom he had written verses and those who had written verses to him includes the name of every man of prominence in the england of king james and the tone of many of these productions discloses an affectionate familiarity that speaks for the amiable personality and sound worth of the laureate in growing unwieldy through inactivity jonson hit upon the heroic remedy of a journey afoot to scotland on his way thither and back he was hospitably received at the houses of many friends and by those to whom his friends had recommended him when he arrived in edinburgh the burgesses met to grant him the freedom of the city and drummond foremost of scottish poets was proud to entertain him for weeks as his guest at hawthornden some of the noblest of jonsons poems were inspired by friendship such is the fine ode to the memory of sir lucius cary and sir henry moryson and that admirable piece of critical insight and filial affection prefixed to the first shakespeare folio to the memory of my beloved master william shakespeare and what he hath left us to mention only these nor can the earlier epode beginning not to know vice at all be matched in stately gravity and gnomic wisdom in its own wise and stately age but if jonson had deserted the stage after the publication of his folio and up to the end of the reign of king james he was far from inactive for year after year his inexhaustible inventiveness continued to contribute to the masquing and entertainment at court in the golden age restored pallas turns the iron age with its attendant evils into statues which sink out of sight in pleasure reconciled to virtue atlas figures represented as an old man his shoulders covered with snow and comus the god of cheer or the belly is one of the characters a circumstance which an imaginative boy of ten named john milton was not to forget pans anniversary late in the reign of james proclaimed that jonson had not yet forgotten how to write exquisite lyrics and the gipsies metamorphosed displayed the old drollery and broad humorous stroke still unimpaired and unmatchable these too and the earlier years of charles were the days of the apollo room of the devil tavern where jonson presided the absolute monarch of english literary bohemia we hear of a room blazoned about with jonsons own judicious leges convivales in letters of gold of a company made up of the choicest spirits of the time devotedly attached to their veteran dictator his reminiscences opinions affections and enmities and we hear too of valorous potations but in the words of herrick addressed to his master jonson at the devil tavern as at the dog the triple tun and at the mermaid we such clusters had as made us nobly wild not mad and yet each verse of thine outdid the meat outdid the frolic wine but the patronage of the court failed in the days of king charles though jonson was not without royal favours and the old poet returned to the stage producing between and the staple of news the new inn the magnetic lady and the tale of a tub the last doubtless revised from a much earlier comedy none of these plays met with any marked success although the scathing generalisation of dryden that designated them jonsons dotages is unfair to their genuine merits thus the idea of an office for the gathering proper dressing and promulgation of news wild flight of the fancy in its time was an excellent subject for satire on the existing absurdities among newsmongers although as much can hardly be said for the magnetic lady who in her bounty draws to her personages of differing humours to reconcile them in the end according to the alternative title or humours reconciled these last plays of the old dramatist revert to caricature and the hard lines of allegory the moralist is more than ever present the satire degenerates into personal lampoon especially of his sometime friend inigo jones who appears unworthily to have used his influence at court against the brokendown old poet and now disease claimed jonson and he was bedridden for months he had succeeded middleton in as chronologer to the city of london but lost the post for not fulfilling its duties king charles befriended him and even commissioned him to write still for the entertainment of the court and he was not without the sustaining hand of noble patrons and devoted friends among the younger poets who were proud to be sealed of the tribe of ben jonson died august and a second folio of his works which he had been some time gathering was printed in bearing in its various parts dates ranging from to it included all the plays mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs excepting the case is altered the masques some fifteen that date between and another collection of lyrics and occasional poetry called underwoods including some further entertainments a translation of horaces art of poetry also published in a vicesimo quarto in and certain fragments and ingatherings which the poet would hardly have included himself these last comprise the fragment less than seventy lines of a tragedy called mortimer his fall and three acts of a pastoral drama of much beauty and poetic spirit the sad shepherd there is also the exceedingly interesting english grammar made by ben jonson for the benefit of all strangers out of his observation of the english language now spoken and in use in latin and english and timber or discoveries made upon men and matter as they have flowed out of his daily reading or had their reflux to his peculiar notion of the times the discoveries as it is usually called is a commonplace book such as many literary men have kept in which their reading was chronicled passages that took their fancy translated or transcribed and their passing opinions noted many passages of jonsons discoveries are literal translations from the authors he chanced to be reading with the reference noted or not as the accident of the moment prescribed at times he follows the line of macchiavellis argument as to the nature and conduct of princes at others he clarifies his own conception of poetry and poets by recourse to aristotle he finds a choice paragraph on eloquence in seneca the elder and applies it to his own recollection of bacons power as an orator and another on facile and ready genius and translates it adapting it to his recollection of his fellowplaywright shakespeare to call such passages which jonson never intended for publication plagiarism is to obscure the significance of words to disparage his memory by citing them is a preposterous use of scholarship jonsons prose both in his dramas in the descriptive comments of his masques and in the discoveries is characterised by clarity and vigorous directness nor is it wanting in a fine sense of form or in the subtler graces of diction when jonson died there was a project for a handsome monument to his memory but the civil war was at hand and the project failed a memorial not insufficient was carved on the stone covering his grave in one of the aisles of westminster abbey o rare ben jonson felix e

in though it be nothing but to revenge myself on the author since i speak not his prologue ill go tell all the argument of his play aforehand and so stale his invention to the auditory before it come forth child o do not so child by no means child advancing to the front of the stage first the title of his play is cynthias revels as any man that hath hope to be saved by his book can witness the scene gargaphie which i do vehemently suspect for some fustian country but let that vanish here is the court of cynthia whither he brings cupid travelling on foot resolved to turn page by the way cupid meets with mercury as thats a thing to be noted take any of our playbooks without a cupid or a mercury in it and burn it for an heretic in poetry in these and the subsequent speeches at every break the other two interrupt and endeavour to stop him pray thee let me alone mercury he in the nature of a conjurer raises up echo who weeps over her love or daffodil narcissus a little sings curses the spring wherein the pretty foolish gentleman melted himself away and theres an end of her now i am to inform you that cupid and mercury do both become pages cupid attends on philautia or selflove a court lady mercury follows hedon the voluptuous and a courtier one that ranks himself even with anaides or the impudent a gallant and thats my part one that keeps laughter gelaia the daughter of folly a wench in boys attire to wait on him these in the court meet with amorphus or the deformed a traveller that hath drunk of the fountain and there tells the wonders of the water they presently dispatch away their pages with bottles to fetch of it and themselves go to visit the ladies but i should have told you look these emmets put me out here that with this amorphus there comes along a citizens heir asotus or the prodigal who in imitation of the traveller who hath the whetstone following him entertains the beggar to be his attendant now the nymphs who are mistresses to these gallants are philautia selflove phantaste a light wittiness argurion money and their guardian mother moria or mistress folly child pray thee no more child there cupid strikes money in love with the prodigal makes her dote upon him give him jewels bracelets carcanets etc all which he most ingeniously departs withal to be made known to the other ladies and gallants and in the heat of this increases his train with the fool to follow him as well as the beggar by this time your beggar begins to wait close who is returned with the rest of his fellow bottlemen there they all drink save argurion who is fallen into a sudden apoplexy child stop his mouth child and then theres a retired scholar there you would not wish a thing to be better contemnd of a society of gallants than it is and he applies his service good gentleman to the lady arete or virtue a poor nymph of cynthias train thats scarce able to buy herself a gown you shall see her play in a black robe anon a creature that i assure you is no less scornd than himself where am i now at a stand child come leave at last yet child o the night is come twas somewhat dark methought and cynthia intends to come forth that helps it a little yet all the courtiers must provide for revels they conclude upon a masque the device of which is what will you ravish me that each of these vices being to appear before cynthia would seem other than indeed they are and therefore assume the most neighbouring virtues as their masking habit id cry a rape but that you are children child come well have no more of this anticipation to give them the inventory of their cates aforehand were the discipline of a tavern and not fitting this presence child tut this was but to shew us the happiness of his memory i thought at first he would have plaid the ignorant critic with everything along as he had gone i expected some such device child o you shall see me do that rarely lend me thy cloak child soft sir youll speak my prologue in it child no would i might never stir then child lend it him lend it him child well you have sworn gives him the cloak child i have now sir suppose i am one of your genteel auditors that am come in having paid my money at the door with much ado and here i take my place and sit down i have my three sorts of tobacco in my pocket my light by me and thus i begin at the breaks he takes his tobacco by this light i wonder that any man is so mad to come to see these rascally tits play here they do act like so many wrens or pismires not the fifth part of a good face amongst them all and then their music is abominable able to stretch a mans ears worse then ten pillories and their ditties most lamentable things like the pitiful fellows that make them poets by this vapour an twere not for tobacco i think the very stench of em would poison me i should not dare to come in at their gates a man were better visit fifteen jails or a dozen or two of hospitals than once adventure to come near them how ist well child excellent give me my cloak child stay you shall see me do another now but a more sober or bettergatherd gallant that is as it may be thought some friend or wellwisher to the house and here i enter child what upon the stage too child yes and i step forth like one of the children and ask you would you have a stool sir child a stool boy child ay sir if youll give me sixpence ill fetch you one child for what i pray thee what shall i do with it child o lord sir will you betray your ignorance so much why throne yourself in state on the stage as other gentlemen use sir child away wag what wouldst thou make an implement of me slid the boy takes me for a piece of perspective i hold my life or some silk curtain come to hang the stage here sir crack i am none of your fresh pictures that use to beautify the decayed dead arras in a public theatre child tis a sign sir you put not that confidence in your good clothes and your better face that a gentleman should do sir but i pray you sir let me be a suitor to you that you will quit our stage then and take a place the play is instantly to begin child most willingly my good wag but i would speak with your author where is he child not this way i assure you sir we are not so officiously befriended by him as to have his presence in the tiringhouse to prompt us aloud stamp at the bookholder swear for our properties curse the poor tireman rail the music out of tune and sweat for every venial trespass we commit as some author would if he had such fine enghles as we well tis but our hard fortune child nay crack be not disheartened child not i sir but if you please to confer with our author by attorney you may sir our proper self here stands for him child troth i have no such serious affair to negotiate with him but what may very safely be turnd upon thy trust it is in the general behalf of this fair society here that i am to speak at least the more judicious part of it which seems much distasted with the immodest and obscene writing of many in their plays besides they could wish your poets would leave to be promoters of other mens jests and to waylay all the stale apothegms or old books they can hear of in print or otherwise to farce their scenes withal that they would not so penuriously glean wit from every laundress or hackneyman or derive their best grace with servile imitation from common stages or observation of the company they converse with as if their invention lived wholly upon another mans trencher again that feeding their friends with nothing of their own but what they have twice or thrice cooked they should not wantonly give out how soon they had drest it nor how many coaches came to carry away the broken meat besides hobbyhorses and footcloth nags child so sir this is all the reformation you seek child it is do not you think it necessary to be practised my little wag child yes where any such illhabited custom is received child o i had almost forgot it too they say the umbrae or ghosts of some three or four plays departed a dozen years since have been seen walking on your stage here take heed boy if your house be haunted with such hobgoblins twill fright away all your spectators quickly child good sir but what will you say now if a poet untouchd with any breath of this disease find the tokens upon you that are of the auditory as some one civetwit among you that knows no other learning than the price of satin and velvets nor other perfection than the wearing of a neat suit and yet will censure as desperately as the most professd critic in the house presuming his clothes should bear him out in it another whom it hath pleased nature to furnish with more beard than brain prunes his mustaccio lisps and with some score of affected oaths swears down all that sit about him that the old hieronimo as it was first acted was the only best and judiciously pennd play of europe a third greatbellied juggler talks of twenty years since and when monsieur was here and would enforce all wits to be of that fashion because his doublet is still so a fourth miscalls all by the name of fustian that his grounded capacity cannot aspire to a fifth only shakes his bottle head and out of his corky brain squeezeth out a pitiful learned face and is silent child by my faith jack you have put me down i would i knew how to get off with any indifferent grace here take your cloak and promise some satisfaction in your prologue or ill be sworn we have marrd all child tut fear not child this will never distaste a true sense be not out and good enough i would thou hadst some sugar candied to sweeten thy mouth the third sounding prologue if gracious silence sweet attention quick sight and quicker apprehension the lights of judgments throne shine any where our doubtful author hopes this is their sphere and therefore opens he himself to those to other weaker beams his labours close as loth to prostitute their virginstrain to every vulgar and adulterate brain in this alone his muse her sweetness hath she shuns the print of any beaten path and proves new ways to come to learned ears pied ignorance she neither loves nor fears nor hunts she after popular applause or foamy praise that drops from common jaws the garland that she wears their hands must twine who can both censure understand define what merit is then cast those piercing rays round as a crown instead of honourd bays

ghosts too that pass the stygian ferry and i suspect you for a share with the old sculler there if the truth were known but let that scape one other peculiar virtue you possess in lifting or leigerdumain which few of the house of heaven have else besides i must confess but methinks that should not make you put that extreme distance twixt yourself and others that we should be said to overdare in speaking to your nimble deity so hercules might challenge priority of us both because he can throw the bar farther or lift more joind stools at the arms end than we if this might carry it

olympian palace rung again with applause of the fact cup o no i remember it freshly and by a particular instance for my mother venus at the same time but stoopd to embrace you and to speak by metaphor

ordinary gallants their tobaccoboxes for i am strangely jealous of your nails mer never trust me cupid but you are turnd a most acute gallant of late the edge of my wit is clean taken off with the fine and subtile stroke of your thinground tongue you fight with too poignant a phrase for me to deal with cup o hermes your craft cannot make me confident i know my own steel to be almost spent and therefore entreat my peace with you in time you are too cunning for me to encounter at length and i think it my safest ward to close mer well for once ill suffer you to win upon me wag but use not these strains too often theyll stretch my patience whither might you march now cup faith to recover thy good thoughts ill discover my whole project the huntress and queen of these groves diana in regard of some black and envious slanders hourly breathed against her for her divine justice on acteon as she pretends hath here in the vale of gargaphie proclaimd a solemn revels which her godhead put off she will descend to grace with the full and royal expense of one of her clearest moons in which time it shall be lawful for all sorts of ingenious persons to visit her palace to court her nymphs to exercise all variety of generous and noble pastimes as well to intimate how far she treads such malicious imputations beneath her as also to shew how clear her beauties are from the least wrinkle of austerity they may be charged with mer but what is all this to cupid cup here do i mean to put off the title of a god and take the habit of a page in which disguise during the interim of these revels i will get to follow some one of dianas maids where if my bow hold and my shafts fly but with half the willingness and aim they are directed i doubt not but i shall really redeem the minutes i have lost by their so long and over nice proscription of my deity from their court mer pursue it divine cupid it will be rare cup but will hermes second me mer i am now to put in act an especial designment from my father jove but that performd i am for any fresh action that offers itself cup well then we part exit mer farewell good wag now to my charge echo fair echo speak tis

transformd into this drooping flower hangs the repentant head back from the stream as if it wishd would i had never lookd in such a flattering mirror o narcissus thou that wast once and yet art my narcissus had echo but been private with thy thoughts she would have dropt away herself in tears till she had all turnd water that in her as in a truer glass thou mightst have gazed and seen thy beauties by more kind reflection but selflove never yet could look on truth but with bleard beams slick flattery and she are twinborn sisters and so mix their eyes as if you sever one the other dies

excellence o hadst thou known the worth of heavens rich gift thou wouldst have turnd it to a truer use and not with starvd and covetous ignorance pined in continual eyeing that bright gem the glance

my behaviours had been of a cheap or customary garb my accent or phrase vulgar my garments trite my countenance illiterate or unpractised in the encounter of a beautiful and brave attired piece then i might with some change of colour have suspected my faculties but knowing myself an essence so sublimated and refined by travel of so studied and well exercised a gesture so alone in fashion able to render the face of any statesman living and to speak the mere extraction of language one that hath now made the sixth return upon venture and was your first that ever enrichd his country with the true laws of the duello whose optics have drunk the spirit of beauty in some eight score and eighteen princes courts where i have resided and been there fortunate in the amours of three hundred and forty

exeunt all but crites cri he will rank even with you eret be long if you hold on your course o vanity how are thy painted beauties doted on by light and empty idiots how pursued with open and extended appetite how they do sweat and run themselves from breath raised on their toes to catch thy airy forms still turning giddy till they reel like drunkards that buy the merry madness of one hour with the long irksomeness of following time o how despised and base a thing is man if he not strive to erect his grovelling thoughts above the strain of flesh but how more cheap when evn his best and understanding part the crown and strength of all his faculties floats like a dead drownd body on the stream of vulgar humour mixt with commonst dregs i suffer for their guilt now and my soul like one that looks on illaffected eyes is hurt with mere intention on their follies why will i view them then my sense might ask me or ist a rarity or some new object that strains my strict observance to this point o would it were therein i could afford my spirit should draw a little near to theirs to gaze on novelties so vice were one tut she is stale rank foul and were it not that those that woo her greet her with lockd eyes in spight of all th impostures paintings drugs which her bawd custom dawbs her cheeks withal she would betray her loathd and leprous face and fright the enamourd dotards from themselves but such is the perverseness of our nature that if we once but fancy levity how antic and ridiculous soeer it suit with us yet will our muffled thought choose rather not to see it than avoid it and if we can but banish our own sense we act our mimic tricks with that free license that lust that pleasure that security as if we practised in a pasteboard case and no one saw the motion but the motion well check thy passion lest it grow too loud while fools are pitied they wax fat and proud act ii scene i the court enter cupid and mercury disguised as pages cup why this was most unexpectedly followed my divine delicate mercury by the beard of jove thou art a precious deity mer nay cupid leave to speak improperly since we are turnd cracks lets study to be like cracks practise

very brine of conceit and sparkle like salt in fire cup thats not every ones happiness hermes though you can presume upon the easiness and dexterity of your wit you shall give me leave to be a little jealous of mine and not desperately to hazard it after your capering humour mer nay then cupid i think we must have you hoodwinkd again for you are grown too provident since your eyes were at liberty

lighted on for a master mer such a one as before i begin to decipher him i dare not affirm to be any thing less than a courtier so much he is during this open time of revels and would be longer but that his means are to leave him shortly after his name is hedon a gallant wholly consecrated to his pleasures cup hedon he uses much to my ladys chamber i think mer how is she calld and then i can shew thee cup madame philautia mer o ay he affects her very particularly indeed these are his graces he doth besides me keep a barber and a monkey he has a rich wrought waistcoat to entertain his visitants in with a cap almost suitable his curtains and bedding are thought to be his own his bathingtub is not suspected he loves to have a fencer a pedant and a musician seen in his lodging amornings cup and not a poet mer fie no himself is a rhymer and thats thought better than a poet he is not lightly within to his mercer no though he come when he takes physic which is commonly after his play he beats a tailor very well but a stockingseller admirably and so consequently any one he owes money to that dares not resist him he never makes general invitement but against the publishing of a new suit marry then you shall have more drawn to his lodging than come to the launching of some three ships especially if he be furnishd with supplies for the retiring of his old wardrobe from pawn if not he does hire a stock of apparel and some forty or fifty pound in gold for that forenoon to shew he is thought a very necessary perfume for the presence and for that only cause welcome thither six milliners shops afford you not the like scent he courts ladies with how many great horse he hath rid that morning or how oft he hath done the whole or half the pommado in a sevennight before and sometime ventures so far upon the virtue of his pomander that he dares tell em how many shirts he has sweat at tennis that week but wisely conceals so many dozen of balls he is on the score

farther fet too by the white valley that lies between the alpine hills of your bosom i protest ana well you travelld for that hedon mer ay in a map where his eyes were but blind guides to his understanding it seems hed and then i have a salutation will nick all by this caper hay ana how is that hed you know i call madam philautia my honour and she calls me her ambition now when i meet her in the presence anon i will come to her and say sweet honour i have hitherto contented my sense with the lilies of your hand but now i will taste the roses of your lip and withal kiss her to which she

brought them acquainted with the room where they shall act lest the strangeness of it put them out of countenance when they should come forth exeunt hedon and anaides cup is that a courtier too mer troth no he has two essential parts of the courtier pride and ignorance marry the rest come somewhat after the ordinary gallant tis impudence itself anaides one that speaks all that comes in his cheeks and will blush no more than a sackbut he lightly occupies the jesters room at the table and keeps laughter gelaia a wench in pages attire following him in place of a squire whom he now and then tickles with some strange ridiculous stuff utterd as his land came to him by chance he will censure or discourse of any thing but as absurdly as you would wish his fashion is not to take knowledge of him that is beneath him in clothes he never drinks below the salt he does naturally admire his wit that wears gold lace or tissue stabs any man that speaks more contemptibly of the scholar than he he is a great proficient in all the illiberal sciences as cheating drinking swaggering whoring and such like never kneels but to pledge healths nor prays but for a pipe of puddingtobacco he will blaspheme in his shirt the oaths which he vomits at one supper would maintain a town of garrison in good swearing a twelvemonth one other genuine quality he has which crowns all these and that is this to a friend in want he will not depart with the weight of a soldered groat lest the world might censure him prodigal or report him a gull marry to his cockatrice or punquetto half a dozen taffata gowns or satin kirtles in a pair or two of months why they are nothing cup i commend him he is one of my clients they retire to the back of the stage enter amorphus asotus and cos amo come sir you are now within regard of the presence and see the privacy of this room how sweetly it offers itself to our retired intendments page cast a vigilant and enquiring eye about that we be not rudely surprised by the approach of some ruder stranger cos i warrant you sir ill tell you when the wolf enters fear nothing mer o what a mass of benefit shall we possess in being the invisible spectators of this strange show now to be acted amo plant yourself there sir and observe me you shall now as well be the ocular as the earwitness how clearly i can refel that paradox or rather pseudodox of those which hold the face to be the index of the mind which i assure you is not so in any politic creature for instance i will now give you the particular and distinct face of every your most noted species of persons as your merchant your scholar your soldier your lawyer courtier etc and each of these so truly as you would swear but that your eye shall see the variation of the lineament it were my most proper and genuine aspect first for your merchant or cityface tis thus a dull ploddingface still looking in a direct line forward there is no great matter in this face then have you your students or academic face which is here an honest simple and methodical face but somewhat more spread then the former the third is your soldiers face a menacing and astounding face that looks broad and big the grace of his face consisteth much in a beard the antiface to this is your lawyers face a contracted subtile and intricate face full of quirks and turnings a labyrinthean face now angularly now circularly every way aspected next is your statists face a serious solemn and supercilious face full of formal and square gravity the eye for the most part deeply and artificially shadowd there is great judgment required in the making of this face but now to come to your face of faces or courtiers face tis of three sorts according to our subdivision of a courtier elementary practic and theoric your courtier theoric is he that hath arrived to his farthest and doth now know the court rather by speculation than practice and this is his face a fastidious and oblique face that looks as it went with a vice and were screwd thus your courtier practic is he that is yet in his path his course his way and hath not touchd the punctilio or point of his hopes his face is here a most promising open smooth and overflowing face that seems as it would run and pour itself into you somewhat a northerly face your courtier elementary is one but newly enterd or as it were in the alphabet or utremifasolla of courtship note well this face for it is this you must practise aso ill practise them all if you please sir amo ay hereafter you may and it will not be altogether an ungrateful study for let your soul be assured of this in any rank or profession whatever the more general or major part of opinion goes with the face and simply respects nothing else therefore if that can be made exactly curiously exquisitely thoroughly it is enough but for the present you shall only apply yourself to this face of the elementary courtier a light revelling and protesting face now blushing now smiling which you may help much with a wanton wagging of your head thus a feather will teach you or with kissing your finger that hath the ruby or playing with some string of your band which is a most quaint kind of melancholy besides or if among ladies laughing loud and crying up your own wit though perhaps borrowd it is not amiss where is your page call for your castingbottle and place your mirror in your hat as i told you so come look not pale observe me set your face and enter mer o for some excellent painter to have taken the copy of all these faces aside aso prosaites amo fie i premonish you of that in the court boy lacquey or sirrah cos master lupus in o tis prosaites enter prosaites aso sirrah prepare my castingbottle i think i must be enforced to purchase me another page you see how at hand cos waits here exeunt amorphus asotus cos and prosaites mer so will he too in time cup whats he mercury mer a notable smelt one that hath newly entertaind the beggar to follow him but cannot get him to wait near enough tis asotus the heir of philargyrus but first ill give ye the others character which may make his the clearer he that is with him is amorphus a traveller one so made out of the mixture of shreds of forms that himself is truly deformd he walks most commonly with a clove or picktooth in his mouth he is the very mint of compliment all his behaviours are printed his face is another volume of essays and his beard is an aristarchus he speaks all cream skimmd and more affected than a dozen waiting women he is his own promoter in every place the wife of the ordinary gives him his diet to maintain her table in discourse which indeed is a mere tyranny over her other guests for he will usurp all the talk ten constables are not so tedious he is no great shifter once a year his apparel is ready to revolt he doth use much to arbitrate quarrels and fights himself exceeding well out at a window he will lie cheaper than any beggar and louder than most clocks for which he is right properly accommodated to the whetstone his page the other gallant is his zany and doth most of these tricks after him sweats to imitate him in every thing to a hair except a beard which is not yet extant he doth learn to make strange sauces to eat anchovies maccaroni bovoli fagioli and caviare because he loves them speaks as he speaks looks walks goes so in clothes and fashion is in all as if he were moulded of him marry before they met he had other very pretty sufficiencies which yet he retains some light impression of as frequenting a dancing school and grievously torturing strangers with inquisition after his grace in his galliard he buys a fresh acquaintance at any rate his eyes and his raiment confer much together as he goes in the street he treads nicely like the fellow that walks upon ropes especially the first sunday of his silk stockings and when he is most neat and new you shall strip him with commendations cup here comes another crites passes over the stage mer ay but one of another strain cupid this fellow weighs somewhat cup his name hermes mer crites a creature of a most perfect and divine temper one in whom the humours and elements are peaceably met without emulation of precedency he is neither too fantastically melancholy too slowly phlegmatic too lightly sanguine or too rashly choleric but in all so composed and ordered as it is clear nature went about some full work she did more than make a man when she made him his discourse is like his behaviour uncommon but not unpleasing he is prodigal of neither he strives rather to be that which men call judicious than to be thought so and is so truly learned that he affects not to shew it he will think and speak his thought both freely but as distant from depraving another mans merit as proclaiming his own for his valour tis such that he dares as little to offer any injury as receive one in sum he hath a most ingenuous and sweet spirit a sharp and seasond wit a straight judgment and a strong mind fortune could never break him nor make him less he counts it his pleasure to despise pleasures and is more delighted with good deeds than goods it is a competency to him that he can be virtuous he doth neither covet nor fear he hath too much reason to do either and that commends all things to him cup not better than mercury commends him mer o cupid tis beyond my deity to give him his due praises i could leave my place in heaven to live among mortals so i were sure to be no other than he cup slight i believe he is your minion you seem to be so ravishd with him mer hes one i would not have a wry thought darted against willingly cup no but a straight shaft in his bosom ill promise him if i am cythereas son mer shall we go cupid cup stay and see the ladies now theyll come presently ill help to paint them mer what lay colour upon colour that affords but an ill blazon cup here comes metal to help it the lady argurion argurion passes over the stage mer money money cup the same a nymph of a most wandering and giddy disposition humorous as the air shell run from gallant to gallant as they sit at primero in the presence most strangely and seldom stays with any she spreads as she goes today you shall have her look as clear and fresh as the morning and tomorrow as melancholic as midnight she takes special pleasure in a close obscure lodging and for that cause visits the city so often where she has many secret true concealing favourites when she comes abroad shes more loose and scattering than dust and will fly from place to place as she were wrapped with a whirlwind your young student for the most part she affects not only salutes him and away a poet nor a philosopher she is hardly brought to take any notice of no though he be some part of an alchemist she loves a player well and a lawyer infinitely but your fool above all she can do much in court for the obtaining of any suit whatsoever no door but flies open to her her presence is above a charm the worst in her is want of keeping state and too much descending into inferior and base offices shes for any coarse employment you will put upon her as to be your procurer or pander mer peace

of her wit she will think herself wise against all the judgments that come a lady made all of voice and air talks any thing of any thing she is like one of your ignorant poetasters of the time who when they have got acquainted with a strange word never rest till they have wrung it in though it loosen the whole fabric of their sense mer that was pretty and sharply noted cupid cup she will tell you philosophy was a fine reveller when she was young and a gallant and that then though she say it she was thought to be the dame dido and helen of the court as also what a sweet dog she had this time four years and how it was called fortune and that if the fates had not cut his thread he had been a dog to have given entertainment to any gallant in this kingdom and unless she had whelpd it herself she could not have loved a thing better in this world mer o i prithee no more i am full of her cup yes i must needs tell you she composes a sackposset well and would court a young page sweetly but that her breath is against it mer now her breath or something more strong protect me from her the other the other cupid cup o thats my lady and mistress madam philautia she admires not herself for any one particularity but for all she is fair and she knows it she has a pretty light wit too and she knows it she can dance and she knows that too play at shuttlecock and that too no quality she has but she shall take a very particular knowledge of and most ladylike commend it to you you shall have her at any time read you the history of herself and very subtilely run over another ladys sufficiencies to come to her own she has a good superficial judgment in painting and would seem to have so in poetry a most complete lady in the opinion of some three beside herself phi faith how

languishing upon the rushes like so many pounded cattle in the midst of harvest sighing one to another and gasping as if each of them expected a cock from the fountain to be brought into his mouth and without we return quickly they are all as a youth would say no better then a few trouts cast ashore or a dish of eels in a sandbag mer well then you were best dispatch and have a care of them come

under the first disaster it is with your young grammatical courtier as with your neophyte player a thing usual to be daunted at the first presence or interview you saw there was hedon and anaides far more practised gallants than yourself who were both out to comfort you it is no disgrace no more than for your adventurous reveller to fall by some inauspicious chance in his galliard or for some subtile politic to undertake the bastinado that the state might think worthily of him and respect him as a man well beaten to the world what hath your tailor provided the property we spake of at your chamber or no aso i think he has amo nay i entreat you be not so flat and melancholic erect your mind you shall redeem this with the courtship i will teach you against the afternoon where eat you

courtly grace aso a poison of all i think i was forespoke i amo no i must tell you you are not audacious enough you must frequent ordinaries a month more to initiate yourself in which time it will not

your own aso yes and ill give out my acquaintance with all the best writers to countenance me the more amo rather seem not to know them it is your best ay be wise that you never so much as mention the name of one nor remember it mentioned but if they be offerd to you in discourse shake your light head make between a sad and a smiling face pity some rail at all and commend yourself tis your only safe and unsuspected course come you shall look back upon the court again today and be restored to your colours i do now partly aim at the cause of your repulse which was ominous indeed for as you enter at the door there is opposed to you the frame of a wolf in the hangings which surprising your eye suddenly gave a false alarm to the heart and that was it called your blood out of your face and so routed the whole rank of your spirits i beseech you labour to forget it and remember as i inculcated to you before for your comfort hedon and anaides exeunt scene ii another apartment in the same enter hedon and anaides hedon heart was there ever so prosperous an invention thus unluckily perverted and spoiled by a whoreson bookworm a candlewaster ana nay be not impatient hedon hed slight i would fain know his name ana hang him poor grogan rascal prithee think not of him ill send for him to my lodging and have him blanketed when thou wilt man hed ods so i would thou couldst look here he comes enter crites and walks in a musing posture at the back of the stage laugh at him laugh at him ha ha ha ana fough he smells all lampoil with studying by candlelight hed how confidently he went by us and carelessly never moved nor stirred at any thing did you observe him ana ay a pox on him let him go dormouse he is in a dream now he has no other time to sleep but thus when he walks abroad to take the air hed sprecious this afflicts me more than all the rest that we should so particularly direct our hate and contempt against him and he to carry it thus without wound or passion tis insufferable ana slid my dear envy if thou but sayst the word now ill undo him eternally for thee hed how sweet anaides ana marry half a score of us get him in one night and make him pawn his wit for a supper hed away thou hast such unseasonable jests by this heaven i wonder at nothing more than our gentlemen ushers that will suffer a piece of serge or perpetuana to come into the presence methinks they should out of their experience better distinguish the silken disposition of courtiers than to let such terrible coarse rags mix with us able to fret any smooth or gentle society to the threads with their rubbing devices ana unless twere lent emberweeks or fasting days when the place is most penuriously empty of all other good outsides d n me if i should adventure on his company once more without a suit of buff to defend my wit he does nothing but stab the slave how mischievously he crossd thy device of the prophecy there and moria she comes without her muff too and there my invention was lost hed well i am resolved what ill do ana what my good spiritous spark hed marry speak all the venom i can of him and poison his reputation in every place where i come ana fore god most courtly hed and if i chance to be present where any question is made of his sufficiencies or of any thing he hath done private or public ill censure it slightly and ridiculously ana at any hand beware of that so thou mayst draw thine own judgment in suspect no ill instruct thee what thou shalt do and by a safer means approve any thing thou hearest of his to the received opinion of it but if it be extraordinary give it from him to some other whom thou more particularly affectst thats the way to plague him and he shall never come to defend himself slud ill give out all he does is dictated from other men and swear it too if thoult have me and that i know the time and place where he stole it though my soul be guilty of no such thing and that i think out of my heart he hates such barren shifts yet to do thee a pleasure and him a disgrace ill damn myself or do any thing hed gramercy my dear devil well put it seriously in practice ifaith exeunt hedon and anaides cri coming forward do good detraction do and i the while shall shake thy spight off with a careless smile poor piteous gallants what lean idle slights their thoughts suggest to flatter their starvd hopes as if i knew not how to entertain these strawdevices but of force must yield to the weak stroke of their calumnious tongues what should i care what every dor doth buz in credulous ears it is a crown to me that the best judgments can report me wrongd them liars and their slanders impudent perhaps upon the rumour of their speeches some grieved friend will whisper to me crites men speak ill of thee so they be ill men if they spake worse twere better for of such to be dispraised is the most perfect praise what can his censure hurt me whom the world hath censured vile before me if good chrestus euthus or phronimus had spoke the words they would have moved me and i should have calld my thoughts and actions to a strict account upon the hearing but when i remember tis hedon and anaides alas then i think but what they are and am not stirrd the one a light voluptuous reveller the other a strange arrogating puff both impudent and ignorant enough that talk as they are wont not as i merit traduce by custom as most dogs do bark do nothing out of judgment but disease speak ill because they never could speak well and whod be angry with this race of creatures what wise physician have we ever seen moved with a frantic man the same affects that he doth bear to his sick patient should a right mind carry to such as these and i do count it a most rare revenge that i can thus with such a sweet neglect pluck from them all the pleasure of their malice for thats the mark of all their enginous drifts to wound my patience howsoer they seem to aim at other objects which if missd their envys like an arrow shot upright that in the fall endangers their own heads enter arete are what crites where have you drawn forth the day you have not visited your jealous friends cri where i have seen most honourd arete the strangest pageant fashiond like a court at least i dreamt i saw it so diffused so painted pied and full of rainbow strains as never yet either by time or place was made the food to my distasted sense nor can my weak imperfect memory now render half the forms unto my tongue that were convolved within this thrifty room here stalks me by a proud and spangled sir that looks three handfuls higher then his foretop savours himself alone is only kind and loving to himself one that will speak more dark and doubtful than six oracles salutes a friend as if he had a stitch is his own chronicle and scarce can eat for registring himself is waited on by mimics jesters panders parasites and other such like prodigies of men he past appears some mincing marmoset made all of clothes and face his limbs so set as if they had some voluntary act without mans motion and must move just so in spight of their creation one that weighs his breath between his teeth and dares not smile beyond a point for fear tunstarch his look hath travelld to make legs and seen the cringe of several courts and courtiers knows the time of giving titles and of taking walls hath read court commonplaces made them his studied the grammar of state and all the rules each formal usher in that politic school can teach a man a third comes giving nods to his repenting creditors protests to weeping suitors takes the coming gold of insolent and base ambition that hourly rubs his dry and itchy palms which griped like burning coals he hurls away into the laps of bawds and buffoons mouths with him there meets some subtle proteus one can change and vary with all forms he sees be any thing but honest serves the time hovers betwixt two factions and explores the drifts of both which with cross face he bears to the divided heads and is received with mutual grace of either one that dares do deeds worthy the hurdle or the wheel to be thought somebody and is in sooth such as the satirist points truly forth that only to his crimes owes all his worth are you tell us wonders crites cri this is nothing there stands a neophite glazing of his face pruning his clothes perfuming of his hair against his idol enters and repeats like an unperfect prologue at third music his part of speeches and confederate jests in passion to himself another swears his scene of courtship over bids believe him twenty times ere they will anon doth seem as he would kiss away his hand in kindness then walks off melancholic and stands wreathd as he were pinnd up to the arras thus a third is most in action swims and frisks plays with his mistresss paps salutes her pumps adores her hems her skirts her knots her curls will spend his patrimony for a garter or the least feather in her bounteous fan a fourth he only comes in for a mute divides the act with a dumb show and exit then must the ladies laugh straight comes their scene a sixth times worse confusion then the rest where you shall hear one talk of this mans eye another of his lip a third his nose a fourth commend his leg a fifth his foot a sixth his hand and every one a limb that you would think the poor distorted gallant must there expire then fall they in discourse of tires and fashions how they must take place where they may kiss and whom when to sit down and with what grace to rise if they salute what courtsy they must use such cobweb stuff as would enforce

swaggering coachhorse anaides draws with him there has been the diverter of him phi for cupids sake speak no more of him would i might never dare to look in a mirror again if i respect ever a marmoset

amongst them i say the traveller amorphus phi o fie on him he looks like a venetian trumpeter in the battle of lepanto in the gallery yonder and speaks to the tune of a country lady that comes ever in

who might that be guardian mor marry fair charge anaides pha anaides you talkd of a tune philautia theres one speaks in a key like the opening of some justices gate or a postboys horn as if his voice feared an arrest for some ill words it should give and were loth to come forth phi ay and he has a very imperfect face pha like a seamonster that were to ravish andromeda from the rock phi his hands too great too by at least a straws breadth pha nay he has a worse fault than that too phi a long heel pha that were a fault in a lady rather than him no they say he puts off the calves of his legs with his stockings every night phi out upon him turn to another of the pictures for loves sake what says argurion whom does she commend afore the rest cup i hope i have instructed her sufficiently for

plain gentleman in the black there pha who crites arg ay ay he a fellow that nobody so much as lookd upon or regarded and she would have had me done him particular grace pha that was a true trick of yourself moria to persuade argurion to affect the scholar arg tut but she shall be no chooser for me in good faith i like the citizens son there asotus methinks none of them all come near him pha not hedon arg hedon in troth no hedons a pretty slight courtier and he wears his clothes well and sometimes in fashion marry his face is but indifferent and he has no such excellent body no the other is a most delicate youth a sweet face a straight body a wellproportiond leg and foot a white hand a tender voice phi how now argurion pha o you should have let her alone she was bestowing a copy of him upon us such a nose were enough to make me love a man now phi and then his several colours he wears wherein he flourisheth changeably every day pha o but his short hair and his narrow eyes phi why she doats more palpably upon him than ever his father did upon her pha believe me the young gentleman deserves it if she could doat more twere not amiss he is an exceeding proper youth and would have made a most neat barber surgeon if he had been put to it in time phi say you so methinks he looks like a tailor already pha ay that had sayed on one of his customers suits his face is like a squeezed orange or arg well ladies jest on the best of you both would be glad of such a servant mor ay ill be sworn would they though he be a little shamefaced pha shamefaced moria out upon him your shamefaced servant is your only gull mor go to beauties make much of time and place and occasion and opportunity and favourites and things that belong to them for ill ensure you they will all relinquish they cannot endure above another year i know it out of future experience and therefore take exhibition and warning i was once a reveller myself and though i speak it as mine own trumpet i was then esteemd phi the very marchpane of the court i warrant you pha and all the gallants came about you like flies did they not mor go to they did somewhat thats no matter now pha nay good moria be not angry put case that we four now had the grant from juno to wish ourselves into what happy estate we could what would you wish to be moria mor who i let me see now i would wish to be a wise woman and know all the secrets of court city and country i would know what were done behind the arras what upon the stairs what in the garden what in the nymphs chamber what by barge and what by coach i would tell you which courtier were scabbed and which not which lady had her own face to lie with her anights and which not who put off their teeth with their clothes in court who their hair who their complexion and in which box they put it there should not a nymph or a widow be got with child in the verge but i would guess within one or two who was the right father and in what month it was gotten with what words and which way i would tell you which madam loved a monsieur which a player which a page who slept with her husband who with her friend who with her gentlemanusher who with her horsekeeper who with her monkey and who with all yes and who jiggd the cock too pha fie youd tell all moria if i should wish now it should be to have your tongue out but what says philautia who should she be phi troth the very same i am only i would wish myself a little more command and sovereignty that all the court were subject to my absolute beck and all things in it depending on my look as if there were no other heaven but in my smile nor other hell but in my frown that i might send for any man i list and have his head cut off when i have done with him or made an eunuch if he denied me and if i saw a better face than mine own i might have my doctor to poison it what would you wish phantaste pha faith i cannot readily tell you what but methinks i should wish myself all manner of creatures now i would be an empress and by and by a duchess then a great lady of state then one of your miscellany madams then a waitingwoman then your citizens wife then a coarse country gentlewoman then a dairymaid then a shepherds lass then an empress again or the queen of fairies and thus i would prove the vicissitudes and whirl of pleasures about and again as i were a shepherdess i would be piped and sung to as a dairywench i would dance at maypoles and make syllabubs as a country gentlewoman keep a good house and come up to term to see motions as a citizens wife to be troubled with a jealous husband and put to my shifts others miseries should be my pleasures as a waitingwoman i would taste my ladys delights to her as a miscellany madam invent new tires and go visit courtiers as a great lady lie abed and have courtiers visit me as a duchess i would keep my state and as an empress i would do any thing and in all these shapes i would ever be followd with the affections of all that see me marry i myself would affect none or if i did it should not be heartily but so as i might save myself in them still and take pride in tormenting the poor wretches or now i think ont i would for one year wish myself one woman but the richest fairest and delicatest in a kingdom the very centre of wealth and beauty wherein all lines of love should meet and in that person i would prove all manner of suitors of all humours and of all complexions and never have any two of a sort i would see how love by the power of his object could work inwardly alike in a choleric man and a sanguine in a melancholic and a phlegmatic in a fool and a wise man in a clown and a courtier in a valiant man and a coward and how he could vary outward by letting this gallant express himself in dumb gaze another with sighing and rubbing his fingers a third with playends and pitiful verses a fourth with stabbing himself and drinking healths or writing languishing letters in his blood a fifth in colourd ribands and good clothes with this lord to smile and that lord to court and the tother lord to dote and one lord to hang himself and then i to have a book made of all this which i would call the book of humours and every night read a little piece ere i slept and laugh at it here comes hedon enter hedon anaides and mercury who retires with cupid to the back of the stage where they converse together hed save you sweet and clear beauties by the spirit that moves in me you are all most pleasingly bestowd ladies only i can take it for no good omen to find mine honour so dejected phi you need not fear sir i did of purpose humble myself against your coming to decline the pride of my ambition hed fair honour ambition dares not stoop but if it be your sweet pleasure i shall lose that title i will as i am hedon

me but only heard the common report of my virtue learning and travel fell into that extremity of passion for my love that she there immediately swooned physicians were sent for she had to her chamber

coaches coverd all with blackvelvet attended by the state of his empire all which he freely presented me with and i reciprocally out of the same bounty gave to the lords that brought it only reserving the gift of the deceased lady upon which i composed this ode and set it to my most affected instrument the lyra thou more then most sweet glove unto my more sweet love suffer me to store with kisses

term of satisfaction to his godly will though i profess without the affectation of an enforced and formd austerity i could be willing to enjoy no place with so unequal natures mer we believe it but for our sake and to inflict just pains on their prodigious follies aid us now no man is presently made bad with ill and good men like the sea should still maintain their noble taste in midst of all fresh humours that flow about them to corrupt their streams bearing no season much less salt of goodness it is our purpose crites to correct and punish with our laughter this nights sport which our courtdors so heartily intend and by that worthy scorn to make them know how far beneath the dignity of man their serious and most practised actions are cri ay but though mercury can warrant out his undertakings and make all things good out of the powers of his divinity th offence will be returnd with weight on me that am a creature so despised and poor when the whole court shall take itself abused by our ironical confederacy mer you are deceived the better race in court that have the true nobility calld virtue will apprehend it as a grateful right done to their separate merit and approve the fit rebuke of so ridiculous heads who with their apish customs and forced garbs would bring the name of courtier in contempt did it not live unblemishd in some few whom equal jove hath loved and

it is the part of every obsequious servant to be sure to have daily about him copy and variety of colours to be presently answerable to any hourly or halfhourly change in his mistresss revolution aso i know it sir amo give leave i pray you which if your antagonist or player against you shall ignorantly be without and yourself can produce you give him the dor aso ay ay sir amo or if you can possess your opposite that the green your mistress wears is her rejoicing or exultation in his service the yellow suspicion of his truth from her height of affection and that he greenly credulous shall withdraw thus in private and from the abundance of his pocket to displace her jealous conceit steal into his hat the colour whose blueness doth express trueness she being not so nor so affected you give him the dor aso do not i know it sir amo nay good swell not above your understanding there is yet a third dor in colours aso i know it too i know it amo do you know it too what is it make good your knowledge aso why it is no matter for that amo do it on pain of the dor aso why what ist say you amo lo you have given yourself the dor but i will remonstrate to you the third dor which is not as

harm so are none without it her place in the court of perfection was to quicken minds in the pursuit of honour her device is a perpendicular level upon a cube or square the word se suo modulo alluding to that true measure of ones self which as every one ought to make so is it most conspicuous in thy divine example the second in green is aglaia delectable and pleasant conversation whose property it is to move a kindly delight and sometime not without laughter her office to entertain assemblies and keep societies together with fair familiarity her device within a ring of clouds a heart with shine about it the word curarum nubila pello an allegory of cynthias light which no less clears the sky then her fair mirth the heart the third in the discoloured mantle spangled all over is euphantaste a

there are four cardinal virtues upon which the whole frame of the court doth move so are these the four cardinal properties without which the body of compliment moveth not with these four silver javelins which they bear in their hands they support in princes courts the state of the presence as by office they are obliged which though here they may seem superfluous yet for honours sake they thus presume to visit thee having also been employed in the palace of queen perfection and though to them that would make themselves gracious to a goddess sacrifices were fitter than presents or impresses yet they both hope thy favour and in place of either use several symbols containing the titles of thy imperial dignity first the hithermost in the changeable blue and green robe is the commendablyfashioned gallant eucosmos whose courtly habit is the grace of the presence and delight of the surveying eye whom ladies understand by the names of neat and elegant his symbol is divae virgini in which he would express thy deitys principal glory which hath ever been virginity the second in the rich accoutrement and robe of purple empaled with gold is eupathes who entertains his mind with an harmless but not incurious variety all the objects of his senses are sumptuous himself a gallant that without excess can make use of superfluity go richly in embroideries jewels and what not without vanity and fare delicately without gluttony and therefore not without cause is universally thought to be of fine humour his symbol is divae optimae an attribute to express thy goodness in which thou so resemblest jove thy father the third in the blushcoloured suit is eutolmos as duly respecting others as never neglecting himself commonly known by the title of good audacity to courts and courtly assemblies a guest most acceptable his symbol is divae viragini to express thy hardy courage in chase of savage beasts which harbour in woods and wildernesses the fourth in watchet tinsel is the kind and truly benefique eucolos who imparteth not without respect but yet without difficulty and hath the happiness to make every kindness seem double by the timely and freely bestowing thereof he is the chief of them who by the vulgar are said to be of good nature his symbol is divae maximae an adjunct to signify thy greatness which in heaven earth and hell is formidable music a

cannot tell perhaps the physic will not work so soon upon some as upon others it may be the rest are not so resty mer ex ungue you know the old adage as these so are the remainder cup ill try this is the same shaft with which i wounded argurion waves his arrow again mer ay but let me save you a labour cupid there were certain bottles of water fetchd and drunk off since that time by these gallants

not now in adonis garden but in cynthias presence where thorns lie in garrison about the roses soft cynthia speaks cyn ladies and gallants of our court to end and give a timely period to our sports let us conclude them with declining night our empire is but of the darker half and if you judge it any recompence for your faire pains t have earnd dianas thanks diana grants them and bestows their crown to gratify your acceptable zeal for you are they that not as some have done do censure us as too severe and sour but as more rightly gracious to the good although we not deny unto the proud or the profane perhaps indeed austere for so actaeon by presuming far did to our grief incur a fatal doom and so swoln niobe comparing more than he presumed was trophaeed into stone but are we therefore judged too extreme seems it no crime to enter sacred bowers and hallowed places with impure aspect most lewdly to pollute seems it no crime to brave a deity let mortals learn to make religion of offending heaven and not at all to censure powers divine to men this argument should stand for firm a goddess did it therefore it was good we are not cruel nor delight in blood but what have serious repetitions to do with revels and the sports of court we not intend to sour your late delights with harsh expostulation let it suffice that we take notice and can take revenge of these calumnious and lewd blasphemies for we are no less cynthia than we were nor is our power but as ourself the same though we have now put on no tire of shine but mortal eyes undazzled may endure years are beneath the spheres and time makes weak things under heaven not powers which govern heaven and though ourself be in ourself secure yet let not mortals challenge to themselves immunity from thence lo this is all honour hath store of spleen but wanteth gall once more we cast the slumber of our thanks on your taen toil which here let take an end and that we not mistake your several worths nor you our favour from yourselves remove what makes you not yourselves those clouds of masque particular pains particular thanks do ask the dancers unmask how let me view you ha are we contemnd is there so little awe of our disdain that any under trust of their disguise should mix themselves with others of the court and without forehead boldly press so far as farther none how apt is lenity to be abused severity to be loathd and yet how much more doth the seeming face of neighbour virtues and their borrowd names add of lewd boldness to loose vanities who would have thought that philautia durst or have usurped noble storges name or with that theft have ventured on our eyes who would have thought that all of them should hope so much of our connivence as to come to grace themselves with titles not their own instead of medcines have we maladies and such imposthumes as phantaste is grow in our palace we must lance these sores or all will putrify nor are these all for we suspect a farther fraud than this take off our veil that shadows many depart and shapes appear beloved arete so another face of things presents itself than did of late what featherd cupid masqued and masked like anteros and stay more strange dear mercury our brother like a page to countenance the ambush of the boy nor endeth our discovery as yet gelaia like a nymph that but erewhile in male attire did serve anaides cupid came hither to find sport and game who heretofore hath been too conversant among our train but never felt revenge and mercury bare cupid company cupid we must confess this time of mirth proclaimd by us gave opportunity to thy attempts although no privilege tempt us no farther we cannot endure thy presence longer vanish hence away exit cupid you mercury we must entreat to stay and hear what we determine of the rest for in this plot we well perceive your hand but for we mean not a censorian task and yet to lance these ulcers grown so ripe dear arete and crites to you two we give the charge impose what pains you please th incurable cut off the rest reform remembering ever what we first decreed since revels were proclaimd let now none bleed are how well diana can distinguish times and sort her censures keeping to herself the doom of gods leaving the rest to us come cite them crites first and then proceed cri first philautia for she was the first then light gelaia in aglaias name

prosaites and thou the travellers evil cos approach impostors all and male deformities are nay forward for i delegate my power and will that at thy mercy they do stand whom they so oft so plainly scornd before tis virtue which they want and wanting it honour no garment to their backs can fit then crites practise thy discretion cri adored cynthia and bright arete another might seem fitter for this task than crites far but that you judge not so for i not to appear vindicative or mindful of contempts which i contemnd as done of impotence must be remiss who as i was the author in some sort to work their knowledge into cynthias sight so should be much severer to revenge the indignity hence issuing to her name but theres not one of these who are unpaind or by themselves unpunished for vice is like a fury to the vicious mind and turns delight itself to punishment but we must forward to define their doom you are offenders that must be confessd do you confess it all we do cri and that you merit sharp correction all yes cri then we reserving unto delias grace her farther pleasure and to arete what delia granteth thus do sentence you that from this place for penance known of all since you have drunk so deeply of selflove you two and two singing a palinode march to your several homes by niobes stone and offer up two tears apiece thereon that it may change the name as you must change
