paul the peddler chapter i paul the peddler heres your prize packages only five cents money prize in every package walk up gentlemen and try your luck the speaker a boy of fourteen stood in front of the shabby brick building on nassau street which has served for many years as the new york post office in front of him as he stood with his back to the building was a small basket filled with ordinary letter envelopes each labeled prize package his attractive announcement which at that time had also the merit of novelty for paul had himself hit upon the idea and manufactured the packages as we shall hereafter explain drew around him a miscellaneous crowd composed chiefly of boys whats in the packages johnny asked a bootblack with his box strapped to his back candy answered paul buy one only five cents there aint much candy answered the bootblack with a disparaging glance what if there isnt theres a prize how big a prize theres a tencent stamp in some of em all have got something in em influenced by this representation the bootblack drew out a fivecent piece and said pitch one over then i guess i can stand it an envelope was at once handed him open it johnny said a newsboy at his side twenty curious eyes were fixed upon him as he opened the package he drew out rather a scanty supply of candy and then turning to paul with a look of indignation said wheres the prize i dont see no prize give me back my five cents give it to me ill show you said the young merchant he thrust in his finger and drew out a square bit of paper on which was writtenone cent theres your prize he added drawing a penny from his pocket it aint much of a prize said the buyer wheres your ten cents i didnt say i put ten cents into every package answered paul id burst up pretty quick if i did that wholl have another package only five cents curiosity and taste for speculation are as prevalent among children as with men so this appeal produced its effect give me a package said teddy obrien a newsboy stretching out a dirty hand containing the stipulated sum he also was watched curiously as he opened the package he drew out a paper bearing the wordstwo cents bully for you teddy youve had better luck than i said the bootblack the check was duly honored and teddy seemed satisfied though the amount of candy he received probably could not have cost over halfacent still he had drawn twice as large a prize as the first buyer and that was satisfactory wholl take the next asked paul in a businesslike manner maybe theres ten cents in this package thats where you double your money walk up gentlemen only five cents three more responded to this invitation one drawing a prize of two cents the other two of one cent each just then as it seemed doubtful whether any more would be purchased by those present a young man employed in a wall street house came out of the post office what have you got here he asked pausing prize packages of candy money prize in every package only five cents give me one then i never drew a prize in my life the exchange was speedily made i dont see any prize he said opening it its on a bit of paper mister said teddy nearly as much interested as if it had been his own purchase oh yes i see well im in luck ten cents ten cents exclaimed several of the less fortunate buyers with a shade of envy heres your prize mister said paul drawing out a tencent stamp from his vest pocket well johnny you do things on the square thats a fact just keep the ten cents and give me two more packages this paul did with alacrity but the wall street clerks luck was at an end he got two prizes of a penny each well he said im not much out of pocket ive bought three packages and its only cost me three cents the tencent prize produced a favorable effect on the business of the young peddler five more packages were bought and the contents eagerly inspected but no other large prize appeared two cents was the maximum prize drawn their curiosity being satisfied the crowd dispersed but it was not long before another gathered in fact paul had shown excellent judgment in selecting the front of the post office as his place of business hundreds passed in and out every hour besides those who passed by on a different destination thus many ears caught the young peddlers cry prize packages only five cents apiece and made a purchase most from curiosity but some few attracted by the businesslike bearing of the young merchant and willing to encourage him in his efforts to make a living these last as well as some of the former class declined to accept the prizes so that these were so much gain to paul at length but one package remained and this paul was some time getting rid of at last a gentleman came up holding a little boy of seven by the hand oh buy me the package papa he said drawing his fathers attention what is there in it boy asked the gentleman candy was the answer alfred for this was the little boys name renewed his entreaties having like most boys a taste for candy there it is alfred said his father handing the package to his little son theres a prize inside said paul seeing that they were about to pass we must look for the prize by all means said the gentleman what is this one cent yes sir and paul held out a cent to his customer never mind about that you may keep the prize i want it pa interposed alfred with his mouth full of candy ill give you another said his father still declining to accept the proffered prize paul now found himself in the enviable position of one who at eleven oclock had succeeded in disposing of his entire stock in trade and that at an excellent profit as we soon shall see business had been more brisk with him than with many merchants on a larger scale who sometimes keep open their shops all day without taking in enough to pay expenses but then it is to be considered that in pauls case expenses were not a formidable item he had no rent to pay for one thing nor clerk hire being competent to attend to his entire business singlehanded all his expense in fact was the first cost of his stock in trade and he had so fixed his prices as to insure a good profit on that so on the whole paul felt very well satisfied at the result of his experiment for this was his first day in the prizepackage business i guess ill go home he said to himself motherll want to know how i made out he turned up nassau street and had reached the corner of maiden lane when teddy obrien met him did you sell out johnny he asked yes answered paul how many packages did you have fifty thats bully how much you made i cant tell yet i havent counted up said paul its bettern sellin papers ill bet ive only made thirty cents the day dont you want to take a partner johnny no i dont think i do said paul who had good reason to doubt whether such a step would be to his advantage then ill go in for myself said teddy somewhat displeased at the refusal go ahead theres nobody to stop you said paul id rather go in with you said teddy feeling that there would be some trouble in making the prize packages but influenced still more by the knowledge that he had not capital enough to start in the business alone no said paul positively i dont want any partner i can do well enough alone he was not surprised at teddys application street boys are as enterprising and have as sharp eyes for business as their elders and no one among them can monopolize a profitable business long this is especially the case with the young street merchant when one has had the good luck to find some attractive article which promises to sell briskly he takes every care to hide the source of his supply from his rivals in trade but this is almost impossible cases are frequent where such boys are subjected to the closest espionage their steps being dogged for hours by boys who think they have found a good thing and are determined to share it in the present case paul had hit upon an idea which seemed to promise well and he was determined to keep it to himself as long as possible as soon as he was subjected to competition and rivalry his gains would probably diminish chapter ii paul at home paul went up centre street and turned into pearl stopping before a tenementhouse he entered and going up two flights of stairs opened a door and entered you are home early paul said a woman of middle age looking up at his entrance yes mother ive sold out youve not sold out the whole fifty packages she asked in surprise yes i have i had capital luck why you must have made as much as a dollar and its not twelve yet ive made more than that mother just wait a minute till ive reckoned up a little wheres jimmy miss beckwith offered to take him out to walk with her so i let him go hell be back at twelve while paul is making a calculation a few words of explanation and description may be given so that the reader may understand better how he is situated the rooms occupied by paul and his mother were three in number the largest one was about fourteen feet square and was lighted by two windows it was covered with a neat though wellworn carpet a few canebottomed chairs were ranged at the windows and on each side of the table there was a french clock on the mantel a rocking chair for his mother and a few inexpensive engravings hung upon the walls there was a hanging bookcase containing two shelves filled with books partly school books supplemented by a few miscellaneous books such as robinson crusoe pilgrims progress a volume of poetical selections an odd volume of scott and several others out of the main room opened two narrow chambers both together of about the same area as the main room one of these was occupied by paul and jimmy the other by his mother those who are familiar with the construction of a new york tenementhouse will readily understand the appearance of the rooms into which we have introduced them it must however be explained that few similar apartments are found so well furnished carpets are not very common in tenementhouses and if there are any pictures they are usually the cheapest prints wooden chairs and generally every object of the cheapest are to be met with in the dwellings of the new york poor if we find something better in the present instance it is not because paul and his mother are any better off than their neighbors on the contrary there are few whose income is so small but they have seen better days and the furniture we see has been saved from the time of their comparative prosperity as paul is still at his estimate let us improve the opportunity by giving a little of their early history mr hoffman the father of paul was born in germany but came to new york when a boy of twelve and there he grew up and married his wife being an american he was a cabinetmaker and being a skillful workman earned very good wages so that he was able to maintain his family in comfort they occupied a neat little cottage in harlem and lived very happily for mr hoffman was temperate and kind when an unfortunate accident clouded their happiness and brought an end to their prosperity in crossing broadway at its most crowded part the husband and father was run over by a loaded dray and so seriously injured that he lived but a few hours then the precarious nature of their prosperity was found out mr hoffman had not saved anything having always lived up to the extent of his income it was obviously impossible for them to continue to live in their old home paying a rent of twenty dollars per month besides paul did not see any good opportunity to earn his living in harlem so at his instigation his mother moved downtown and took rooms in a tenementhouse in pearl street agreeing to pay six dollars a month for apartments which would now command double the price they brought with them furniture enough to furnish the three rooms selling the rest for what it would bring and thus obtaining a small reserve fund which by this time was nearly exhausted once fairly established in their new home paul went out into the streets to earn his living the two most obvious and on the whole most profitable trades were blacking boots and selling newspapers to the first paul who was a neat boy objected on the score that it would keep his hands and clothing dirty and street boy though he had become he had a pride in his personal appearance to selling papers he had not the same objection but he had a natural taste for trade and this led him to join the ranks of the street peddlers he began with vending matches but found so much competition in the business and received so rough a reception oftentimes from those who had repeated calls from others in the same business that he gave it up and tried something else but the same competition which crowds the professions and the higher employments followed by men prevails among the street trades which are pursued by boys if paul had only had himself to support he could have made a fair living at match selling or any other of the employments he took up but his mother could not earn much at making vests and jimmy was lame and could do nothing to fill the common purse so that paul felt that his earnings must be the main support of the family and naturally sought out what would bring him in most money at length he had hit upon selling prize packages and his first experience in that line are recorded in the previous chapter adding only that it was now a year since his fathers death we resume our narrative do you want to know how much ive made mother asked paul looking up at length from his calculation yes paul a dollar and thirty cents i did not think it would amount to so much the prizes came to considerable didnt they listen and i will tell you how i stand one pound of candy two packs of envelopes prize that makes i sold the fifty packages at five cents each and that brought me in two dollars and a half taking out the expenses it leaves me a dollar and thirty cents isnt that doing well for one mornings work its excellent but i thought your prizes amounted to more than ninety cents so they did but several persons who bought wouldnt take their prizes and that was so much gain you have done very well paul i wish you might earn as much every day im going to earn some more this afternoon i bought a pound of candy on the way home and some cheap envelopes and ill be making up a new stock while i am waiting for dinner paul took out his candy and envelopes and set about making up the packages did any complain of the small amount of candy you put in a few but most bought for the sake of the prizes perhaps you had better be a little more liberal with your candy and then there may not be so much dissatisfaction where the prize is only a penny i dont know but your are right mother i believe ill only make thirty packages with this pound instead of fifty thirtyll be all i can sell this afternoon just then the door opened and pauls brother entered jimmy hoffman or lame jimmy as he was often called was a delicatelooking boy of ten with a fair complexion and sweet face but incurably lame a defect which added to his delicate constitution was likely to interfere seriously with his success in life but as frequently happens jimmy was all the more endeared to his mother and brother by his misfortune and bodily weakness and if either were obliged to suffer from poverty jimmy would be spared the suffering well jimmy have you had a pleasant walk asked his mother yes mother i went down to fulton market theres a good deal to see there a good deal more than in this dull room jimmy it doesnt seem dull to me mother while you are here how did you make out selling your prize packages they are all sold jimmy every one i am making some more shant i help you yes i would like to have you just take those envelopes and write prize packages on every one of them all right paul and jimmy glad to be of use got the pen and ink and gathering up the envelopes began to inscribe them as he had been instructed by the time the packages were made up dinner was ready it was not a very luxurious repast there was a small piece of rump steak not more than threequarters of a pound a few potatoes a loaf of bread and a small plate of butter that was all but then the cloth that covered the table was neat and clean and the knives and forks were as bright as new and what there was tasted good what have you been doing this morning jimmy asked paul i have been drawing paul heres a picture of friday i copied it from robinson crusoe he showed the picture which was wonderfully like that in the book for this the gift of drawing was jimmys one talent and he possessed it in no common degree excellent jimmy said paul youre a real genius i shouldnt be surprised if youd make an artist some day i wish i might said jimmy earnestly theres nothing id like better ill tell you what jimmy if i do well this afternoon ill buy you a drawingbook and some paper to work on while mother and i are busy if you can afford it paul i should like it so much some time i might earn something that way of course you may said paul cheerfully i wont forget you dinner over paul went out to business and was again successful getting rid of his thirty packages and clearing another dollar half of this he invested in a drawingbook a pencil and some drawingpaper for jimmy even then he had left of his earnings for the day one dollar and eighty cents but this success in the new business had already excited envy and competition as he was destined to find out on the morrow chapter iii paul has competitors the next morning paul took his old place in front of the post office he set down his basket in front and taking one of the packages in his hand called out in a businesslike manner as on the day before heres your prize packages only five cents money prize in every package walk up gentlemen and try your luck he met with a fair degree of success at first managing in the course of an hour to sell ten packages all the prizes drawn were small with the exception of one tencent prize which was drawn by a little bootblack who exclaimed thats the way to do business johnny if youve got any more of them tencent prizes ill give you ten cents a piece for the lot better buy some more and see said paul that dont go down said the other maybe thered be only a penny nevertheless the effect of this large prize was to influence the sale of three other packages but as neither of these contained more than twocent prizes trade began to grow dull and for ten minutes all pauls eloquent appeals to gentlemen to walk up and try their luck produced no effect at this point paul found that there was a rival in the field teddy obrien who had applied for a partnership the day before came up with a basket similar to his own apparently filled with similar packages he took a position about six feet distant from paul and began to cry out in a shrill voice heres your bully prize packages best in the market heres where you get your big prizes fifty cents in some of em walk up boys tumble up and take your pick afore theyre gone fifty cents for five thats a lie teddy said paul who saw that his rivals attractive announcement was likely to spoil his trade no tisnt said teddy if you dont believe it just buy one and see ill tell you what ill do said paul ill exchange no said teddy i aint agoin to risk givin fifty cents for one more likely youd get ten for one youre a humbug have you really got any fiftycent prizes asked a newsboy who had sold out his morning stock of papers and was lounging about the post office steps best way is to buy johnny said teddy the boy did buy but his prize amounted to only one cent didnt i tell you so said paul just wait a while and see said teddy the lucky feller hasnt come along here mike jest buy a package mike a boy of fifteen produced five cents and said i dont mind if i do he selected a package and without opening it slipped it into his pocket why dont you open it said teddy whats the use said mike there aint no fifty cents inside however he drew it out of his pocket and opened it whats this he exclaimed pulling out a piece of scrip howly st patrick its i thats in luck anyhow ive got the fifty cents and he held up to view a fiftycent scrip let me look at it said paul incredulously but there was no room for doubt it was a genuine fifty cents as paul was compelled to admit didnt i tell you so said teddy triumphantly heres where you get fiftycent prizes the appeal was successful the sight of the fiftycent prize led to a large call for packages of which teddy immediately sold ten while paul found himself completely deserted none of the ten however contained over two cents still the possibility of drawing fifty cents kept up the courage of buyers while pauls inducements were so far inferior that he found himself wholly distanced dont you wish youd gone pardners with me asked teddy with a triumphant grin noticing pauls look of discomfiture you cant do business alongside of me you cant make any money giving such big prizes said paul you havent taken in as much as youve given yet all right said teddy im satisfied if you are have a package jim yes said jim mind you give me a good prize the package was bought and on being opened proved to contain fifty cents also to pauls great amazement how teddys business could pay as it was managed he could not comprehend one thing was certain however his new competitor monopolized the trade and for two hours paul did not get a solitary customer theres something about this i dont understand he pondered thoughtfully he must lose money but hes spoiled my trade paul did not like to give up his beat but he found himself compelled to accordingly he took his basket and moved off toward wall street here he was able to start in business without competitors and succeeded in selling quite a number of packages until a boy came up and said theres a feller up at the post office thats givin fiftycent prizes i got one of em there was a group of halfadozen boys around paul two of whom were about to invest but on hearing thus they changed their intention and walked of in the direction of the post office looking up paul saw that the boy who had injured his trade was mike who had drawn the first fiftycent prize from his competitor cant you stop interfering he said angrily ive lost two customers by you if you dont like it you can lump it said mike insolently this is a free country aint it its a mean trick said paul indignantly say that agin and ill upset your basket returned mike ill say it as often as i like said paul who wasnt troubled by cowardice come on if you want to mike advanced a step doubling his fists but finding that paul showed no particular sign of fear he stopped short saying ill lick you some other time youd better put it off said paul have a prize package sir only five cents this was addressed to a young man who came out of an insurance office i dont mind if i do said the young man five cents is it what prize may i expect the highest is ten cents theres a boy around the post office that gives fiftycent prizes mister said mike youd better buy of him ill wait till another time said the young man heres the money johnny now for the package look here said paul indignantly when his customer had gone away havent you anything to do except to drive off my customers give me two cents on every package said mike and ill tell em you give dollar prizes that would be a lie and i dont want to do business that way mike continued his persecutions a while longer and then turned the corner into nassau street im glad hes gone thought paul now theres a chance for me he managed after a while to sell twenty of his packages by this time it was twelve oclock and he began to feel hungry he resolved therefore to go home to dinner and come out again in the afternoon he didnt know how much he had made but probably about fifty cents he had made more than double as much the day before in less time but then he did not suffer from competition he began to doubt whether he could long pursue this business since other competitors were likely to spring up as he walked by the post office he had the curiosity to look and see how his competitor was getting along teddy had started originally with seventyfive packages but of those scarcely a dozen were left a group of boys were around him among them was mike who was just on the point of buying another package as before he put it in his pocket and it was not till teddy asked what luck mike that he drew it out and opening it again produced fifty cents its the big prize he said sure im in luck anyhow youre the boy thats lucky said teddy with a grin as paul witnessed the scene a light broke upon him now he understood how teddy could afford to give such large prizes mike and the other boy jim were only confederates of his decoy ducks who kept drawing over again the same prize which was eventually given back to teddy it was plain now why mike put the package into his pocket before opening it it was to exchange it for another packet into which the money had previously been placed but which was supposed by the lookerson to be the same that had just been purchased the prize could afterward be placed in a new packet and used over again that aint the same package said paul announcing his discovery he had it all the while in his pocket look here blustered mike you jest mind your own business thats the best thing for you suppose i dont if you dont there may be a funeral tomorrow of a boy about your size there was a laugh at pauls expense but he took it coolly ill send you a particular invitation to attend if i can get anybody to go over to the island as mike had been a resident at blackwells island on two different occasions this produced a laugh at his expense in the midst of which paul walked off chapter iv teddy gives up business have you sold all your packages paul asked jimmy as our hero entered the humble room where the table was already spread with a simple dinner no said paul i only sold twenty i begin to think that the prizepackage business will soon be played out why theres too many thatll go into it here paul related his experience of the morning explaining how it was that teddy had managed to distance him in the competition cant you do the same paul asked jimmy mothers got a gold dollar she could lend you that might do said paul but i dont know any boy i could trust to draw it except you and some of them would know we were brothers i think paul that would be dishonest said mrs hoffman i would rather make less if i were you and do it honestly maybe youre right mother ill try it again this afternoon keeping as far away from teddy as i can if i find i cant make it go ill try some other business jimmy have you shown paul your drawing said his mother here it is paul said jimmy producing his drawingbook from which he had copied a simple design of a rustic cottage why thats capital jimmy said paul in real surprise i had no idea you would succeed so well do you really think so paul asked the little boy much pleased i really do how long did it take you only a short time not more than half an hour i should think said mrs hoffman i think jimmy succeeded very well youll make a great artist some time jimmy said paul i wish i could said the little boy i should like to earn some money so that you and mother need not work so hard hard work agrees with me im tough said paul but when we get to be men jimmy well make so much money that mother neednt work at all she shall sit in the parlor all day dressed in silk with nothing to do i dont think i would enjoy that said mrs hoffman smiling will you be in the candy business then paul said jimmy no jimmy it would never do for the brother of a great artist to be selling candy round the streets i hope i shall have something better to do than that sit down to dinner paul said his mother its all ready the dinner was not a luxurious one there was a small plate of cold meat some potatoes and bread and butter but mrs hoffman felt glad to be able to provide even that and paul who had the hearty appetite of a growing boy did full justice to the fare they had scarcely finished when a knock was heard at the door paul answering the summons admitted a stout pleasantlooking irishwoman the top of the mornin to ye mrs donovan said paul bowing ceremoniously ah yell be afther havin your joke paul said mrs donovan goodnaturedly and how is your health mum the day i am well thank you mrs donovan said mrs hoffman sit down to the table wont you were just through dinner but theres something left thank you mum ive jist taken dinner i was goin to wash this afternoon and i thought maybe youd have some little pieces i could wash jist as well as not thank you mrs donovan you are very kind but you must have enough work of your own to do im stout and strong mum and hard work agrees with me but youre a rale lady and aint used to it its only a thrifle but if you want to pay me you could do a bit of sewin for me i aint very good with the needle my fingers is too coarse belike thank you mrs donovan on those terms i will agree to your kind offer washing is a little hard for me mrs hoffman collected a few pieces and wrapping them up in a handkerchief handed them to her guest and now what have you been doin jimmy darlint said mrs donovan turning her broad goodhumored face toward the younger boy ive been drawing a picture said jimmy would you like to see it now isnt that illigant exclaimed mrs donovan admiringly taking the picture and gazing at it with rapt admiration who showed you how to do it paul bought me a book and i copied it out of that youre a rale genius maybe youll make pictures some time like them we have in the church of the blessed virgin and the saints do you think you could draw me now she asked with curiosity i havent got a piece of paper big enough said jimmy slyly ah its pokin fun at me ye are said mrs donovan goodhumoredly just like my pat he run into the room yesterday sayin mother theres great news barnums fat woman is dead and hes comin afther you this afternoon hell pay you ten dollars a week and board whist ye spalpeen said i is it makin fun of your poor mother ye are but i couldnt help laughing at the impertinence of the boy but i must be goin thank you for your kind offer mrs donovan jimmy shall go to your room for the sewing theres no hurry about that said mrs donovan ill jist bring it in meself when its ready she is very kind said mrs hoffman when bridget donovan had gone i shall be glad to have her wash i am apt to feel weak after it what are you going to do this afternoon paul ill try to sell out the rest of my stock of packages perhaps i shant succeed but ill do my best shall you have another picture to show me when i come back tonight jimmy yes paul i love to draw im going to try this castle its rather hard isnt it i can do it said jimmy confidently paul left the room with his basket on his arm he was drawn by curiosity to the spot where he had met with his first success as well as his first failure the front of the post office here he became witness to an unexpectedly lively scene in other words a fight in which teddy obrien and his confederate mike were the contestants to explain the cause of the quarrel it must be stated that it related to a division of the spoils teddy had sold out his last package seventyfive in number for these he had received five cents apiece making in all three dollars and seventyfive cents of which all but a dollar and seventyfive cents representing the value of the prizes and the original cost of the packages and their contents was profit now according to the arrangement entered into between him and mike the latter for his services was to receive one cent on every package sold this however seemed to teddy too much to pay so when the time of reckoning came he stoutly asseverated that there were but sixty packages that dont go down said mike indignantly its nearer a hundred no it isnt its only sixty youve got the fifty cents and ill give you ten more you must give me the whole sixty then said mike changing his ground i drawed the fifty as a prize teddy was struck with astonishment at the impudence of this assumption it wasnt no prize he said yes it was said mike you said so yourself didnt he jim jim who was also a confederate but had agreed to accept twentyfive cents in full for services rendered promptly answered shure mikes right it was a prize he drew you want to chate me said teddy angrily what have you been doin all the mornin demanded mike youre the chap to talk about chatin aint you ill give you twentyfive cents said teddy and thats all i will give you then youve got to fight said mike squaring off yes youve got to fight chimed in jim who thought he saw a chance for more money teddy looked at his two enemies each of whom was probably more than a match for himself and was not long in deciding that his best course was to avoid a fight by running accordingly he tucked all the money into his pocket and turning incontinently fled down liberty street closely pursued by his late confederates paul came up just in time to hear the termination of the dispute and watch the flight of his late business rival i guess teddy wont go into the business again he reflected i may as well take my old stand accordingly he once more installed himself on the post office steps and began to cry prize packages only five cents having no competitor now to interfere with his trade he met with fair success and by four oclock was able to start for home with his empty basket having disposed of all his stock in trade his profits though not so great as the day before amounted to a dollar if i could only make a dollar every day thought paul i would be satisfied chapter v paul loses his basket paul continued in the prizepackage business for three weeks his success varied but he never made less than seventyfive cents a day and sometimes as much as a dollar and a quarter he was not without competitors more than once on reaching his accustomed stand he found a rival occupying it before him in such cases he quietly passed on and set up his business elsewhere preferring to monopolize the trade though the location might not be so good teddy obrien did not again enter the field we left him at the end of the last chapter trying to escape from mike and jim who demanded a larger sum than he was willing to pay for their services he succeeded in escaping with his money but the next day the two confederates caught him and teddy received a black eye as a receipt in full of all demands so on the whole he decided that some other business would suit him better and resumed the blackingbox which he had abandoned on embarking in commercial pursuits mike donovan and jim parker were two notoriously bad boys preferring to make a living in any other way than by honest industry as some of these ways were not regarded as honest in the sight of the law each had more than once been sentenced to a term at blackwells island they made a proposition to paul to act as decoy ducks for him in the same way as for teddy he liked neither of the boys and did not care to be associated with them this refusal mike and jim resented and determined to pay of paul if they ever got a chance our hero from time to time saw them hovering about him but took very little notice of them he knew that he was a match for either though mike exceeded him in size and he felt quite capable of taking care of himself one day mike and jim whose kindred tastes led them to keep company met at the corner of liberty and william streets mike looked unusually dilapidated he had had a scuffle the day before with another boy and his clothes always well ventilated got torn in several extra places as it was very uncertain when he would be in a financial condition to provide himself with another suit the prospect was rather alarming jim parker looked a shade more respectable in attire but his face and hands were streaked with blacking to this however jim had become so accustomed that he would probably have felt uncomfortable with a clean face how are you off for stamps jim asked mike dead broke was the reply so am i i aint had no breakfast nor i cept an apple couldnt i eat though suppose we borrow a quarter of paul hoffman he wouldnt lend a feller not if he knowed it said mike significantly what do you mean mike asked jim with some curiosity well borrow without leave howll we do it ill tell you said mike he proceeded to unfold his plan which was briefly this the two were to saunter up to where paul was standing and remain until the group if there were any around him should be dispersed then one was to pull his hat over his eyes while the other would snatch the basket containing his prize packages and run down liberty street never stopping until he landed in a certain alley known to both boys the other would run in a different direction and both would meet as soon as practicable for the division of the spoils it was yet so early that paul could not have sold many from his stock as each contained a prize varying from one penny to ten they would probably realize enough to buy a good breakfast besides the candy contained in the packages more money might be obtained by selling packages but there was risk in this besides it would take time and they decided that a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush thats a good idea said jim approvingly wholl knock his hat over his head you can said mike and ill grab the basket but to this jim demurred for two reasons first he was rather afraid of paul whose strength of arm he had tested on a previous occasion and again he was afraid that if mike got off with the basket he would appropriate the lions share ill grab the basket he said what for said mike suspiciously for he too felt some distrust of his confederate youre strongern i am mike said jim maybe hed turn on me and i cant fight him as well as you thats so said mike who had rather a high idea of his own prowess and felt pleased with the compliment im a match for him of course you be said jim artfully and he knows it of course he does said mike boastfully i can lick him with one hand jim had serious doubts of this but he had his reasons for concurring in mikes estimate of his own powers wed better start now said jim im awful hungry come along then they walked up liberty street as far as nassau on reaching the corner they saw their unconscious victim at his usual place it was rather a public place for an assault and both boys would have hesitated had they not been incited by a double motive the desire of gain and a feeling of hostility they sauntered along and mike pressed in close by paul what do you want asked paul not liking the vicinity whats that to you demanded mike quit crowdin me i aint crowdin ive got as much right to be here as you heres your prize packages exclaimed paul in a businesslike tone maybe ill buy one if youll give me credit till tomorrow said mike your credit isnt good with me said paul you must pay cash down then you wont trust me said mike pressing a little closer no i wont said paul decidedly then take that you spalpeen said mike suddenly pulling pauls hat over his eyes at the same time jim to whom he had tipped a wink snatched the basket which paul held loosely in his hand and disappeared round the corner the attack was so sudden and unexpected that paul was at first bewildered but he quickly recovered his presence of mind and saw into the trick he raised his hat and darted in pursuit of mike not knowing in what direction his basket had gone thats a mean trick he exclaimed indignantly give me back my basket you thief i aint got no basket said mike facing round then you know where it is i dont know nothin of your basket you pulled my hat over my eyes on purpose to steal my basket no i didnt you insulted me thats why i did it tell me where my basket is or ill lick you said paul incensed i aint nothin to do with your basket take that then for pulling my hat over my eyes and paul suiting the action to the word dealt mike a staggering blow in the face ill murder you shouted mike furiously dashing at paul with a blow which might have leveled him if he had not fended it off paul was not quarrelsome but he knew how to fight and he was prepared now to fight in earnest indignant as he was at the robbery which entailed upon him a loss he could ill sustain ill give you all you want he said resolutely eyeing mike warily and watching a chance to give him another blow the contest was brief being terminated by the sudden and unwelcome arrival of a policeman whats this he asked authoritatively surveying the combatants paul with his flushed face and mike whose nose was bleeding freely from a successful blow of his adversary he pitched into me for nothin said mike glaring at paul and rubbing his bloody nose on the sleeve of his ragged coat that isnt true said paul excitedly he came up while i was selling prize packages of candy in front of the post office and pulled my hat over my eyes while another boy grabbed my basket you lie said mike i dont know nothin of your basket why did you pull his hat over his eyes asked the policeman because he insulted me how did he insult you he wouldnt trust me till tomorrow i dont blame him much for that said the policeman who was aware of mikes shady reputation having on a former occasion been under the necessity of arresting him even without such acquaintance mikes general appearance would hardly have recommended him to officer jones ill let you go this time he said but if i catch you fighting again on my beat ill march you off to the stationhouse mike was glad to escape though he would almost have been willing to be arrested if paul could have been arrested also the officer walked away and mike started down the street paul followed him that didnt suit mikes ideas as he was anxious to meet jim and divide the spoils with him what are you follerin me for he demanded angrily i have my reasons said paul then youd better stay where you are your company aint wanted i know that said paul but im going to follow you till i find my basket what do i know of your basket thats what i want to find out mike saw by pauls resolute tone that he meant what he said desirous of shaking him of he started on a run chapter vi paul as an artist paul was not slow in following mike he was a good runner and would have had no difficulty in keeping up with his enemy if the streets had been empty but to thread his way in and out among the numerous foot passengers that thronged the sidewalks was not so easy he kept up pretty well however until in turning a street corner he ran at full speed into a very stout gentleman whose scanty wind was quite knocked out of him by the collision he glared in anger at paul but could not at first obtain breath enough to speak i beg your pardon sir said paul who in spite of his desire to overtake mike felt it incumbent upon him to stop and offer an apology what do you mean sir exploded the fat man at last by tearing through the streets like a locomotive youve nearly killed me i am very sorry sir you ought to be dont you know better than to run at such speed you ought to be indicted as a public nuisance i was trying to catch a thief said paul trying to catch a thief hows that asked the stout gentleman his indignation giving way to curiosity i was selling packages in front of the post office when he and another boy came up and stole my basket indeed what were you selling prize packages sir what was in them candy could you make much that way about a dollar a day id rather have given you a dollar than had you run against me with such violence i feel it yet indeed sir im very sorry well ill forgive you under the circumstances whats your name paul hoffman well i hope youll get back your basket some time if you see me in the street come up and let me know would you know me again i think i should sir well goodmorning i hope youll catch the thief i thank you sir they parted company but paul did not continue the pursuit the conversation in which he had taken part had lasted so long that mike had had plenty of time to find a refuge and there would be no use in following him so paul went home you are home early paul said his mother surely you havent sold out by this time no but all my packages are gone how is that they were stolen tell me about it so paul told the story that mike was awful mean said jimmy indignantly id like to hit him i dont think you would hurt him much jimmy said paul amused at his little brothers vehemence then i wish i was a big strong boy said jimmy i hope you will be some time how much was your loss paul asked his mother there were nearly forty packages they cost me about a dollar but if i had sold them all they would have brought me in twice as much i had only sold ten packages shall you make some more no i think not said paul ive got tired of the business its getting poorer every day ill go out after dinner and see if i cant find something else to do you aint going out now paul said jimmy no ill stop and see you draw a little while thats bully im going to try these oxen thats a hard picture i dont think you can draw it jimmy yes i can said the little boy confidently just see if i dont jimmy has improved a good deal said his mother youll be a great artist one of these days jimmy said paul im going to try paul said the little boy i like it so much little jimmy had indeed made surprising progress in drawing with no instruction whatever he had succeeded in a very close and accurate imitation of the sketches in the drawing books paul had purchased for him it was a great delight to the little boy to draw and hour after hour as his mother sat at her work he sat up to the table and worked at his drawing scarcely speaking a word unless spoken to so absorbed was he in his fascinating employment paul watched him attentively youll make a bully artist jimmy he said at length really surprised at his little brothers proficiency if you keep on a little longer youll beat me i wish youd draw something paul said jimmy i never saw any of your drawings i am afraid if you saw mine it would discourage you said paul you know im older and ought to draw better his face was serious but there was a merry twinkle of fun in his eyes of course i know you draw better said jimmy seriously what shall i draw asked paul try this horse paul all right said paul but you must go away i dont want you to see it till it is done jimmy left the table and paul commenced his attempt now though paul is the hero of my story i am bound to confess that he had not the slightest talent for drawing though jimmy did not know it it was only to afford his little brother amusement that he now undertook the task paul worked away for about five minutes its done he said so quick exclaimed jimmy in surprise how fast you work he drew near and inspected pauls drawing he had no sooner inspected it than he burst into a fit of laughter pauls drawing was a very rough one and such a horse as he had drawn will never probably be seen until the race has greatly degenerated whats the matter jimmy asked paul dont you like it its awful paul said the little boy almost choking with mirth i see how it is said paul with feigned resentment youre jealous of me because you cant draw as well oh paul youll kill me and jimmy again burst into a fit of merriment cant you really draw any better no jimmy said paul joining in the laugh i cant draw any better than an old cow youve got all the talent in the family in that line but youre smart in other ways paul said jimmy who had a great admiration of paul notwithstanding the discovery of his artistic inferiority im glad theres one that thinks so jimmy said paul ill refer to you when i want a recommendation jimmy resumed his drawing and was proud of the praises which paul freely bestowed upon him ill get you a harder drawing book when youve got through with these said paul that is if i dont get reduced to poverty by having my stock in trade stolen again after a while came dinner this meal in mrs hoffmans household usually came at twelve oclock it was a plain frugal meal always but on sunday they usually managed to have something a little better as they had been accustomed to do when mr hoffman was alive paul was soon through he took his hat from the bureau and prepared to go out im going out to try my luck mother he said ill see if i cant get into something i like a little better than the prizepackage business i hope youll succeed paul better than i did in drawing horses eh jimmy yes i hope so paul said the little boy dont you show that horse to visitors and pretend its yours jimmy no danger paul paul went downstairs and into the street he had no definite plan in his head but was ready for anything that might turn up he did not feel anxious for he knew there were plenty of ways in which he could earn something he had never tried blacking boots but still he could do it in case of emergency he had sold papers and succeeded fairly in that line and knew he could again he had pitted himself against other boys and the result had been to give him a certain confidence in his own powers and business abilities when he had first gone into the street to try his chances there it had been with a degree of diffidence but knocking about the streets soon gives a boy confidence sometimes too much of it and paul had learned to rely upon himself but the influence of a good though humble home and a judicious mother had kept him aloof from the bad habits into which many street boys are led so paul though his stock in trade had been stolen and he was obliged to seek a new kind of business was by no means disheartened he walked a little way downtown and then crossing the city hall park found himself on broadway a little below the astor house he came to the stand of a sidewalkmerchant who dealt in neckties upon an upright framework hung a great variety of ties of different colors most of which were sold at the uniform price of twentyfive cents each paul was acquainted with the proprietor of the stand and having nothing else to do determined to stop and speak to him chapter vii a new business the proprietor of the necktie stand was a slender darkcomplexioned young man of about twentyfive or thereabouts his name was george barry paul had known him for over a year and whenever he passed his stand was accustomed to stop and speak with him well george hows business asked paul fair said barry that isnt whats the matter what is it then im sick i ought not to be out here today whats the matter with you ive caught a bad cold and feel hot and feverish i ought to be at home and abed why dont you go i cant leave my business its better to do that than to get a bad sickness i suppose it is i am afraid i am going to have a fever one minute im hot another im cold but i cant afford to close up my business why dont you get somebody to take your place i dont know anybody i could get that i could trust theyd sell my goods and make off with the money can you trust me asked paul who saw a chance to benefit himself as well as his friend yes paul i could trust you but im afraid i couldnt pay you enough to make it worth while for you to stand here i havent got anything to do just now said paul i was in the prizepackage business but two fellows stole my stock in trade and im not going into it again its about played out im your man just make me an offer i should like to have you take my place for a day or two for i know you wouldnt cheat me you may be sure of that i am sure i know you are an honest boy paul but i dont know what to offer you how many neckties do you sell a day asked paul in a businesslike tone about a dozen on an average and how much profit do you make its half profit paul made a short calculation twelve neckties at twentyfive cents each would bring three dollars half of this was a dollar and a half ill take your place for half profits he said thats fair said george barry ill accept your offer can you begin now yes then ill go home and go to bed its the best place for me youd better ill come round after closing up and hand over the money all right you know where i live im not sure no bleecker street ill come up this evening george barry walked away leaving paul in charge of his business he did so with perfect confidence not every boy in pauls circumstances can be trusted but he felt sure that paul would do the right thing by him i may as well say in this connection that george barry had a mother living they occupied two rooms in a lodginghouse in bleecker street and lived very comfortably mrs barry had an allowance of two hundred dollars a year from a relation this with what she earned by sewing and her son by his stand supported them very comfortably especially as they provided and cooked their own food which was of course much cheaper than boarding still the loss of the young mans earnings even for a short time would have been felt though they had a reserve of a hundred dollars in a savings bank from which they might draw if necessary but george did not like to do this the arrangement which he made with paul was a satisfactory one for with half his usual earnings they would still be able to keep out of debt and not be compelled to draw upon the fund in the bank of course something depended on pauls success as a salesman but he would not be likely to fall much below the average amount of sales so on the whole george barry went home considerably relieved in mind though his head was throbbing and he felt decidedly sick arrived at home his mother who understood sickness at once took measures to relieve him dont mind the loss of a few days george she said cheerfully we shall be able to get along very well itll only be part loss mother he said ive got paul hoffman to take my place for half the profits paul hoffman do i know him i dont think he has ever been here but i have known him for a year can you trust him yes im not at all afraid he is a smart boy and as honest as he is smart i think he will sell nearly as much as i would that is an excellent arrangement you neednt feel uneasy then no the business will go on right i should like to see your salesman youll see him tonight mother hes coming round this evening to let me know how hes got along and hand over the money hes taken youd better be quiet now george and go to sleep if you can ill make you some warm tea i think itll do you good meanwhile paul assumed charge of george barrys business he was sorry his friend was sick but he congratulated himself on getting into business so soon its more respectable than selling prize packages thought paul i wish i had a stand of my own he was still a street merchant but among street merchants there are grades as well as among merchants whose claim to higher respectability rests upon having rent to pay paul felt that it was almost like having a shop of his own he had always looked up to george barry as standing higher than himself in a business way and he felt that even if his earnings should not be as great that it was a step upward to have sole charge of his stand if only for a day or two pauls ambition was aroused it was for his interest to make as large sales as possible besides he thought he would like to prove to george barry that he had made a good selection in appointing him his substitute now if the truth must be told george barry himself was not possessed of superior business ability he was lacking in energy and push he could sell neckties to those who asked for them but had no particular talent for attracting trade he would have been a fair clerk but was never likely to rise above a very moderate success paul was quite different he was quick enterprising and smart he was a boy likely to push his way to success unless circumstances were very much against him id like to sell more than george barry he said to himself i dont know if i can but im going to try the day was half over and probably the most profitable so far as business was concerned paul had only four or five hours left let me see he said to himself i ought to sell six neckties to come up to the average of half a days sale i wonder whether i can do it as his soliloquy ended his quick eye detected a young man glancing at his stock and he observed that he paused irresolutely as if half inclined to purchase cant i sell you a necktie today asked paul promptly i dont know said the other what do you charge you can have your choice for twentyfive cents that is cheap isnt it yes thats cheap let me look at them heres one that will suit your complexion said paul yes thats a pretty one i think ill take it you have to pay twice as much in the shops continued paul as he rolled it up you see we have no rent to pay and so we can sell cheap youll save money by always buying your neckties here the only objection to that is that i dont live in the city i am here only for a day i live about fifty miles in the country then ill tell you what youd better do said paul lay in half a dozen while you are about it itll only be a dollar and a half and youll save as much as that by doing it i dont know but you are right said his customer whom the suggestion impressed favorably as you say its only a dollar and a half and itll give me a good stock let me pick them out for you said paul briskly unless theres something you see yourself i like that one all right what shall be the next finally the young man selected the entire halfdozen and deposited a dollar and a half in pauls hands come and see me again said paul and if you have any friends coming to the city send them to me i will said the other tell them its the first stand south of the astor house then they wont miss it thats a good beginning said paul to himself with satisfaction half a days average sales already and ive only been here fifteen minutes let me see what will my profits be on that three shillings i declare that isnt bad now paul had reason to be satisfied with himself if he had not spoken the young man would very probably have gone on without purchasing at all or at any rate remained content with a single necktie pauls manner and timely word had increased his purchase sixfold that is generally the difference between a poor salesman and one of the first class anybody can sell to those who are anxious to buy but it takes a smart man to persuade a customer that he wants what otherwise he would go without the difference in success is generally appreciated by dealers and a superior salesman is generally paid a handsome salary i dont believe george barry would have sold that man so many ties thought paul i hope i shall have as good luck next time but this of course was not to be expected it is not every customer who can be persuaded to buy halfadozen ties even by the most eloquent salesman however in the course of an hour more paul had sold three more to single customers then came a man who bought two then there was a lull and for an hour paul sold none at all but business improved a little toward the close of the afternoon and when it was time to close up our young merchant found that he had disposed of fifteen my share of the profits will be ninetythree cents thought paul with satisfaction that isnt bad for an afternoons work chapter viii a stroke of ill luck paul transferred his frame of goods to a neighboring office at the end of the afternoon the arrangement having been made by george barry on first entering into business as a street merchant this saved a good deal of trouble as otherwise he would have been compelled to carry them home every night and bring them back in the morning well paul asked his mother when he returned to supper have you found anything to do yet i have got employment for a few days said paul to tend a necktie stand the man that keeps it is sick how much does he pay you paul asked jimmy half the profits how much do you think i have made this afternoon forty cents what do you say to ninetythree cents just look at this and paul displayed his earnings that is excellent i had good luck generally i shant make more in a whole day than this that will be doing very well but i shall make more if i can one fellow bought six neckties of me this afternoon i wish everybody would do that now mother i hope supper is most ready for selling neckties has made me hungry almost ready paul it was a humble meal but a good one there were fresh rolls and butter tea and some cold meat that was all but the cloth was clean and everything looked neat all did justice to the plain meal and never thought of envying the thousands who in their rich uptown mansions were sitting down at the same hour to elaborate dinners costing more than their entire weeks board are you going out paul asked mrs hoffman noticing that he took his hat yes i must go and see george barry and carry the money i have received for sales where does he live in bleecker street i shant be gone long paul reached the number which had been given him it was a large fourstory house with the appearance of a barracks mr barry said the servant in answer to his question he lives upstairs on the fourth floor room on the right paul plodded his way upstairs and found the room without difficulty on knocking the door was opened by mrs barry who looked at him inquiringly does george barry live here asked paul yes are you the one he left in charge of his business paul answered in the affirmative adding how is he he seems quite feverish i am afraid he is going to have a fever its fortunate he came home he was not able to attend to his business can i see him come in said mrs barry the room was covered with a worn carpet but looked neat and comfortable there was a cheap sewingmachine in one corner and some plain furniture there was a bedroom opening out of this room and here it was that george barry lay upon the bed is that paul hoffman mother was heard from the bedroom yes said paul answering for himself go in if you like said mrs barry my son wishes to see you how do you feel now george asked paul not very well paul i didnt give up a minute too soon i think i am going to have a fever that is not comfortable said paul still you have your mother to take care of you i dont know how i should get along without her can you look after my business as long as i am sick yes i have nothing else to do then that is off my mind by the way how many ties did you sell this afternoon fifteen what demanded barry in surprise you sold fifteen yes why i never sold so many as that in an afternoon didnt you said paul gratified then you think i did well splendidly how did you do it you see there was a young man from the country that i persuaded to buy six as he could not get them so cheap at home that was my first sale and it encouraged me i didnt think youd sell more than six in the whole afternoon nor did i when i started but i determined to do my best i dont expect to do as well every day no of course not ive been in the business more than a year and i know what it is some days are very dull ive got the money for you the fifteen ties came to three dollars and seventyfive cents i keep onefourth of this as my commission that leaves two dollars and eightytwo cents quite correct however you neednt give me the money you may need to change a bill or else lose a sale it will do if you settle with me at the end of the week i see you have confidence in me george suppose i should take a fancy to run away with the money i am not afraid if i do i will give you warning a week beforehand after a little more conversation paul withdrew thinking he might worry the sick man he offered to come up the next evening but george barry said it would be too much to expect you to come up every evening i shall be satisfied if you come up every other evening very well said paul then you may expect me saturday i hope i shall have some good sales to report and that i shall find you better paul descended to the street and walked slowly homeward he couldnt help wishing that the stand was his own and the entire profits his this would double his income and enable him to save up money at present this was hardly possible his own earnings had been and were likely to continue very fluctuating still they constituted the main support of the family his mother made shirts for an establishment on broadway at twentyfive cents each which was more than some establishments paid she could hardly average more than one shirt a day in addition to her household work and in order to accomplish this even she was obliged to work very steadily all day jimmy of course earned nothing not that he was too young there were plenty of little newsboys who were as small as he perhaps smaller i have seen boys who did not appear to be more than four years old standing at the corners crying the news in their childish treble but paul was not willing to have jimmy sent out into the streets to undergo the rough discipline of street life he was himself of a strong robust nature and did not shrink from the rough and tumble of life he felt sure he could make his way and give as well as receive blows but jimmy was shy and retiring of a timid shrinking nature who would suffer from what would only exhilarate paul and brace him for the contest so it was understood that jimmy was to get an education studying at present at home with his mother who had received a good education and that mrs hoffman and paul were to be the breadwinners i wish mother didnt have to sit so steadily at her work thought paul many a time he resolved some time to relieve her from the necessity but at present it was impossible to maintain their small family in comfort required all that both could earn the next morning paul started out after breakfast for the street stand wondering what success he was destined to meet with about the middle of the forenoon mrs hoffman prepared to go out do you think you can stay alone for an hour or two jimmy she asked yes mother answered jimmy who was deep in a picture which he was copying from one of the drawingbooks paul had bought him where are you going mother to carry back some work jimmy i have got halfadozen shirts done and must return them and ask for more they ought to pay you more than twentyfive cents apiece mother how long has it taken you to make them nearly a week that is only a dollar and a half for a weeks work i know it jimmy but they can get plenty to work at that price so it wont do for me to complain i shall be very glad if i can get steady work even at that price jimmy said no more and mrs hoffman gathering up her bundle went out she had a little more than half a mile to go this did not require long she entered the large door and advanced to the counter behind which stood a clerk with a pen behind his ear how many he said as she laid the bundle upon the counter six name hoffman correct i will look at them he opened the bundle hastily and surveyed the work critically luckily there was no fault to find for mrs hoffman was a skillful seamstress they will do he said and taking from a drawer the stipulated sum paid for them can i have some more asked mrs hoffman anxiously not today were overstocked with goods made up we must contract our manufacture this was unexpected and carried dismay to the heart of the poor woman what she could earn was very little but it was important to her when do you think you can give me some more work she asked it may be a month or six weeks he answered carelessly a month or six weeks to have her supply of work cut off for so long a time would indeed be a dire misfortune but there was nothing to say mrs hoffman knew very well that no one in the establishment cared for her necessities so with a heavy heart she started for home making up her mind to look elsewhere for work in the afternoon she could not help recalling with sorrow the time when her husband was living and they lived in a pleasant little home before the shadow of bereavement and pecuniary anxiety had come to cloud their happiness still she was not utterly cast down paul had proved himself a manly and a helpful boy selfreliant and courageous and though they might be pinched she knew that as long as he was able to work they would not actually suffer chapter ix a new patron mrs hoffman went out in the afternoon and visited several large establishments in the hope of obtaining work but everywhere she was met with the stereotyped reply business is so dull that we are obliged to turn off some who are accustomed to work for us we have no room for new hands finally she decided that it would be of no use to make any further applications and went home feeling considerably disheartened i must find something to do she said to herself i cannot throw upon paul the entire burden of supporting the family but it was not easy to decide what to do there are so few paths open to a woman like mrs hoffman she was not strong enough to take in washing nor if she had been would paul who was proud for his mother though not for himself have consented to her doing it she determined to think it over during the evening and make another attempt to get work of some kind the next day i wont tell paul till tomorrow night she decided perhaps by that time i shall have found something to do all that day the first full day in his new business paul sold eighteen ties he was not as successful proportionately as the previous afternoon still his share of the profits amounted to a dollar and twelve cents and he felt quite satisfied his sales had been fifty per cent more than george barrys average sales and that was doing remarkably well considering that the business was a new one to him the next morning about ten oclock as he stood behind his stand he saw a stout gentleman approaching from the direction of the astor house he remembered him as the one with whom he had accidentally come in collision when he was in pursuit of mike donovan having been invited to speak to him he determined to do so goodmorning sir said paul politely eh did you speak to me inquired the stout gentleman yes sir i bade you goodmorning goodmorning i dont remember you though whats your name paul hoffman dont you remember my running against you a day or two since oho youre the boy then you nearly knocked the breath out of me i am very sorry sir of course you didnt mean to is this your stand no sir i am tending for the owner who is sick does he pay you well he gives me half the profits and does that pay you for your labor i can earn about a dollar a day that is good it is more than i earned when i was of your age indeed sir yes i was a poor boy but i kept steadily at work and now i am rich i hope i shall be rich some time said paul you have the same chance that i had i dont care so much for myself as for my mother and my little brother i should like to become rich for their sake so you have a mother and a brother where do they live paul told him and you help support them yes sir thats a good boy said the gentleman approvingly is your mother able to earn anything not much sir she makes shirts for a broadway store but they only pay her twentyfive cents apiece thats very small she can sew well i suppose oh yes sir no fault is ever found with her work do you think she would make me a dozen shirts she would be glad to do so said paul quickly for he knew that his new acquaintance would pay far more liberally than the broadway firm i will give the price i usually pay ten shillings apiece ten shillings in new york currency amount to a dollar and a quarter which would be five times the price mrs hoffman had been accustomed to receive a dozen shirts would come to fifteen dollars which to a family in their circumstances would be a great help thank you sir said paul my mother will accept the work thankfully and will try to suit you when shall i come for the cloth you may come to my house this evening and i will give you a pattern and an order for the materials on a dry goods dealer in broadway where do you live sir no madison avenue between thirtyfourth and thirtyfifth streets my name is preston can you remember it yes sir but i will put it down to make sure well goodmorning goodmorning sir i suppose you dont want a tie this morning i dont think you keep the kind i am accustomed to wear said mr preston smiling i stick to the old fashions and wear a stock the old gentleman had scarcely gone when two boys of twelve or thirteen paused before the stand thats a bully tie jeff said george the elder of the two i have a good mind to buy it it wont cost much said jeff only twentyfive cents but i like that one better if you buy one i will all right said jeff whose full name was jefferson we can wear them to dancingschool this afternoon so the two boys bought a necktie and this in addition to previous sales made six sold during the morning i hope i shall do as well as i did yesterday thought paul if i can make nine shillings every day i wont complain it is better than selling prizepackages paul seemed likely to obtain his wish since at twelve oclock when he returned home to dinner he had sold ten ties making rather more than half of the previous days sales mrs hoffman had been out once more but met with no better success than before there seemed to be no room anywhere for a new hand at several places she had seen others out of employment like herself who were also in quest of work the only encouragement she received was that probably in a month or six weeks business might so far improve that she could obtain work but to mrs hoffman it was a serious matter to remain idle even four weeks she reflected that pauls present employment was only temporary and that he would be forced to give up his post as soon as george barry should recover his health which probably would be within a week or two she tried in vain to think of some temporary employment and determined in case she should be unsuccessful in the afternoon which she hardly anticipated to consult paul what she had better do paul noticed when he came in that his mother looked more sober and thoughtful than usual have you a headache mother he inquired no paul she said smiling faintly something troubles you i am sure continued paul you are right paul said mrs hoffman though i didnt mean to tell you till evening what is it asked paul anxiously when i carried back the last shirts i made for duncan co they told me i couldnt have any more for a month or six weeks that will give you some time to rest mother said paul who wanted to keep back his good news for a while but i cant afford to rest paul you forget that i am earning money mother i am sure i can earn a dollar a day i know you are a good industrious boy paul and i dont know how we should get along without you but it is necessary for me to do my part though it is small dont be anxious mother i am sure we can get along but i am not willing that the whole burden of supporting the family should come upon you besides you are not sure how long you can retain your present employment i know that mother but something else will be sure to turn up if i cant do anything else i can turn bootblack though i would prefer something else there is no chance of my being out of work long there are fewer things for me to do said his mother but perhaps you can think of something i shall go out this afternoon and try my luck once more if i do not succeed i will consult with you this evening suppose i tell you that i have work for you enough to last for two or three weeks that will pay five times as well as the work you have been doing what would you say to that asked paul smiling are you in earnest paul asked his mother very much surprised quite in earnest mother theres a gentleman uptown that wants a dozen shirts made and is willing to pay ten shillings apiece ten shillings why thats a dollar and a quarter of course it is i told him i thought you would accommodate him you are sure i can get the work to do certainly i am to go up to his house this evening and get the pattern and an order for the materials it seems too good to be true said his mother why i can earn at least a dollar a day then you will be doing as well as i am tell me how you heard of it paul said mrs hoffman paul told the story of the manner in which he formed mr prestons acquaintance its lucky you ran into him paul said jimmy he didnt think so at the time said paul laughing he said i nearly knocked the breath out of him you wont go out this afternoon mother will you asked jimmy no it will not be necessary now i didnt think this morning that such a piece of good luck was in store for me chapter x another loss after supper paul brushed his clothes carefully and prepared to go to the address given him by mr preston he decided to walk one way not wishing to incur the expenses of two railroad fares the distance was considerable and it was nearly eight oclock when he arrived at his destination paul found himself standing before a handsome house of brown stone he ascended the steps and inquired on the door being opened if mr preston was at home ill see said the servant she returned in a short time and said he says you may come upstairs paul followed the servant who pointed out a door at the head of the first staircase paul knocked and hearing come in from within he opened the door and entered he found himself in a spacious chamber handsomely furnished mr preston in dressinggown and slippers sat before a cheerful open fire come and sit down by the fire he said sociably thank you sir i am warm with walking and paul took a seat near the door i am one of the cold kind said mr preston and have a fire earlier than most people you come about the shirts i suppose yes sir will your mother undertake them with pleasure sir she can no longer get work from the shop business dull i suppose yes sir then i am glad i thought of giving her the commission hows business with you today eh pretty good sir how many neckties did you sell nineteen sir and how much do you get for that nine shillings and a half a dollar and eighteen cents thats pretty good for a boy like you when i was of your age i was working on a farm for my board and clothes were you sir asked paul interested yes i was bound out till i was twentyone at the end of that time i was to receive a hundred dollars and a freedom suit to begin the world with that wasnt a very large capital eh no sir but the death of my employer put an end to my apprenticeship at the age of eighteen i hadnt a penny of money and was thrown upon my own resources however i had a pair of good strong arms and a good stock of courage i knew considerable about farming but i didnt like it i thought i should like trade better so i went to the village merchant who kept a small drygoods store and arranged with him to supply me with a small stock of goods which i undertook to sell on commission for him his business was limited and having confidence in my honesty he was quite willing to intrust me with what i wanted so i set out with my pack on my back and made a tour of the neighboring villages paul listened with eager interest he had his own way to make and it was very encouraging to find that mr preston who was evidently rich and prosperous was no better off at eighteen than he was now you will want to know how i succeeded well at first only moderately but i think i had some tact in adapting myself to the different classes of persons with whom i came in contact at any rate i was always polite and that helped me so my sales increased and i did a good thing for my employer as well as myself he would have been glad to employ me for a series of years but i happened to meet a traveling salesman of a new york wholesale house who offered to obtain me a position similar to his own as this would give me a larger field and larger profits i accepted gladly and so changed the nature of my employment i became very successful my salary was raised from time to time till it reached five thousand dollars i lived frugally and saved money and at length bought an interest in the house by which i had been so long employed i am now senior partner and as you may suppose very comfortably provided for do you know why i have told you this asked mr preston noticing the eagerness with which paul had listened i dont know sir but i have been very much interested it is because i like to give encouragement to boys and young men who are now situated as i used to be i think you are a smart boy thank you sir and though you are poor you can lift yourself to prosperity if you are willing to work hard enough and long enough i am not afraid of work said paul promptly no i do not believe you are i can tell by a boys face and you have the appearance of one who is willing to work hard how long have you been a street peddler about a year sir before that time my father was living and i was kept at school you will find the street a school though of a different kind in which you can learn valuable lessons if you can get time in the evening however it will be best to keep up your school studies i am doing that now sir that is well and now about the shirts did your mother say how long it would take her to make them about three weeks i think sir will that be soon enough that will do perhaps it will be well however to bring half the number whenever they are finished all right sir i suppose your mother can cut them out if i send a shirt as a pattern yes sir mr preston rose and going to a bureau took therefrom a shirt which he handed to paul he then wrote a few lines on a slip of paper which he also handed our hero that is an order on barclay co he explained for the requisite materials if either you or your mother presents it they will be given you very good sir said paul he took his cap and prepared to go goodevening mr preston he said goodevening i shall expect you with the shirts when they are ready paul went downstairs and into the street thinking that mr preston was very sociable and agreeable he had fancied that rich men were generally stuck up but about mr preston there seemed an absence of all pretense pauls ambition was aroused when he thought of the story he had heard and he wondered whether it would be possible for him to raise himself to wealth and live in as handsome a house as mr preston he thought what a satisfaction it would be if the time should ever come when he could free his mother from the necessity of work and give little jimmy a chance to develop his talent for drawing however such success must be a long way off if it ever came he had intended to ride home but his mind was so preoccupied that he forgot all about it and had got some distance on his way before it occurred to him then not feeling particularly tired he concluded to keep on walking as he had commenced it will save me six cents he reflected and that is something if i am ever going to be a prosperous merchant i must begin to save now so he kept on walking passing the cooper institute he came into the bowery a broad and busy street the humble neighbor of broadway to which it is nearly parallel he was still engaged in earnest thought when he felt a rude slap on the back looking round he met the malicious glance of mike donovan who probably would not have ventured on such a liberty if he had not been accompanied by a boy a head taller than himself and to judge from appearances of about the same character what did you do that for mike demanded paul none of your business i didnt hurt you did i returned mike roughly no but i dont care to be hit that way by you so youre putting on airs are you no i dont do that returned paul but i dont care about having anything to do with you thats because youve got a new shirt is it sneered mike it isnt mine thats what i thought who did you steal it from do you mean to insult me mike donovan demanded paul angrily just as you like said mike independently if you want to know why i dont want to have anything to do with you i will tell you tell ahead because youre a thief if you say that again ill lick you said mike reddening with anger its true you stole my basket of candy the other day and that isnt the only time youve been caught stealing ill give you the worst licking you ever had do you want to fight said mike flourishing his fist no i dont said paul some time when i havent a bundle ill accommodate you youre a coward sneered mike gaining courage as he saw paul was not disposed for an encounter i dont think i am said paul coolly ill hold your shirt said mikes companion with a grin if you want to fight paul however did not care to intrust the shirt to a stranger of so unprepossessing an appearance he therefore attempted to pass on but mike encouraged by his reluctance stepped up and shook his fist within an inch of pauls nose calling him at the same time a coward this was too much for pauls selfrestraint he dropped the shirt and pitched into mike in so scientific a manner that the latter was compelled to retreat and finally to flee at the top of his speed not without having first received several pretty hard blows i dont think he will meddle with me again said paul to himself as he pulled down the sleeves of his jacket he walked back and looked for the shirt which he had laid down before commencing the combat but he looked in vain nothing was to be seen of the shirt or of mikes companion probably both had disappeared together chapter xi barclay co the loss of the shirt was very vexatious it was not so much the value of it that paul cared for although this was a consideration by no means to be despised by one in his circumstances but it had been lent as a pattern and without it his mother would be unable to make mr prestons shirts as to recovering it he felt that there was little chance of this besides it would involve delay and his mother could not afford to remain idle paul felt decidedly uncomfortable again mike donovan had done him an injury and this time of a more serious nature than before what should he do there seemed but one answer to this question he must go back to mr preston explain the manner in which he had lost his shirt and ask him for another promising of course to supply the place of the one lost he was not sure whether mr preston would accept this explanation he might think it was only an attempt to defraud him but at any rate it seemed the only thing to do and it must be done at once he entered a passing car for it was too late to walk i wish i had taken the car down thought paul then i shouldnt have lost the shirt but it was too late for regrets now he must do the best that remained to him it was nearly ten oclock when paul once more stood before the door of mr prestons boardingplace he rang the bell and asked to see him you have been here before this evening said the servant yes then you know the room you can walk right up paul went upstairs and knocked at mr prestons room he was bidden to come in and did so mr preston looked up with surprise i suppose you are surprised to see me said paul rather awkwardly why yes i did not anticipate that pleasure quite so soon said mr preston smiling i am afraid it wont be a pleasure for i bring bad news bad news repeated the gentleman rather startled yes i have lost the shirt you gave me oh is that all said mr preston looking relieved but how did you lose it i was walking home down the bowery when two fellows met me one of them mike donovan forced me into a fight i gave him a licking added paul with satisfaction but when it was all over i found the other fellow had run off with the shirt i dont believe it will fit him said mr preston laughing as the speaker probably weighed two hundred and fifty pounds it was indeed rather doubtful paul couldnt help laughing himself at the thought you were certainly unlucky said mr preston did you know the boy you fought with yes sir he once before stole my stock of candy when i was in the prizepackage business that was the day we got acquainted remarked mr preston yes sir he doesnt seem to be a very particular friend of yours no he hates me mike does though i dont know why but i hope you wont be angry with me for losing the shirt no it doesnt seem to be your fault only your misfortune i was afraid you might think i had made up the story and only wanted to get an extra shirt from you no my young friend i have some faith in physiognomy and you have an honest face i dont believe you would deceive me no i wouldnt said paul promptly if you will trust me with another shirt mother will make you an extra one to make up for the one i have lost certainly you shall have the extra shirt but you neednt supply the place of the one lost it is only fair that i should that may be and i am glad you made the offer but the loss is of little importance to me it was no fault of yours that you lost it and you shall not suffer for it you are very kind sir said paul gratefully only just paul mr preston went to the bureau and drew out another shirt which he handed to paul let me suggest my young friend he said that you ride home this time it is late and you might have another encounter with your friend i should like to see him with the shirt on and mr preston laughed heartily at the thought paul decided to follow his patrons advice he had no idea of running any more risk in the matter he accordingly walked to fourth avenue and got on board the car it was nearly eleven oclock when he reached home as it was never his habit to stay out late his mother had become alarmed at his long absence what kept you so late paul she asked ill tell you pretty soon mother heres the shirt that is to serve as a pattern can you cut out the new shirts by it mrs hoffman examined it attentively yes she said there will be no difficulty about that mr preston must be a pretty large man yes he is big enough for an alderman but he is very kind and considerate and i like him you shall judge for yourself when i tell you what happened this evening it will not be necessary to tell pauls adventure over again his mother listened with pardonable indignation against mike donovan and his companion i hope you wont have anything to do with that bad boy paul she said i shant if i can help it said paul i didnt want to speak to him tonight but i couldnt help myself oh i forgot to say when half the shirts are ready i am to take them to mr preston i think i can make one a day there is no need of working so steadily mother you will be well paid you know that is true and for that reason i shall work more cheerfully i wish i could get paid as well for all my work perhaps mr preston will recommend you to his friends and you can get more work that way i wish i could i will mention it to him when i carry back the last half dozen is he going to send the cloth i nearly forgot that too i have an order on barclay co for the necessary amount of cloth i can go up there tomorrow morning and get it that will take you from your work paul well i can close up for a couple of hours i dont think that will be necessary i will go up myself and present the order and get them to send it home for me will they do that it is their custom or if the bundle isnt too large i can bring it home myself in the car thats all right then and now mother as its past eleven oclock i think we may as well both go to bed the next day paul went as usual to his business and mrs hoffman after clearing away the breakfast put on her bonnet and shawl and prepared to go for the materials for the shirts the retail store of barclay co is of great size and ranks among the most important in new york it was not so well filled when mrs hoffman entered as it would be later she was directed to the proper counter where she presented the order signed by mr preston as he was a customer of long standing there was no difficulty about filling the order a bundle was made up which as it contained the materials for twelve shirts necessarily was of considerable size here is your bundle maam said the clerk mrs hoffmans strength was slender and she did not feel able to carry the heavy bundle offered her even if she took the car she would be obliged to carry it a portion of the way and she felt that it would overtask her strength dont you send bundles she asked sometimes said the clerk looking superciliously at the modest attire of the poor widow and mentally deciding that she was not entitled to much consideration had she been richly dressed he would have been very obsequious and insisted on sending home the smallest parcel but there are many who have two rules of conduct one for the rich and quite a different one for the poor and among these was the clerk who was attending upon mrs hoffman then said mrs hoffman i should like to have you send this its a great deal of trouble to send everything said the clerk impertinently this bundle is too heavy for me to carry said the widow deprecatingly i suppose we can send it said the clerk illnaturedly if you insist upon it meanwhile though he had not observed it his employer had approached and heard the last part of the colloquy he was considered by some as a hard man but there was one thing he always required of those in his employ that was to treat all purchasers with uniform courtesy whatever their circumstances are you objecting to sending this ladys bundle said mr barclay sternly the clerk looked up in confusion i told her we would send it he stammered i have heard what passed you have been deficient in politeness if this happens again you leave my employ i will take your address said the clerk in a subdued tone mrs hoffman gave it and left the store thankful for the interference of the great merchant who had given his clerk a lesson which the latter as he valued his situation found it advisable to bear in mind chapter xii the barrel thief while mike donovan was engaged in his contest with paul his companion had quietly walked off with the shirt it mattered very little to him which party conquered as long as he carried off the spoils his conduct in the premises was quite as unsatisfactory to mike as it was to paul when mike found himself in danger of being overpowered he appealed to his companion for assistance and was incensed to see him coolly disregarding the appeal and selfishly appropriating the booty the mane thafe he exclaimed after the fight was over and he was compelled to retreat he let me be bate and wouldnt lift his finger to help me id like to put a head on him i would just at that moment mike felt quite as angry with his friend jerry mcgaverty as with his late opponent the shirts mine fair he said to himself and ill make jerry give it to me but jerry had disappeared and mike didnt know where to look for him in fact he had entered a dark alleyway and taking the shirt from the paper in which it was wrapped proceeded to examine his prize the unusual size struck him by the powers he muttered its big enough for me greatgrandfather and all his children i wouldnt like to pay for the cloth it tuck to make it but ill wear it anyway jerry was not particular as to an exact fit his nether garments were several sizes too large for him and the shirt would complete his costume appropriately he certainly did need a new shirt for the one he had on was the only article of the kind he possessed and was so far gone that its best days if it ever had any appeared to date back to a remote antiquity it had been bought cheap in baxter street its previous history being unknown jerry decided to make the change at once the alley afforded a convenient place for making the transfer he accordingly pulled off the ragged shirt he wore and put on the article he had purloined from paul the sleeves were too long but he turned up the cuffs and the ample body he tucked inside his pants it fits me too much soliloquized jerry as he surveyed himself after the exchange i could let out the half of it and have enough left for meself anyhow its clane and it came chape enough he came out of the alley leaving his old shirt behind him even if it had been worth carrying away jerry saw no use in possessing more than one shirt it was his habit to wear one until it was ready to drop off from him and then get another if he could there is a practical convenience in this arrangement though there are also objections which will readily occur to the reader on the whole though the shirt fitted him too much as he expressed it he regarded himself complacently the superabundant material gave the impression of liberal expenditure and easy circumstances since a large shirt naturally costs more than a small one so jerry as he walked along the bowery assumed a jaunty air precisely such as some of my readers may when they have a new suit to display his new shirt was quite conspicuous since he was encumbered neither with vest nor coat mike feeling sore over his defeat met jerry the next morning on chatham street his quick eye detected the improved state of his friends apparel and his indignation rose as he reflected that jerry had pocketed the profits while the hard knocks had been his jerry he called out jerry did not see fit to heed the call he was sensible that mike had something to complain of and he was in no hurry to meet his reproaches jerry mcgaverty called mike coming near oh its you mike is it answered jerry unable longer to keep up the pretense of not hearing yes its me said mike what made you leave me for last night i didnt want to interfere betwane two gintlemen said jerry with a grin did you mash him mike no said mike sullenly he mashed me why didnt you help me i thought you was bating him so as i had some business to attind to i went away you went away wid the shirt yes i took it by mistake aint it an illigant fit its big enough for two of you maybe ill grow to it in time said jerry and how much are you goin to give me for my share demanded mike say that agin said jerry mike repeated it i thought maybe i didnt hear straight it aint yours at all didnt i take it you wouldnt have got it if i hadnt fit with paul that aint nothin to me said jerry the shirts mine and ill kape it mike felt strongly tempted to put a head on jerry whatever that may mean but as jerry was a head taller already the attempt did not seem quite prudent he indulged in some forcible remarks which however did not disturb jerrys equanimity ill give you my old shirt mike he said if you can find it i left it in an alley near the old bowery i dont want the dirty rag said mike contemptuously finally a compromise was effected jerry offering to help mike on the next occasion and leave the spoils in his hands i have to chronicle another adventure of jerrys in which he was less fortunate than he had been in the present case he was a genuine vagabond and lived by his wits being too lazy to devote himself to any regular street employment as boot blacking or selling newspapers occasionally he did a little work at each of these but regular persistent industry was out of his line he was a drone by inclination and a decided enemy to work on the subject of honesty his principles were far from strict if he could appropriate what did not belong to him he was ready to do so without scruple this propensity had several times brought him into trouble and he had more than once been sent to reside temporarily on blackwells island from which he had returned by no means improved mike was not quite so much of a vagabond as his companion he could work at times though he did not like it and once pursued the vocation of a bootblack for several months with fair success but jerrys companionship was doing him no good and it seemed likely that eventually he would become quite as shiftless as jerry himself jerry having no breakfast strolled down to one of the city markets he frequently found an opportunity of stealing here and was now in search of such a chance he was a dexterous and experienced barrel thief a term which it may be necessary to explain barrels then have a commercial value and coopers will generally pay twentyfive cents for one in good condition this is enough in the eyes of many a young vagabond to pay for the risk incurred in stealing one jerry prowled round the market for some time seeking a good opportunity to walk off with an apple or banana or something eatable but the guardians of the stands seemed unusually vigilant and he was compelled to give up the attempt as involving too great risk jerry was hungry and hunger is an uncomfortable feeling he began to wish he had remained satisfied with his old shirt dirty as it was and carried the new one to some of the baxter street dealers from whom he could perhaps have got fifty cents for it now fifty cents would have paid for a breakfast and a couple of cigars and those just now would have made jerry happy what a fool i was not to think of it he said the old shirt would do me and i could buy a bully breakfast wid the money id get for this just at this moment he espied an empty barrel a barrel apparently quite new and in an unguarded position he resolved to take it but the affair must be managed slyly he lounged up to the barrel and leaned upon it indolently then in apparent unconsciousness he began to turn it gradually changing its position if observed he could easily deny all felonious intentions this he kept up till he got round the corner when glancing around to see if he was observed he quickly lifted it on his shoulder and marched off all this happened without his being observed by the owner of the barrel but a policeman who chanced to be going his rounds had been a witness of jerrys little game he remained quiet till jerrys intentions became evident then walked quietly up and put his hand on his shoulder put down that barrel he said authoritatively jerry had been indulging in visions of the breakfast he would get with the twentyfive cents he expected to obtain for the barrel and the interruption was not an agreeable one but he determined to brazen it out if possible what for will i put it down he said because you have stolen it thats why no said jerry im carrying it round to my boss its his where do you work in fourth street said jerry at random what number no then your boss will have to get some one in your place for you will have to come with me what for i saw you steal the barrel youre a barrel thief and this isnt the first time youve been caught at it carry back the barrel to the place you took it from and then come with me jerry tried to beg off but without avail at that moment mike donovan lounged up when he saw his friend in custody he felt a degree of satisfaction remembering the trick jerry had played on him where are you goin jerry he asked with a grin as he passed him did ye buy that barrel to kape your shirt in jerry scowled but thought it best not to answer lest his unlawful possession of the shirt might also be discovered and lead to a longer sentence hes goin down to the island to show his new shirt thought mike with a grin maybe hell set the fashion there mike was right jerry was sent to the island for two months there introducing mr prestons shirt to company little dreamed of by its original proprietor chapter xiii out of business the next day mrs hoffman commenced work upon mr prestons shirts she worked with much more cheerfulness now that she was sure of obtaining a liberal price for her labor as the shirts were of extra size she found herself unable to finish one in a day as she had formerly done but had no difficulty in making four in a week this however gave her five dollars weekly instead of a dollar and a half as formerly now five dollars may not seem a very large sum to some of my young readers but to mrs hoffman it seemed excellent compensation for a weeks work if i could only earn as much every week she said to paul on saturday evening i should feel quite rich your work will last three weeks mother and perhaps at the end of that time some of mr prestons friends may wish to employ you i hope they will how much do you think i have made continued paul six dollars seven dollars and a half so between us we have earned over twelve dollars i wish i could earn something said little jimmy looking up from his drawing theres time enough for that jimmy you are going to be a great artist one of these days do you really think i shall asked the little boy wistfully i think there is a good chance of it let me see what you are drawing the picture upon which jimmy was at work represented a farmer standing upright in a cart drawn by a sturdy largeframed horse the copy bore a close resemblance to the original even in the most difficult portions the face and expression both in the man and the horse being carefully reproduced this is wonderful jimmy exclaimed paul in real surprise didnt you find it hard to get the mans face just right rather hard said jimmy i had to be careful but i like best the parts where i have to take the most pains i wish i could afford to hire a teacher for you said paul perhaps if mother and i keep on earning so much money we shall be able to some time by the middle of the next week six of the shirts were finished and paul as had been agreed upon carried them up to mr preston he was fortunate enough to find him at home i hope they will suit you said paul i can see that the sewing is excellent said mr preston examining them as to the fit i can tell better after i have tried one on mother made them just like the one you sent but if there is anything wrong she will of course be ready to alter them if they are just like the pattern they will be sure to suit me and now my young friend he added let me know how you are getting on in your own business i am making a dollar a day sometimes a little more that is very good yes sir but it wont last long i believe you told me that the stand belonged to some one else yes sir i am only tending it in his sickness but he is getting better and when he gets about again i shall be thrown out of business but you dont look like one who would remain idle long no sir i shall be certain to find something to do if it is only blacking boots have you ever been in that business ive tried about everything said paul laughing i suppose you wouldnt enjoy bootblacking much no sir but i would rather do that than be earning nothing you are quite right there and i am glad you have no false shame in the matter there are plenty who have for instance a stout broadshouldered young fellow applied to me thus morning for a clerkship he said he had come to the city in search of employment and had nearly expended all his money without finding anything to do i told him i couldnt give him a clerkship but was in want of a porter i offered him the place at two dollars per day he drew back and said he should not be willing to accept a porters place he was very foolish said paul so i thought i told him that if such were his feelings i could not help him perhaps he may regret his refusal when he is reduced to his last penny by the way whenever you have to give up your stand you may come to me and i will see what i can do for you thank you sir and now about these shirts i believe i agreed to pay a dollar and a quarter each yes sir as they are of extra size i think i ought to pay twelve shillings instead of ten my mother thinks herself well paid at ten shillings there must be a great deal of work about one twelve shillings are none too much and mr preston placed nine dollars in pauls hand thank you said paul gratefully my mother will consider herself very lucky when mrs hoffman received from paul a dollar and a half more than she anticipated she felt in unusually good spirits she had regretted the loss of her former poorly paid work but it appeared that her seeming misfortune had only prepared the way for greater prosperity the trouble was that it would not last still it would tide over the dull time and when this job was over she might be able to resume her old employment at any rate while the future seemed uncertain she did not feel like increasing her expenditures on account of her increased earnings but laid carefully away threequarters of her receipts to use hereafter in case of need meanwhile paul continued to take care of george barrys business he had been obliged to renew the stock his large sales having materially reduced it twice a week he went up to see his principal to report sales george barry could not conceal the surprise he felt at pauls success i never thought you would do so well he said you beat me i suppose its because i like it said paul then as i get only half the profits i have to work the harder to make fair wages it is fortunate for my son that he found you to take his place said mrs barry he could not afford to lose all the income from his business it is a good thing for both of us said paul i was looking for a job just when he fell sick what had you been doing before i was in the prizepackage business but that got played out and i was a gentleman at large seeking for a light genteel business that wouldnt require much capital i shall be able to take my place pretty soon now said the young man i might go tomorrow but mother thinks it imprudent better get back your strength first george said his mother or you may fall sick again but her son was impatient of confinement and anxious to get to work again so two days afterward about the middle of the forenoon paul was surprised by seeing george barry get out of a broadway omnibus just in front of the stand can i sell you a necktie mr barry he asked in a joke i almost feel like a stranger said barry its so long since i have been here do you feel strong enough to take charge now asked paul i am not so strong as i was and the walk from our rooms would tire me but i think if i rode both ways for the present i shall be able to get along then you wont need me any longer i would like to have you stay with me today i dont know how i shall hold out all right ill stop george barry remained in attendance the rest of the day he found that his strength had so far returned that he should be able to manage alone hereafter and he told paul so i am glad you are well again george said paul it must have been dull work staying at home sick yes it was dull but i felt more comfortable from knowing that you were taking my place if i get sick again i will send for you i hope you wont get sick but if you do i will do what i can to help you so the two parted on the best of terms each had been of service to the other and neither had cause to complain well said paul to himself i am out of work again what shall i go at next it was six oclock and there was nothing to be done till the morrow he went slowly homeward revolving this subject in his mind he knew that he need not remain idle he could black boots or sell newspapers if nothing better offered and he thought it quite possible that he might adopt the latter business for a few days at least he had not forgotten mr prestons injunction to let him know when he got out of business but as the second half dozen shirts would be ready in three or four days he preferred to wait till then and not make a special call on mr preston he had considerable independence of feeling and didnt like to put himself in the position of one asking a favor though he had no objection to accept one voluntarily offered well mother he said entering his humble home i am out of business has george recovered then yes he was at the stand today but wanted me to stay with him till this evening oh im so sorry said jimmy sorry that george has got well for shame jimmy no i dont mean that paul i am sorry you are out of work i shall find plenty to do jimmy perhaps mr stewart will take me in as senior partner if i ask him i dont think he will said jimmy laughing then perhaps i can get a few scholars in drawing cant you recommend me i am afraid not paul unless you have improved a good deal chapter xiv the diamond ring paul was up betimes the next morning he had made up his mind for a few days at least to sell newspapers and it was necessary in this business to begin the day early he tool a dollar with him and invested a part of it in a stock of dailies he posted himself in printing house square and began to look out for customers being an enterprising boy he was sure to meet with fair success in any business which he undertook so it happened that at ten oclock he had sold out his stock of papers and realized a profit of fifty cents it was getting late for morning papers and there was nothing left to do till the issue of the first edition of the afternoon papers ill go down and see how george barry is getting along thought paul he crossed broadway and soon reached the familiar stand hows business george he inquired fair said barry ive sold four ties how do you feel im not so strong as i was yet i get tired more easily i dont think i shall stay in this business long you dont what will you do then ive got a chance in philadelphia or i shall have by the first of the month what sort of a chance mother got a letter yesterday from a cousin of hers who has a store on chestnut street he offers to take me as a clerk and give me ten dollars a week at first and more after a while thats a good offer i should like to get one like it ill tell you what paul youd better buy out my stand you know how to sell ties and can make money theres only one objection george whats that i havent got any capital it dont need much how much ill sell out all my stock at cost price how much do you think there is about twentyfive dollars worth then there is the frame which is worth say ten dollars making thirtyfive in all that isnt much its more than ive got ill tell you what ill do ill take it and pay you five dollars down and the rest in one month i would take your offer paul but i need all the money how it will be expensive moving to philadelphia and i shall want all i can get i wish i could buy you out said paul thoughtfully cant you borrow the money how soon do you want to give up its the seventeenth now i should like to get rid of it by the twentysecond ill see what i can do just keep it for me till tomorrow all right paul walked home revolving in his mind this unexpected opportunity he had made as george barrys agent a dollar a day though he received only half the profits if he were himself the proprietor and did equally well he could make twelve dollars a week the calculation almost took away his breath twelve dollars a week would make about fifty dollars a month it would enable him to contribute more to the support of the family and save up money besides but the great problem was how to raise the necessary money if paul had been a railroad corporation he might have issued first mortgage bonds at a high rate of interest payable in gold and negotiated them through some leading banker but he was not much versed in financial schemes and therefore was at a loss the only wealthy friend he had was mr preston and he did not like to apply to him till he had exhausted other ways and means what makes you so sober paul asked his mother as he entered the room you are home early yes i sold all my papers and thought i would take an early dinner so as to be on hand in time for the first afternoon papers dont you feel well tiptop but ive had a good offer and im thinking whether i can accept it what sort of an offer george barry wants to sell out his stand how much does he ask thirtyfive dollars is it worth that yes its worth all that and more too if i had it i could make two dollars a day but i havent got thirtyfive dollars i can let you have nine paul i had a little saved up and i havent touched the money mr preston paid me for the shirts ive got five myself but that will only make fourteen wont he wait for the rest no hes going to philadelphia early next week and wants the whole in cash it would be a pity to lose such a good chance said mrs hoffman thats what i think you could soon save up the money on two dollars a day i could pay for it in a month i mean all above the fourteen dollars we have in a day or two i shall have finished the second halfdozen shirts and then i suppose mr preston will pay me nine dollars more i could let you have six dollars of that that would make twenty perhaps george barry will take that if he wont i dont know but i will venture to apply to mr preston he seems to take an interest in you perhaps he would trust you with the money i could offer him a mortgage on the stock said paul if he has occasion to foreclose he will be well provided with neckties said mrs hoffman smiling none of which he could wear ill tell you what mother i should like to pick up a pocketbook in the street containing say twenty or twentyfive dollars that would be very convenient said his mother but i think it will hardly do to depend on such good luck happening to you by the way she said suddenly perhaps i can help you after all dont you remember that gold ring i picked up in central park two years ago the one you advertised yes i advertised or rather your father did but we never found an owner for it i remember it now mother have you got the ring still i will get it mrs hoffman went to her trunk and opening it produced the ring referred to it was a gold ring with a single stone of considerable size i dont know how much it is worth said mrs hoffman but if the ring is a diamond as i think it is it must be worth as much as twenty dollars did you ever price it no paul i have kept it thinking that it would be something to fall back upon if we should ever be hard pressed as long as we were able to get along without suffering i thought i would keep it besides i had another feeling it might belong to some person who prized it very much and the time might come when we could find the owner however that is not likely after so long a time so if you cannot raise the money in any other way you may sell the ring i might pawn it for thirty days mother by that time i should be able to redeem it with the profits of my business i dont think you could get enough from a pawnbroker i can try at any rate but first i will see george barry and find out whether he will take twenty dollars down and the rest at the end of a month paul wrapped up the ring in a piece of paper and deposited it in his vest pocket he waited till after dinner and then went at once to the necktie stand where he made the proposal to george barry the young man shook his head id like to oblige you paul he said but i must have the money i have an offer of thirtytwo dollars cash from another party and i must take up with it if i cant do any better id rather sell out to you but you know i have to consult my own interest of course george i cant complain of that i think you will be able to borrow the money somewhere most of my friends are as poor as myself said paul still i think i shall be able to raise the money only wait for me two days yes paul ill wait that long id like to sell out to you if only because you have helped me when i was sick but for you all that would have been lost time where theres a will theres a way george said paul im bound to buy your stand and i will raise the money somehow paul bought a few papers for he did not like to lose the afternoon trade and in an hour had sold them all off realizing a profit of twenty cents this made his profits for the day seventy cents that isnt as well as i used to do said paul to himself but perhaps i can make something more by and by i will go now and see what i can get for the ring as he had determined he proceeded to a pawnbrokers shop which he had often passed it was on chatham street and was kept by an old man an englishman by birth who though he lived meanly in a room behind his shop was popularly supposed to have accumulated a considerable fortune chapter xv the pawnbrokers shop stuffed behind the counter and on the shelves of the pawnbrokers shop were articles in almost endless variety all was fish that came to his net he was willing to advance on anything that had a marketable value and which promised to yield him i was about to say a fair profit but a fair profit was far from satisfying the old man he demanded an extortionate profit from those whom illfortune drove to his door for relief eliakim henderson for that was his name was a small man with a bald head scattering yellow whiskers and foxlike eyes spiderlike he waited for the flies who flew of their own accord into his clutches and took care not to let them go until he had levied a large tribute when paul entered the shop there were three customers ahead of him one was a young woman whose pale face and sunken cheeks showed that she was waging an unequal conflict with disease she was a seamstress by occupation and had to work fifteen hours a day to earn the little that was barely sufficient to keep body and soul together confined in her close little room on the fourth floor she scarcely dared to snatch time to look out of the window into the street beneath lest she should not be able to complete her allotted task a two days sickness had compelled her to have recourse to eliakim henderson she had under her arm a small bundle covered with an old copy of the sun what have you got there asked the old man roughly show it quick for theres others waiting meekly she unfolded a small shawl somewhat faded from long use what will you give me on that she asked timidly it isnt worth much it cost five dollars then you got cheated it never was worth half the money what do you want on it the seamstress intended to ask a dollar and a half but after this depreciation she did not venture to name so high a figure a dollar and a quarter she said a dollar and a quarter repeated the old man shrilly take it home with you i dont want it what will you give asked the poor girl faintly fifty cents not a penny more fifty cents she repeated in dismay and was about to refold it but the thought of her rent in arrears changed her halfformed intention ill take it sir the money and ticket were handed her and she went back to her miserable atticroom coughing as she went now maam said eliakim his new customer was an irish woman by no means consumptive in appearance red of face and portly of figure and whatll ye be givin me for this she asked displaying a pair of pantaloons are they yours maam asked eliakim with a chuckle its not bridget mccarty that wears the breeches said that lady its me husbands and a dacent respectable man he is barrin the drink which turns his head whatll ye give for em name your price said eliakim whose principle it was to insist upon his customers making the first offer twelve shillins said bridget twelve shillings exclaimed eliakim holding up both hands thats all they cost when they were new they cost every cint of five dollars said bridget they was made at one of the most fashionable shops in the city oh they was an illigant pair when they was new how many years ago was that asked the pawnbroker only six months and they aint been worn moren a month ill give you fifty cents fifty cints repeated mrs mccarty turning to the other customers as if to call their attention to an offer so out of proportion to the valuable article she held in her hand only fifty cints for these illigant breeches oh its you thats a hard man that lives on the poor and the nady you neednt take it i should lose money on it if you didnt redeem it he says hed lose money on it said mrs mccarty and suppose he did isnt he arollin in gold im poor said eliakim almost as poor as you because im too liberal to my customers hear till him said mrs mccarty he says hes liberal and only offers fifty cints for these illigant breeches will you take them or leave them demanded the pawnbroker impatiently you may give me the money said bridget and its i that wonder how you can slape in your bed when you are so hard on poor folks mrs mccarty departed with her money and eliakim fixed his sharp eyes on the next customer it was a tall man shabbily dressed with a thin melancholylooking face and the expression of one who had struggled with the world and failed in the struggle how much for this he asked pointing to the violin and speaking in a slow deliberate tone as if he did not feel at home in the language what do you want for it ten dollar he answered ten dollars youre crazy was the contemptuous comment of the pawnbroker he is a very good violin said the man if you would like to hear him and he made a movement as if to play upon it never mind said eliakim i havent any time to hear it if it were new it would be worth something but its old and but you do not understand interrupted the customer eagerly it is worth much more than new do you see it is by a famous maker i would not sell him but i am poor and my bettina needs bread it hurts me very much to let him go i will buy him back as soon as i can i will give you two dollars but i shall lose on it unless you redeem it two dollar repeated the italian ocielo it is nothing but bettina is at home without bread poor little one will you not give three dollar not a cent more i will take it theres your money and ticket and with these the poor italian departed giving one last lingering glance at his precious violin as eliakim took it roughly and deposited it upon a shelf behind him but he thought of his little daughter at home and the means of relief which he held in his hand and a smile of joy lightened his melancholy features the future might be dark and unpromising but for three days at any rate she should not want bread pauls turn came next what have you got asked the pawnbroker paul showed the ring eliakim took it and his small beadlike eyes sparkled avariciously as he recognized the diamond for his experience was such that he could form a tolerably correct estimate of its value but he quickly suppressed all outward manifestations of interest and said indifferently what do you want for it i want twenty dollars said paul boldly twenty dollars returned the pawnbroker thats a joke no it isnt said paul i want twenty dollars and you cant have the ring for less if you said twenty shillings i might give it to you said eliakim but you must think i am a fool to give twenty dollars thats cheap for a diamond ring said paul its worth a good deal more the pawnbroker eyed paul sharply did the boy know that it was a diamond ring what chance was there of deceiving him as to its value the old man whose business made him a good judge decided that the ring was not worth less than two hundred and fifty dollars and if he could get it into his possession for a trifle it would be a paying operation youre mistaken boy he said its not a diamond what is it a very good imitation how much is it worth ill give you three dollars that wont do i want to raise twenty dollars and if i cant get that ill keep the ring the pawnbroker saw that he had made a mistake paul was not as much in need of money as the majority of his customers he would rather pay twenty dollars than lose the bargain though it went against the grain to pay so much money but after pronouncing the stone an imitation how could he rise much above the offer he had already made he resolved to approach it gradually surveying it more closely he said it is an excellent imitation i will give you five dollars paul was not without natural shrewdness and this sudden advance convinced him that it was after all a real stone he determined to get twenty dollars or carry the ring home five dollars wont do me any good he said give me back the ring five dollars is a good deal of money said eliakim id rather have the ring what is your lowest price twenty dollars ill give you eight just now you said it was worth only three said paul sharply it is very fine gold it is better than i thought here is the money youre a little too fast said paul coolly i havent agreed to part with the ring for eight dollars and i dont mean to twenty dollars is my lowest price ill give you ten said the old man whose eagerness increased with pauls indifference no you wont give me back the ring i might give eleven but i should lose money i dont want you to lose money and ive concluded to keep the ring said paul rightly inferring from the old mans eagerness that the ring was much more valuable than he had at first supposed but the old pawnbroker was fascinated by the sparkling bauble he could not make up his mind to give it up by fair means or foul he must possess it he advanced his bid to twelve fourteen fifteen dollars but paul shook his head resolutely he had made up his mind to carry it to ball blacks or some other firstclass jewelers and ascertain whether it was a real diamond or not and if so to obtain an estimate of its value ive changed my mind he said ill keep the ring just give it back to me chapter xvi the jewelers price but to give it back was not eliakims intention should he buy it at twenty dollars he would make at least two hundred and such bargains were not to be had every day he decided to give paul his price i will give you twenty dollars he said but it is more than the ring is worth i have concluded not to take twenty dollars said paul you may give it back you agreed to take twenty dollars said eliakim angrily that was when i first came in you said you wouldnt give it i have changed my mind so have i said paul you had a chance to get it but now its too late eliakim was deeply disappointed generally he had his own way with his customers who being in urgent need of money were obliged to accept such terms as he chose to offer but now the tables were turned and paul proved more than a match for him he resolved to attempt intimidation boy where did you get this ring he asked in a significant tone honestly said paul thats all you need to know i dont believe it said the old man harshly i believe you stole it you may believe what you like but you must give it back to me said paul coolly ive a great mind to call a policeman said eliakim if you did said paul id tell him that you were anxious to get the ring though you believed it to be stolen perhaps he might have something to say to you eliakim perceived the force of pauls argument for in law the receiver of stolen goods is as bad as the thief and there had been occasions when the pawnbroker had narrowly escaped punishment for thus indirectly conniving at theft if you say you got it honestly ill buy it of you he said changing his tune what will you take i dont care about selling today answered paul ill give you twentyfive dollars i cant sell without consulting my mother it belongs to her reluctantly eliakim gave back the ring finding his wiles of no effect bring your mother round tomorrow he said ill give you a better price than you will get anywhere else all right said paul ill tell her what you say the old pawnbroker followed paul with wistful glances vainly wishing that he had not at first depreciated the ring to such an extent that his subsequent advances had evidently excited his customers suspicion that it was more valuable than be supposed he felt that he had lost it through not understanding the character of the boy with whom he had to deal well paul what news of the ring asked mrs hoffman as he reentered the room i was offered twentyfive dollars for it said paul did you sell it no mother why not asked jimmy twentyfive dollars is a lot of money i know it said paul but the ring is worth a great deal more what makes you think so paul because the offer was made by a pawnbroker who never pays quarter what an article is worth i am sure the ring is worth a hundred dollars yes i am sure it is worth all that a hundred dollars repeated jimmy awestruck at the magnitude of the sum what shall we do about it paul asked his mother a hundred dollars will do us more good than the ring i know that mother what i propose is to carry it to ball blacks or tiffanys and sell it for whatever they say it is worth they are firstclass houses and we can depend upon fair treatment your advice is good paul i think we will follow it when will you go i will go at once i have nothing else to do and i would like to find out as soon as i can how much it will bring old henderson wanted me to think at first that it was only imitation and offered me twenty shillings on it hes an old cheat when he found that i wasnt to be humbugged he raised his offer by degrees to twentyfive dollars that was what made me suspect its value if you get a hundred dollars paul said jimmy you can buy out the stand that depends on whether mother will lend me the money said paul you know its hers she may not be willing to lend without security i am so unaccustomed to being a capitalist said mrs hoffman smiling that i shant know how to sustain the character i dont think i shall be afraid to trust you paul once more with the ring carefully wrapped in a paper and deposited in his pocketbook paul started uptown tiffany whose fame as a jeweler is worldwide was located on broadway he had not yet removed to his present magnificent store on union square paul knew the store but had never entered it now as he entered he was struck with astonishment at the sight of the immense and costly stock unrivaled by any similar establishment not only in the united states but in europe our hero walked up to the counter and stood beside a richlydressed lady who was bargaining for a costly bracelet he had to wait ten minutes while the lady was making her choice from a number submitted to her for inspection finally she selected one and paid for it the clerk now being at leisure turned to our hero and asked well young man what can i do for you i have a ring which i should like to show you i want to know how much it is worth very well let me see it when paul produced the diamond ring the clerk who had long been in the business and perceived its value at once started in surprise this is a very valuable ring he said so i thought said paul how much is it worth do you mean how much should we ask for it no how much would you give for it probably two hundred and fifty dollars paul was quite startled on finding the ring so much more valuable than he had supposed he had thought it might possibly be worth a hundred dollars but he had not imagined any rings were worth as much as the sum named will you buy it of me he asked the clerk regarded paul attentively and as he thought a little suspiciously does the ring belong to you he asked no to my mother where did she buy it she didnt buy it at all she found it one day at central park it belongs to her now she advertised for an owner and examined the papers to see if it was advertised as lost but could hear nothing of the one to whom it belonged how long ago was this two years ago i will show this ring to mr tiffany said the clerk very well paul took a seat and waited soon mr tiffany came up are you the boy who brought in the ring he asked yes sir you say your mother found it two years ago in central park yes sir it is a valuable ring i should be willing to buy it for two hundred and fifty dollars if i were quite certain that you had a right to dispose of it i have told you the truth mr tiffany said paul a little nettled at having his word doubted that may be but there is still a possibility that the original owner may turn up wont you buy it then asked paul disappointed for if he were unable to dispose of the ring he would have to look elsewhere for the means of buying out barrys street stand i dont say that but i should want a guaranty of indemnity against loss in case the person who lost it should present a claim in that case said paul i would give you back the money you paid me mr tiffany smiled but suppose the money were all spent he suggested i suppose you are intending to use the money i am going to start in business with it said paul and i hope to add to it every one thinks so who goes into business but some get disappointed you see my young friend that i should incur a risk remember i dont know you i judge from your appearance that you are honest but appearances are sometimes deceitful then i suppose you wont buy it said paul who saw the force of this remark if you can bring here any responsible gentleman who knows you and is willing to guarantee me against loss in the event of the owners being found i will buy the ring for two hundred and fifty dollars paul brightened up he thought at once of mr preston and from the friendly interest which that gentleman appeared to take in him he judged that he would not refuse him this service i think i can do that he said do you know mr andrew preston he is a wealthy gentleman who lives on madison avenue between thirtyfourth and thirtyfifth streets not personally i know him by reputation will he be satisfactory entirely so he knows me well said paul i think he will be willing to stand security for me i will come back in a day or two paul took the ring and left the store he determined to call that evening on mr preston and ask the favor indicated chapter xvii mr felix montgomery paul had an errand farther uptown and on leaving tiffanys walked up as far as twentythird street feeling rather tired he got on board a university place car to return they had accomplished perhaps half the distance when to his surprise george barry entered the car how do you happen to be here at this time barry he asked i thought you were attending to business i closed up for a couple of hours having an errand at home where have you been to tiffanys what the jewelers yes to buy a diamond ring i suppose said barry jocosely no not to buy but to sell one you are joking said his companion incredulously no i am not the ring belongs to my mother i am trying to raise money enough on it to buy you out i didnt know your mother was rich enough to indulge in such expensive jewelry she isnt and thats the reason i am trying to sell it i mean i didnt think she was ever rich enough ill explain it said paul the ring was found some time since in central park as no owner has ever appeared though we advertised it we consider that it belongs to us how much is it worth mr tiffany offered two hundred and fifty dollars for it barry uttered an exclamation of surprise well that is what i call luck of course you accepted it i intend to do so but i must bring some gentleman who will guarantee that i am all right and have the right to sell it can you do that i think so i am going to ask mr preston i think he will do me that favor then theres a fair chance of your buying me out yes i guess i can settle the whole thing up tomorrow have you got the ring with you yes i should like to see it if you have no objection paul drew it from his pocket and passed it over to barry its a handsome one but who would think such a little thing could be worth two hundred and fifty dollars id rather have the money than the ring so would i on the right of paul sat a man of about forty welldressed and respectable in appearance with a heavy gold chain ostentatiously depending from his watch pocket and with the air of a substantial citizen he listened to the conversation between barry and paul with evident interest and when barry had returned the ring he said young gentleman would you be kind enough to let me look at your ring i am myself in business as a jeweler in syracuse and so feel an interest in examining it certainly sir said paul the strangers explanation of his motives inspiring him with perfect confidence the jeweler from syracuse took the ring in his hands and appeared to examine it carefully this is a handsome ring he said and one of great value how much were you offered for it at tiffanys two hundred and fifty dollars it is worth more yes i suppose so said paul but he has to sell it and make a profit he could do that and yet make a profit i will pay you two hundred and seventyfive dollars myself that is on one condition i dont object to getting twentyfive dollars more said paul what is the condition i have an order from a gentleman for a diamond ring for a young lady an engagement ring in short if this suits him as i think it will i will pay you what i said i can easily get three hundred and twentyfive from him how are you going to find out whether it will suit him easily he is stopping at the same hotel with me what hotel is that lovejoys if you can spare the time and will come with me now we can arrange matters at once by the way you can refer me to some responsible citizen who will guarantee you not of course that i have any doubts but we business men are forced to be cautious paul mentioned mr prestons name quite satisfactory answered the jeweler i know mr preston personally and as i am pressed for time i will accept his name without calling upon him what is your name paul hoffman i will note it down the gentleman from syracuse drew out a memorandum book in which he entered pauls name when you see mr preston just mention my name felix montgomery i will do so say if you please that i would have called upon him but coming to the city strictly on business was too hurried to do so this also paul promised and counted himself fortunate in falling in with a friend or at all events acquaintance of mr preston since he was likely to make twentyfive dollars more than he would otherwise have done when he got out of the car at the astor house the stranger said it will be half an hour before i can reach lovejoys as i have a business call to make first can you call there say in threequarters of an hour yes sir very well then i will expect you inquire for me at the desk and ask the servant to conduct you to my room you remember my name yes sir mr felix montgomery quite right goodby then till we meet mr felix montgomery went into the astor house and remained about five minutes he then came out on the steps and looking about him to see if paul was anywhere near descended the steps and walked across to lovejoys hotel going up to the desk he inquired can you accommodate me with a room yes sir please enter your name the stranger entered his name with a flourish as felix montgomery syracuse room no said the clerk will you go up now yes i think so any luggage my trunk will be brought from the st nicholas in the course of the afternoon we require payment in advance where there is no luggage very well i will pay for one day i am not sure but i shall get through my business in time to go away tomorrow here the servant appeared to conduct mr montgomery to his room by the way he said turning back as if it were an afterthought i directed a boy to call here for me in about half an hour when he comes you may send him up to my room very well sir mr montgomery followed the servant upstairs to room no it was rather high up but he seemed well pleased that this was the case hope you wont get tired of climbing sir said the servant no ive got pretty good wind most gentlemen complain of going up so far it makes little difference to me at length they reached the room and mr montgomery entered this will answer very well he said with a hasty glance about him when my trunk comes i want it sent up yes sir i believe that is all you can go the servant retired and mr felix montgomery sat down upon the bed my little plot seems likely to succeed he said to himself ive been out of luck lately but this boys ring will give me a lift he cant suspect anything hell be sure to come probably the reader has already suspected that mr felix montgomery was not a jeweler from syracuse nor had he any claim to the name under which he at present figured he was a noted confidence man who lived by preying upon the community his appearance was in his favor and it was his practice to assume the dress and air of a respectable middleaged citizen as in the present instance the sight of the diamond ring had excited his cupidity and he had instantly formed the design of getting possession of it if possible thus far his plan promised success meanwhile paul loitered away the time in the city hall park for half an hour or more he did not care to go home until his negotiation was complete and he could report the ring sold and carry home the money wont mother be astonished he thought at the price i got for the ring im in luck this morning when the stipulated time had passed paul rose from the bench on which he was seated and walked to lovejoys hotel not far distant has mr felix montgomery a room here he asked yes answered the clerk did you wish to see him yes sir he mentioned that a boy would call by appointment here james show this boy up to no mr montgomerys room a hotel servant appeared and paul followed him up several flights of stairs till they stood before no this is the room sir said james wait a minute and ill knock in answer to the knock mr montgomery himself opened the door come in he said to paul i was expecting you so paul not suspecting treachery entered no chapter xviii a clever thief take a seat said mr montgomery my friend will be in directly meanwhile will you let me look at the ring once more paul took it from his pocket and handed it to the jeweler from syracuse as he supposed him to be mr montgomery took it to the window and appeared to be examining it carefully he stood with his back to paul but this did not excite suspicion on the part of our hero i am quite sure he said still standing with his back to paul that this will please my friend from the instructions he gave me it is precisely what he wanted while uttering these words he had drawn a sponge and a vial of chloroform from his side pocket he saturated the former from the vial and then turning quickly seized paul too much taken by surprise to make immediate resistance and applied the sponge to his nose when he realized that foul play was meditated he began to struggle but he was in a firm grasp and the chloroform was already beginning to do its work his head began to swim and he was speedily in a state of insensibility when this was accomplished mr felix montgomery eyeing the insensible boy with satisfaction put on his hat walked quickly to the door which he locked on the outside and made his way rapidly downstairs leaving the key at the desk he left the hotel and disappeared meanwhile paul slowly recovered consciousness as he came to himself he looked about him bewildered not at first comprehending where he was all at once it flashed upon him and he jumped up eagerly and rushed to the door he tried in vain to open it i am regularly trapped he thought with a feeling of mingled anger and vexation what a fool i was to let myself be swindled so easily i wonder how long i have been lying here insensible paul was not a boy to give up easily he meant to get back the ring if it was a possible thing the first thing was of course to get out of his present confinement he was not used to hotel arrangements and never thought of the bell but as the only thing he could think of began to pound upon the door but it so happened that at this time there were no servants on that floor and his appeals for help were not heard every moment that he had to wait seemed at least five for no doubt the man who had swindled him was improving the time to escape to a place of safety finding that his blows upon the door produced no effect he began to jump up and down upon the floor making in his heavy boots a considerable noise the room directly under no was occupied by an old gentleman of a very nervous and irascible temper mr samuel piper a country merchant who having occasion to be in the city on business for a few days had put up at lovejoys hotel he had fatigued himself by some business calls and was now taking a little rest upon the bed when he was aroused from halfsleep by the pounding overhead i wish people would have the decency to keep quiet he said to himself peevishly how can i rest with such a confounded racket going on above he lay back thinking the noise would cease but paul finding the knocking on the door ineffectual began to jump up and down as i have already said of course this noise was heard distinctly in the room below this is getting intolerable exclaimed mr piper becoming more and more excited the man ought to be indicted as a common nuisance how they can allow such goingson in a respectable hotel i cant understand i should think the fellow was splitting wood upstairs he took his cane and standing on the bed struck it furiously against the ceiling intending it as signal to the man above to desist but paul catching the response began to jump more furiously than ever finding that he had attracted attention mr piper became enraged the man must be a lunatic or overcome by drink he exclaimed i cant and i wont stand it but the noise kept on mr piper put on his shoes and his coat and seizing his cane emerged upon the landing he espied a female servant just coming upstairs here you bridget or nancy or whatever your name is he roared theres a lunatic upstairs making a tremendous row in the room over mine if you dont stop him ill leave the hotel hear him now bridget let fall her duster in fright is it a crazy man she asked of course he must be i want you to go up and stop him is it me that would go near a crazy man exclaimed bridget horrorstruck i wouldnt do it for a million dollars no i wouldnt i insist upon your going up said mr piper irritably he must be stopped do you think i am going to stand such an infernal thumping over my head i wouldnt do it if youd go down on your knees to me said bridget fervently come along ill go with you but the terrified girl would not budge then you go down and tell your master theres a madman up here if you dont i will this bridget consented to do and going downstairs gave a not very coherent account of the disturbance three male servants came back with her is that the man asked the first pointing to mr piper who certainly looked half wild with irritation yes said bridget stupidly immediately mr piper found himself pinioned on either side by a stout servant what have you been kickin up a row for demanded the first let me alone or ill have the law take care of you screamed the outraged man cant you hear the fellow thats making the racket paul tired with thumping had desisted for a moment but now had recommenced with increased energy the sounds could be distinctly heard on the floor below excuse me sir i made a mistake said the first speaker releasing his hold well go up and see whats the matter so the party went upstairs followed at a distance by bridget who influenced alike by fear and curiosity did not know whether to go up or retreat the sounds were easily traced to room no in front of this therefore the party congregated whats the matter in there asked james the first servant putting his lips to the keyhole yes chimed in mr piper irritably what do you mean by such an infernal hubbub open the door and let me out returned paul eagerly the party looked at each other in surprise they did not expect to find the desperate maniac a boy perhaps theres more than one of them suggested the second servant prudently why dont you come out yourself asked james i am locked in the door was opened with a passkey and paul confronted the party now young man what do you mean by making such a disturbance demanded mr piper excitably my room is just below and i expected every minute you would come through i am sorry if i disturbed you sir said paul politely but it was the only way i could attract attention how came you locked up here yes chimed in james suspiciously how came you locked up here i was drugged with chloroform and locked in said paul who did it mr felix montgomery or thats what he called himself i came here by appointment to meet him what did he do that for he has carried off a diamond ring which i came up here to sell him a very improbable story said mr piper suspiciously what should such a boy have to do with a diamond ring nothing is easier than to impart suspicion men are prone to believe evil of each other and paul was destined to realize this the hotel servants ignorant and suspicious caught the suggestion its likely hes a thafe said bridget from a safe distance if i were said paul coolly i shouldnt be apt to call your attention by such a noise i can prove to you that i am telling the truth i stopped at the office and the bookkeeper sent a servant to show me up here if this is true said mr piper why when you found yourself locked in didnt you ring the bell instead of making such a confounded racket my nerves wont get over it for a week i didnt think of the bell said paul i am not much used to hotels what will we do with him asked james looking to mr piper for counsel youd better take him downstairs and see if his story is correct said the nervous gentleman with returning good sense ill do it said james to whom the very obvious suggestion seemed marked by extraordinary wisdom and he grasped paul roughly by the arm you neednt hold me said our hero shaking off the grasp i havent any intention of running away i want to find out if i can what has become of the man that swindled me james looked doubtfully at mr piper i dont think he means to run away said that gentleman i begin to think his story is correct and hark you my young friend if you ever get locked up in a hotel room again just see if there is a bell before you make such a confounded racket yes sir i will said paul halfsmiling but ill take care not to get locked up again it wont be easy for anybody to play that trick on me again the party filed downstairs to the office and paul told his story to the bookkeeper have you seen mr montgomery go out asked our hero yes he went out half an hour ago or perhaps more he left his key at the desk but said nothing he seemed to be in a hurry you didnt notice in what direction he went no of course no attempt was made to detain paul there could be no case against him he went out of the hotel and looked up and down broadway in a state of indecision he did not mean to sit down passively and submit to the swindle but he had no idea in what direction to search for mr felix montgomery chapter xix paul deliberates paul stood in the street irresolute he looked hopelessly up and down broadway but of course the jeweler from syracuse was not to be seen seeking for him in a city containing hundreds of streets and millions of inhabitants was about as discouraging as hunting for a needle in a haystack but difficult as it was paul was by no means ready to give up the search indeed besides the regret he felt at the loss he was mortified at having been so easily outwitted hes taken me in just as if i was a country boy thought paul i dare say hes laughing at me now id like to get even with him finally he decided to go to tiffanys and ask them to detain any one who might bring in the ring and offer it for sale he at once acted upon this thought and hailing a broadway stage for no time was to be lost soon reached his destination entering the store he walked up to the counter and addressed the clerk to whom he had before shown the ring do you remember my offering you a diamond ring for sale this morning he asked yes i remember it very well have you got it with you no it has been stolen from me indeed how was that asked the clerk with interest i met in the cars a welldressed man who called himself a jeweler from syracuse he examined the ring and offered me more than mr tiffany but asked me to bring it to him at lovejoys hotel when i got there he drugged me with chloroform and when i recovered he was gone you have been unlucky there are plenty of such swindlers about you should have been careful about displaying the ring before strangers i was showing it to a friend have you notified the police not yet i came here to let you know because i thought the thief might bring it in here to sell very likely give me a description of him paul described mr felix montgomery to the best of his ability i think i should know him from your description i will speak to mr tiffany and he will no doubt give orders to detain any person who may offer the ring for sale thank you if you will give me your address we will notify you in case the ring is brought in paul left his address and went out of the store feeling that he had taken one step toward the recovery of his treasure he next visited the police headquarters and left a detailed description of the man who had relieved him of the ring and of the circumstances attending the robbery then he went home his mother looked up as he entered well paul she said inquiringly ive got bad news mother he said what is it tell me quick she said nervously the ring has been stolen from me how did it happen paul first i must tell you how much the ring is worth i went up to tiffanys and showed the ring to mr tiffany himself he told me that he would give me two hundred and fifty dollars for it if i would satisfy him that i had a right to sell it two hundred and fifty dollars repeated mrs hoffman in amazement yes the diamond is very large and pure two hundred and fifty dollars would be a great help to us yes mother that is what makes me feel so bad about being swindled out of it tell me how it happened is there no chance of recovering it a little i shall do what i can i have already notified the police and mr tiffany you have not told me yet how you lost it when paul had told the story his mother asked did you mention it in the cars that you had offered it at tiffanys yes and i mentioned his offer perhaps the thief would be cautious about going there for that very reason he might think the ring would be recognized he would go to a large place thinking that so valuable a ring would be more readily purchased there he might go to ball blacks that is true it would be well to give notice there also i will go up there at once i only wish i could meet mr felix montgomery i dont think he would find it so easy to outreach me a second time take some dinner first paul then i must hurry it down mother i dont want to run the risk of getting too late to ball blacks i cant help thinking what a splendid thing it would be if we had the two hundred and fifty dollars i would buy out barrys stand and i would get a sewingmachine for you and we could live much more comfortably it makes me mad to think i let that villain take me in so he must think me jolly green anybody might have been deceived paul you mustnt blame yourself too much for that leaving paul on his way to ball blacks we return to mr felix montgomery as we shall continue to call him though he had no right to the name after stupefying paul as already described he made his way downstairs and leaving his key at the desk went out i hope my young friend will enjoy himself upstairs he chuckled to himself hes quite welcome to the use of the room till tomorrow morning its paid for in advance and i dont think i shall find it convenient to stop there he took the ring from his vest pocket and glanced at it furtively its a beauty he murmured complacently i never saw a handsomer ring of the size what was it the boy said he was offered for it two hundred and fifty dollars thatll give me a lift and it doesnt come any too soon my money is pretty low he walked across the city hall park and at barclay street entered a university place car evenin paper mister said a ragged newsboy whose garments were constructed on the most approved system of ventilation what have you got evenin post mail express give me an express heres ten cents i havent got but three cents change mister never mind the change said mr montgomery in a fit of temporary generosity occasioned by his good luck thank you sir said the newsboy regarding mr montgomery as a philanthropist worthy of his veneration felix montgomery leaned back in his seat and with a benevolent smile ran his eyes over the columns of the express among the paragraphs which attracted his attention was one relating to a comrade of similar profession who had just been arrested in albany while in the act of relieving a gentleman of his pocketbook jerry always was a bungler said mr montgomery complacently to himself he cant hold a candle to me i flatter myself that i know how to manage a little affair like this for instance as well as the next man itll take a sharp detective to lay hold of me it might have been thought that the manner in which he had gained possession of the ring would have troubled mr montgomery but it was many years since he had led an honest life he had made a living by overreaching others and his conscience had become so blunted as to occasion him little trouble he appeared to think that the world owed him a living and that he was quite justified in collecting the debt in any way he could about twenty minutes brought the car to amity street and mr montgomery signaled the conductor and the car being stopped he got out he walked a few rods in a westerly direction and paused before a threestory brick house which appeared to have seen better days it was now used as a boarding or rather lodginghouse the guests were not of a very high character the landlady not being particular as long as her rent was paid regularly mr montgomery ascended the steps in a jaunty way and opening the door with a passkey ascended the front staircase he paused before a room on the third floor and knocked in a peculiar manner the door was opened by a tall woman in rather neglected attire so youre back she said yes my dear home again as the poet says there is no place like home i should hope there wasnt said mrs montgomery looking about her disdainfully a very delightful home it makes with such a charming prospect of the back yard ive been moping here all day youve found something to console you i see said her husband glancing at the table on which might be seen a bottle of brandy halfemptied and a glass yes said mrs montgomery i felt so bad i had to send out for something it took every cent i had and by the way mrs flagg sent in her bill this morning for the last two weeks board she said she must have it my dear said mr montgomery she shall have it you dont mean to say youve got the money tony exclaimed his wife in surprise no i havent got the money but ive got whats just as good what have you got what do you say to this and mr montgomery drew from his pocket the diamond ring whose loss was so deeply felt by our hero is that genuine asked the lady its the real thing what a beauty where did you get it it was kindly presented me by a young man of the tender age of fifteen or thereabouts who had no further use for it you did him out of it that is tell me how you did it mr montgomery told the story his wife listened with interest and appreciation that was a smart operation tony she said i should say it was maria how much is the ring worth two hundred and fifty dollars can you get that for it i can get that for it tony you are a treasure have you just found that out my dear chapter xx the thief in disguise it will be inferred from the preceding conversation that mrs montgomery was not likely to be shocked by the lack of honesty in her husband her conscience was as elastic as his and she was perfectly willing to help him spend his unlawful gains how soon are you going to sell the ring she asked i should like to dispose of it at once maria you will need to mrs flagg wants her bill paid at once i quite understand the necessity of promptness my dear only you know one has to be cautious about disposing of articles obtained in this way you say you left the boy locked up it seems to me youd better sell the ring before he has a chance to get out and interfere i dont know but youre right my dear well well get ready do you want me to go with you yes it will disarm suspicion if you are with me i think ill go as a country parson country parsons are not apt to have diamond rings to dispose of very true my dear the remark does credit to your good judgment and penetration but i know how to get over that as how be a little more particular about your speech my dear remember you are a ministers wife and must use refined expressions what is easier than to say that the ring was given me by a benevolent lady of my congregation to dispose of for the benefit of the poor well thought of tony youve got a good headpiece youre right my dear i dont like to indulge in selfpraise but i believe i know a thing or two and now for the masquerade where are the duds in the black trunk then wed better lose no time in putting them on without describing the process of transformation in detail it will be sufficient to say that the next twenty minutes wrought a decided change in the appearance of mr and mrs felix montgomery the former was arrayed in a suit of canonical black not of the latest cut a white neckcloth was substituted for the more gaudy article worn by the jeweler from syracuse and a pair of silverbowed spectacles composed of plain glass lent a scholarly air to his face his hair was combed behind his ears and so far as appearance went he quite looked the character of a clergyman from the rural districts how will i do my dear he asked complacently tiptop answered the lady how do i look mrs montgomery had put on a dress of sober tint and scant circumference contrasting in a marked manner with the mode then prevailing a very plain collar encircled her neck her hands were incased in brown silk gloves while her husband wore black kids her bonnet was exceedingly plain and her whole costume was almost quakerlike in its simplicity her husband surveyed her with satisfaction my dear he said you are a fitting helpmeet for the rev mr barnes of hayfield centre by jove you do me credit by jove is not a proper expression for a man of your profession mr barnes said the new ministers wife with a smile you are right my dear i must eschew profanity and cultivate a decorous style of speech well are we ready i am then let us set forth on our pilgrimage we will imagine mrs barnes that we are about to make some pastoral calls they emerged into the street on the way downstairs they met mrs flagg the landlady who bowed respectfully she was somewhat puzzled however not knowing when they were let in goodmorning madam said mr barnes are you the landlady of this establishment yes sir i have been calling on one of your lodgers mr anthony blodgett this was the name by which mr felix montgomery was known in the house he is a very worthy man now to tell the truth mrs flagg had not been particularly struck by the moral worth of her lodger and this testimony led her to entertain doubts as to the discernment of her clerical visitor you know him then i know him as myself madam have you never heard him mention the name of rev mr barnes of hayfield centre connecticut i cant say i have answered the landlady that is singular we were always very intimate we attended the same school as boys and in fact were like damon and pythias mrs flagg had never heard of damon and pythias still she understood the comparison youre in rather a different line now she remarked dryly yes our positions are different my friend dwells in the busy metropolis while i pass a quiet peaceful existence in a secluded country village doing what good i can but my dear we are perhaps detaining this worthy lady from her domestic avocations i think we must be going very well i am ready the first sound of her voice drew the attention of the landlady mrs felix montgomery possessed a thin somewhat shrill voice which she was unable to conceal and looking attentively at her mrs flagg penetrated her disguise then turning quickly to the gentleman aided by her new discovery she also recognized him well i declare said she if you didnt take me in beautifully mr montgomery laughed heartily you wouldnt know me then he said youre got up excellent said mrs flagg with a slight disregard for grammar is it a joke yes a little practical joke were going to call on some friends and see if they know us youd do for the theatre said the landlady admiringly i flatter myself i might have done something on the stage if my attention had been turned that way but my dear we must be moving or we shant get through our calls i wonder what mischief they are up to now thought mrs flagg as she followed them to the door i know better than to think theyd take the trouble to dress up that way just to take in their friends no theyre up to some game not that i care as long as they get money enough to pay my bill so the worldlywise landlady dismissed them from her thoughts and went about her work mr barnes and his wife walked up toward broadway at a slow decorous pace suited to the character they had assumed more than one who met them turned back to look at what they considered a perfect type of the country minister and his wife they would have been not a little surprised to learn that under this quiet garb walked two of the most accomplished swindlers in a city abounding in adventurers of all kinds mr barnes paused a moment to reprove a couple of urchins who were pitching pennies on the sidewalk dont you know that its wrong to pitch pennies he said gravely none of your chaff mister retorted one of the street boys irreverently when did you come from the country old goggles my son you should address me with more respect just get out of the way mister i dont want to hear no preachin i am afraid you have been badly brought up my son i aint your son and i wouldnt be for a shillin just you go along and let me alone a sad case of depravity my dear remarked mr barnes to his wife i fear we must leave these boys to their evil ways youd better said one of the boys theyre smart little rascals said mr montgomery when they were out of hearing of the boys i took them in though they thought i was the genuine article wed better not waste any more time said his wife that boy might get out you know and give us trouble i dont believe he will get out in a hurry i locked the door and hed have to pound some time before he could make any one hear i declare i should like to see how he looked when he recovered from his stupor and realized that his ring was gone what sort of boy was he tony better not call me by that name my dear it might be heard you know and might not be considered in character as to your question he was by no means a stupid boy rather sharpish i should say then how came he to let you take him in as to that i claim to be rather sharp myself and quite a match even for a smart boy i havent knocked about the world fortyfour years for nothing they were now in broadway turning the corner of amity street they walked a short distance downtown and paused before the handsome jewelry store of ball black i think we had better go in here said felix montgomery i hesitate a little by which of his numerous names to call him why not go to tiffanys i gather from what the boy told me that the ring has already been offered there it would be very likely to be recognized and that would be awkward you know are you sure the ring has not been offered here asked his wife quite sure the boy would have mentioned it had such been the case very well let us go in then the rev mr barnes and his wife of hayfield centre entered the elegant store and ten minutes later paul hoffman entered also and took his station at the counters wholly unconscious of the near proximity of the man who had so artfully swindled him chapter xxi paul is checkmated on entering the large jewelry store mr montgomery and his wife walked to the rear of the store and advanced to the counter behind which stood a clerk unengaged what shall i show you he inquired i didnt come to purchase said mr montgomery with suavity but to sell i suppose you purchase jewelry at times sometimes said the clerk let me see what you have first said the adventurer let me introduce myself i am the rev mr barnes of hayfield centre connecticut you perhaps know the place i dont think i remember it said the clerk respectfully it is a small place said mr montgomery modestly but my tastes are plain and unobtrusive and i do not aspire to a more conspicuous post however that is not to the purpose a lady parishioner desiring to donate a portion of her wealth to the poor has placed in my hand a diamond ring the proceeds to be devoted to charitable objects i desire to sell it and knowing the high reputation of your firm feel safe in offering it to you i know very little of the value of such things since they are not in my line but i am sure of fair treatment at your hands you may depend upon that said the clerk favorably impressed with the appearance and manners of his customer allow me to see the ring the brilliant was handed over the counter it is quite valuable said he scrutinizing it closely so i supposed as the lady is possessed of wealth you may rely upon its being genuine i am not authorized to purchase said the clerk but i will show it to one of the firm just at that moment mr montgomery chancing to look toward the door was startled by seeing the entrance of paul hoffman he saw that it would be dangerous to carry the negotiation any farther and he quickly gave a secret signal to his wife the hint was instantly understood and acted upon mrs montgomery uttered a slight cry and clung to her husbands arm my dear she said i feel one of my attacks coming on take me out quickly my wife is suddenly taken sick said mr montgomery hurriedly she is subject to fits if you will give me the ring i will return tomorrow and negotiate for its sale i am very sorry said the clerk with sympathy handing back the ring can i get anything for the lady no thank you the best thing to do is to get her into the open air thank you for your kindness let me help you said the clerk and coming from behind the counter he took one arm of mrs montgomery who leaning heavily on her husband and the clerk walked or rather was carried to the street door of course the attention of all within the store was drawn to the party what was the matter inquired a fellowclerk as the salesman returned it was a clergyman from connecticut who wished to sell a diamond ring given to him for charitable purposes his wife was taken suddenly sick he will bring it back tomorrow was the ring a valuable one it must be worth in the neighborhood of three hundred dollars paul listened to this explanation and a sudden light flashed upon him as he heard the estimated value of the ring there had been something familiar in the appearance of the adventurer though on account of his successful disguise and his being accompanied by a lady he had not before felt any suspicion as to his identity with the man who had swindled him now he felt convinced that it was mr felix montgomery and that it was his own appearance which had led to the sudden sickness and the precipitate departure that trick wont work mr montgomery he said to himself ive got on your track sooner than i anticipated and i mean to follow you up reaching the sidewalk he caught sight of mr and mrs montgomery just turning the corner of a side street the pair supposed they were safe not thinking that our hero had recognized them and the lady no longer exhibited illness and was walking briskly at her husbands side paul hurried up and tapped the adventurer on the shoulder mr montgomery turning was annoyed on finding that he had not yet escaped he determined however to stick to his false character and deny all knowledge of the mornings transaction well my young friend he said do you want me i believe i have not the pleasure of your acquaintance you are mistaken there mr felix montgomery said paul significantly by what name did you address me said the swindler assuming a tone of surprise i addressed you as mr felix montgomery you have made a mistake my good friend i am an humble clergyman from connecticut i am called the rev mr barnes should you ever visit hayfield centre i shall be glad to receive a call from you when i last met you you were a jeweler from syracuse said paul bluntly mr montgomery laughed heartily my dear he said turning to his wife is not this an excellent joke my young friend here thinks he recognizes in me a jeweler from syracuse indeed you are quite mistaken said the lady my husband is a country minister we came up to the city this morning on a little business i understand on what business said paul you wanted to dispose of a diamond ring mr montgomery was disposed to deny the charge but a moments reflection convinced him that it would be useless as paul had doubtless been informed in ball blacks of his business there he decided to put on a bold front and admit it i suppose you were in ball blacks just now he said i was and so learned my business there but i am at a loss to understand why you should be interested in the matter that ring is mine said paul you swindled me out of it this morning my young friend you must certainly be insane said mr montgomery shrugging his shoulders my dear did you hear that he is an impudent boy said the lady i am surprised that you should be willing to talk to him if you leave here i will put a policeman on your track said paul he looked so determined that mr montgomery found that he must parley you are under a strange hallucination my young friend he said if you will walk along with me i think i can convince you of your mistake there is no mistake about the matter said paul walking on with them the ring is mine and i must have it my dear will you explain about the ring he may credit your testimony i dont see that any explanation is necessary said the lady however since you wish it i will say that the ring was handed you by mrs benton a wealthy lady of your parish with instructions to sell it and devote the proceeds to charitable purposes is that explanation satisfactory asked mr montgomery no it is not said paul resolutely i dont believe one word of it i recognize you in spite of your dress you gave me chloroform this morning in a room in lovejoys hotel and when i was unconscious you made off with the ring which i expected to sell you you had better return it or i will call a policeman i am not the person you take me for said felix montgomery you are the jeweler from syracuse who swindled me out of my ring i never was a jeweler and never lived in syracuse said the adventurer with entire truth you may be right but that is what you told me this morning i wish you would go away and cease to annoy us said the lady impatiently i want my ring we have no ring of yours show me the ring and if it is not mine i will go away you are a very impudent fellow upon my word said mrs montgomery sharply to accuse a gentleman like my husband of taking your ring i dont believe you ever had one my dear interposed her husband mildly i dare say my young friend here really thinks we have his ring of course it is a great mistake imagine what our friends in hayfield centre would think of such a charge but you must remember that he is unacquainted with my standing in the community in order to satisfy his mind i am willing to let him see the ring to let him see the ring repeated the lady in surprise yes here my lad taking the ring from his pocket this is the ring you will see at once that it is not yours i see that it is mine said paul taking the proffered ring and preparing to go astonished at his own good fortune in so easily recovering it not so fast exclaimed mr montgomery seizing him by the shoulder help police an officer had turned the corner just before and it was this that had suggested the trap he came up quickly and looking keenly from one to the other inquired what was the matter this boy has just purloined a ring from my wife said mr montgomery fortunately i caught him in the act give up the ring you young scoundrel said the officer imposed upon by the clerical appearance of the adventurer it is mine said paul none of your gammon give up the ring and come with me the ring was restored to mr montgomery who overwhelmed the officer with a profusion of thanks it is not a diamond only an imitation he said but my wife values it as the gift of a friend dont be too hard on the boy he may not be so bad as he seems ill attend to him said the policeman emphatically ill learn him to rob ladies of rings in the street come along sir paul tried to explain matters but no attention was paid to his protestations to his anger and mortification he saw the swindler make off triumphantly with the ring while he the wronged owner was arrested as a thief but at the stationhouse he had his revenge he was able to prove to his captor that he had lodged information against mr montgomery and the policeman in turn was mortified to think how readily he had been imposed upon of course paul was set free but the officers blundering interference seemed to render the recovery of the ring more doubtful than ever chapter xxii a man of resources well that was a narrow escape said mr montgomery with a sigh of relief i think i managed rather cleverly eh i wanted to box the boys ears said mrs montgomery sharply it wouldnt have been in character my dear ha ha he laughed softly we imposed upon the officer neatly our young friend got rather the worst of it why dont you call things by their right names he isnt much of a friend names are of no consequence my dear well what are you going to do next asked the lady abruptly about the ring of course i hardly know said mr montgomery reflectively if it were not for appearing too anxious i would go back to ball blacks now that our young friend is otherwise engaged and cant interrupt us suppose we go well you see it might be considered rather soon for you to recover from your fit besides i dont know what stories this boy may have thought fit to tell about us he didnt have time to say anything perhaps you are right we want to dispose of the ring as soon as possible and leave the city that is true well if you say so we will go back it seems to me now is the best time the boy will tell his story to the officer and we may be inquired for then my dear i will follow your advice mr and mrs montgomery turned and directed their steps again toward broadway the distance was short and fifteen minutes had scarcely elapsed since they left the store before they again entered it they made their way to the lower end of the store and accosted the same clerk with whom they had before spoken is your wife better he asked much better thank you a turn in the air always relieves her and she is quite herself again i have returned because it is necessary for me to leave the city by the evening train and my time is therefore short will you be kind enough to show the ring to your employer and ask him if he will purchase the clerk returned and said that the firm would pay two hundred and fifty dollars but must be assured of his right to dispose of it did you mention my name asked the adventurer i mentioned that you were a clergyman i could not remember the name the rev mr barnes of hayfield centre connecticut i have been preaching there for is it six or seven years my dear seven said his wife i should think that would be sufficient you may mention that to mr ball or mr black if you please i presume after that he will not be afraid to purchase mr montgomery said this with an air of conscious respectability and high standing which might readily impose upon strangers but by bad luck what he had said was heard by a person able to confute him did you say you were from hayfield centre asked a gentleman standing a few feet distant yes said mr montgomery i think you said your name was barnes yes sir and that you have been preaching there for the last seven years yes sir answered mr montgomery but there was rather less confidence in his tone in fact he was beginning to feel uneasy it is very strange said the other i have a sister living in hayfield centre and frequently visit the place myself and so of course know something of it yet i have never heard of any clergyman named barnes preaching there mr montgomery saw that things looked critical you are strangely mistaken sir he said however i will not press the sale if you will return the ring to the clerk i will dispose of it elsewhere but the clerks suspicions had been aroused by what had been said i will first speak to mr ball he said there is no occasion to speak to him i shall not sell the ring today tomorrow i will come with witnesses whose testimony will outweigh that of this gentleman who i suspect never was in hayfield centre in his life i will trouble you for the ring i hope you dont intend to give it to him said the gentleman the presumption is that as he is masquerading he has not come by it honestly i shall not deign to notice your insinuations said mr montgomery who concealed beneath a consequential tone his real uneasiness the ring if you please dont give it to him as the clerk seemed disinclined to surrender the ring mr montgomery said young man you will find it to be a serious matter to withhold my property perhaps i had better give it to him said the clerk imposed upon by the adventurers manner require him to prove property if it is really his he can readily do this my dear said the rev mr barnes we will leave the store what and leave the ring for the present i will invoke the aid of the police to save me from being robbed in this extraordinary manner he walked to the street door accompanied by his wife he was deeply disappointed at the failure of the sale and would gladly have wreaked vengeance upon the stranger who had prevented it but he saw that his safety required an immediate retreat in addition to his own disappointment he had to bear his wifes censure if you had the spirit of a man mr montgomery she commenced you wouldnt have given up that ring so easily he had no business to keep it i would have called in a policeman if i dared but you know i am not on the best of terms with these gentlemen are we to lose the ring then i am afraid so unless i can make them believe in the store that i am really what i pretend to be cant you do it not very easily unless stay i have an idea do you see that young man he directed his wifes attention to a young man evidently fresh from the country who was approaching staring openeyed at the unwonted sights of the city he was dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons while his pantaloons of a check pattern terminated rather higher up than was in accordance with the fashion yes i see him said mrs montgomery what of him i am going to recover the ring through his help i dont see how you will see how do you do said the adventurer cordially advancing to the young man and seizing his hand pretty smart said the countryman looking surprised are your parents quite well theyre sos to be around when did you come to the city this mornin do you stay any length of time im goin back this afternoon you didnt expect to meet me now did you asked mr montgomery i spose id orter know you said the perplexed youth but i cant think what your name is what not know mr barnes the minister of hayfield centre dont you remember hearing me preach for your minister seems to me i do answered the young man persuading himself that he ought to remember of course you do now my young friend i am very glad to have met you so am i said the other awkwardly you can do me a favor if you will of course i will said jonathan if its anything i can do yes you will have no trouble about it you see i went into a jewelers near by to sell a valuable ring and they wanted to make sure i was really a minister and not intending to cheat them if you will go in with me and say that you have often heard me preach and that i am the rev mr barnes of hayfield centre i wont mind paying you five dollars for your trouble all right ill do it said the rustic considering that it would be an unusually easy way of earning few dollars youll remember the name wont you yes parson barnes of hayfield centre that is right the store is near by walk along with us and we will be there in five minutes chapter xxiii a new expedient i believe your name is peck said mr montgomery hazarding a guess no its young ephraim young of course it is i remember now but i am apt to forget names you said your parents were quite well yes theyre pretty smart i am glad to hear it i have the pleasantest recollections of your excellent father let me see didnt you call there with me once mrs barnes not that i remember you must go with me the next time i want you to know the parents of our young friend they are excellent people do you go back this afternoon mr young yes i guess so you dont know of any sitooation i could get in a store round here do you not at present but i have some influential friends to whom i will mention your name suppose now i could obtain a situation for you how shall i direct the letter letting you know just put on the letter ephraim young everybody in plainfield knows me so he lives in plainfield said mr montgomery to himself its as well to know that then aloud i wont forget mr young what sort of business would you prefer any kind thatll pay said the gratified youth firmly convinced of his companions ability to fulfill his promise ive got tired of stayin round home and id like to try york a little while folks say its easy to make money here you are right if i were a business man i would come to new york at once for a smart young man like you it offers a much better opening than a country village thats what ive told dad often said the rustic but hes afraid i wouldnt get nothing to do and he says its dreadful expensive livin here so it is expensive but then you will be better paid than in the country however here we are you wont forget what i told you no ill remember said the young man the reappearance of mr barnes and wife so soon excited some surprise in the store for it had got around as such things will that he was an impostor and it was supposed that he would not venture to show his face there again the appearance of his rustic companion likewise attracted attention certainly mr montgomery it makes little difference what we call him did not exhibit the slightest appearance of apprehension but his manner was quite cool and selfpossessed he made his way to that part of the counter attended by the clerk with whom he had before spoken he observed with pleasure and relief that the man who had questioned his identity with any of the ministers of hayfield centre was no longer in the store this would make the recovery of the ring considerably easier well sir he said addressing the clerk i suppose you did not expect to see me again so soon no sir nor did i expect to be able to return for the ring before tomorrow not supposing that i could bring witnesses to prove that i was what i represented but fortunately i met just now a young friend who can testify to my identity as he has heard me preach frequently in plainfield where he resides mr young will you be kind enough to tell this gentleman who i am parson barnes of hayfield centre said the youth confidently you have heard me preach have you not in plainfield yes said the young man fully believing that he was telling the truth and i have called on your parents yes i think said the adventurer that will be sufficient to convince you that i am what i appear it was hard to doubt in the face of such evidence ephraim young was so unmistakably from the rural districts that it would have been absurd to suspect him of being an artful city rogue besides mr barnes himself was got up so naturally that all the clerks doubts vanished at once he concluded that the customer who had questioned his genuineness must be very much mistaken i ought to apologize to you sir he said for doubting your word but in a city like this you know one has to be very careful of course said the adventurer blandly i do not blame you in the least you only did your duty though it might have cost me some trouble and inconvenience i am sorry sir no apologies i beg it has all turned out right and your mistake was a natural one if you will kindly return me the ring i will defer selling it i think till another day the clerk brought the ring which he handed back to mr montgomery the latter received it with so much the more satisfaction as he had made up his mind at one time that it was gone irrevocably and put it away in his waistcoat pocket i had intended to buy some silver spoons he said but it will be necessary to wait until i have disposed of the ring however i may as well look at some eh mrs barnes if you like assented the lady so the pair examined some spoons and fixed upon a dozen which they said they would return and buy on the next day and then with a polite goodby went out of the store leaving behind on the whole a favorable impression ephraim young accompanied them out and walked along beside them in the street he too was in good spirits for had not his companion promised him five dollars for his services which he had faithfully rendered five dollars to the young man from the rural districts was a very considerable sum of money quite a nugget in fact and he already enjoyed in advance the pleasure which he anticipated of telling his friends at home how easily he had earned such a sum in york he walked along beside the adventurer expecting that he would say something about paying him but no allusion was made by the adventurer to his promise indeed five dollars was considerably more than he had in his possession when they reached amity street for they were now proceeding up broadway he sought to shake off the young man whose company he no longer desired this is our way he said i suppose you are going further i am very glad to have met you mr young i hope you will give our regards to your excellent parents and he held out his hand in token of farewell aint you goin to pay me that money said ephraim bluntly becoming alarmed at the prospect of losing the nugget he had counted on with so much confidence bless me i came near forgetting it i hope you will excuse me and to ephraims delight he drew out his pocketbook but the prospect of payment was not so bright as the young man supposed i dont think i have a fivedollar bill said mr montgomery after an examination of the pocketbook mrs montgomery do you happen to have a five with you no i havent said the lady promptly i spent all my money shopping this morning that is unfortunate our young friend has rendered us such a service i dont like to make him wait for his money ephraim young looked rather blank at this suggestion let me see i have a hundreddollar bill here said mr montgomery i will go into the next store and see if i cant get it changed mr young will you be kind enough to remain with my wife certain said ephraim brightening up mr montgomery went into a shop near by but made no request to have a hundreddollar bill changed he was rather afraid that they might comply with his request which would have subjected him to some embarrassment he merely inquired if he could use a pen for a moment request which was readily granted in less than five minutes he emerged into the street again ephraim young looked toward him eagerly i am sorry to say my young friend he remarked that i was unable to get my bill changed i might get it changed at a bank but the banks are all closed at this hour the countryman looked disturbed i am afraid continued mr montgomery i must wait and send you the money in a letter from hayfield centre id rather have it now said ephraim i am sorry to disappoint you said the adventurer smoothly but after all you will only have a day or two to wait to make up to you for the delay i have decided to send you ten dollars instead of five finding i could not change my bill i wrote a note for the amount which i will hand you ephraim received the paper which the other handed him and read as follows new york sept three days from date i promise to pay mr ephraim young ten dollars jotham barnes of hayfield centre how will that do asked the adventurer by waiting three days you double your money youll be sure to send it said ephraim doubtfully my young friend i hope you do not doubt me said the rev mr barnes impressively i guess its all right said ephraim only i thought i might like to spend the money in the city much better save it up said the other by and by it may come in useful ephraim carefully folded up the note and deposited it in an immense wallet the gift of his father he would have preferred the money which it represented but three days would soon pass and the ten dollars would be forwarded to him he took leave of his new acquaintances mr montgomery shaking his hand with affectionate warmth and requesting him to give his best respects to his parents when ephraim was out of sight he returned to his wife with a humorous twinkle in his eye and said wasnt that cleverly done old lady good enough remarked the lady now youve got the ring back again what are you going to do with it that my dear is a subject which requires the maturest consideration i shall endeavor to convert it as soon as possible into the largest possible sum in greenbacks otherwise i am afraid our board bill and the note i have just given to my rural friend will remain unpaid chapter xxiv mr montgomerys arrest having shaken off his country acquaintance of whom he had no further need mr montgomery started to return to his lodgings on the whole he was in good spirits though he had not effected the sale of the ring but it was still in his possession and it had a tangible value i am sorry you did not sell the ring said mrs montgomery so am i said her husband we may have to sell it in some other city we cant leave the city without money thats true returned her husband rather taken aback by what was undeniably true we must sell the ring or raise money on it in new york i dont know but you are right the trouble is there are not many places where they will buy so expensive an article besides they will be apt to ask impertinent questions you might go to a pawnbrokers and get fleeced if i got a quarter of the value from a pawnbroker i should be lucky we must do something with it said mrs montgomery decidedly right my dear we must get the sinews of war somewhere richard will never be himself again till his pocketbook is lined with greenbacks at present who steals my purse steals trash suppose you try tiffanys the ring has already been offered there they might remember it if they do say that he is your son a good thought answered the husband i will act upon it but on the whole ill doff this disguise and assume my ordinary garments this time my dear i shall not need your assistance well the sooner its done the better thats all i have to say as soon as possible mr montgomery returned to his lodgings in amity street and taking off his clerical garb appeared in the garb in which we first made his acquaintance the change was very speedily effected wish me good luck mrs m he said as he opened the door i am going to make another attempt good luck to you tony come back soon as soon as my business is completed if i get the money we will leave for philadelphia this evening you may as well be packing up i am afraid the landlady wont let us carry away our baggage unless we pay our bill never mind pack it up and well run our chance felix montgomery left the house with the ring carefully deposited in his vest pocket to judge from his air of easy indifference he might readily have been taken for a substantial citizen in excellent circumstances but then appearances are oftentimes deceitful and they were especially so in the present instance he made his way quickly to broadway and thence to tiffanys at that time not so far uptown as at present he entered the store with a nonchalant air and advancing to the counter accosted the same clerk to whom paul had shown the ring earlier in the day i have a valuable ring which i would like to sell he said will you tell me its value the clerk no sooner took it in his hand than he recognized it i have seen that ring before he said looking at mr montgomery keenly yes said the latter composedly this morning wasnt it yes my boy brought it in here i ought not to have sent him for he came very near losing it on the way home i thought it best to come with it myself this was said so quietly that it was hard to doubt the statement or would have been if information had not been brought to the store that the ring had been stolen yes boys are careless assented the clerk not caring to arouse mr montgomerys suspicions you wish to sell the ring i suppose yes answered the other i dont like to carry a ring of so great value several times i have come near having it stolen will you buy it i am not authorized to make the purchase said the clerk i will refer the matter to mr tiffany very well said mr montgomery i am willing to accept whatever he may pronounce a fair price no doubt thought the clerk he carried the ring to his employer and quickly explained the circumstances the man is doubtless a thief he must be arrested said the jeweler if i go for an officer he will take alarm invite him to come into the back part of the shop and i will protract the negotiation while you summon a policeman the clerk returned and at his invitation mr montgomery walked to the lower end of the store where he was introduced to the head of the establishment sharp though he was he suspected no plot you are the owner of this ring asked mr tiffany yes sir said the adventurer it has been in our family for a long time but you wish to sell it now yes i have come near losing it several times and prefer to dispose of it what is its value that requires some consideration i will examine it closely mr montgomery stood with his back to the entrance waiting patiently while the jeweler appeared to be engaged in a close examination of the ring he congratulated himself that no questions had been asked which it might have been difficult for him to answer he made up his mind that after due examination mr tiffany would make an offer which he determined in advance to accept whatever it might be since he would consider himself fortunate to dispose of it at even twothirds of its value meanwhile the clerk quietly slipped out of the store and at a short distance encountered a policeman upon whom he called for assistance at the same moment paul and mr preston came up our hero on being released from arrest had sought mr preston and the latter obligingly agreed to go with him to tiffanys and certify to his honesty that if the ring should be brought there it might be retained for him paul did not recognize the clerk but the latter at once remembered him are you not the boy that brought a diamond ring into our store this morning he asked into tiffanys yes have you seen anything of it asked our hero eagerly i am the one who brought it in a man just brought it into the store said the clerk is he there now he is talking with mr tiffany i came out for a policeman he will be arrested at once good ejaculated paul i am in luck i thought i should never see the ring again what sort of a man is he from the description paul judged that it was felix montgomery himself and remembering what a trick the adventurer had played upon him at lovejoys hotel he felt no little satisfaction in the thought that the trapper was himself trapped at last ill go along with you he said i want to see that man arrested you had better stay outside just at first until we have secured him meanwhile mr tiffany after a prolonged examination said the ring is worth two hundred and fifty dollars that will be satisfactory said mr montgomery promptly shall i give you a check for the amount asked the jeweler i should prefer the money as i am a stranger in the city and not known at the banks i can make the check payable to bearer and then you will have no difficulty in getting it cashed while this conversation was going on the clerk entered the store with the policeman but mr montgomerys back was turned and he was not aware of the fact till the officer tapped him on the shoulder saying you are my prisoner what does this mean there is some mistake said the adventurer wheeling round with a start no mistake at all you must come with me what have i done you take me for some one else you have stolen a diamond ring who says so demanded the adventurer boldly it is true i brought one here to sell but it has belonged to me for years you are mistaken mr montgomery said paul who had come up unperceived you stole that ring from me this morning after dosing me with chloroform at lovejoys hotel it is a lie said the adventurer boldly that boy is my son he is in league with his mother to rob me she sent him here this morning unknown to me finding it out i took the ring from him and brought it here myself paul was certainly surprised at being claimed as a son by the man who had swindled him and answered i never saw you before this morning i have no father living i will guarantee this boys truth and honesty said mr preston speaking for the first time i believe you know me mr tiffany i need no other assurance said the jeweler bowing officer you may remove your prisoner the game is up said the adventurer finding no further chance for deception i played for high stakes and i have lost the game i have one favor to ask will some one let my wife know where i am give me her address said paul and i will let her know no amity street ask her to come to the stationhouse to see me i will go at once thank you said mr montgomery as i am not to have the ring i dont know that i am sorry it has fallen into your hands one piece of advice i will venture to offer you my lad he added smiling beware of any jewelers hailing from syracuse they will cheat you if you give them a chance i will be on my guard said paul can i do anything more for you nothing thank you i have a fast friend at my side who will look after me the officer smiled grimly at the jest and the two left the store arm in arm do you still wish to sell this ring asked mr tiffany addressing paul yes sir i renew my offer of this morning i will give you two hundred and fifty dollars i shall be glad to accept it the sale was quickly effected and paul left the store with what seemed to him a fortune in his pocket be careful not to lose your money said mr preston i should like to place a hundred and fifty dollars in your hands said paul turning to mr preston i will willingly take care of it for you and allow you interest upon it the transfer was made and carefully depositing the balance of the money in his pocketbook our hero took leave of his friend and sought the house in amity street chapter xxv pauls final success mrs montgomery impatiently awaited the return of her husband meanwhile she commenced packing the single trunk which answered both for her husband and herself she was getting tired of new york and anxious to leave for philadelphia being fearful lest certain little transactions in which she and her husband had taken part should become known to the police she had nearly completed her packing when paul rang the doorbell the summons was answered by the landlady in person is mrs montgomery at home asked paul no such lady lives here was the answer it occurred to paul as very possible that mr montgomery might pass under a variety of names he accordingly said perhaps i have got the name wrong the lady i mean is tall i come with a message from her husband who is a stout man with black hair and whiskers he gave me this number perhaps you mean mr grimsby he and his wife live here probably that is the name said paul i will give mrs grimsby your message returned the landlady whose curiosity was excited to learn something further about her boarders thank you said paul but it is necessary for me to see the lady myself well you can follow me then said the landlady rather ungraciously she led the way upstairs and knocked at the door of mrs grimsby or as we will still call her mrs montgomery since that name is more familiar to the reader and she was as much entitled to the one as the other mrs montgomery opened the door and regarded our hero suspiciously for her mode of life had taught her suspicion of strangers heres a boy that wants to see you said the landlady i come with a message from your husband said paul mrs montgomery remembered paul as the boy who was the real owner of the diamond ring and she eyed him with increased suspicion did my husband send you when did you see him just now at tiffanys answered paul significantly what is his message asked mrs montgomery beginning to feel uneasy paul glanced at the landlady who in the hope of gratifying her curiosity maintained her stand by his side the message is private he said i suppose that means that i am in the way remarked the landlady sharply i dont want to pry into anybodys secrets thank heaven i havent got any secrets of my own walk in young man said mrs montgomery paul entered the room and she closed the door behind him meanwhile the landlady who had gone part way downstairs retraced her steps softly and put her ear to the keyhole her curiosity naturally strong had been stimulated by pauls intimation that there was a secret now said mrs montgomery impatiently out with it why does my husband send a message by you instead of coming himself he cant come himself why cant he i am sorry to say that i am the bearer of bad news said paul gravely your husband has been arrested for robbing me of a diamond ring where is he demanded mrs montgomery not so much excited or overcome as she would have been had this been the first time her husband had fallen into the clutches of the law at the street stationhouse he wants you to come and see him have you got the ring back yes mrs montgomery was sorry to hear it she hoped her husband might be able to secrete it in which case he would pass it over to her to dispose of now she was rather awkwardly situated being without money or the means of making any i will go she said paul who was sitting next to the door opened it suddenly with unexpected effort for the landlady whose ear was fast to the keyhole staggered into the room involuntarily so you were listening maam were you demanded mrs montgomery scornfully yes i was said the landlady rather red in the face you were in good business its a better business than stealing diamond rings retorted the landlady recovering herself ive long suspected there was something wrong about you and your husband maam and now i know it i dont want no thieves nor jail birds in my house and the sooner you pay your bill and leave the better ill like it ill leave as soon as you like but i cant pay your bill i dare say retorted the landlady youre a nice character to cheat an honest woman out of four weeks board well paul what news asked barry i am ready to buy your stand said paul can you pay me all the money down on the spot then it is all settled said barry with satisfaction i am glad of it for now i shall be able to go on to philadelphia tomorrow paul drew a roll of bills from his pocket and proceeded to count out thirtyfive dollars barry noticed with surprise that he had a considerable amount left you are getting rich paul he said i am not rich yet answered paul but i mean to be some time if i can accomplish it by industry and attention to business youll be sure to succeed said george barry youre just the right sort goodby old fellow when you come on to philadelphia come and see me i may establish a branch stand in philadelphia before long said paul jocosely chapter xxvi conclusion when paul was left in charge of the stand and realized that it was his own he felt a degree of satisfaction which can be imagined he had been a newsboy a baggagesmasher and in fact had pretty much gone the round of the street trades but now he felt that he had advanced one step higher some of my readers may not appreciate the difference but to paul it was a great one he was not a merchant prince to be sure but he had a fixed place of business and with his experience he felt confident he could make it pay i am sure i can make from ten to fifteen dollars a week he said to himself i averaged over a dollar a day when i worked for george barry and then i only got halfprofits now i shall have the whole this consideration was a very agreeable one he would be able to maintain his mother and little jimmy in greater comfort than before and this he cared more for than for any extra indulgences for himself in fact he could relieve his mother entirely from the necessity of working and yet live better than at present when paul thought of this it gave him a thrill of satisfaction and made him feel almost like a man he set to work soliciting custom and soon had sold three neckties at twentyfive cents each all that money is mine he thought proudly i havent got to hand any of it over to george barry thats a comfort as this thought occurred to him he recognized an old acquaintance strolling along the sidewalk in his direction it was no other than jim parker the friend and crony of mike donovan who will be remembered as figuring in not a very creditable way in the earlier chapters of this story it so happened that he and paul had not met for some time and jim was quite ignorant of pauls rise in life as for jim himself no great change had taken place in his appearance or prospects his suit was rather more ragged and dirty than when we first made his acquaintance having been worn night and day in the streets by night stretched out in some dirty alley or outoftheway corner where jim found cheap lodgings he strolled along with his hands in his pockets not much concerned at the deficiencies in his costume hallo said he stopping opposite pauls stand what are you up to you can see for yourself answered paul i am selling neckties how long youve been at it just begun whos your boss i havent any you aint runnin the stand yourself be you asked jim in surprise yes whered you borrow the stamps of my mother said paul cant i sell you a necktie this morning not much said jim laughing at the joke ive got my trunks stuffed full of em at home but i dont wear em only sundays do you make much money i expect to do pretty well what made you give up sellin prize packages asked jim slyly customers like you answered paul jim laughed you didnt catch me that time you lost your basket he said that was a mean trick said paul indignantly you dont want to hire me to sell for you do you thats where youre right i dont id like to go into the business youd better open a secondhand clothing store suggested paul glancing at his companions ragged attire maybe i will said jim with a grin if youll buy of me i dont like the style said paul whos your tailor he lives round in chatham street say cant you lend a fellow a couple of shillin to buy some breakfast have you done any work today no then you cant expect to eat if you dont work i didnt have no money to start with suppose you had a quarter what would you do id buy a tencent plate of meat and buy some evenin papers with the rest if youll do that ill give you what you ask for youll give me two shillin repeated jim incredulously for he remembered how he had wronged paul yes said paul heres the money and he drew a twentyfivecent piece from his vest pocket and handed it to jim you give me that after the mean trick i played you said jim yes i am sorry for you and want to help you along youre a brick exclaimed jim emphatically if any feller tries to play a trick on you you just tell me and ill lam him all right jim said paul kindly ill remember it there aint anybody you want licked is there asked jim earnestly not at present thank you said paul smiling when you do im on hand said jim now ill go and get some grub he shuffled along toward ann street where there was a cheap eatinghouse in which ten cents would pay for a plate of meat he was decidedly hungry and did justice to the restaurant whose style of cookery though not very choice suited him so well that he could readily have eaten three plates of meat instead of one but for the prudent thought that compelled him to reserve enough to embark in business afterwards jim was certainly a hard ticket but pauls unexpected kindness had won him and produced a more profound impression than a dozen floggings could have done i may add that jim proved luck in his business investment and by the close of the afternoon had enough money to provide himself with supper and lodging besides a small fund to start with the next day paul sold three more neckties and then though it yet lacked an hour of the time when he generally proposed to close he prepared to go home he wanted to communicate the good news to his mother and little jimmy mrs hoffman raised her eyes from her sewing as he entered well paul she said have you heard anything of the ring yes mother its sold is it well we must do without it then said his mother in a tone of disappointment there wont be any trouble about that mother as long as we have got the money for it i would rather have that than the ring did you recover it then asked his mother eagerly yes mother listen and i will tell you all about it he sat down and told the story to two very attentive listeners what did you do with the money paul asked jimmy mr preston is keeping a hundred and fifty dollars for me he will allow seven per cent interest but i must not forget that the money belongs to you mother and not to me perhaps you would prefer to deposit it in a savings bank i am quite satisfied with your disposal of it paul said mrs hoffman i little thought when i found the ring that it would be of such service to us it has set me up in business said paul and i am sure to make money but i am getting out of stock i must go round and buy some more neckties tomorrow how much do you pay for your ties paul asked his mother one shilling i sell them for two that gives me a good profit i wonder whether i couldnt make them said mrs hoffman i find there is no sewing at present to be got and besides she added i think i would rather work for you than for a stranger there is no need of your working mother i can earn enough to support the family while i have health i would prefer to work paul then i will bring round some of the ties tomorrow i have two or three kinds there is nothing very hard about any of them i think they would be easy to make that will suit me much better than making shirts suppose i admit you to the firm mother i can get a large signboard and have painted on it paul hoffman and mother dealers in neckties how would that sound i think i would leave the business part in your hands paul i begin to feel like a wholesale merchant already said paul who knows but i may be one some day many successful men have begun as low down said his mother with energy and industry much may be accomplished do you think ill ever be a wholesale painter asked jimmy whose small ears had drank in the conversation better try for it jimmy said paul i dont know exactly what a wholesale painter is unless its one who paints houses i shouldnt like that said the little boy then jimmy youd better be a retail painter i guess i will said jimmy seriously thus far we have accompanied paul hoffman in his career he is considerably better off than when we met him peddling prize packages in front of the post office but we have reason to believe that greater success awaits him he will figure in the next two volumes of this series more particularly in the second to be called slow and sure or from the sidewalk to the shop before this appears however i propose to describe the adventures of a friend and protegee of pauls under the title of phil the fiddler or the young street musician which will be our next etext after the unabridged dictionary
