along to pick up sally and take her with us sally hope was darrells best friend mr rivers darrells father was motoring them both down to malory towers their school in cornwall they were setting off very early so that they would be there before dark and sally was going with them i hate leaving home but i just cant help being excited at going back again said darrell this will be my fifth term at malory towers motherand im to be in the second form i shall feel grand well youre thirteen now so its time you went up said her mother settling down in the car you will quite look down on the first form wont youthink they are mere babies i suppose i shall said darrell with a laugh well the third form look down on usso were all kept in our places theres your little sister waving to you said her father as the car slid down the drive she will miss you darrell darrell waved frantically goodbye felicity she yelled youll be coming to malory towers sometime then well go together the car purred out of the drive into the road darrell took a last look back at her home she would not see it again for three months she felt a little sadbut then being a sensible girl she cheered up at once and set her thoughts on malory towers she had grown to love her school very much in the last year and she was proud that she belonged to it four terms in the first form with miss potts lay behind hernow she had a year in the second form to look forward to they arrived at sally hopes house in an hours time sally was ready for them her school trunk and her nightcase standing beside her on the steps with her was her mother and by them stood a toddler of about eighteen months clutching at sallys hand hallo sally hallo daffy shouted darrell in excitement good youre ready the trunk was put in the boot at the back of the car with darrells the nightcase was strapped on the grid sallys lacrosse stick was shoved in with the odds and ends and then she got in herself want to come too called daffy her eyes full of tears as she saw her beloved sally going away goodbye mother dear ill write as soon as i can called sally goodbye daffy darling the car slid off again and daffy began to howl sally looked a little upset i hate leaving mother she said and now i hate leaving daffy too shes lovely nowshe can run everywhere and she talks awfully well do you remember how yon hated her when she was a baby said darrell now i bet you wouldnt be without her its fun to have a sister yes i was horrid to her said sally remembering that was an awful first term i had at malory towersi was so miserable thinking id been sent away from home to make room for daffy the new baby i hated you too darrellisnt it queer to think of and now were best friends said darrell with a laugh i saywho do you think win be head of the second form this term sally katherines in the third form now so she wont be itll be somebody else alicia perhaps said sally shes about the oldest i knowbut do you think she would make a good head said darrell doubtfully i know shes awfully clever and gets top marks in anythingbut dont you think shes too fond of playing the fool she might stop that if she was head of the form said sally what alicia wants is a bit of responsibility i think she just wont take any you know she was asked to run the nature walks last term and she wouldnt but i can think of another reason why she wouldnt make a good head girl what asked darrell enjoying this gossip about her school fellows well shes rather hard said sally she wouldnt bother to help people if they were in trouble she wouldnt bother herself to be kind shed just be headoftheform and give orders and see that they were kept and nothing elseand you do want something else in a headgirl dont you think so well who do you think is fit to be head of the form demanded darrell what about youyou size people up awfully well and youre fine when anybodys upset or in trouble and youre sowell so steady somehow you dont fly off the handle like i do or get all worked up about things id love you to be head i wouldnt want to be said sally and any way theres no chance of it i think you would be fine as head of the form darrellyou really would everyone likes you and trusts you for a wild moment darrell wondered if it was possible that she might be chosen it was true that all the girls except one or two really liked and trusted her but theres my temper still she said regretfully took how i flared up last term when marigold ticked me off at tennis thinking i was somebody else i didnt know shed made a mistake of coursebut just think how i yelled at her and flung my racket down and stamped off i cant think what came over me oh the sun was too much for you and lots of us that day said sally comfortingly you dont usually lose your temper for silly things like that you are learning to keep it for things its useful fort like going for that ass of a gwendoline mary for instance darrell laughed yes she really is an idiot isnt she do you remember how silly she was over miss terry that singing mistress we had last termthe one that took mr youngs place for two months i thought miss terry was stupid to put up with it oh gwendoline will always be silly over somebody said sally shes that kind i expect shell pick on somebody this term too to worship and follow round well thank goodness its not likely to be me i hope therell be some new girls said darell its fun sizing them up isnt itand seeing what theyre like there are sure to be some said sally i say wouldnt it be funny if marylou was told to be headgirl both girls laughed marylou was devoted to both sally and darrell though darrell was her heroine and the girls liked little marylou very much but she was such a timid little thing shrinking away from all idea of responsibility that it was quite funny to picture her face if she was ever told she was to be head of the form shed have a blue fit and go up in smoke said darrell but shes much better now sally do you remember how she used to shake at the knees when she was scared she hardly ever does that now weve all been decent to her and not scared her and weve made her believe in herselfso shes different shell never be so bad again it was a long long drive to cornwall the journey was broken by picnic meals taken by the wayside sitting on heather or grass mrs rivers took the wheel of the car once to relieve her husband the girls sat at the back and talked or drowsed as the journey lengthened out not very far now said mr rivers who was back at the wheel we may see some other cars on their way to the school too look out for them they soon saw onea low red car belonging to irenes people irene was at the back and waved violently almost knocking off her fathers glasses as he sat at the wheel the car swerved isnt that just like irene said sally with a grin hey irene had good hols the two cars kept more or less together and the girls looked back at irenes merry face they liked her she was a clever girl especially at music but a real scatterbrain otherwise always forgetting things and losing them but she was so goodhumoured that nobody could be cross with her for long theres another car whose is it said sally as a third one came in from a sideroad complete with school trunk at the back it swung away ahead of them one of the bigger girls said darrell looks like georgina thomas i wonder who will be head of the whole school this year pamelas gone now i hope georgina wont shes too bossy for anything now they were very near the school and it suddenly came into sight round a comer the girls looked at it in silence they both liked their school immensely and were very proud of it they saw the great grey building with a rounded tower at each endnorth tower south tower east and west a creeper now turning red climbed almost up to the roof our castle said darrell proudly malory towers best school in the world soon the car swung up to the big flight of steps leading to the great front door other cars were in the drive and groups of chattering girls stood about gay voices called across the drive hallo lucy look theres freda isnt she brown had good hols freda you look as if youd lived in the water youre so brown hallo jenny did you get my letters you never answered one you pig hey tessie look out for my nightcase take your great feet off it goodbye mother goodbye daddy ill write as soon as ive settled in dont forget to feed my pet mice will you get out of the way there youll be run over by that car oh its betty hill betty betty have you brought any tricks or jokes back with you a pair of wicked eyes looked out of the window of the car and a tuft of hair fell over a brown forehead i may have said betty stepping out you never know anyone seen alicia or hasnt she come yet the traingirls havent arrived the train is late as usual darrell darrell rivers hallo there and sally i say lets go in and find our dormy come on what a noise what a tumult darrell couldnt help feeling thrilled it was good to be back at school againback at malory towers three new girls darrell said goodbye to her parents and they purred off in the car darrell was always glad that her father and mother were sensible when they said goodbye they didnt burst into tears as gwendolines mother always did they didnt expect her to stay close beside them and look mournful they laughed and talked just as usual promised to come down at halfterm then kissed her goodbye and went waving cheerfully soon she and sally were carrying their nightcases up the steps into the big hall they had their lacrosse sticks too which got entangled with peoples legs as the other girls surged around and about miss potts was in the hall she had been their formmistress when they had been in the first form and was still their housemistress for she was in charge of north tower in which they slept all the girls bedrooms or dormitories were in the four towers and there was a housemistress in charge of each one and also a matron miss potts saw sally and darrell and called them sally darrell take charge of this new girl for me will you she will be in the second form with you and will be in your dormy take her up to matron darrell saw a tall thin girl standing by miss potts looking nervous and scared darrell remembered how lost she had felt when she had first come to malory towers and she felt sorry for the girl she went up to her sally behind her hallo come along with us and well look after you whats your name ellen wilson said the girl she had a very pate face and looked tired out in the middle of her forehead was a deep line cutting down between her eyebrows making her look as if she was continually frowning darrell didnt much like the look of her but she smiled at ellen kindly expect you feel pretty muddled with all this row going on she said i felt the same last year when i came my names darrell rivers and this is my friend sally hope the girl gave polite little smiles and then followed silently behind them they all made their way through the excited throng of girls theres marylou said darrell hallo marylou youve grown little marylou smiled i hope sol she said im tired of being the smallest in the form whos this ellen wilson new girl second form said darrell in our dormy added sally were taking her to matron hallo heres irene irene we saw you nearly knock off your fathers glasses in the car when you waved to us irene grinned yes that was the third time id done it he was just getting annoyed with me are you going to matron ill come along too got your health certificate asked sally slyly it was a standing joke with the girls that irene always arrived without it no matter how safely her mother had packed it in her nightcase or given it in an envelope to irene to put in her pocket got yours said darrell to ellen wilson we have to hand them over at once and woe betide you if you go down with measles or chicken pox or something if youve just handed in a certificate saying you havent been near anyone ill golly irene you dont really mean to say you havent got yours again irene was feeling in all her pockets with a humorous look of dismay on her face cant find it at the moment she said must be in my nightcase but nomother said she wasnt going to put it in there any more because it always disappeared blow matron said shed isolate you next time you came without a health certificate said sally youll have to be in the san for two days till your mother sends another one you really are an idiot irene feeling frantically in all her pockets irene followed sally darrell and ellen to north tower and went in with them the secondform dormy was not far from the firstform dormy where darrell had slept for the last four terms it was on the second floor and was a lovely big room with ten white beds in it each covered with a pretty eiderdown the girls dumped their nightcases down in the dormy and went to look for matron ah there she was shepherding another new girl up to the dormy darrell looked at the girl she was about the same age as darrell and like darrell had black curly hair but cut much shorter more like a boy she looked rather dirty and untidy but she had a very attractive grin and her eyes twinkled as she looked at the other girls she did not look nearly so lost or forlorn as ellen ah sallydarrellheres another new girl said matron briskly take charge of her will you her name is belinda morris nowhave you all got your nightcases and what about your health certificates our nightcases are there said darrell pointing to where they had dumped them on the floor and heres my health certificate matron wheres my nightcase said belinda suddenly surely you had it with you a minute ago said matron looking all round well give me your certificate and then go and look for your case but its in the case said belinda and looked vaguely round you probably left it down in the hall for everyone to fall over said matron you girls i thank you darrell is this your certificate sallyand yours marylouand yours fikn what about yours irene its a most peculiar thing matron began irene hunting in all her pockets again you know i had it when i started off this morning i remember mother saying matron stared at irene really exasperated irene dont dare to tell me youve not brought it again you know what i told you last term there is a rule here that girls who forget their health certificates shall be isolated until one is produced ive never had to enforce that rule yetbut in your case i really think oh matron dont isolate me begged irene taking her nightcase opening it and emptying all the contents higgledypiggledy on the floor ill find it i will the girls stood by laughing really irene was very funny when she had lost something matron looked on grimly irene bent low over the case hunting hardand suddenly she gave a cry and put her hand to her chest oooh somethings pricking me whatever can it be gracious somethings run a sharp point right into me she stood up rubbing her chest then she opened the front of her coatand the girls gave a scream of laughter irene you donkey youve got your health certificate pinned on to your front i you couldnt lose it if you wanted to irene looked down pleased of course she said unpinning it i remember now i knew i should lose it unless i really did hang on to it somehowso i pinned it tightly to my front here it is matron you wont have to isolate me after all matron took it and put it with the others she had a narrow squeak for you irene she said and her plump face broke into a smile you put a grey hair into my head at the beginning of every term now you girlsunpack your nightcases and put out your things the trunks wont be unpacked till tomorrowand then each of you will have to check the clothes list you brought with you she departed rustling stiffly in her starched apron looking out for more returning girls collecting lists and names and certificates bringing order out of confusion and welcoming back all the sixty or so girls returning to north tower in the other towers three more matrons were doing the same thing it was a real task to welcome back about two hundred and fifty girls with their trunks nightcases and oddsandends belinda had wandered off to look for her nightcase whilst the others were still putting out their things she sauntered back a brown suitcase in her hand she opened it and shook out a pair of pyjamas she stared at them in surprise golly i didnt know i bad pyjamas like this she said and what posh bedroom slippers mother has put in for me for a surprise i suppose darrell looked over her shoulder then she grinned youll get into trouble if you unpack any more of those things she said they belong to georgina thomas shell be jolly wild if she finds out youve got her nightcase shes probably hunting all over the place for it now cant you read belinda darrell pointed to the name marked on the collar of the pyjamas georgina thomas goodness what an ass i am said belinda and stuffed all the things back untidily into the case i thought it was my case she went out of the room again presumably to hunt once more for her lost case darrell grinned at irene i dont know what were going to do if we have two people like you irene she said ones bad enoughbut two youll drive mamzelle cracked between you and as for miss parker our formmistresswell you know what she is she cant stand anything vague or careless we shall have some fun this term with you and belinda in the class together irene didnt in the least mind being teased she was a clever goodhumoured girl brilliant at music but very thoughtless and vague over the ordinary little everyday things if anyone lost a grammar book it was irene if anyone forgot to turn up at a special lesson it was irene and now here was another girl belinda who seemed to be just as bad irene very much liked the look of her and had already made up her mind to be friends belinda soon came back again this time fortunately with her own case she tipped everything out and then proceeded to put her things in place just as the others didpyjamas under the pillowtoothbrush faceflannel toothpaste and sponge on a glass ledge at one end of the dormy where the washbasins were brush and comb in their bag inside the top drawer of the dressingtable then the empty nightcase was pat with the pile outside in the corridor waiting to be taken to the boxroom there came a great clatter op the stairs and the girls in the dormy raised their heads the traingirls theyve come at last arent they late more girls clattered into the dormy alicia johns came in her eyes bright behind her came jean the straightforward sensible scots girl then came emily a quiet girl whose only real interest was sewing and the most elaborate embroidery one two three four five six seven eight of us said darrell counting two more to come who are they gwendoline mary for one i suppose said irene with a grimace dear gwendoline mary i expect her mother is still sobbing over letting her darling lamb go away from her i whos the tenth here comes gwendoline said darrell and the girls heard that familiar rather whining voice gwendoline was a spoilt child and although malory towers had done her a lot of good the holidays always seemed to make her worse again she came inand with her was the tenth girl gwendoline mary introduced her hallo everyonethis is daphne millicent turner a new girl shes in our form and in our dormy she travelled down in my carriage and im sure shes going to be a favourite with all of us in no time first day of term this of course was a silly way to introduce any new girl especially as every listening girl immediately felt that anyone likely to be gwendolines favourite was not at all likely to be theirs they smiled politely at die new gilt taking her in from top to bottom she was very pretty her golden hair curled about her forehead and her blue eyes were much bluer than gwendolines large pale ones but they were set nearer together than gwendolines giving her rather a sly look she had beautiful white teeth and a very charmtag smile she used it now tm so pleased to come to malory towers she said ive never been to a school before thats one thing we had in common said gwendoline in a pleased voice i didnt go to school before i came here either it would have been better for you if you had said alicia you wanted a lot of licking into shape gwendoline i suppose as usual you were waited on hand and foot at home these hols with your old governess and your mother telling you that you were the most wonderful girl in the world gwendoline looked annoyed you dont need to be rude immediately you see me alicia she said come along daphne ill show you what to do you are in our dormy which will be very nice i can show you round quite a lot i know how i felt when i first got here and didnt know anyone daphne seemed very grateful she had very good manners and thanked everyone nicely whenever they showed her or told her anything she certainly was very pretty and graceful it was dear that for some reason gwendoline had quite made up her mind to be her friend and helper i told you shed have to be silly about somebody said sally to darrell as they went downstairs to their sapper well shes welcome to daphne shes got too many airs and graces for me gwendoline says that daphnes father is practically a millionaire said darrell she had a nurse a governess and her own maid before she came here ohso thats why dear gwendoline is sucking up to her said sally i thought there must be something hey ireneyouve still got your hat on do you particularly want to wear it at supper oh gosh said irene putting her hand up to her head have i forgotten to take it off belinda you might have told me belinda grinned i dont know that i noticed h she said so many things strike me as odd here at the moment wearing a hat to supper didnt seem to be anything out of the ordinary what a pair youll make said sally come on darrell come on marylou we shant get any supper if we dont hurry all the girls were tired that night and the secondformers were very glad to tumble into bed gwendoline bad chosen the bed next to daphne if you feel homesick just tell me she said to daphne who looked really charming in blue pyjamas her curly hair all about her shoulders in a golden mass gwendolines hair too was golden but it was straight she envied daphne her curls i expect i shall feel rather queer said daphne getting into bed you see im so used to lots of people round memummy coming to kiss me good nightand my governess popping in to see if im all rightand my maid folding all my things i shall no more talking said sally suddenly gwendoline sat up youre not head of form or dormy sally she said dont give orders then im not said sally you know the roles gwendoline im just reminding you of them thats all gwendoline lay down presently the whispering began again sally got cross shut up gwendoline its long past time to stop talking we all want to go to sleep wait till youre head and ill obey you but not till then said gwendoline rather anxious to show off in front of her grand new friend well know tomorrow whos head well it wont be you said alicias malicious voice from down the room shhhht said darrell hearing a footstep it was matron she came in quietly saw the wakeful girls and spoke kindly to them not asleep yet hurry up no more talking now of course good night she went out gwendoline debated whether or not to begin whispering to daphne again but a tiny snore from daphne showed that she was asleep so it wouldnt be any good to defy sallydaphne wouldnt be able to whisper back soon all the girls were fast asleep they didnt bear miss potts peep into the room and shut the door quietly they didnt even hear the sixthformers trooping upstairs later on they were all tired out the dressingbell awoke everyone with a jump sally sat straight up startled ohits only the school bell she said and laughed i couldnt think what it was for a moment the first day was always fun no real lessons were done though classes were held tests were given to see what the new girls knew new books pencils and so on were given out a list of various duties was com piled each girl taking her torn at them week by week the new girls all had to go to see miss grayling the quiet lowvoiced head mistress she told the girls exactly the same as she had told darrell the year before you will all get a lot out of your years at malory towers see that you give a lot back be just and responsible kind and hardworking i count as our successes those who leave here as young women good hearted and kind sensible and trustable good sound people that the world can lean on our failures are those who do not leant these things in the years they are here daphne ellen belinda and all the other new girls in various forms heard these words that morning all of them listened impressed some remembered the words and never forgot them they would be the successes all three new girls in the second form seemed to be listening earnestly and sincerely especially daphne miss grayling glanced at her looking at her closely without appearing to she knew quite a lot about daphne millicent turner daphne looked back putting all her soul into her eyes she wanted badly to make a good impression on miss grayling she smiled her charming smile but the head mistress did not return it she spoke a few more serious words and then dismissed the girls they went silently out of the room isnt she wonderful said daphne fervently gwendoline said shed make a real impression on me and she has nobody appeared to care whether any impression had been made on daphne or not they separated and went their different ways this term darrell and salty made their way to the secondform room they passed the door of the tirstformers the room where they themselves had sat for many terms the door was open a tangled crowd of small girls were choosing desks and bagging seats babies said darrell loftily just inkyfingered kids who probably dont know their twelvetimes table yet two old secondformers now thirdformers passed them in the passage hallo kids said one of the thirdformers condescendingly look out for old nosey shes hard on people who make too many spelling mistakes nosey was the popular name for miss parker the secondform mistress she had rather a large nose which so the girls said she kept putting into things that was no concern of hers certainly she was a most inquisitive person when she suspected any mischief was going on and did not rest till she had got to the bottom of it she was strict but sometimes she had dreamy fits when she seemed to forget the class and sit gazing into the distance the class lived for these rare moments and then made the most of them darrell was sure she would not like miss parker nearly as much as she had liked potty the mistress who had taught her in the first form belinda and ellen seemed to be very keen to know all the details about the various teachers darrell and sally were pleased to supply them daphne of course went to gwendoline for information youve got to be careful of both mamzelles said darrell but most of all of mamzelle rougier the tall thin one theyve both got tempersbut mamzelle duponts temper is just a short hot one and mamzelle rougiers is a real bad one and look oat for miss carton the history mistress because if you dont like history shell sharpen her tongue on you said alicia i do like it so im all right but if you dont took out the first day passed pleasantly and interestingly the new girls were taken to see the various parts of the big school buildings the tennis courts and the gardens they marvelled at the great swimmingpool hollowed out from the rocks continually filled with fresh water each tide i suppose you can swim very well said daphne to gwendoline gwendoline hesitated and looked round she had been boasting quite a lot to daphne but not in the hearing of the others now darrell was too near for her to make any untruthful statement about her swimming wellnot so well as the others she said i bet you swim the best said daphne warmly youre too modest darrell giggled no one could call gwendoline modest surely she was the worst boaster in the school and sometimes could not draw the line between stupid boasting and real untruth ellen said she could not swim ive never had much time for games she said but id like to play them well ive had to work so hard always you must be jolly clever said marylou you won the only scholarship offered that would take you to malory towers didnt you yes but i dont believe im really clever said ellen the little line deepening on her forehead and giving her a worried look i meani can work and work and work and remember things all rightbut fm not brilliant like some girls some dont need to work hard at alltheyre top because theyre so clever and they cant help it i have had to work for everything stilli badly wanted to come to malory towers and here i am so the hard work was worth it well you try being good at games as well as at work said sally who was very keen on all games herself you know what they say all work and no play makes jack a dull boyand ellen a dull girl said ellen with a small laugh im afraid thats what i am toodull belinda loved everything about malory towers irene who seemed to have taken her as much in tow as gwendoline had taken daphne was delighted with belindas rapturous admiration of everything oh the views cried belinda look at that sea look at the colours in that swimmingpool wheres my paintbox quick it was men that for the first time the girls discovered belindas talent she could draw and paint marvellously well best of all or so the girls thought she could caricature anyone in a bold pencil or charcoal drawing producing a comic exaggerated likeness that sent everyone into peals of laughter well have some fun with you belinda said irene you can draw nosey parkerand mamzelleboth mamzelles in factand matronand everyone im glad you came well certainly have some fun with you settling in on the first day of the term miss parker announced who the headgirl of the form was to be the class were all agog to hear her and sat like mice whilst she rustled her papers and looked for her pencil i am sure you all want to know who has been chosen for headgirl this term she said well i will not keep you in suspense long after a short discussion at the staff meeting we decided onsally hope the girls clapped and sally blushed red she was very pleased indeed miss parker went on glancing at her notes as she spoke you may perhaps like to know what girls were in the running for the position darrell rivers was jean macdonald was another winnie toms was a third everyone expected to hear alicias name mentioned or irenes but miss parker did not give any more names at all irene didnt mind she knew she was a scatterbrain and she didnt in the least want to be head of the form so long as she had her music she was happy being head of the form might rob her of some of her practice time t but alicia did mind she had been top of the form last term she had a fine brain and an excellent memory and although she never needed to work hard because she had these to help her still she certainly had done well last term and yet she wasnt even in the running for the position of headgirl she bit her lips and wished she could stop herself going red theres too much favouritism she told herself fiercely just because i play the fool sometimes and upset the mistresses they wont even consider me as head but alicia was not altogether right it was not playing the fool that made the staff pass over her name but something else it was alicias hardness to those she didnt like her sneers at those less clever than herself who needed help not taunts often the staff laughed privately over alicias ridiculous tricks and enjoyed thembut nobody liked her wild and unruly tongue and the sharp things it could say shell get a lot of admiration and envy but she wont get much love or real friendship from others miss grayling had said at the staff meeting as for betty her friend she is clever too but a little emptyhead compared with alicia who really has it in her to make good if she tried it isnt alicias brain that is at fault its her heart and so the choice had been madesally hope the steady loyal kindly sensible sally darrells best friend sally might not be top of the form but she would always listen to anyone in difficulty sally would not do brilliantly in exams as alicia wouldbut she would always help a younger girl at games or lessons she would be completely fair and just as headgirl of the form and she wouldnt stand any nonsense everyone in the form knew that a good choice had been made although some of them would have welcomed a bad choice for they didnt like sally gwendoline was furious so was betty who had hoped that alicia would have been chosen so were one or two of bettys friends not in sallys dormy darrell squeezed sallys arm jolly good she said im glad wont your mother be pleased youll be head of our dormy too sally sucks for gwendoline it certainly was most annoying for gwendoline that night in bed when sally took command sally did not mean to use her new power too much or too soon but she knew that if gwendoline began to be silly again she would have to make a stand at once gwendoline didnt understand leniency but took advantage of it so as soon as the whispering began again after lights out sally spoke up shut up gwendoline i told you that last night i wasnt head of dormy then but i am now so shut up when i tell you poor daphnes homesick began gwendoline it wont make her any better if you whisper stuff and nonsense into her ear said sally there was a short silence then belindas voice cut through the darkness asking a question sally what happens if we disobey and go on whispering when the headgirl has said were not to nobody ever does said sally grimly but i believe there is an unwritten law at malory towers that if anyone makes herself a nuisance at night a nice big hairbrush is chosen and a few slaps given oh said belinda and snuggled down in bed grinning to think of what gwendoline would feel now would she whisper again or not gwendoline had opened her mouth to continueher conversation with daphne but when she heard belindas question and its answer she shut it again shocked how dare sally hint such a thing to a secondformer she debated whether or not sally was just saying it to scare her but remembering sallys grim voice she decided she wouldnt risk it it would be too humiliating if sally really did carry out her threat daphne would never respect her again t so there was peace in the dormy and when matron came silently to the door there was only the regular breathing of ten girls to be heard eight were fast asleep but two were awake they were gwendoline and ellen gwendoline was cross and that always made her wakeful ellen was thinking about her work she had done fairly well in the testpapers that morning but not brilliantly was she really up to the secondform work here oh yes she had won that scholarship but it wasnt brains that had done it only hard hard work was it going to be terribly hard work here to keep up with the others her brain didnt seem to work so easily as it used to ellen was worried and did not fall asleep till long after gwendoline it took the new girls a few days to get into the way of things ellen and daphne learnt their way about more quickly than belinda who kept turning up in the wrong classroom continually she would go into the firstform classroom instead of in the second form and miss potts got quite annoyed with her belinda dont ten me youre here again she would say do you particularly want to work with the first form of course if you really feel that the work of the second form is but by that time belinda had fled muttering hurried apologies she would appear in her own formroom a minute or two late giggling im so sorry i got lost miss parker she would say and subside into her seat ill look after her a bit miss parker said irene but miss parker forbade that immediately that would mean the two of you getting lost she said youd probably be down in the swimmingpool waiting for a diving lesson whilst we were all up here doing maths its time belinda learnt to look after herself after all shes been here three days now yes miss parker said belinda meekly and began to make a little sketch of the teacher on her blottingpad she was always drawing wherever she was she kept a little sketch book in her pocket and filled it with odd drawings of the girls the flowers on the windowsill the view from the window anything that caught her observant eye mamzelle dupont plump short and beadyeyed holding her lorgnettes close to her eyes was a source of delight to belinda for she was so easy to draw neatly every girl in the class now had a neat little sketch of mamzelle marking her place in her french grammar it was the ambition of the class to have as a marker caricatures of all the mistresses taking their different classesmiss carton for their history books miss grayling for the scripture exercise books mr young for the school song book and so on belinda had promised to do one for each girl as a marker providing that they would tidy her drawers for her keep her desk spick and span and generally see that whatever she forgot was done before she got into trouble simply cant help forgetting things she explained tin even worse than irene if i get into too many rows i get upset and cant draw thats awful dont worry well run round you all right said alicia looking in delight at the sly drawing belinda had done of mr young the singingmaster there he was with his funny little moustache twisted up at the ends his bald head with the three or four hairs plastered down the middle his toohigh collar and his eyes large behind their glasses you really are a marvel belinda said betty looking over alicias shoulder at the drawing what will you draw for me if i promise to take over your week of classroom duties when your turn comes thus belinda made her bargains and got out of all the jobs she didnt want to dot miss parker was amazed to find the girls doing so much for belinda belinda exasperated her with her irresponsible ways and she couldnt think why the girls ran round her so much its queer she said to mamzelle they never do mat for irene who is almost as bad do they like belinda so much then i cant see what there is in that silly child to make them fuss round her so much why i even saw gwendoline tidying out her desk for her this morning instead of going off at break ah belinda has the artistic temperament said mamzelle she has no time for such things as tidying desks and making beds i myself have an artistic temperament but in this soenglish school it gets no sympathy you english you do not like such things no we dont said miss parker who had heard a good many times before about mamzelle duponts artistic temperament it usually took the form of groaning over such laborious jobs as marking papers making out long lists and so on mamzelles artistic temperament was always at war with such tasks and she tried in vain to hand them over to more practical people such as miss potts or miss parker we must be patient with such as belinda went on mamzelle how i have suffered because people well believe me belinda will suffer too if she doesnt get rid of some of her ways said miss parker grimly i know what miss potts had to put up with in irene the last year she put a bit of sense into her thank goodness and i can deal with her belindas got to toe the line too its a pity all the girls seem bent on doing so much for her nobody told miss parker the real reason and although she tiled hard to find out she couldnt nobody showed miss parker any of the drawings either belinda had a malicious pencil sometimes and just hit off the weak points in her subjects miss parkers big nose always appeared in her drawings just a little bit bigger than life mamzelle rougier was always bonier than she really was mamzelle dupont was rounder and fatter no the girls certainly didnt want to show those clever caricatures to their teachers the only teacher who was really delighted with belinda was miss linnie the art mistress she was young and lighthearted with a great sense of fun she soon found out belindas gift for art and encouraged her all she could tm going to enjoy myself here said belinda to irene miss linnies thrilled with me and is helping me no end and ive got out of all the silly jobs i hate emilys even going to darn my stockings for me youre lucky said irene enviously i wouldnt mind swopping some of my music compositions if somebody would do jobs for mebut nobody wants the music i write but they all want your funny drawings belinda sorting themselves out the first week went slowly by it always did go slowly and then after that the weeks went faster and faster all the girls had now settled in well and were enjoying themselves the weather kept fine and warm and there was still bathing to be had for those who wanted it the tennis courts were still in use too although the winter game of lacrosse was now being played so there was plenty to do in spare time gwendoline and daphne had become firm friends gwendoline had not had a proper friend during the four terms she had been at malory towers and she was thrilled to have daphne she admired the girls prettiness and her charming ways and loved to hear the stories of her wealthy home the two girls had much in common neither of them liked the water and nothing would persuade them to take a dip in the pool we have to do enough of that each summer objected gwendoline one hot day when her form tried to get her to come along and bathe we dont have to swim this term so fm jolly well not going to anyway you dont really want me to comeall you want me for is to creep behind me and push me in nowe want belinda to see you shivering in your bathing suit putting one toe gingerly into the water said alicia it would make such a comical picture for our classroom wall gwendoline beast said gwendoline who hated to be made fun of she walked off with daphne just because they live violent things like swimming and tennis and rough games they think everyone ought to she said to daphne after alt you and i have never been to school before we came here and well never get used to all their stupid ideas i wish i had been born french then i shouldnt have had to swim if i didnt want to or tire myself out trying to hit a silly ball over a net we have three courts at home said daphne two are hard and one is soft you see mother is a marvellous hostess and she likes to give tennis parties as well as other kinds but of course the ones people really love are the ones she gives on board daddys yacht gwendoline hadnt heard about the yacht before she gazed enviously at her friend perhaps daphne would invite her to stay one summer holiday and then she too could go on this wonderful yacht how pleased her mother would be to know she had made such a fine friend at last you must have hated coming away to school daphne she said leaving all your luxury and having to pig it here i dont expect you ever made your bed in your life before you came here of course i didnt said daphne shaking back her pretty hair and i bet you didnt either no i didnt said gwendoline my governess miss winter always did things like that for me she still does in the holidays shes a stupid old thing but shes useful in those ways she wasnt much good at teaching me though i was awfully backward when i first came here gwendoline still was instead of getting down to things and trying to work really hard all the term to catch up with the others she made a great show and did very little her parents were almost resigned to the fact that her reports always contained the words fair could work harder weak does not use her brains enough poorhas not tried her best her father made plenty of cutting remarks about her reports but as her mother always sympathized with gwendoline and spoilt her his remarks did no good at all except to make gwendoline cross then she would burst into tears and it would be all that miss winter and her mother could do to comfort her gwendoline knew how to turn on her tears all right and daphne knew how to turn on her charming smile it got her out of a good deal of trouble especially with mamzelle dupont miss linnie the art mistress and mr young the singing master mamzelle could not resist that smile daphne could make it sweet pathetic brave affectionateit was extraordinary what a smile could be when daphne presented a badly written french exercise to mamzelle she would turn on her smile and mamzelle would gaze warmly at her ah the pretty child ive done my best mamzelle daphne would say still keeping on her smile but im afraid its not very good yet you seeits so difficult my not having been to school before then the smile would become rather pathetic and mamzelle quite overcome would pat daphnes arm you do your best mes enfant you cannot do more see i will help you if you like to come to me in the evenings for extra work mamzelle would make this generous offer beaming all over her face but daphne was quick enough to deal with it at once she would shake her head regretfully and say how sorry she was but already she had extra work with another mistress then on would come that smile again and the blue eyes would look beseechingly at mamzelle do not make me do all this french work again please mamzelle she would say i have so much to do to catch up with the others my first term and no matter who had their french exercises to do all over again daphne never did she could do anything with mamzelle if only she exerted her charm and put on that ravishing smile unfortunately it worked the other way with miss parker miss potts and mamzelle rougjerespecially with mamzelle rougier who as a rule made it a habit to dislike those girls that the other mamzelle liked and to tike those she didnt she was hard on daphne and soon it became impossible for the girl even to try to smile at her they both disliked one another intensely if it had not been for the unexpected help of somebody else in the class daphne would have had a very bad time and have bad all her work returned from mamzelle rougier that somebody was surprisingly enough marylout marylou had become exceedingly good at french for her mother had had a french girl to look after her in the holidays for the past year and marylou could chatter almost as well in french now as she could in english pleasing both mamzelles immensely maryloo thought daphne was lovely she couldnt help gazing and gazing at her she would never never like her as much as she liked darrell and sally of course but she couldnt help warming to her prettiness and nice manners one day she saw daphne almost in tears over some returned work from mamzelle rougier who had told daphne that she would return it yet again if it was not given in perfect this time marylou went to her cant gwendoline help you she asked timidly shes not doing anything in particular shall i ask her to come and help you daphne dabbed her eyes and turned a watery but still charming smile on marylou no its no good asking gwen shed help if she could but shes not much better than i am at french welli suppose you wouldnt like me to help you would you asked marylou eagerly id like to oh thanks awfully said daphne thrilled youre frightfully good at it i know simply wizard look what have i done wrong here marylou slipped happily into a seat beside daphne and began to explain a few things to her without realizing it she had soon done the whole of the work and daphne smiled to herself and thanked marylou warmly thats all right said marylou shyly she gazed at daphnes curling golden hair youve got beautiful hair she said daphne was like gwen she loved people to admire her and say nice things she looked at little marylou and quite liked her also she thought it would be extremely useful if marylou would always help her with her french i suppose you wouldnt give me a hand with my french sometimes would you she asked i dont want any extra coaching from either of the mamzelles but id love to let you explain things to me you explain very well nobody had ever asked marylou for help before in that way she went brilliant red and swallowed hard id love to she said at last fancy me helping you im the one thats usually always rushing round for help id love to daphne so to the astonishment of the secondformers they saw the curious sight of little marylou sitting by daphne in the evenings at the end of the commonroom carefully explaining the mistakes made in the french exercise of the day before and doing all the next days work for her too said darrell in disgust she didnt like to see the faithful marylou sitting so long with somebody else why marylou had tagged along behind darrell and sally for terms and terms surely she wasnt going to make mat awful daphne her friend let her be said the sensible sally if she wants to help her why not daphne is awful at french but i dont blame her for not taking extra coaching from the mamzelles you know bow irritable mamzelle rougier gets in the evening and you know how long mamzelle dupont keeps you if you do go for extra work youre supposed to go for half an hour and she keeps you two hours i hope daphne wont put any of her silly ideas into marylous head said darrell maybe marylou will put a few sensible ideas into daphnes head said sally i know youre longing to interfere darrell dont the gills soon sorted themselves out in the form making their own friends choosing people to sit next to and go walks with it was nice to have a particular friend and to have someone to confide in sally had darrell and darrell had sally irene had belinda the two became quite inseparable and did one another no good what one forgot the other certainly didnt remember they seemed to make one another worse alicia of course had betty alicia was not as goodtempered as usual she still smarted because she had not been made headgirl and she was not at all nice to sally nor as loyal to her as she should have been sally took no notice but she was not very happy about it gwen had daphne of courseand now marylou seemed to want daphne too how was gwen going to feel about that you neednt worry said daphne to gwen im only using her silly little thing ill let her come out with me sometimes when youre busy because i dont want her to mink i only want her help for my french you can use her too gwen copy my work when ive done it so gwendoline put up with marylous company at times and even said nothing when she went off alone with daphne what did it matter daphne was only using her but all the same daphne couldnt help liking little marylouand it was certainly a change from the silly gwen to have goodhearted marylou trotting by her side once or twice a week the invisible chalk after a few weeks alicia got restless its time we livened things up a bit she said to betty i know were secondformers now and all thatbut theres no reason why we shouldnt have a bit of fun sallys such a borenever a joke never a trick what shall we do said betty her wicked dark eyes gleaming ive got some invisible chalk have you got anything invisible chalk yon never told met said alicia her face brightening what is it show me ive got it in my locker in a box said betty the commonroom will be empty now come along and m show you its queer stuff the two girls went to their commonroom betty opened her locker and took out a tin box inside wrapped carefully in paper was a thick slab of curious pink chalk it doesnt look invisible said alicia what does it do well if you rub it on to a chair it cant possibly be seen said betty and whoever sits down on it makes it warm and it leaves a bright pink patch on a dress or skirt i see said alicia gollywe could rub it on the mistresss chair in our formroomwhen mamzelle rougier is coming perhaps know lets rub it on to mr youngs chair when he comes to take singing said betty on his piano stool then hell sit down hard on it when he plays accompaniment for our songsand when he gets up and turns round to write on the blackboardgolly what a scream alicia laughed loudly it would be better to play it on mr young than on nosey or mamzellehe wont suspect a thingand the first form will have a share in the joke too because they take singing with us alicia cheered up considerably after this she and betty tried out the invisible chalk very carefully and it was a great success betty took a woodenbottomed chair and rubbed the curious pink chalk all over it look she said it doesnt show at all alicia can you see anything of it alicia looked carefully at the chair tipping it this way and that its perfect she said not a thing to be seen funny how you can rub it on and it seems to disappear betty it really is invisible now you sit down on it and let me see what happens betty sat down and remained there for a minute or two the chalk would not work unless it was slightly warmed as betty was sitting solemnly there with alicia watching her gwendoline popped her head in to look for daphne she was astonished to see betty sitting solemnly by herself on a chair with alicia a little way off what are you doing she asked curiously whats happening nothing said alicia buzz off daphnes not here but what are you doing persisted gwendoline suspecting something though she didnt know what why is betty sitting on that uncomfortable chair in the middle of the room like that alicia nosey wants you suddenly cried a voice and jeans head came round the door hurry shes in a stew about something your maths paper i should think blow said alicia and shot off be back in a minute betty she said and ran down the passage jean looked with interest at betty sitting all alone in the middle of the commonroom tired she asked betty scowled she felt foolish she wanted to hurl a book at gwendolines silly golden head but she didnt dare to get up in case she had a nice chalky pattern on her back she didnt want to let anyone else into the trick at the moment paralysed or something poor thing said gwendoline cant get up or perhaps its rheumatism to bettys great relief gwendoline became tired of teasing her and went out to find daphne jean gave a grin and left too betty got up and looked round at herself she gave a chuckle of delight she had a brilliant pink pattern on the skirt of her tunic how extraordinary that the invisible chalk should act like that when it was warmed up alicia came flying in does it work she cried and giggled when betty swung round and showed her the bright pink marks golly its fine i well try it on old mr young tomorrow shall we tell anyone asked betty not a soul said alicia someones sure to give it away by giggling if we do nowell let dear mr young spring this surprise himself on an astonished audience neither betty nor alicia did much prep that night potty who was taking prep looked with suspicion at the two plotters and wondered what was up it was obvious that their thoughts were pleasantly and humorously engaged far elsewhere potty knew the signs she warned miss parker those two in your form alicia and betty are up to something miss parker look out tomorrow youll have an unaccountable smell or a curious noise or an orgy of bookdropping or something thanks said miss parker grimly ill watch out but she could see nothing out of the way in her first lesson or in her second one either the girls worked much as usual only alicia and betty seemed restless but then they often were especially alicia whose quick mind often chafed at the slower rate of the others the lesson before break was singing just before the second lesson was finished betty put up her hand please miss parker its my turn to get things ready for mr young in the singingroom may i go miss parker glanced at the clock yes you have about four minutes betty flashed a quick grin at alicia and went demurely to the door once outside she raced down the corridor and made her way to the singingroom no one was there mr young was always a minute or two late thank goodness betty flew to the piano stool it was the round leathertopped kind that could be screwed round and round betty took out her piece of pink chalk and rubbed it vigorously all over the top of the round stool she was sure there was not a single spot unchalked though of course she could not see anything of what she had done at all it certainly was invisible chalk then she quickly sent the stool spinning round till it was too low for mr young if ever it was too low or too high he had a little habit of sitting on the stool and going round and round with it till it had reached the height he liked if only he did that today it would give the chalk a wonderful chance of getting properly on to him betty stacked the music ready and cleaned the blackboard then there came the sound of feet and the first form marched into the room under the sharp eye of miss potts then came the second form alicias eyes were bright betty grinned at her and winked then she went to hold the door for the two mistresses to go out and for mr young to come in in he trotted a dapper little man in a wellbrushed black suit and a toohigh collar he smoothed his pointed moustache and bowed politely to the girls good morning young ladies good morning mr young they chorused and rustled their songsheets the lesson began mr young took some blackboard drill for five minutes explaining various notes and signs then he went to the piano betty nudged alicia and held her breath but most annoyingly mr young did not sit down he struck a few notes with one hand standing facing the girls as he did so his baton raised exercises please he said i wish to see your mouths well open and to hear the sound coming from the back of the throat mr young set great store on the back of the throat it was always coming into everything exercises songs and sightreading back of the throat was his one unfailing motto now he stood instead of sitting and conducted the exercises alicia was in agonies of disappointment suppose he didnt sit down at all probably the next person then to sit down would be the accompanist of the mistress who taught dancingand she always wore a brightly coloured frock so that the chalk wouldnt show at all what a waste but mr young did sit down eventually of course he had a new song to teach to the girls and as always he wanted to play the whole thing through two or three the chalk ought to be working now times before he taught it so that the girls could catch the hit and swing and tune of it so down he sat aha that stool was once more too low mr young twirled himself vigorously round on it till it was the right height the girls giggled mr young could never realize how funny he was twirling round lightly on that little stool now i will play you your new song said mr young you may sit to listen to it you will hear when the chorus comes for i will sing it to you off he started tumtytumtitam his hands flying up and down and then his voice booming out at the chorus alicia and betty winked at one another the chalk ought to be working now t three times mr young played the song and then he got up did you like it he asked and the girls chorused loudly oh yes mr young mr young turned towards the blackboard and picked up a piece of white chalk at once the girls saw that he was smeared with the brightest pink at the back they stared in delight look at mr young whats he rubbed against oh do look soon the class was in a state of giggle and mr young glared round silence please what behaviour is this today there was a momentary silence but as soon as the unfortunate singingmaster turned back to the board again more giggles broke out then irene gave one of her terrific explosions mr young flung the chalk down on the floor he looked as if he was about to stamp on it and probably he would have done so if the door hadnt suddenly opened and miss grayling appeared she had someone with her oh excuse me for interrupting your class mr young she said but could you just have a word with mr lemming about the piano here mr young had to swallow his annoyance and explain what was wrong with the piano in doing so he turned his back to miss grayling who eyed this patch of brilliant pink with the utmost astonishment the girls were as quiet as mice now and alicia and betty felt distinctly anxious miss grayling turned to sally the head of the second form will you go to the hall and fetch the clothes brush there she said poor mr young has brushed against something sally flew off and fetched the brush mr young was surprised to hear miss graylings remark he looked over his shoulder trying to see himself is it paint he asked in alarm i do hope not ohonly chalk how in the world did it get there oy soon the offending pink chalk had been vigorously brushed away by mr lemming who then proceeded to sit down on the piano stool himself to try out some of the bass notes which had gone wrong alicia and betty watched breathlessly most of the girls guessing that some trick was being played watched eagerly too they were well rewarded when mr lemming rose from the stool he was wearing a long black overcoat and on it was a wonderful pattern of bright pink mr young stared at it in amazement ah you have it tool he cried see miss grayling mr lemming has brushed up against something also i will soon put him right in spite of being under miss graylings eye the girls began to giggle miss grayling looked very puzzled your coat was quite all right when we came along here she said to mr lemming i am sure i should have noticed it if you had brushed against anything so violently pink as this in any case there is no wall as pink as this chalk whatever can have happened she walked to the stool and looked at it very closely alicia and betty hardly dared to breathe but the invisible chalk lived up to its name and miss grayling did not see a sign of it it did not occur to her to sit down and see if the same thing happened to her still feeling puzzled she took mr lemming out of the room and the lesson proceeded again not until the end of it did poor mr young sit down on that stool again when he got up behold he was as pretty a sight as before and the girls stuffed their hankies into their mouths trying not to explode with mirth mr young noticed nothing this time he walked pompously to the door and gave the girls the quick little bow he always kept for them good morning young ladies and out he went showing his patch of brilliant colour as he went the bell for break rang and the girls tore into the court longing to give way to their pentup laughter alicia you had something to do with it what was it oh it was marvellous when be turned round to the blackboard i thought i should die betty darell was it your trick how did you do it i looked at the stool and there wasnt a thing to be seen that reminds me said betty to alicia with a grin i must get a wet cloth and rub it over the stool she disappeared and the girls surged round alicia begging her to tell them the secret meanwhile mr young was walking down one of die long corridors quite unaware of his beautiful decoration mamzelle dopoot happened to come out of a room just behind him and stared disbelievingly at the extraordinary sight she raced after him monsieur young ha monsieur young mr young was scared of both mamzelles he hastened his steps mamzelle ran more quickly monsieur monsieur attendez je vous prie wait wait you cannot go out like that it is terrible mr young swung round annoyed what is it whats terrible this this said mamzelle and tapped him smartly on the chalk a cloud of it flew off at once mr young was horrified at being tapped so familiarly by mamzelle and amazed at the cloud of chalk that sew from his person he wriggled himself round to try and see it remembering what mr lemmings coat had been like i will attend to you said mamzelle out of the kindness of her heart and caught hold of his arm she hurried him to a hallstand took up a brush there and with extremely vigorous strokes she removed the chalk from his clothes he was angry and not at all grateful twice it has happened this morning he said angrily to mamzelle and actually shook his fist in her face as if she was the culprit she backed away alarmed mr young snatched up his hat and went off muttering to himself he is not polite that man said mamzelle to herself i do him a kindness and he puts his fist into my face i will never speak to him again the only girl who had seen this episode in the hall was darrell and she hurried to the others with the titbit i was going past the end of the hall and i saw mamzelle banging at mr young for all she was worth with the clothes brush she panted he was so angry oh do lets do it again alicia its a gorgeous trick it is always a mistake to play the same trick twice running and alicia knew it but she could not resist the temptation to try it on mamzelle dupont shall we she asked betty and betty nodded in glee the girls crowded round to see the queer invisible chalk they chuckled and laughed when they thought of the singinglesson and they let the firstformers into the secret too altogether the trick cheered up everyone considerably and the thought mat they would play it once more gave them something to look forward to who can rub it on the mistresss chair before the french lesson this afternoon demanded betty alicia and i cant weve no chance of being in the room who is room monitor i am said darrell ill do it give me the chalk what do you do just rub it over the chair ten minutes before afternoon school darrell slipped into the secondform classroom it was her job that week to tidy the bookshelves clean the blackboard and see that the chalk was handy and the duster there it took her only a minute to do these things then she went to the chair that stood behind the desk and took the chalk from her pocket she was about to rub it over the seat of the chair when a mischievous idea struck her couldnt she write something short so that a word would appear on mamzelles skirt and send everyone into fits it would have to be a short word ill write oy said darrell to herself in glee ill have to write it backwards so that it will come off on mamzelle the right way round so very painstakingly she rubbed the chalk on the seat of the chair in the form of the two letters o and y oy fancy going about with that written on you how all the girls would yell the bell went for lessons darrell slipped the chalk into her pocket and went to her place she giggled when the rest of the form came in did you do it did you have time whispered the girls darrell nodded then in came mamzelle appearing to be in quite a good temper and the door was shut mamzelle sat down at once she had very tiny feet and did not like standing the girls watched eagerly when would she stand up darrell could hardly wait for her to turn her back to the class what would they say when they saw what she had written on the chair jean was called to the blackboard to write something do it all wrong hissed darrell then mamzelle will get up to correct it so much to mamzelles surprise die usually careful jean made ridiculous mistakes in the french words she wrote down and appeared to be quite unable to put them right despite mamzelles exasperated instructions at last thoroughly annoyed she dismissed jean to her seat and got up to put the mistakes right herself the class saw her back view at once and gasped written across her tightfitting skirt in bright pink letters was the word oy even darrell was surprised to see it so clearly and suddenly felt very uncomfortable it was one thing to make a patch of pink appear on somebodys clothesit could easily be explained awaybut how could the word oy be explained it was quite impossible the class gaped at mamzelles back view they were absolutely taken aback they didnt know whether to giggle or to be alarmed darrell you idiot i suppose she goes walking up the corridor in front of all the other mistresses with that written on her skirt hissed alicia really you might have more sense the thought of me other mistresses seeing mamzelles oy really alarmed the form miss parker would certainly not approve she would consider it most disrespectful but how to get it off that dreadful pink oy flashed back and forth as mamzelle wrote on the board turned to the class to explain and wrote again ill tell mamzelle shes got some dust or something on her skirt and ill brush it off promised darrell in a whisper at the end of the lesson but she had no chance to for mamzelle walked off in a hurry remembering that she was late for the first form next door and the firstformers had the surprise of their lives when they saw mamzelles pink oy flashing at mem every other minute they couldnt keep back their giggles and mamzelle grew more and more furious what is there so funny about me this afternoon she demanded is my hair untidy is my face black are my shoes not a pair no mamzelle said the first form almost helpless with trying to stop their laughter i am not funny and i do not feel fumy said mamzelle severely but i shall soon do some funny things ah yes i shall soon say one hundred lines of french poetry from you please and from you and you aha i shall soon be very funny with that she swung round to the blackboard and the oy flashed again the first form clutched one another in agonies of suppressed laughter but all the same they had the sense to grab mamzelle before she went out of die room well have to get that off her before she goes said hilda or else the secondformers will get into awful trouble i expect they meant to brush it off somehow and didnt have the chance so before mamzelle left the firstform room hilda politely offered to brush down her skirt as it was all dusty with chalk tiens said mamzelle looking down at it this blackboard chalk it is not good for dresses thank you hilda vous ties gentile you are kind she stood like a lamb whilst hilda assiduously brushed her skirt back and front and got rid of the pink oy then she walked out of the room the secondformers who had finished their lesson were watching for her hoping to brush her down themselves before she went off to the little room she shared with miss potts with great relief they saw that mamzelles skirt was now spotless they went back into their formroom and sank down into their chairs thank goodness said alicia we might have got into a firstclass row over mat potty or nosey would certainly have reported it if theyd seen that oy you know how annoyed the mistresses get if they think weve been really disrespectful darrell you were an idiot i suppose salty put you up to it fine head of form she is shut up said darrell annoyed with herself and everyone else too sally had nothing to do with it i just didnt think thats all the term goes on the affair of the invisible chalk was talked about for days afterwards some of the upper school got to hear about it and secretly wished they too could have seen mamzelles oy those in the know grinned at darrell when they met her and whispered oy into her ear it seemed as if everyone thought that the whole idea was darrells and alicia and betty were annoyed about it why should darrell get all the credit when all she had done was to make that word appear on mamzelles skirt and risk getting the whole of the form into very serious trouble the two of them coldshouldered darrell and darrell retaliated by ignoring them as much as she could she knew that alicia was still sore about not being headgirl and was not being nice to sally darrell was loyal and she was not going to have that if she could help it alicias tongue grew wild and sharp again darrell knowing that alicia was trying to make her lose her temper grew red with suppressed rage but said nothing she mustnt lose her temper she mustnt i if she did she would begin to shout she might even throw something at aliciaand then she would put herself in the wrong immediately so she looked as if she was going to burst but didnt and it was very bad for her sally tried to calm her down but that made darrell worse dont you see that its because youre my friend that i get so wild with alicia darrell would say she could say all she liked about me i wouldnt carebut its bard to sit and listen to things about you sally all because shes jealous she just says them because she knows ive got a temper and want to stick up for you well for goodness sake dont go and fall into her trap said the sensible sally that would be idiotic she and betty would have the laugh over you easily so poor darrell had to grit her teeth and say nothing when alicia and betty had one of their crosstalk conversations to bait her dear sally alicia would say always so goodand yet so dull the perfect headgirl dont you think so betty oh i do so agree with you betty would say with a smile that infuriated darrell think what a good example she is to us alldear conscientious sally really i feel overcome with shame at my faults when i see sally sitting so prim and good in class not a joke not a smile such a model for all of us i what should we do without her alicia would go on glancing slyly at darrell to see if she was at burstingpoint yet if darrell got up and went away the two counted it as a victory for thembut poor darrell knew quite well that if she stayed much longer her mouth would open and she would say things she would regret bitterly afterwards so darrells temper was not too good those days and there was someone else whose temper was not good either and that was ellens she had been quite eventempered though rather worriedlooking for the first few weeks and then suddenly she became really irritable she snapped at the girls and the little deft in her forehead deepened until it seemed as if she was always frowning jean tried to find out if anything was the matter sally had tried but ellen seemed to think that sally was just being a good headgirl saying to set her right and stop her being so irritable so she snapped at sally and the headgirl surprised and hurt said no more funny girl she said to darrell i dont understand her shes won a scholarship to malory towers which must mean shes terribly cleverand she works as hard or harder than any of us doand yet shes never top or even in the first three or four i suppose shes cross about that and gets badtempered i dont like her neither do i said darrell shes not worth bothering about sally leave her alone oh i think shes worth bothering about said sally everybody is ill ask jean to have a word with her she sits next to her in class jean was a very forthright girl with little imagination and usually went at things in the way a tank might crushing all resistance insisting on knowing what she wanted to know but for some reason she did not tackle ellen quite in this way she sat next to her in class and she slept next to her in the dormyso she had had plenty of opportunity of hearing ellens unconscious sighs and little groans when she was hard at workor when she was trying to go to sleep i she knew that ellen often lay awake at night and she guessed that ellen was worrying about something it couldnt be her work surelyno scholarship girl needed to worry about work as far as she had seen all scholarship girls found work very easy indeed jean was a kindly girl though sometimes much too blunt in her speech and ways she tried to think bow to get at ellen there didnt seem any way except by asking her straight out what was the matter and couldnt it be put right but that just wouldnt do ellen would snap at once as she did to sally so for once jean gave the matter some thought and did not act as clumsily as she usually did ellen had no friend she did not encourage anyone at an not even the quiet emily jean set herself out to be friendly in unobtrusive ways she would never be able to force oat of ellen what was the matterbut perhaps she could persuade the girl to trust her enough to want to tell her this was really a very praiseworthy idea on jeans part for it was seldom that the blunt scots girl bothered herself to go to a lot of trouble in her dealings with people but she was rather proud that sally had asked her to try her hand at ellen as she herself had failed so although ellen did not realize it at the time jean set herself out to be kind and helpful in all kinds of little ways she helped ellen to hunt for ages for her gym shoes which were lost she sympathized when the photograph of ellens parents got broken and offered to get some glass cat for the frame when next she went to the shops she helped her to dry her hair when she washed it just little things that nobody not even ellen at first noticed very much but gradually ellen grew to trust this shrewd scots girl she told her when she had a very bad headache although she refused to go to matron and ten her too she stopped snapping at jean though she still snapped at everyone elseexcept marylou it would need a very hardhearted badtempered person to snap at little marylou there were some evenings when ellen was quite unbearable really anyone would think she suffered from what my mother calls nerves said alicia one evening jumps at any little thing takes things the wrong way snaps like a bad doglook at her now scowling at her workbasket as if it had bitten her if anyone passed too close to ellen and knocked her elbow she would jump and snap look out cant you see where youre going if anyone interrupted her reading she would slam her book down on the table and glare at the offender cant you see im reading there isnt a quiet place in the whole of this beastly house youre not reading darrell would say you havent turned a page since you took up your book ohso youve been watching me have you ellen would say and her eyes would suddenly fill with tears then she would go out of the room and slam the door isnt she awful scratches like a cat i wish shed won a scholarship to somewhere else always pretending to read and study and yet she slides down lower every week hypocrite i call her och shes not a happy girl maybe she hasnt settled down here yet that was jean of course and sally would flash her a glance of approval jean certainly bad an uphill task with ellen but she was persevering with it the weather was bad just then and there was no lacrosse and not even a walk for the country round about was deep in mud the girls grew restless penned up indoors and the teachers decided that bad weather or not there had better be a school walk the next day everyone groaned the rain poured down the sky was black and lowering the lacrosse fields were half under water whatever would the country lanes be like the sea was an angry greygreen and the wind was so high on the cliff that no girl was allowed up there in case she was blown over gwendoline and daphne grumbled the loudest of all gwendoline developed a persistent sniff in class hoping that miss parker would think she had a cold and let her off the walk but miss parker had been warned by potty of gwendolines sniffs and was not sympathetic if you sniff any more you can go and do it outside the door she said if theres one thing i cannot bear its somebody sniffing its disgusting its unnecessary and in your case it is probably put on gwendoline gwendoline glared why were there no school teachers like her old governess at home miss winter she always rushed for a thermometer at once if gwendoline so much as cleared her throat and would never never dream of making her go out for a walk in such terrible weather i she did not dare to sniff again and was annoyed at darrells grins daphne looked at her sympathetically not that she cared whether gwendoline had a cold or not but it was the thing to dogwendoline simply lapped up sympathy daphne herself tried other tactics to get out of the walk she had no intention at all of wading through miles of mud she went to mamzelle dupont with her exercise book that evening she put on her sweetest smile and knocked at the door of the little room which miss potts shared with mamzelle she hoped fervently that potts wasnt there potty always seemed to be irritated by daphnes presence fortunately potty wasnt there ah it is you ma petite daphne cried mamzelle welcoming her favourite with a smile almost as charming as daphnes you have something to say to me you do not understand something is it not oh mamzelle fm in such a muddle over these tenses said daphne i really do feel that i ought to have a little coaching in them if you could possibly spare the time i do so badly want to get my french better but it has been much better lately my dear child cried mamzelle beaming not knowing that little marylou had been doing most of daphnes french for her i am pleased with you daphne turned on her smile again and mamzelles heart melted still further ah this pretty daphne she put her arm around her yes yes of course i will give you a little extra coaching she said we shall soon put these tenses right you can stay now ma petite no not now mamzelle said daphne but i could give up that lovely country walk tomorrow if you would be good enough to take me then its the only spare time i have the good childto give up the walk that you english girls so dearly love cried mamzelle who thought that all walks were an extremely silly invention yes i can take you then i will tell miss parker you are a good girl daphne i am pleased with you thank you mamzelle said daphne delighted and gave mamzelle a ravishing smile as she went triumphantly out of the room daphne is annoyed miss parker was surprised and annoyed when she heard that daphne was not to go with the class on their long walk she looked crossly at mamzelle but why this sudden desire for french on daphnes pact she said shes just the type of girl that needs a jolly good long walkyes and a muddy one too shake some of her airs and graces off her give her the extra lesson another time mamzelle but mamzelle was obstinate she did not like miss parker with her big nose she pursed up her small mouth and shook her head i cannot take daphne any other time it is good of the girl to give up a nice walk to improve her french miss parker made a disbelieving noise that irritated mamzelle at once she wants to get out of the walk you know mat perfectly well mamzelle its foolish to give her her way like that daphne gets her way too easily and i dont like some of her methods too underhand for me mamzelle stood up for her favourite and began to exaggerate miss parker if you knew how much that girl wanted to go for her walk ah to splash through the autumn lanes ah to sniff the sea air after being cooped up so long daphne has sacrificed her pleasure and she should be praised for that not blamed she will be hard at work with me whilst you are all enjoying yourselves out in the lovely air well she wouldnt take mamzelle rougier in quite so easily as she takes you said miss parker beginning to lose her temper she sees through her all right mamzelle began to bristle i will have a word with mamzelle rougier she began i will have two three four words she shall not say things about daphne who is getting so much better at french lets drop the subject said miss parker feeling heartily tired of daphne go and have it out with mamzelle rougier if you like i dont care except that i feel daphne has got the better of us im glad not to have her with us on the walk moaning and groaning dragging her feet along daphne could not resist telling everyone of the way she had managed to get out of the walk gwendoline wished she had been sharp enough to do the same the others were frankly disgusted with the hypocritical little trick fancy doing all that just to get out of going for a walk said darrell itll be fun splashing through the puddles in our wellingtons wellif you want to spend the afternoon doing french verbs good luck to you thats just like you somehow daphne but the walk didnt come off after all the wind blew itself into a gale and miss parker decided that it must be put off the girls were just putting on their macs and wellingtons when she came to the cloakroom to tell them daphne had already taken her french book to mamzelle girls im sorry but the wind has become a perfect gale said miss parker appearing suddenly in the cloakroom the walk is off but to make up well all go into the gym and have an afternoon of riotous games shall we and ill get matron to let us have a picnic tea in mere to make a change if some of you will carry the stuff the girls cheered an afternoon of jolly games racing round competing with one another laughing yellingand ending up with a picnic tea on the floor that certainly would be a change i matron came up to scratch tooshe provided four super chocolate cakes for a treat as well as two pots of golden honey the girls were thrilled what about daphne miss parker said marylou remembering that daphne was with mamzelle shall i go and fetch her idiot said alicia under her breath fancy reminding miss parker about daphne serve her right to miss all this ill tell marylou what i think of her in a minute miss parker looked down at marylous anxious face and wondered for the twentieth time why marylou bothered about daphne when she had darrell and sally for friends oh marylou no you mustnt disturb daphne said miss parker clearly so that all the listening girls heard quite well she badly wanted to have this extra coaching mamzelle tells me and was quite willing to forgo the walk she would be willing to forgo the games and picnic too i am sure we mustnt disturb her when a girl shows herself to be as studious as that it would be a pity to spoil it all marylou was the only one who did not see the sly humour of miss parkers words the others did immediately and a roar of laughter broke out miss parker smiled too sucks for daphne said alicia serves her jolly well right they had a gay and riotous afternoon and got thoroughly tired and dusty then they sat down to an enormous tea demolishing bread and butter and honey and the four chocolate cakes in no time daphne appeared just as the last piece of cake was eaten she had had an extremely boring afternoon for mamzelle dupont had taken her at her word and had given her some very very thorough coaching in the french verbs she had made poor daphne repeat them after her scores of times she had corrected her pronunciation conscientiously she had even made her write them out daphne wished heartily she had never suggested such a thing she had thought that she would have had a nice cosy time with mamzelle talking about herself but although mamzelle was fond of daphne and quite taken in by her she was determined to do her duty as regards coaching the girl so she kept poor daphnes nose to the grindstone and when daphne faintly protested saying that she thought she had bothered mamzelle enough and the girls would be back from their walk now surely mamzelle poohpoohed the idea at once we shall hear the girls come back she said not knowing that they had never gone out as soon as we hear them you shall go down and join them ma petite and you will enjoy your tea i am sure a good conscience makes us enjoy our food well when mamzelle puzzled by the nonappearance of the girls back from their walk sent daphne down to see what had happened the girl could have burst into tears when she saw the empty plates the cake all gone and the happy faces of the secondformers in the gym you mean pigs she cried you didnt go out after all i and youve had tea without me we couldnt disturb you at your extra french lesson grinned alicia dear miss parker quite agreed it would be a pity to spoil it for you as you were so anxious to have it daphne glared at gwendoline you might have come for me she said you could easily have slipped off and fetched me the only person who tried to get you was marylou said sally she actually went up to miss parker and suggested that she should go and get you marylou doesnt think that extra french is preferable to walks or games daphne looked at marylou and felt warm towards her not even gwendoline her friend bad tried to get her out of that awful french lesson to join the games but marylou had marylou had thought loyally of her thanks marylou said daphne and turned a rather watery smile on her i wont forget that that was decent of you from that time the selfish boastful untrustworthy daphne was nice to marylou not only because the smaller girl helped her so much with her french but because she really liked her and admired her perhaps never before had daphne really liked anyone for themselves marylou of course was delighted she had quite fallen under daphnes spell and was too simple to see the faults in the girls character she was very happy to be with her and delighted to help her whenever she could she did not even see that the help she gave almost amounted to making daphne cheat for many an evening she did practically the whole of daphnes prep for her gwendoline began to be jealous of marylou for she sensed that daphne was really beginning to like her very much but daphne always laughed when gwendoline spoke to her about it you know im only using her she said dont be a mutt gwen youre my friend and i dont want anybody else ive nothing whatever in common with maryloushes a silly little simpleton a stupid little mouse it was a good thing that marylou did not hear these remarks for she would have been shocked and hurt she was very glad to feel that daphne really did like her she often lay in bed thinking of the girls beautiful hair and lovely smile she wished she was as charming as that but she wasnt and never would be daphne did not forgive the others for being mean enough not to warn her when they knew the walk was off she was even a little cold to gwendoline about it and gwendoline fearful of losing her grand friends liking made haste to lick her boots again listening to all daphnes tales with most satisfactory attention sally heard daphne one evening she was sitting near the curtain in the commonroom and the two girls gwen and daphne did not see her didnt i ever tell you about the time my mother gave a party on board our yacht and i sat next to the prince at supper began daphne were you allowed to sit up to supper said gwendoline and whatever did you find to say to a prince oh wellbe seemed to admire my hair and talked to me awfully nicely said daphne beginning to embroider her tale as usual mi stayed up till one oclock that night the yacht was lovely it had little lights all over it and people on land said it looked beautifullike a ship in a fairytale what were you dressed in asked gwendoline oha frilly frock with little pearls all over it and my pearl necklace its worth hundreds of pounds said daphne gwendoline gasped where is it she said oh im not allowed to bring anything like that to school said daphne mothers very strict about things of that sort you know i havent any jeweller hereor grand dressesor anything you havent got no ive noticed thati think its very sensible of your mother said gwendoline sally had got tired of all this grand talk she slipped off the windowsill its a pity your mother didnt supply you with your own lacrosse stick and another pair of shoes and plenty of writingpaper she remarked then you wouldnt have to keep borrowing from everyone else a little less yacht and fewer carsand more envelopes and a book of stamps would be better for you daphne daphne looked haughtily at sally mind your own business she said i was talking to gwen it is my business persisted sally you are always borrowing from one or other of usand you never pay backl as youre so rich you ought to use some of your plentiful pocketmoney to buy the things you lack beast said daphne as sally went out of the room shes jealous of me i supposejust because her people arent as welloff as mine the two mamzelles halfterm came and went sally and darrell went out together with darrells parents and had a lovely tune to gwendolines disappointment daphnes parents did not visit her so there was no chance of being asked out to meals with daphne or going off in a magnificent car i wanted to see your mother said gwendoline she looks so lovely in her photo on daphnes dressingtable stood a photograph of a very beautiful woman in a flowing evening gown with gleaming jewels round her lovely neck everyone had admired it yea arent much like your mother all the same said darrell critically to daphne shes got wideset eyesand yours are rather near together and your nose isnt the same everybody isnt always like their mother said daphne i take after my fathers family i suppose i have an aunt who is very very beautiful and i suppose you are considered to resemble her daphne said jean in her quiet amused voice what it is to have beautiful and distinguished relatives i have a plain mother whos the kindest darling on earthand quite an ugly fatherand all my aunts are as plain as i am but i dont care a bit theyre jolly good fun and i like the whole lot gwendoline asked daphne if she would like to go out with her at halfterm and daphne accepted graciously mrs lacey gwendolines mother was very struck with the beautiful girl and her charming smile as for miss winter the governess who always most faithfully came to see her darling gwen every halfterm she could hardly take her eyes off her which annoyed gwendoline very much such a nice friend for you dear said mrs lacey to gwendoline such beautiful manners and how rich her people must be to own a yacht and all those cars wouldnt it be nice if you could go and stay with them ssh mother said gwendoline afraid that daphne would hear but daphne was far too busy charming poor miss winter she played up to gwendoline very well too remarking on her friends brilliance her clever comments in class and what a favourite she was with the teachers mrs lacey listened with pride and pleasure well you never told me these things in your letters gwen darling she said fondly youre too modest gwendoline felt a little embarrassed and began to hope that daphne wouldnt lay it on too thicklyif she did her mother would expect a wonderful report and gwendoline knew perfectly well there was no hope of that belinda and irene went out together both forgetting their hats and both returning without their gloves they went with belindas parents who appeared to be as bad as belinda herself for they lost the way when bringing the girls back to malory towers and turned up over an hour late much to miss barkers annoyance she could not bear the timetable to be played about with but neither belinda nor irene noticed her cold manner as they went noisily into the room to report their return to her alicia and betty had gone out together of course and had come back fun of giggles apparently one of alicias brothers had been in the party and had related with much gusto all the tricks that he and his class had been up to that term to everyones surprise jean had asked the badtempered irritable ellen to come out with her i ellen had refused at first rather ungraciouslyand then had unexpectedly said she would but it had not been a very pleasant outing for ellen had been rather silent and had not tried in any way to be pleasant to her hosts she seemed sunk into herself and jean was sorry she had asked her you might have been a bit more cheerful ellen she said as they came into the school again you hardly spoke and you didnt laugh once even when my father made some quite good jokes well dont ask me out again then said ellen snappily and turned away jean caught the gleam of tears in her eyes funny girl so touchy that nobody could say a word to her without getting their head bitten off jean was beginning to be tired of her efforts to be nice to ellen now we can look forward to christmas said darrell with satisfaction halfterms over weve got those awful french plays to mug up now groaned alicia whatever possessed the two mamzelles to think up such a horrible thing for the second form to do who wants to see us perform french plays each form had to produce some sort of entertainment at the end of the term it was the lot of the second form to learn two french plays one chosen by mamzelle dupont the other by mamzelle rougier it was over the choosing of the girls to play the different characters in these plays that the two mamzelles almost came to blows in one play there was a princessthe princess trueheart in the other there was an angelthe angel of goodness mamzelle dupont wanted her favourite daphne to play both parts she pictured the pretty goldenhaired girl as the princessah how wonderful she would look and as an angel truly daphne was made for the part of an angel but mamzelle rougier unfortunately had quite different ideas what you would choose that imbecile of a daphne to play two good parts like that scoffed mamzelle rougier she could never learn half the wordsand her pronunciation is abominable you know it i will not have that girl in a good part ah but she will look the part to perfection cried mamzelle dupont sweeping her arms wide apart to emphasize her words she looks a real princessand when she smiles it is truly the smile of an angel bah said mamzelle rougier rudely she is one of your favourites your little pets now sally would do well in one of those partsshe would learn well and her pronunciation is good or darrell or even marylou would be better than daphne for she at least speaks french as it should be spoken you are mad cried mamzelle dupont as if any of those girls could play such parts as these i insist on daphne playing the parts then i shall not have anything to do with the plays said mamzelle rougier stiffly it is always a mistake to do as you do mamzelle dupont and have favouritesand when it comes to forcing them on me it is finished i do not have favourites said mamzelle dupont untruthfully tapping her foot on the ground i like all the girls just the same mamzelle rougier snorted disbelievingly then you are the only one who thinks so she said good day mamzelle i cannot stand arguing here talking nonsense about such girls as daphne she swung round and walked off stiffly holding her thin bony body like a stick flump little mamzelle dupont stared after her angrily favourites indeed i how dared mamzelle say things like that to her never would she speak to mamzelle rougier again never never never she would leave malory towers she would go back to her beloved france she would write to the newspapers about it mamzelle dupont made a noise nice the growling of a dog and startled miss potts considerably as she came in at the door dont you feel well mamzelle she said rather alarmed at mamzelles red face and glaring eyes i do not feel at all well i have been insulted said mamzelle dupont i am not to be allowed to choose the girls in my own plays mamzelle rougier objects to my choosing the pretty charming daphne for the princess she will not even allow meme mamzelle dupontto give her the part of the angel of goodness well i must say i agree with her said miss potts sitting down and arranging her papers daphne always seems a doublefaced little creature to me you too are in the plot against me said mamzelle going all dramatic and working herself up into a tearful rage you too ah these cold english people ah these miss potts was very glad indeed to hear a knock at the door at that moment she didnt like dealing with mamzelle in these moods matron came in smiling can i have a word with you mamzelle she asked no you cannot said mamzelle fiercely i am upset my heart it beats soand soand so but i tell you thiswill choose what girl i wish for my plays ahhhh and making a noise like a dog again mamzelle walked angrily from the room leaving matron quite stupefied whatever is she talking about she asked miss potts oh shes had some sort of upset with the other mamzelle said miss potts beginning to add up marks they get across one another at times you know but this appears to be more serious than usual well theyll have to sort out their own tangles mamzelle dupont and mamzelle rougher took it in turns to train the girls in the two french plays mamzelle dupont put daphne into the two principal parts each time she took the play much to the girls gratification but equally promptly mamzelle rougier relegated her to a minor part the next day and put sally and darrell into the principal ones it was most muddling neither mamzelle would give way the quarrel appeared to be deadly and serious they looked the other way when they met they never spoke to one another the girls thought it was a great joke but on the whole they took mamzelle duponts part for they liked her much the better of the two they did not approve of her choice of daphne for the principal parts but that couldnt be helped belinda intrigued by the quarrel did a masterly set of caricatures of mamzelle rougier taller and bonier than ever she drew her with a dagger in her hand stalking poor mamzelle dupont she drew her hiding behind a bosh with a gun she drew her pouring poison into a teacup to present to her enemy the girls giggled over the pictures alicia was very struck by them a wicked idea came into her head belinda mamzelle dupont would adore these pictures you know what a sense of humour she has she ought to see them put them on her desk tomorrow afternoon just before she takes french translation and watch her face when she opens the book bet we shant have any french translation tomorrow afternoon once she sees the pictures giggled betty and the others agreed belinda bound the pictures neatly into a book she had put no name to them but they were so cleverly drawn that anyone could see at once that they were meant to represent the two mamzelles ill pop it on the desk just before the afternoon class she said and you can jolly well an of you do my prep for me tonight to repay me for getting you off your french translation tomorrow alicia whispered something to betty betty looked startled and then grinned broadly alicia had just told her something interesting it isnt mamzelle dupont whos taking us tomorrow its mamzelle kougier watch out for fireworks a shock for the second form the book of drawings was placed on the classroom desk in good time the girls stood in their places excited waiting for mamzelle to come how she would roar at the pictures how she would enjoy the joke against her enemy mamzelle rougier alicia was holding the door it had been quite by chance that she had heard that the lesson was to be taken by mamzelle rougier instead of mamzelle dupont she hugged herself secretly when she thought of the bombshell she had prepared it would pay back mamzelle rougier for many a sharp word she had given alicia quick footsteps came down the passage the girls stiffened somebody came in at the door and went to the deskbut it wasnt the mamzelle they bad been expecting it was of course the other one mamzelle rougier seated herself and addressed the class asseyez vous sil vous plait some of the girls forgot to sit down so overcome with horror were they to think that mamzelle rougier was sitting there with that book of caricatures right under her nose mamzelle rapped on her desk are you deaf sit they sat belinda stared beseechingly round she caught alicias satisfied grin and felt angry so alicia had known that mamzelle rougier was coming instead of mamzelle dupontand had used her as a cats paw to play a very dangerous trick everyone knew what mamzelle rougiers temper was like she would probably go straight to the head belinda didnt know what to do darrell saw how alarmed she was and did a bold thing she got up and walked to mamzelles desk and put her hand on the book tm sorry this was left here by mistake mamzelle she said politely she almost got away with it but not quite the girls stared breathlessly wait a minute said mamzelle rougier books left on the desk must not be removed without permission what is this book ohonly aa sketch book said darrell desperately mamzelle glanced round the silent class why were they all looking and listening so intently there was something curious here she took up the book and opened it her glance fell on the picture of herself stalking mamzelle dupont with a dagger she stared at it incredulously there she was in the picture tall thin bonypositively evillookingand with a dagger too she turned over a page what here she was againwith a gun ah no this was too much she turned another page and another always she saw herself there unkindly caricatured pursuing poor mamzelle dupont who had been given a most amiable look and was obviously the heroine whilst she mamzelle rougier was the villain this is unbelievable said mamzelle under her breath almost forgetting darrell who stood petrified nearby and all the other waiting girls belinda was very pale what bad luck whatever would happen now oh why had she been such an idiot as to let alicia lead her into this silly trapjust to make alicia and betty enjoy seeing her well ticked off mamzelle became aware of the girls again she snapped at darrell and made her jump go back to your place darrell fled thankfully mamzelle looked round the class raking them with cold angry eyes who has done this who has committed the insult of placing this book beneath my eyes sally spoke up at once were all in it mamzelle but we didnt mean you to see the book we meant it for mamzelle dupont we didnt know you had changed over lessons today this was unfortunately the worst possible thing that sally could have said mamzelle shot to her feet at once her eyes stony what you meant to give this to mamzelle dupont you meant her to laugh at me with you is that what she does behind my back ah how glad i am to know how she behaves this shameful frenchwoman she shall know of this i go to miss grayling at oncethis very minute the class sat in horrified silence it had not occurred to them that it might be insulting to mamzelle rougier to show the book of comical drawing to mamzelle dupont belinda felt faint mamzelle dont go to miss grayling i but the class were not going to let belinda take the blame even alicia looked scared now many of the girls spoke at once drowning poor belindas faint voice mamzelle were sorry dont report us but mamzelle swept by a cold fury was already departing out of the door the girls looked at one another in real horror aliciayou knew mamzelle rougier was coming this afternoon instead of mamzelle dupont said belinda i saw you wink at betty you knew and you used me to play one of your nasty tricks id never have shown those pictures to mamzelle rougier and you know it alicia was truthful whatever her faults were she did not deny it i didnt know shed make such a fuss she said rather feebly alicia youre a beast said darrell feeling a hot flame working up inside her you might have thought what serious trouble youd get belinda into you you leave me to deal with this said sallys quiet voice behind her dont get all worked up darrell ill deal with alicia oh will you said alicia spitefully well you wont if you think youre going to tick me off youre not miss headoftheform goodgirloftheschool sally hope dont be silly said salty in disgust i cant think whats come over you lately alicia you are always trying to make things difficult for me fm going down to the head myself this very minuteand youre to come too belinda well try to get things put straight before they go too far youll put the whole blame on to me of course said alicia scornfully i know you get belinda out of trouble and me into it i shant say anything about you said sally im not a sneak but id think a lot better of you if you came along with us and explained your part in the affair i dont care what you think of me said alicia getting angry im not going to tag along at your heels and say please i did it youre not going to make me do anything i dont want to do im not going to try said sally come on belinda lets go before its too late poor belinda looking frightened out of her life went along the passage and down the stairs and out into the court they made their way to the head mistresss room oh sallyits awful said belinda all her high spirits and tightheartedness gone mamzelle was so fierce and those pictures were rather beastly some of them when the girls knocked on the door of the head mistresss drawingroom they heard voices inside miss grayling was there and mamzelle rougierand miss linnie the art mistress she had been called in to see if she could tell them who had done the clever and malicious drawings belinda morris of course she said after a glance theres no girl in the school as clever as she is at sketching shell be a firstclass artist one of these days my wordthese are clever clever snorted mamzelle they are wicked they are disrespectful they are bad bad bad i demand that you punish this girl miss grayling i demand that the whole class shall be severely punished too just at mat moment salty knocked at the door come in said miss grayling and the two girls entered well said miss grayling sally swallowed hard it was all very difficultespecially as mamzelle was glaring at her so fiercely miss grayling she began were very very sorry about this what is this to do with you asked miss grayling i thought belinda did the pictures yes i did said belinda in a low voice but it was the whole class who wanted to put them on the deskand let mamzelle dupont see them said sally butmamzelle rougier came instead and she saw them fm very sorry about it but why should you picture mamzelle rougier pursuing her friend in such a murderous manner asked the head looking through the book i dont see why mat should interest or amuse mamzelle dupont there was a silence then mamzelle rougier spoke stiffly we are not friends mamzelle dupont and i and before miss grayling could stop her mamzelle had poured out her grievance over the plays miss grayling listened gravely then she turned to the girls then do i understand that one day the chief characters are played by sally and darrell and the next day by daphne she asked sally said yes that was what had happened mamzelle rougier suddenly looked rather ashamed it occurred to her that she and mamzelle dupont had been very silly and had allowed their private quarrel to muddle up the play and make things awkward for the girls she wished she had thought twice about taking the book down to the head no wonder the girls had put the quarrel into those stupid drawingsbut why did they make her the villain and mamzelle dupont the heroine ah that was not nice you didnt know then that mamzelle rougier was going to take the class instead of mamzelle dupont said the head suddenly sally hesitated a fraction of a second alicia had knownand betty too but she sally hadnt known nor had any of the others i didnt know that of course miss grayling she said did anyone know persisted the head sally did not know how to answer she did not want to tell tales but she could not very well say nothing belinda broke in yes someone knewand that someone used me for a cats paw id never never have shown those drawings to mamzelle rougier i wont tell who it wasbut do believe me when i say i wouldnt have hurt mamzelle rougiers feelings for anything it was just a joke yes i see that said miss grayling an unfortunate joke of course but still a joke a joke that was played on the wrong person and caused anger and distress as i see it quite a lot of people are to blame in this she glanced at mamzelle rougier who grew rather red there was a quarrel it seems to start with without that possibly all this would not have occurred you two girls may go now i will discuss with mamzelle what punishment is fitting for you all in silence belinda and sally went out of the door miss linnie came with them mamzelle rougier was left behind as miss grayling had made her a sign to stop belinda youre an idiot said miss linnie ill never draw anyone again said belinda dismally oh yes you win said miss linnie but youll probably draw kinder pictures in future dont be too clever belindait always lands you into trouble sooner or later mamzelle dupont puts things right upstairs something was happening mamzelle dupont had come past the door of the second form and had found it open on looking in she had found to her surprise that mamzelle rougier had apparently deserted her form and left the girls alone more surprising still the girls were sitting as quiet as miceand what long faces what is the matter mes petites cried mamzelle her little beady eyes ranging over the silent class what has happened marylou thoroughly upset by everything gave an unexpected sob mamzelle turned to her marylou was one of her pets for marylou could chatter french perfectly what is wrong then tell me i am i not your friend what is this that has happened oh mamzellean awful thing has happened burst out marylou belinda did some pictures of you and mamzelle rougier nice ones of you but awful ones of mamzelle rougierand we didnt know mamzelle was coming instead of you this afternoon and we put the book on the desk for you to see and and ah mamzelle rougier she saw them instead and she has gone blue in the face and she has taken belinda and poor sally to miss grayling cried mamzelle ah this badtempered woman she cannot see a joke i i myself will go to see miss grayling i will tell her one two three things about mamzelle rougier ahhh and off went mamzelle dupont scuttling along on her high heels like a harassed rabbit the girls looked at one another what an afternoon mamzelle did not meet belinda and sally for they went different ways just at the moment that she knocked at miss graylings door sally and belinda walked into the classroom looking rather gloomy they reported what had happened so you did split on me after all said alicia in disgust we didnt even mention your name said belinda so you neednt be afraid alicia im not afraid said alicia but she was she hadnt been in miss graylings good books lately and she knew it she didnt want to be hauled over the coals for this now but she didnt like the girls scornful glances mamzelle duponts gone off to join the merry family now said darrell i wonder what is happening mamzelle dupont had swept into the heads drawingroom startling both miss grayling and mamzelle rougier miss grayling was just getting an account of the quarrel between the two french mistresses from a rather shamefaced mamzelle rougier when the other mamzelle swept in she saw the book of drawings at once and picked them up she examined them ah ha ha this belinda is a genius ha halook at me here miss graylingdid you ever see such a plump rabbit as i look and oh mamzelle rougier what are you doing with that dagger it is marvellous wonderful i but see here i am to be poisoned mamzelle dupont went off into peals of laughter she wiped the tears from her eyes you do not think it is funny she said in astonishment to the other mistresses but looklookhere i am to be shot with this gun as if my good friend mamzelle rougier would do such a thing to me ah we quarrel sometimes she and i but it matters nothing we are two frenchwomen together nest ce pas mamzelle rougier and we have much to put up with from these bad english girls mamzelle rougier began to look a little less frigid miss grayling looked at one or two of the pictures and allowed herself to smile this one is really very funny mamzelle dupont she said and this one too of course the whole thing is most disrespectful and i want you both to say what punishment we must give the classand especially of course belinda there was a silence i feel began mamzelle rougier at last i feel miss grayling that perhaps mamzelle dupont and i are a little to blame for an thisour stupid quarrel you knownaturally it intrigues the girlsand ah yes you are right cried mamzelle dupont fervently you arc quite quite right my friend it is we who are to blame miss graylingwe demand no punishment for the bad bad girls we will forgive them mamzelle rougier looked a little taken aback why should mamzelle dupont forgive them they hadnt drawn her unkindly but mamzelle dupont was rushing on in her headlong way these pictures they are more funny than bad it is a tease a joke is it not we do not mind it was our stupid quarrel that started it but now now we are friends are we not mamzelle rougier mamzelle rougier could not say no to that swept away in spite of herself she nodded mamzelle dupont gave her two sudden and exuberant kisses one on each cheek miss grayling was much amused that belinda said mamzelle dupont looking at the drawings again ah what a clever child one day maybe miss grayling we shall be proud of these drawings when belinda is famous mamzelle rougier and i we shall look together with pride on these pictures and we shall say ah the little belinda did these for us when she was in our class mamzelle rougier said nothing to this she was feeling that she had been made to do all kinds of things she hadnt meant to do but she couldnt go back on what she bad said now that was certain well perhaps you would go back to your classes now suggested miss grayling and you win tell the girls and set their minds at rest belinda must apologize of course but i think youll find she will do that without any prompting the two mamzelles departed arminarm the girls they met stared at them in surprise for everyone knew that the two had been bitter enemies for the last week or so they went up to the second form who stood in silence glad to see mamzelle looking so cheerful and the other mamzelle not quite so sour as usual mamzelle dupont set their minds at rest you have been bad girls very bad girls belinda you let your pencil run away with you i am shocked she didnt look shocked her beady black eyes twinkled belinda stood up i want to apologize she said rather shakily to both of you mamzelle rougier didnt see any necessity for belinda to apologize to mamzelle dupont but she didnt say so she accepted the apology as graciously as she could and now for punishment said mamzelle dupont in a stem voice but still with twinkling eyes for punishment you will pay better attention to your french lessons than you have ever done before you will learn well you will translate marvellously you will be my best pupils is that not so oh yes mamzelle promised the girls fervently and for the time being at any rate even gwendoline and daphne meant it mamzelle rougier went mamzelle dupont took over for the five remaining minutes of the lesson please said darrell at the end mamzelle will you tell us who is to take the chief parts in the french plays were doing its so muddling not knowing perhaps you and mamzelle rougier have settled it now we have not said mamzelle dupont but i i am generous today i will let the poor mamzelle rougier have her way to make up to her for the shock you have given her this morning i will not take daphne for the chief parts you darrell and sally shall have them that will please mamzelle rougier and put her into such a good mood that she will smile on you all daphne was not too pleased about this she looked at mamzelle rather hurt all the same it was a good thing she thought because how she was ever going to learn all that french talk in the play she really didnt know perhaps it would be just as well if she didnt have the chief parts after all she would look hurt but be very sweet and generous about it so looking rather stricken she spoke to mamzelle its just as you like mamzelle i had been looking forward to swotting up my parts for youbut i hope im generous enough to give them up to others without a fuss the kind girl said mamzelle beaming i will make it up to you daphne you shall come to me and we will read together a french book i loved when i was a girl ah that will be a treat for both of us the class wanted to laugh when they saw daphnes horrified face read a french book with mamzelle how dreadful she would have to get out of that somehow the affair of the drawings had three results alicia was sulky because she felt she bad come out very badly in the matter and she knew that sally and darrell and some of the others didnt think very much of her because of it the two mamzelles were firm friends now instead of enemies and daphne was now given a very minor part indeed in the plays where she would not appear as someone beautiful but only as an old man in a hood she was very much disgusted especially as ive written and told my people all about my fine parts she complained its a shame yes it is said gwendoline never mind daphneyou wont have to do all that swotting now jean came up with a box at that moment she jingled it under their noses have you got your games sub you two were collecting it today five bob each heres mine said gwendoline getting out her purse yours please daphne said jean daphne took out her purse blow she said i thought i had ten shillings but theres only a sixpence oh yesi had to buy a birthday present for my governess last week gwen lend me the money till i get some from home will you she lent you two bob last week said jean jingling the box again i bet you didnt pay her back and you borrowed sixpence off me for church collection let me tell you why dont you keep a little book showing your debts what do little sums like that matter said daphne annoyed ill be getting pounds and pounds on my birthday soon anyway i can pay back this week my uncle is sending me thirty shillings well ill ill lend you five bob till then said gwendoline and put a tenshilling note into the box jean turned to darrell and collected her money she went to ellen and jingled the box under her nose five bob please ellen dont do that under my nose said ellen jumping what is it you want five shillings well i havent got it on me just now ill give it to you later you said that last time said jean who was a most persistent person when it came to collecting money go onget it ellen and then the collection will be finished im working said ellen annoyed take the thing away ill give you the five shillings soon jean went off also annoyed daphne spoke in a low voice to gwendoline i bet she hasnt got the five bob to give she won a scholarship here but i dont believe her people can really afford to keep her at a school like this ellen didnt quite hear what was said but she knew it was something nasty by daphnes sneering tone she flung down her book cant anybody work in this place she said stop your whispering daphne and take that smile off your silly face poor ellen really said daphne as ellen walked out of the room and banged the door what awful manners that girls got whats the matter with her nobody knew nobody guessed that ellen was getting more and more worried about her work she knew that the end of term tests were coming along and she wanted to come out well in them she must so she was working hard every minute and she had begun to feel at last that she would be able to face the tests and do well but that evening she did not feel very well her throat hurt her her eyes hurt her especially when she moved them about she coughed surely she wasnt going to be ill that would put her terribly behind in her work it would never do so ellen dosed herself with cough lozenges and gargled secretly in the bathroom hoping that matron would not notice anything wrong her eyes were too bright that evening her usually pale cheeks were red she coughed in prep miss potts who was taking prep looked at her do you feel all right ellen she asked oh quite all right miss potts said ellen untruthfully and bent her head over her book she coughed again dont like that cough said miss potts i think perhaps you had better go to oh miss potts its only a tickle in my throat said ellen desperately perhaps id better get a drink of water well go then said miss potts still not quite satisfied so ellen went she leaned her hot head against the cool wall of the cloakroom and wished miserably that she had someone she could confide in but her snappiness and irritability had put everyone against hereven jean jean had tried to be niceand ellen hadnt even bothered to go and get the games subscription for her i dont know whats come over me lately thought the girl i used not to be like this surely i had plenty of friends at my other school i wish id never left there i wish id never won a scholarship she must go back her throat still hurt her and she slipped a lozenge into her mouth then she went back to the classroom trying to walk firmly though her legs felt rather wobbly she had a high temperature and should have been tucked up in bed but she wasnt going to give in she must do her work she mustnt get behind she must do well in the tests whatever happened she tried to learn some french poetry but it buzzed round and round in her head she began to cough again oh shut up said alicia in a whisper youre putting it on to get pottys sympathy that was so like alicia she didnt like people who coughed or sniffed or groaned she had no sympathy to spare for those who needed it she was a healthy strong clever girl who had never been ill in her life and she scorned stupid people or those who were delicate and ailing or in trouble she was hard and it didnt seem as if she was getting any kinder darrell often wondered how she could so badly have wanted alicia to be her friend when she had first come to malory towers ellen looked at alicia with dislike i cant help it she said tm not putting it on she sneezed and alicia gave an exclamation of disgust dont go to bed if youre as bad as all that silence said miss potts annoyed alicia said no more ellen sighed and tried to concentrate on her book again but she couldnt she was glad when the bell went and she could get up and go out into the cooler air she was hot and yet she shivered oh blow she certainly was in for a cold perhaps it would be better tomorrow she tried to stuff some food down her throat at suppertime in case miss parker noticed she wasnt eating anything miss parker did not often take any notice of ellen she was usually a quiet girl with a name for bad temper and miss parker was not at all interested in her though sometimes surprised that her work was not better it was sally who noticed that ellen seemed ih that night she heard her quick rather hoarse breathing and looked at her in concern she remembered how ellen had coughed in prep poor ellenwas she feeling simply awful and not wanting to make a fuss sally was both sensible and kind she went to ellen and took her hot hands ellen youre not well let me go with you to matron silly the little act of kindness made the tears start to ellens eyes but she shook her head impatiently im all right leave me alone just got a headache thats all poor old ellen said sally youve got more than a headache come along to matron you ought to be in bed but ellen wouldnt go it was not until jean came up and sympathized with her that she broke down and confessed that yes she really did feel awful but she couldnt possibly go to bed with all that work to do before the tests i must do well you see she kept saying i must the tears ran down her cheeks as she spoke and she suddenly shivered you wont do any good by keeping up when you should be in bed said jean come along ill keep you well posted in what we do in lessons i promise you in make notes for you and everything i oh will you said poor ellen coughing ah right then if youll help me to catch up ill go and see matron now perhaps just one day in bed will put me right but one day was certainly not going to put ellen right she was very ill and matron put her to bed in the san at once ellen was so thankful to be there that she couldnt help crying she was ashamed of herself but she couldnt stop the tears now dont you worry said matron kindly you should have been in bed days ago by the look of you silly child now you just lie still and enjoy a week in bed a week ellen started up in horror she couldnt possibly miss a weeks work she stared at matron in dismay matron pushed her back dont look so horrified youll enjoy it and as soon as you feel like it and your cold is not infectious you can choose a visitor poor ellens really ill said jean as she went back to the others i dont know what her temperature is but i saw matrons face when she took it and it must be pretty high she coughed like anything in prep tonight said sally i felt sorry for her well alicia didnt said gwen maliciously she told her to shut up dear kind alicia alicia glared she was always making sharp remarks about gwenbut this time gwen had got gbq back at herand alicia didnt much like it on we all know that alicia cant bear to give a little sympathy out said darrell unable to stop herself she had felt annoyed with alicia lately because she had been so offhand with sally also she had thought that alicia should certainly have owned up that it was she who had known mamzelle rougier was going to take the lesson instead of mamzelle dupont she had made belinda get into a row when she could have prevented it alicia too was ashamed of this cow but it was too late to do anything about it there was no point in owning up now that the matter was closed but she kept kicking herself for not doing so at the right tune she had been too obstinate she was sorry too that she had been bard on ellen that eveningbut how could she know she was really ill she hadnt any time for that silly ellen always snapping and snarling at everyone let her be ill a good thing if she was away from the class for a while she wouldnt miss her ellen felt very ill for four days then she felt a little better her temperature went down and she began to take a little more interest in things but alas her old worry came back immediately she was well enough to think clearly those tests she knew that on the result of the tests depended her place in form and it was very important that she should be top or nearly top her father and mother were so very proud that she bad won the scholarship to such a fine school they were not welloff but they had told ellen they would do anything they could to keep her at malory towers now that she had won the right to be there by her own hard work the uniform had been so expensive even the train fare was expensive it was a good thing she had been able to get a lift down in somebodys car mother had bought her a new trunk and a new suitcase more expense oh dearwas it really a good thing to win a scholarship to a school like malory towers if you had to count your pennies perhaps it wasnt then another thought struck her she had had to have the doctor that would be another expense on the bill and all the time she was losing her school work and would do badly her first term her parents would be bitterly disappointed so ellen worried and worried the matron and the nurse couldnt think why she did not throw off her illness as quickly as she should every day she begged to be allowed to get up but matron shook her head no you cant dear youre not quite right yet but would you like a visitor now you can have one if you like oh yes id like jean please said ellen at once jean bad promised to take notes for her jean would tell her all about the lessons she had missed jean was dependable and reliable so jean came to see her bringing a pot of honey but it was not honey that ellen wanted she hardly even glanced at it did you bring the notes you said you would make for me she asked eagerly oh jeandidnt you good gracious mewhat do you want notes of lessons for already demanded jean in astonishment youre not even up oh i do i do said ellen you promised jean well bring them next time you tell me all the lessons youve had now jean screwed up her eyes and tried to remember she thought ellen queer to want to talk about lessons instead of games or fun she began to tell ellen well in maths we did those new sums again i can bring you some to show you and in french we learnt that long piece of poetry on page sixtyfour i can recite some of it if you like and for geography we learnt matron bustled up jean ellen mustnt hear a word about lessons yet i she mustnt start worrying her head about work she couldnt help missing it and miss parker and mamzelle will quite understand that she will be a bit behind when she comes back ellen stared at her in consternation but matron i must know it all i must oh do let jean tell me and shes going to bring me some lesson notes shes made for me too well she certainly mustnt i forbid it said matron so that was that ellen took no more interest in jeans conversation she lay back desperate shed be near the bottom now i how unlucky she was ellen has a bad idea nobody missed ellen very much she hadnt any of darrells high spirits or friendliness none of alicias mischief or fun she hadnt even the shyness and timidity of marylou that made her missed when she wasnt there you dont much notice marylou when shes there under your nosebut you do miss her when shes not said darrell once and that was true darrell was missing marylou quite a lot these days for marylou was attaching herself firmly to daphne nobody could quite understand it nobody believed that daphne wanted marylous friendshipshe only wanted her help in french even when darrell pointed out that it was almost cheating for marylou to do such a lot for her she would hardly listen i cant do much to help anybody said marylou its only in french that im really goodand its so nice to help somebody who wants it and besidesdaphne does really like me darrell well so do i like you and so does sally said darrell really exasperated to think that marylou should attach herself to such a doublefaced person as daphne yes i know but you only put up with me out of the kindness of your heart said marylou youve got sally you let me tag along behind you like a nice puppybut you dont really want me and i couldnt possibly help you in any way but i can help daphneand though i know you think shes only using me for her french shes not darrell was certain that daphne only put up with marylou because of the frenchbut she wasnt quite right daphne was very fond of marylou now she couldnt quite think why because it wasnt like her to be fond of anyonebut marylou was so unobtrusive so shy so willing to help in any way shes like a pet mouse that you want to protect and take care of thought daphne you cant help liking a mouse she poured out her tales of wealth to marylou and marylou listened in the most gratifying manner the younger girl was proud that someone as grand as daphne should bother to notice her and talk to her and tell her things ellen was away from school eleven days and bad worried terribly the last six or seven because jean had not been allowed to bring her lessonnotes or to tell her about the lessons now she came bade pale a little thinner with an obstinate look in her eyes she was going to catch up somehow i if she had to get up at six in the morning and learn her lessons under the sheets by means of a flashlight she would she asked miss parker if she would be kind enough to give her extra coaching in what she had missed miss parker refused in a kindly manner no ellen youre not up even to your ordinary work at the moment let alone taking extra coaching i shant expect much from you nor will anyone else so dont worry ellen went to mamzelle dupont and even to mamzelle rougier i do so want to know what ive missed so that i can make it up she said could you give a little extra coaching but neither of the mamzelles would you are not yet quite strong man enfant i said mamzelle dupont kindly no one will expect you to do brilliantly now this term take things more easily so poor ellen was quite in despair nobody would help her they all seemed to be in league against hermatron doctor miss parker the two mamzelles and in ten days time the tests began ellen usually liked exams but she was dreading these she couldnt think how it was that the girls joked about them so lightheartedly then an idea came to hera bad idea that at first she put away from her mind at once but it came back again and again whispering itself into her mind so that she had to listen to it if you could perhaps see the testpapers before they were given out if you could read the questions and know what you were going to be asked ellen had never cheated in her life she had never needed to for she had good brains and she knew how to work hard people didnt cheat if they could do as well or better without cheating ah but when you couldnt when something had gone wrong and you didnt know your workwould you cheat then if it was the only way to gain a good place it is not often that a test like that conies to a person with good brains who has always scorned cheating but now it came to ellen it is easy not to cheat if you dont need to it is easy not to cheat if you do need to when that test comes you will know your character for what it is weak or strong crooked or upright ellen could no longer push the thought out of her mind it was always there then one day she was in miss barkers room and saw what she thought was a testpaper on her desk miss parker was not in the room it needed only a moment to slip round and look at the paper ellen read swiftly down the questions how easy they were then with a shock she saw that they were questions set for the first form not the second her heart sank before she could look for the secondform questions and see if they were there she heard miss parkers footsteps and slipped round to the other side of the desk she must never let anyone guess that she was thinking of doing such a dreadful thing ellen was always slipping into miss parkers room or miss potts room after that she chose times when she knew they would not be there she even went through miss parkers desk in the secondform room ellen was rummaging through miss porkers desk one morning after school hoping to find something there in the way of test questions alicia found her there and looked surprised what are you doing she said you know were not supposed to go to that desk really ellen ive lost my fountain pen mumbled ellen i wondered if perhaps miss parker had well even if she had got it you shouldnt go sneaking in her desk said alicia scornfully then another time darrell found her in miss potts room standing at mamzelles empty desk running her fingers through the papers there she stared in surprise ohermamzelle sent me here to find a book for her said ellen and was shocked at herself she had always heard that one sin leads to another and she was finding out that this was true she was trying to cheatand that made her tell untruths what next would it be well i must say ellen isnt much improved by being away for nearly a fortnight said betty one evening in the commonroom when ellen had snapped someones head off and gone out sulkily shes just as snappy as everand she doesnt look a bit well yet bad tempers her trouble said alicia im fed up with her always frowning and sighing and looking miserable gwendoline came in looking bothered anyone seen my purse im sure i put it into my desk and now its gone and i put a tenshilling note in it only this morning because i wanted to go out and buy something f now i cant ill help you to look for it said daphne obligingly and got up i bet its still in your desk somewhere but it wasnt it was most annoying gwendoline screwed up her forehead and tried in vain to think if she had put it anywhere else im sure i didnt she said at last oh how sickening it is can you lend me some money daphne yes ive got my purse in my pocket said daphne anyway i owe yon some i meant to have paid you before i got some money yesterday from my uncle she felt in her pocket and men looked up a dismayed expression on her face its gone theres a hole in my pocket blow wherever can i have dropped it well i must say youre a pretty pair said alicia both of you losing your pursesjust when they are full of money too youre as bad as irene or belinda belinda had lost a halfcrown only the day before and had crawled all over the formfloor looking for it much to mamzelles amazement she hadnt found it and had demanded her games subscription back from jean she hadnt got it however for jean maintained that once the money had gone into her box it was no longer the giversit belonged to the games secretary or the school or whatever fund it was meant for the two purses didnt turn up it was annoying and rather mysterious two pursesfull of money gwendoline looked at daphne and lowered her voice you dont think somebodys taken them do you surely there couldnt be anyone in our form that would do a thing like that alicia was very curious about the purses into her mind slid the memory of ellen going through the mistresss desk in the secondform room why should she do that she had said she had lost her fountain penbut she hadnt because alicia bad seen her using it at the very next lesson well then alicia determined to keep an eye on ellen if she was doing anything dishonest or underhand it ought to be reported to sally it was tiresome to think that sally would have the right to hear about it and settle whether or not it should go before miss parker alicia felt the usual stab of jealousy when she thought of sally as headgut ellen didnt know that alicia was keeping an eye on her but she did know that she was suddenly finding it very difficult to be alone or to go into either miss porkers room or miss potts room or even the formroom when nobody else was there alicia always seemed to pop up and say hallo ellen looking for somebody can i help you daphne borrowed as usual from somebody but gwendoline didnt gwendoline had been taught not to borrow and she had written to ask her people to send her some more money to get on with daphne borrowed some from marylou and then offered half of it to gwendoline oh no said gwendoline a little shocked you cant lend other peoples money to me daphne i know you borrowed that from marylou why dont you do as im doing and wait till you get some more from your people thats the worst of being as rich as you arei suppose you just simply dont understand the value of money daphne looked a little surprised for this was the first time she had ever had any kind of criticism even slight from her faithful gwendoline then she slipped her arm through her friends i expect youre right she said ive always had as much money as i wanteddont really know the value of it its the way ive been brought up dont be cross owen i dont know what would happen to you if you were ever in real need of money said gwendoline you would be miserable without your yacht and your cars and your servants and your beautiful house how i wish i could see them all but daphne did not say as gwen always hoped she would well come and stay with me for the holidays it rather looked as if gwendoline would not be seeing her grand friend during the christmas holidays or attending parties and pantomimes with her it rather looked as if she would have to put up with her own home and adoring mother and worshipping governess a dreadful evening it was the day before the tests were to begin some of the girls were swotting up hard feeling rather girllty because they hadnt paid as much attention to their work as they ought to have done betty hill was poring over her books so was gwendoline and as usual poor ellen had her nose between the pages of a book trying to cram into a short time what could only be learnt slowly and in peace miss parker was quite worried about ellen the girl gave her a strained attention in class and yet her work was only fair it wasnt for lack of trying miss parker knew she supposed it must be that ellen was not very fit after her illness ellen knew that the testpapers were ready she had heard miss parker talking about them as for mamzelle in her usual tantalizing manner she had shaken her testpaper in front of the class and cried ah you would like to know what i have set you would you not you would like to know what are these difficult questions now the first one is but she never did say what the first one was and the class laughed anyway mamzelle dupont was never so strict over tests as mamzelle rougier who set the most difficult questions and expected them to be answered perfectlyand then groaned and grumbled because nearly all the girls failed to get high marks it was ellens last chance that day to try to see the papers if only that irritating alicia wouldnt always keep hanging around the thought occurred to ellen that alicia might be spying on herbut she dismissed it at once why should she nobody in the world save ellen herself knew that she wanted to see the testpapers she hung about in the passage outside miss parker room for a long time that evening but there was never any chance of going in without being seen somebody always seemed to be going by it was astonishing how many girls went this way and that way past miss parkers door then most annoyingly the only time that the passage was really empty was when miss parker herself was in the room she was mete with miss potts ellen could quite well hear what they were saying she bent down by the door as if she was retying her shoelace the second form havent done too badly this term she heard miss parker say to miss potts they seem to have benefited by the year they spent with you most of them can use their brains which is something well i hope they do well in the tests said miss potts i always take an interest in their first tests when they go up to the second form for the first time having bad the girls for three or four terms i cant lose my interest in them quickly i suppose alicia or irene or darrell will be top theyve all got good brains have a look at the questions said miss parker and ellen actually heard the rustling of the testpapers being handed over to miss potts how she longed to see them there was a silence as miss potts read them yes a bit stiff one or two of thembut if the girls have paid attention they ought to do them all quite well what about the french papers mamzelles got them in her room said miss parker ill take these along to her and give them to her she takes the second form first thing tomorrow and can take the papers with her ellens heart leapt now she knew where the papers would be that night in mamzelles room and that was not very tar from the dormy could shedare sheget up in the night and go and peep at them a girl came round the corner and almost knocked ellen over it was alicia gracious its you ellen you were lounging about here when i came upand now i come down and youre still here what on earth are you doing its no business of yours said ellen and walked off she went to the commonroom and sat down she had to work things out dare she creep out in the middle of the night and hunt for the papers it was a very very wrong thing to do but oh if only she had been well all the term and had been able to work and use her brains properly she could easily have been top or near the top it wasnt her fault that she would be near the bottom so she sat and reasoned with herself trying to persuade herself that what she was doing wasnt really so bad as it looked she was doing it to save her parents from being so disappointed she couldnt let them down poor ellen she didnt stop to think that her parents would much rather see her honestly at the bottom than dishonestly at the top alicia was growing quite certain that it was ellen who had taken the money if not why in the world was she always sneaking about by herself listening outside doors and doing such peculiar things neither of the purses had turned up nor had belindas halfcrown another purse and more missing money had not been traced either and emily had reported that her gold bar brooch which her godmother had given her the term before had also gone emily was very tidy and careful and never lost things like belinda or irene when alicia heard her talking about her lost brooch in the commonroom she made up her mind to tell the others what she thought ellen as usual was not there out sneaking round somebodys door i expect thought alicia i say she said raising her voice a little sally ive got something to say about all these mysterious disappearances i dont exactly want to accuse anyone but fve been watching somebody lately and theyve been doing rather peculiar things everyone looked up in surprise sally looked round the commonroom are we all here she said yes wait thoughellen isnt well get her no dont said alicia it would be as well not to what do you mean said sally puzzled then her eyes widened ohyou dont meanno alicia you dont mean that its ellen youve been watching what has she been doing thats so peculiar alicia told how she had watched ellen and seen her sneaking about in the passages apparently waiting for a room to be empty she related how she had found her going through miss barkers desk everyone listened amazed i wouldnt have thought it of her said daphne in a disgusted voice what a thing to do i never did like her theres no doubt she took my purse and gwensand emilys brooch and goodness knows how many things besides youre not to say that till weve proved something said sally sharply weve no definite proof yetand only alicia apparently has seen ellen sneaking about well said darrell reluctantly sally i noticed something once too i found ellen in miss potts room going through some things on her desk how dreadful said daphne and gwen echoed her jean said nothing she had been more friendly with ellen than anyone else though she had never been able to like her very muchbut it seemed to her that ellen was not quits the type of girl to become a thief a thief how terrible it sounded jean frowned surely ellen couldnt be that i dont think i believe it she said slowly in her clear scots voice shes a queer girlbut i dont think shes queer in that way well i bet she never gave you her games subscription said alicia remembering how ellen had refused to go and get it she did the next time i asked her said jean yesand i bet it was after one of the parses had disappeared exclaimed betty jean was silent yes mat was true ellen had not given up her subscription until the purses had gone things looked very black for ellen what are we to do said darrell helplessly sally youre headgirl what are you going to do ill have to think about it said sally i cant decide this very minute theres nothing to decide said alicia with scorn in her voice shes a thief well tackle her with it and make her confess if you dont i shall no you mustnt said sally at once i tell you weve none of us got real proofand its a bad wicked thing to do to accuse somebody without definite proof you are not to say a word alicia as headgirl i forbid you alicias eyes sparkled wickedly well see she said and at that very moment who should come into the room but ellen she sensed hostility as soon as she came in and looked round halfscared the girls stared at her silently rather takenaback at her sudden appearance then sally began to talk to darrell and jean turned to emily but alicia was not going to change the subject or to obey sally either ellen she said in a loud clear voice what do you find when you go sneaking about in empty rooms and looking through desks ellen went pale she stood perfectly still her eyes glued on alicia whatwhat do you mean she stammered at last surely surely nobody had guessed that she was looking for the exam papers shut up alicia said sally peremptorily you know what i said alicia took no notice you know jolly well what i mean dont you she said to ellen in a hard voice you know what you take when you creep into an empty room or go through somebodys desk or locker or drawer dont you ive never taken anything cried ellen a hunted look on her face what should i take ohperhaps purses with money inor a gold brooch or two drawled alicia come onown up ellen you look as guilty as can be so why deny it ellen stared as if she could not believe her eyes she looked round at the quiet girls some of them could not look at her maryloa was crying for she hated scenes of this kind salty looked angrily and hopelessly at alicia it was no good stopping things now they had gone too far how dared alicia defy her like this darrell was angry too but her anger was partly directed at ellen whom she too thought looked exceedingly guilty she was angry mat alicia had defied sally the headgirlbut after allif ellen was guilty it was surely better that it should all be cleared up immediately do you mean thatthat you think ive been stealing your things asked ellen at last with a great effort you cant mean that we do said alicia grimly why else should you snoop round as you do and why go through miss barkers desk can you give us a good explanation of that no ellen couldnt how could she say mat she was hunting for the exam papers because she wanted to cheat oh if once you started doing something wrong there was no end to it she put her hands up to her face cant tell you anything she said and tears made her fingers wet but i didnt take your things i didnt you did said alicia youre a coward as well as a thief you cant even own up and give the things back ellen stumbled out of the room the door shut behind her marylou gave an unhappy sob im so sorry for her she said i cant help it i am in the middle of the night there was a silence only broken by marylous sniffs most of the girls were upset and horrified alicia looked rather pleased with herself sally was tightlipped and angry alicia looked at her and smiled maliciously sorry if ive upset you sally she said but it was time we had it out with ellen as headgirl you should have done it yourself as it was you left it to me i did not said sally i forbade you to say anything we shouldnt have accused elleni know its not right till weve got proof and i wanted to think of the best way of doing itnot in front of everyone thats certain darrell felt uncomfortably that sally was right it would have been best to wait a little and think about it and then perhaps for sally to have spoken with ellen alone now the fat was in the fire everyone knew whatever would ellen do well all i can say is im grateful to alicia for bringing the matter to a head said daphne shaking back her shining curls from her forehead perhaps our belongings will be safe now you ought to be loyal to sally not to alicia flared up darrell dont lets argue any more said sally the things done now mores the pity theres the supperbell for goodness sake lets go they went soberly down to the suppertable ellen was not there jean asked about her shall i go and fetch ellen miss parker she said no shes got one of her headaches and has gone early to bed said miss parker the girls exchanged looks so ellen couldnt even face them again that evening guilty conscience said alicia to betty in a voice loud enough to reach darrell and sally ellen was in bed when the form went up at their bedtime she lay on her side her face in the pillow perfectly still pretending to be asleep said alicia shut up said jean unexpectedly in a low voice youve done your bit already alicia johns well have no more jeering tonight hold your tongue alicia was takenaback and glared at jean jean glared back alicia said no more soon the girls were in bed and the lights were put out they stopped talking at once sally had insisted that the rules were to be kept and the girls respected her and kept them one by one they fell asleep daphne was one of the last to sleep but long after she was asleep too somebody else was wide awake that was ellen of course she bad gone to bed early for three reasons one was mat she really had got one of her headaches another was that she didnt want to face the girls after their accusing faces and the third was that she wanted to think she had hardly been able to believe her ears when the girls had accused her so unjustly ellen had not taken anything she was completely honest in that way however much she might have made up her mind to cheat over the exam a thief alicia had called her that in front of everyone it wasnt fair it was most cruel and unjust but was it altogether unjust after all the girls two of them at least had seen her snooping round and had seen her going through miss parkers desk and looking through things on miss potts desk too it must seem to them as if such behaviour meant dishonestyand it did mean dishonesty though not the land they accused her of what am i doing how can i cheat like this how can i be such a sneak and do such dreadful things ellen suddenly cried in her mind what would mother think of me but oh mother its all because of you and daddy that i want to do well not for myself surely it isnt so wrong if i cheat to please my parents and not to please myself it is wrong said her conscience you know it is see what your foolishness has led you into you have been accused of something terribleall because you were trying to do something wrong and hadnt even done it i shant cheat i wont think of it any more ellen decided suddenly ill do badly in the papers and explain why to mother i will i will then the girls came up and she heard alicias spiteful remark pretending to be asleep in a flash she remembered her unkind accusations her sneering words and she remembered too how all the girls seemed to be against her and to believe she was wicked and bad anger crept through her how dared they accuse her wrongly without any real proof at all they all thought her bad and nothing would convince them that she wasnt she was sure very well then she would be bad she would cheat shed get up in the middle of the night and go and find those papers she knew where they werein mamzelles room ellen lay there in the darkness her mind going over everything again and again she felt defiant and obstinate now she was labelled bad by the girls then she would be bad shed enjoy it now she would read those exam papers and then she would look up all the answers and she would surprise everyone by coming oat top with practically perfect marks i that would make them all sit up she had no difficulty at all in lying awake until she was sure that the staff had gone to bed her eyes looked straight up into the darkness and her head felt hot she clenched her fists when she thought of alicias scornful face at last she thought it would be safe to get up she sat up in bed and looked round the moon was up and a ray pierced the darkness of the room there was no movement anywhere and all she could hear was the regular breathing of the other girls she slid out of bed she put her feet into her bedroom slippers and pulled her dressinggown round her her heart was beating painfully she crept out of the room she knocked against one of the beds on the way and held her breath in case she awoke the girl asleep there but there was no movement she made her way down the moonlit passage and down the stairs to mamzelles room the one she shared with miss potts it was in darkness mamzelle had gene to bed long ago ellen went to the window to make sure that the curtains were tightly drawn she did not want anyone to see even a crack of light there at that time of night they were thick curtains and shut out the moonlight then she shut the door and switched on the electric light she went to the desk it was untidy as usual for mamzelle dupont unlike mamzelle rougier could never keep her books and papers in neat order ellen began to go through the papers on top of the desk she went through them twice the exam papers were not therel her heart stood still surely they must be there perhaps they were in the desk she hoped it was not locked she had seen mamzelle lock it sometimes she tried it yesit was locked what a blow mamzelle must have locked the testpapers up ellen sat down her knees shaking with the suspense then her eyes caught sight of a key lying in the pentray she snatched it up she fitted it into the deskand it opened how like mamzelle to lock the desk carefully and leave the key in the pentray with trembling hands ellen looked through the vast collection of papers there in a corner neatly banded together by miss parker were the secondform test papers with a thankful sigh ellen took them up she was just about to look carefully through them when she heard a sound her heart almost stopped in a trice she slipped to the door and switched off the light then she shut the desk quietly and went over to the door to listen the sound came again what was it was it somebody walking about she would have to be very careful if so she stuffed the papers into the big pocket of her dressinggown and held them there she had better get out of mamzelles room if she could because if anyone found her there she would get into very serious trouble upstairs in the dormy just after ellen had crept out darrell awoke it was her bed that ellen had bumped into and she had not awakened immediately but she sat up hah a minute after ellen had gone out of the room wondering what had awakened her she was just about to settle down again when she noticed ellens empty bed the moon was sending a bright ray down on itand there was no lump there to show that ellen was lying asleep it was flat and empty darrell stared at the empty bed where was ellen was she ill again orwas she doing a bit more snooping to see if she could find anything valuable darrell looked across at sally she ought to tell sally and let her deal with it alicia had already interfered enough and she darrell ought to let sally say what was to be done about the empty bed if ellen didnt come back very quickly ellen didnt come back darrell waited impatiently for some minutes and then decided to try to find her she wouldnt wake sally she was full of curiosity and wanted to follow ellen herself it seemed an exciting thing to do in the middle of the night i she put on her slippers and dressinggown she went out of the room treading quietly in her soft slippers she stood in the passage and listened she could hear nothing she padded down the passage and came to the stairs perhaps ellen was going through the desks in the secondform roomor even in the first form she went quietly down the stairs she came to the firstform room which had its door shut darrell opened it the room was in darkness and she shut the door again it made a little click she went to the secondform room and opened the door there she thought she heard something and switched on the light quickly she could see no one there she switched off the light again and was about to shut the door when she thought she heard a sound she quickly switched the light on againand then over by the cupboard she saw a movement i just as if someone had pulled the door to very quickly darrells heart beat was it ellen in there or somebody else she wouldnt like it at all if it was a burglar but it must be ellen she had gone from her bed and was nowhere to be seen she must be there in the cupboard hiding crouching in the cupboard was ellen darrell went swiftly to the cupboard and gave the door a sharp tug it came openand there crouching in the cupboard scared and trembling was ellen she had slipped out of mamzelles room and gone into the secondform room when she had heard darrell coming she had hidden in the cupboard as still as a mouse darrell looked in amazement at her come out she said you bad girl ellen have you been stealing something again no said ellen and came out she held on to the testpapers in her pocket and darrell noticed the action what have you got there she demanded show me quick youre hiding something im not im not cried ellen forgetting all about being quiet darrell tried to snatch ellens hand away from her pocket and ellen afraid lashed out at darrell with her other hand it caught her on the face then darrell lost her temper she flew at ellen shook her fiercely and slapped her hard on the cheek ellen fell over the legs of a desk and dragged darrell down with her she struggled and darrell pummelled her well you wicked girl shouted darrell coming out and stealing things you give me what youve taken ellen suddenly went limp she could not struggle any longer darrell was able to drag her up and make her take her hand away from her pocket she pulled out the packet of papers roughly the band broke and they scattered all over the floor ellen covered her face and began to sob loudly darrell stared at the papers and picked one or two up so you cheat too do you she said in a scornful voice tomorrows exam papers ellen wilson what sort of a girl are you a thief and a cheat how dare you come here to malory towers oh put the papers back and dont let anyone know sobbed ellen oh dont tell anyone ill certainly put the papers back said darrell grimly but as for not telling anyone thats absurd she dragged ellen to the door where did you find the papers in mamzelles desk well put them back there then she put them back and then with trembling fingers ellen locked the desk again they went up to the dormy all the girls were still asleep tomorrow said darrell i shall tell sally ellen and she will decide what is to be done about you i expect youll be expelled now get into bed and try to go to sleep rumours and tales nobody heard the two girls coming back no one guessed that darrell and ellen had been out of their beds and back again darrell furious and excited lay awake for some time debating whether or not to wake sally there and then and tell her what had happened no i wont she decided reluctantly it would only wake all the others and i must get sally alone and tell her she suddenly fell asleep and tired out with excitement slept very soundly indeed but ellen could not sleep at all this was nothing new for her most nights she did not sleep until the early hours of the morning now she lay on her back in bed quite stunned by all the nights happenings but gradually she ceased to worry about them for a bigger trouble came upon her her headache grew so bad that she thought her head must surely burst red hot hammers seemed at work inside it and at last the girl grew really frightened what was happening to her was she going mad was this what it felt like she lay perfectly still with her eyes closed hoping that the pain would die down but it didnt it got worse at last it was so bad that she began to moan softly the thought of kind comforting matron came to her matron matron had been kind to her in the san she would be kind now ellen felt that if she could only have one small bit of kindness from someone she would feel better she sat up painfully her head spinning round the moon was now shining fully into the dormy she could see all the white beds with their eiderdowns slipping off or neatly pulled up the girls lay in various positions fast asleep ellen got out of bed slowly because any quick movement made her head hurt unbearably she forgot about her dressinggown she forgot about her slippers she made her way slowly to the door as if she was walking in her sleep she passed out of it like a little ghost in pyjamas how she found her way to matrons room she never remembered but matron suddenly awoke from sleep to hear a soft knocking at her door that went on and on come in she cried who is it she switched on the light but nobody came in the soft knocking went on and on matron was puzzled and a little alarmed come in she called again but nobody came matron leapt out of bed and went to the door a sturdy figure in a voluminous nightdress she flung the door openand there stood poor ellen drooping like a weeping willow tree her hand up as if she was still knocking at die door ellen whats the matter child are you ill cried matron and pulled her gently into her room my head said ellen in a tired whisper its bursting matron it didnt take matron long to deal with ellen seeing that the girl was in great pain and that she could hardly even open her eyes matron soon had her in a warm and comfortable bed in a little room opening off her own she gave her medicine and a hot drink she put a comforting hotwater bottle in beside her she was kind and gentle and spoke in a very low voice so as not to jar ellens aching head now you go to sleep she said youll feel better in the morning ellen did fall asleep matron stood by the bed and looked down at her she was puzzled there was something wrong with this girl she was worrying secretly about something and she had been worrying before when she was in the san perhaps it would be better for her to go home for a while in the morning darrell woke up with the others when the dressingbell went she sat up remembering all the excitement of the night she glanced at sally she must somehow get her alone then sally gave an exclamation wheres ellen her beds empty everyone looked at ellens empty bed perhaps she got up early suggested emily well see her at breakfasttime darrell felt a little bit worried had ellen got up early where was she ellen was not at breakfast of course the girls looked at the empty place and darrell felt distinctly uncomfortable surelysurely ellen hadnt run away in the night and not come back i mamzelle was taking breakfast that day and darrell spoke to her wheres ellen mamzelle she is not coming to breakfast said mamzelle who knew nothing more than that miss parker had told her hurriedly as she passed her in the corridor i do not know why perhaps she is ill now alicia began to feel uncomfortable too she remembered how she had accused ellen so bitterly the day before where war ellen she too began to wonder if the girl had run away home she ate her porridge rather silently the next piece of news came from a firstformer katie she had heard miss parker talking to miss potts and had caught a few words i say whats up with ellen wilson she demanded i heard nosey tell potty that she was going to be sent home whats she done sent home the secondformers looked at one another did that mean that the staff had found out about ellenhad perhaps discovered she had been stealing and she was to be expelled good gracious shes either been found out by one of the mistresses or else shes gone and confessed said alicia at last wed better not say too much about what we know its not much to the credit of the school i expect it will be all hushed up do you mean that you really think ellen is being sent awayexpelled from the schoolbecause she stole those things said daphne looking suddenly white surely she wont she jolly well will said betty and there was such scorn in her voice that daphne looked quite startled and a good thing too fancy having that kind of girl at malory towers darrell was bewildered by the turn things had taken now she didnt know whether to report the happenings of last night or not if ellen was to be sent home for stealing then there didnt seem much point in telling anyone that she darrell had caught her cheatingtaking the testpapers to look at before the test because certainly ellen wouldnt take the tests now and why blacken her name even more now that she was apparently being sent off in disgrace darrell was a generous girl even to those she considered her enemies she thought over the night before she had certainly given ellen a good deal of punishment for cheating she felt rather hot when she remembered how she had slapped ellens face pummelled her and knocked her down that was her temper again of course sally wouldnt have done a thing like that sally would have dealt with the whole thing in a dignified calm way and would have made ellen show her the testpapers without a lot of undignified rough behaviour that ended in both girls rolling on the floor i dont manage things very well somehow thought darrell rubbing her nose with her hand i just go off the deep end with a splash i fly off the handle i go up in smoke i well what am i going to do tell sally or not she decided not to there didnt seem any point at all in complaining about ellen and making her character still worse if she was really going to be sent home so darrell held her tongue a thing that not many of the second form would have done is the circumstances for most of them dearly loved a gossip still there was plenty of gossip in the second form about ellen everyone seemed to take it for granted that somehow or other it had been found out by the staff that ellen bad taken the purses money and brooch and possibly other things as well and was being expelled for that curiously enough one of the girls who seemed most distressed about this was daphne but surely they wont expel her without some proof she kept saying sally darrell you said to alicia yesterday that there was no real proof that ellen had stolen anything what will happen to ellen will another school take her i dont know i shouldnt think so said alicia shes finished serve her right dont be so hard said jean dont think im standing up for herim not but you always sound so hard and unmerciful alicia well i was right yesterday when i accused ellen wasnt i demanded alicia you were all so soft you didnt want to have it out with her good thing i did the second form decided to say nothing about ellen to the staff if miss grayling was going to expel the girl she would want to keep it quiet so the less said the better so rather to miss porkers surprise nobody asked about ellen at all curious this lack of interest she thought and she said nothing either the girls had no idea at all when or if ellen had gone home though somebody passed round a rumour that a car had been seen in the drive that morning perhaps it had come to fetch ellen it hadnt it was the doctors car he had been called in to examine the girl and he had spoken gravely to matron and miss grayling theres something here i dont understand is the child worried about anything is there anything wrong at her home has anything upset her at school neither matron nor the head mistress could give the doctor any information as far as they knew there was nothing wrong at ellens home and there had been no upset in her form miss parker was called in and she too said that as far as she knew ellen had not been in any trouble in any class except for mild tickingsoff for not doing work up to standard we think ellen said miss grayling gently when the doctor had gone we think you should go home when you feel well enough that would be the best place for you now she was startled by ellens response to this suggestion the girl sat up and pushed back her hair in a despairing way oh no miss grayling dont expel me i please dont expel you said the head in amazement what do you mean ellen had broken into sobs and matron came hurrying up at once making signs to miss grayling to go she mustnt be excited in any way she whispered so sorry miss grayling but i think youd better go ill deal with her now miss grayling very puzzled indeed went quietly out of the room why should ellen think she was going to be expelled there was something here that needed looking into it took ellen a long time to calm down she really thought that miss graylings suggestion of going home meant that she was telling her she was to be sent away from malory towersexpelled in disgrace perhaps darrell had been to her and told her about the cheating or perhaps alicia had told her that they all believed she had been stealing and miss grayling had decided to expel her because of that ellen didnt know she began to worry all over again and matron was alarmed at the quick rise in her temperature some of the secondformers were upset at the thought that ellen might have been already expelled and had been sent home without even saving goodbye marylou especially was upset she hadnt liked ellen very much but she was very sorry for her she spoke to daphne about it at break daphne isnt it awful what will poor ellen say to her parents when she gets home do you think she win have to tell them herself that shes been sent away for stealing dont said daphne dont lets talk about it marylou look weve got about ten minutes havent we ive got a most important parcel to send off this morning and i cant find any string anywhere be a dear and get me some ive got the brown paper marylou sped off wondering what the important parcel was she couldnt seem to find any string at all it was astonishing the total lack of any string that morning when at last she got back to daphne the bell went for the next lesson havent you got any string said daphne disappointed oh blow well ill see if i can find some after the morning lessons and then ill slip down to the post with the parcel this afternoon ive got half an hour in between two lessons because my music mistress isnt here today is it so very important asked marylou i could run with it for you if you like no youd never get there and back in time said daphne its a long way by the inland road you could manage it by the coast road but theres such a gale again today youd be blown over the top ill go in between lessons this afternoon but she couldnt go after all with her important parcel whatever it was for the music mistress turned up and daphne was called away to her lesson she left the parcel in her desk oh dear she said at teatime to gwen and marylou i did so badly want to take my parcel to the post and i had to have my musiclesson after alland now ive got to go to miss parker after tea for a returned lesson and after that theres a rehearsal for that silly french play whats so urgent about the parcel asked gwen somebodys birthday daphne hesitated yes she said thats it if it doesnt go today it wont get there in time well youll have to post it tomorrow said gwen marylou looked at daphnes worried face what a pity she marylou couldnt take it for her she always liked doing things for daphne and getting that charming smile in return she began to think how she might do it tm free at seven after prep she thought have half an hour before supper i could never get to the postoffice and back if i take the inland roadbut i could if i took the coast road would i dare toin the dark and rain she thought about it as she sat in afternoon school people dont mind what they do for their friends she thought they dare anything daphne would be so thrilled if i went to the post and got her birthday parcel off for her how kind she is to want it to get there on the day just like her wellif it isnt too dark and horrible i might run along tonight for her i mustnt tell anyone though because its against the rules if sally got to know shed forbid me so timid little marylou planned to do something that even not one of the seniors would do on a dark windy nighttake the coast road on the cliff whilst a gale blew wildly round marylou after prep that night marylou scuttled bade to the secondform room which was now empty except for gwendoline who was tidying up marylou went to daphnes desk gwendoline looked at her jealously what do you want in daphnes desk i can take her anything shes forgotten i wish you wouldnt suck up to her so much marylou i dont said marylou she opened the desklid and fished for the brownpaper parcel now neatly tied up with string im going to the post with this for daphne but dont go and split on me gwen i know its against the rules gwendoline stared at marylou in surprise you breaking the rules she said i dont believe you ever did that before youre mad to think you can get to the post and back in time i shall im taking the coast road said marylou valiantly though her heart failed her when she said it its only ten minutes there and back by that road marylou you must be daft said gwendoline theres a gale blowing and its dark as pitch youll be blown over the cliff as sure as anything i shant said marylou stoutly though again her heart sank inside her and anyway its only a small thing to do for a friend i know daphne particularly wants this parcel to go today daphne isnt your friend said gwendoline a flare of jealousy coming up in her again she is said marylou with such certainty that gwendoline was annoyed baby said gwendoline scornfully youre too silly even to see that daphne only uses you because you can help her with her french thats the only reason she puts up with you hanging round her shes told me so marylou stood looking at gwendoline the parcel in her hand she felt suddenly very miserable its not true she said youre making it up it is true said gwendoline spitefully i ten you daphne has said so herself to me heaps of times what would a girl like daphne want with a mouse like you youre just useful to her thats all and if you werent so jolly conceited youd know it without being told marylou felt as if it must be true gwendoline would never say such a thing so emphatically if it wasnt she picked up the parcel her mouth quivering and turned to go marylou you dont mean to say youre going to bother with that parcel after what ive just told you called gwendoline in surprise dont be an idiot im taking it for daphne because im her friend answered marylou in a shaky voice she may not be mine but if im hers in still be willing to do things for her stupid little donkey said gwendoline to herself and began to slam books back on to shelves and to make a terrific cloud of dust with the blackboard duster she didnt tell daphne that marylou had gone off into the darkness with her parcel she was feeling rather ashamed of having been so outspoken daphne might not like it but after all it was nearly the end of the term and there would be now no need for marylou to help daphne she would probably be glad to be rid of marylou when she no longer needed her help with her french halfpast seven came and the supperbell rang girls poured out of the different rooms and went clattering down to the diningroom oooh coffee tonight for a change and jammy buns and rolls and potted meat they all sat down and helped themselves whilst miss parker poured out big cups of coffee she glanced round the table two empty chairs i whos missing oh ellen of course whos the other marylou said sally i saw her just after prep shell be along in a minute miss parker but five minutes ten minutes went by and there was no sign of marylou miss parker frowned surely she must have heard the bell see if you can find her sally sally sped off and came back to report that marylou was nowhere to be found by this time gwendoline was in a great dilemma she and she only knew where marylou was if she told she would get marylou into trouble surely she would be back soon maybe she had had to wait at the postoffice i then she suddenly remembered something the postoffice shut at seven it wouldnt be any use marylou trying to post a parcel there because it would be shut why hadnt she thought of that before then what had happened to mary lou a cold hand seemed to creep round gwendolines heart and almost stop her breathing supposesuppose that the wind had blown little marylou over the cuff suppose that even now she was lying on the rocks dead or badly hurt the thought was so terrible that gwendoline couldnt swallow her morsel of bun and halfchoked daphne thumped her on the back gwendoline spoke to her in a low urgent voice daphne i must tell you something as soon after supper as possible come into one of the practicerooms where we shall be alone daphne looked alarmed she nodded when supper was finished she led the way to one of the deserted practicerooms and switched on the light whats the matter she asked gwendoline you look like a its marylou i know where she went said gwendoline well why on earth didnt you tell miss parker then asked daphne crossly what is the matter owen daphne she took your precious parcel to the post just after seven oclock said gwendoline she took the coast road do you think anythings happened to her daphne took this in slowly took my parcel to the post whatever fort at this time of night too she went an soppy and said that although it meant her going out in the dark and the wind shed do it because you were her friend said gwendoline why didnt you stop her you idiot demanded daphne i did try said gwendoline i even told her that you were not her friendyou only found her useful for helping you with your french as youve often and often told me daphneand youd think that would stop anyone from going off into the dark on a windy night wouldnt you to post a silly parcel and didnt it stop her said daphne in a queer sort of voice no she just said that she would take it for you because she was your friend said gwendoline rather scornfully she said you might not be her friend but she was yours and shed still be willing to do things for you gwendoline was amazed to see tears suddenly glisten in daphnes eyes daphne never cried i whats up said gwendoline in surprise nothing that youd understand said daphne blinking the tears away savagely good heavens fancy going out on a night like this and taking the coast roadjust because she wanted to take that parcel for me and the postoffice would be shut too poor little marylou what can have happened to her has she fallen over the cliff do you think asked gwendoline daphne went very white nono dont say that she said you cant think how awful that would be id never never forgive myself it wouldnt be your fault if she did said gwendoline surprised at this outburst it would it would you dont understand cried daphne oh poor kind little marylou and you sent her out thinking i didnt like herthat i only just used her i do like her i like her ten tunes better than i like you shes kind and generous and unselfish i know i did use her at first and welcomed her just because she could help mebut i couldnt help getting fond of her she just gives everything and asks nothing butyou told me heaps of times you only put up with her because she was useful stammered gwendoline completely taken aback by all this and looking very crestfallen indeed i know i did i was beastly it was the easiest thing to do to keep you from bothering me and nagging me about marylou oh i shall never never get over it if anything has happened im going after her im going to see if i can find her you cant cried gwendoline in horror hark at the wind its worse than ever if marylou can go out into that wind to post a stupid parcel for me surely i can go out into it to find her said daphne and a look came into her pretty pale face that gwendoline had never seen beforea sturdy determined look that gave her face unexpected character but daphne protested gwendoline feebly and then stopped daphne had gone out of the little musicroom like a whirlwind she ran up to the dormy and got her mackintosh and souwester she tore down to the cloakroom and put on her wellingtons nobody saw her then out she went into the night flashing on her torch to see her way it was a wild night and the wind howled round fiercely it took daphnes breath away as she made her way to the coast road up on the cliff whatever would it be like there she would be almost blown away she flashed her torch here and there there was nothing to be seen but a few bent bushes dripping with rain she went a little further and began to call loudly and desperately marylou marylou where are you the wind tore her words out of her mouth and flung them over the cliff she called again putting her hands up to her mouth marylou marylou i marylou and surely that was a faint call in answer here here help me a heroine daphne stood quite still and listened the cry came again on the wind very faint here here it seemed to come from somewhere in front daphne struggled on against the wind and then came to a place where the cliff edge swung inwards she followed the edge round cautiously not daring to go too near for the wind was so strong still it seemed to be dying down a little now she suddenly heard marylous voice much nearer help help daphne was afraid of being blown over the cliff if she went too near the edge but the voice seemed to come from the edge somewhere daphne sat down on the wet ground feeling that the wind would not then have so much power over her and began to edge herself forward holding on the tufts of grass when she could she came to where the cliff had crumbled away a little and made a series of ledges going steeply down to the sea she crawled to this place lay flat down and shone her light over the broken cliff and there a few feet below was poor marylou clinging for dear life to a ledge her white face up turned to the glare of the torch help she called again feebly seeing the torch oh help me i cant hold on much longer i daphne was horrified she could see that if marylou did leave go she would hurtle down to the rocks a long way below her heart went cold at the thought what could she do tm here marylout she called hold on ill fetch help ohdaphne is it you dont go away daphne i shall fall in a minute cant you do something daphne looked down at marylou she felt that it would not be the slightest use leaving her and going for help for it was clear that marylou might leave go at any moment no she must think of something else and do it at once she thought of her mackintosh belt and her tunic belt if she tied those both together and let them down marylou might hold them and drag herself up but would they reach she undid her mackintosh belt and took off her tunic belt with fingers that fumbled exasperatingly all the time she kept up a comforting flow of words to marylou ill save you dont you worry ill soon have you up here i im making a rope with my belts and ill let it down hold on marylou hold on and ill soon save you marylou was comforted and held on she had been so frightened when the gale took her and rolled her over and over to the edge of the cliff how she had managed to hold on to the tufts of grass she didnt know it had seemed ages and ages till she heard daphnes voice now daphne was here and would rescue her whatever gwendoline had said daphne was her friend daphne lay down flat again she found a stout gorse bush behind her and she pushed her legs under it till her feet found the sturdy rootstem growing out of the ground heedless of scratches and pricks she wound her two feet firmly round the stem so that she bad a good hold with her legs and would not be likely to be pulled over the cliff by marylou a frantic voice suddenly came up to her daphne this tuft of grass is giving way i shall fall quick quick daphne hurriedly let down the rough rope made of her two belts marylou caught at it and looped the end firmly round her wrists daphne felt the pull at once are you all right she called anxiously you wont fall now will you no i dont think so my feet have got quite a firm hold called back marylou much reassured by the belt round her wrists i shant pull you over shall i daphne no but i dont think im strong enough to pull you up said daphne in despair and the belts might break and let you fall i dont see that we can do anything but just hang on to each other till somebody finds us oh poor daphne this is awful for you came back marylous voice i wish id never thought of taking that parcel it was kind of you said daphne not knowing how to get the words out but youre always kind marylou and marylou im your friend you know that dont you gwen told me the beastly things she said theyre not true i think the world of you i do really ive never been fond of anyone before oh i knew gwen told me untruths as soon as i heard your voice and knew youd come to look for me said marylou out of the darkness i think youre a heroine daphne im not said daphne im a beastly person you simply dont know how beastly this is a funny conversation to be having on a cliffside in a stormy night isnt it said marylou trying to sound cheerful oh deari am so sorry to have caused all this trouble daphne when will people come to look for us well only gwen knows ive come out said daphne if i dont come back soon surely she will tell nosey parker and theyll send out to look for us i do hope shell have the sense to tell someone gwendoline had she had felt very worried indeed about first marylou and now daphne when daphne had not come back after half an hour gwendoline had gone to miss parker she told her where marylou had gone and that daphne had gone to look for her what out on the coast road at night in this weather what madness cried miss parker and rushed off to miss grayling at once in two or three minutes a searchparty was out with lanterns ropes and flasks of hot cocoa it was not long before the two girls were found miss grayling gave an agonized exclamation as she saw them they might both have been killed daphnes arms were almost numb with strain when the searchparty came up they saw her lying flat on the ground her legs curled tightly round the stem of the prickly bush holding the two belts down the cliffsideand there at the other end holding on for dear life was marylou the sea pounding away far below her a rope was let down to marylou slipped right over her head and tightened over arms and shoulders another one looped tightly round her waist daphne got up thankfully her legs almost asleep and miss parker caught hold of her steady now hold on to me marylou was pulled up safely by a hefty gardener she lay on the ground crying with relief the gardener undid the ropes and lifted her up ill carry her he said give her a drink mam shes freezing both girls felt glad of the hot cocoa then holding on to miss parker daphne staggered back to school followed by the gardener carrying marylou and then by the rest of the party put both girls to bed miss grayling said to matron theyve had a terrible experience i only hope they dont get pneumonia now i daphne you saved little marylous life theres no doubt about that i am very proud of you daphne said nothing at all but to miss graylings surprise hung her head and turned away she had no time to puzzle over this but helped matron to get marylou undressed and into bed both girls were soon in warm beds with hot food and drink inside them they each felt extremely sleepy and went off to sleep quite suddenly the secondformers were in bed worried and sleepless gwen had told them about marylou going off and daphne following her to see if she could find her they knew that a searchparty had gone out all kinds of horrible pictures came into their minds as they lay in bed and listened to the wind they talked long after lights out sally did not forbid them this was not a usual nightit was a night of anxiety and talking helped then after a long time they heard miss parkers quick footsteps coming along the corridor news they all sat up at once she switched on the light and looked round at the seven waiting girls then she told them the story of how marylou and daphne had been found and how daphne by her ingenious idea had saved marylou she described how she had laid herself down on the wet ground her feet curled round the gorse bush stem and had held the belts down to marylou until help came daphnes a heroine cried darrell i never liked herbut miss parker shes been marvellous hasnt she shes a real heroine i think she is said miss parker i did not guess that she had it in her shes in bed now in the san but i think shell soon be all right again well give her three cheers and a clap when she comes back to class she switched off the light and said good night the girls talked excitedly for a few minutes more thankful that they knew what had happened fancy daphne turning out like that and doing it for marylou why gwen had always said that daphne only put up with marylou because she helped her with her french daphne must be fond of marylou said darrell voicing what everyone thought im glad i always thought it was mean to use marylou and not really like her i wonder what became of the parcel said belinda marylou cant have posted it because the postoffice was shut i bet nobody thought of the precious parcel well go and hunt for it tomorrow said sally i saywhat a small dormy we are tonightonly seven of us ellen goneand daphne and marylou in the san well thank goodness theyre there and not out on the cliff the wind rose to a gale again and howled round north tower the girls snuggled down closer into the beds i do think daphne was brave said darrell and i cant imagine how timid little marylou could possibly have dared to go out in this gale marylou of all people people are queer said irene you simply never can tell what a person will do from one day to the next you never said a truer word chuckled darrell today you put your french grammar away in the games cupboard and tried to put your lacrosse stick into your deskand goodness knows what youll do tomorrow an astonishing parcel it was difficult to do tests in the midst of so much excitement the story of marylou and daphne ran through the school and everyone talked about it the two girls did not appear in school that day because matron was keeping them quiet they neither of them seemed any the worse for their adventure before afternoon school darrell sally irene and belinda set off up the cliffpath to look for the parcel the wind had completely died down and it was a lovely day one of cornwalls best the sky was as blue as a cornflower and the sea picked up the colour and made the view a really beautiful one as the girls walked up the coastpath lookthat must be where marylou was blown over said darrell pointing to where the cliff had crumbled and seesurely thats the gorse bush daphne wound her legs round golly she must have been scratched the girls stood and looked at the place where marylou and daphne had had their frightening adventure sally shivered thinking of what it must have been like in the dark night with the wind howling round and the sea pounding on the rocks below its horrid to think of she said come onlets hunt about for the parcel marylou must have dropped it somewhere near here i should think they looked at the contents in bewilderment they began to look it was darrell who found the parcel lying wet and torn in the grass some little way off ive got it she shouted and ran to pick it up oh its all coming to pieces the paper is pulpy and the contents are coming out better take off the paper and carry the things inside home in our hands said sally so darrell stripped off the wet pulpy paper and shook out the contents they fell on the grass they were rather queer the girls looked at them lying there there were four purses of different sizes and shapes there were three boxes the kind that brooches or lockets are sold in by jewellerslittle leather boxes with a catch you had to press to open them darrell picked one up and pressed it it shot open and a little gold bar brooch gleamed inside she looked at it bewildered then passed it to sally isnt that emilys broochthe one she lost its got her name behind it if it is said sally in a sober voice she took out the brooch and looked at the back of the little gold bar yesits emilys she said her name is there sally opened another of ate boxes it contained a little gold necklace plain and simple katies said irene at once ive seen her wearing it good gracioushow did these come to be in the parcel is it the right parcel weve found sally picked everything up from the grass her face looked very serious its the right parcel she said lookthese purses belong to people we know thats gwens and thats marylous and thats surely bettys the four girls looked at one another in bewilderment if this was the parcel that marylou was posting for daphne how was it daphne put all these things into it said sally voicing what everyone was thinking could she have got them from ellen said darrell puzzled we all know ellen must have taken them wherever did she get them from is she doing it to shield ellen or something well have to find out said irene sally wed better take the parcel to miss grayling we cant keep this to ourselves no we cant said sally well go back at once they went back saying very little puzzled and solemn here were the stolen things the things they had accused ellen of takingdaphne had somehow got hold of them and for some extraordinary reason was sending them awayand marylou had almost lost her life in trying to post them and had been rescued by daphne it was all most complicated i think its all very mysterious said belinda i cant make head or tail of it its a pity ellens been expelled or we might go to her and show her what weve found the girls had no idea that ellen was still at malory towers what with one rumour and another they were all firmly convinced she had been sent home the bell was ringing for afternoon school as they got in they caught miss parker as she was going to the second form and asked her for permission to go and see miss grayling weve found the parcel that marylou went to post and we think we ought to hand it over to miss grayling explained sally very well dont be too long said miss parker and went on her way the four girls went to miss graylings part of the buildings and knocked at her door come in said her low voice and they opened the door and went in she was alone she looked up in surprise when she saw the four girls then she smiled for she liked all of them even harumscarum belinda please miss grayling we found the parcel that marylou went to post for daphne said sally coming forward and here are the things that were inside it the paper was so wet that we had to take it off she placed the purses and the boxes down on the head mistresss desk miss grayling looked at them in surprise were these inside she said are they all daphnes then i understand that it was daphnes parcel there was an awkward pause well miss grayling they are things belonging to us girls said sally at last we missed them at various times some of the purses had money in when they were taken they are empty now miss grayling suddenly looked quite different a stem expression came into her eyes and she sat up straight you will have to explain a little better sally she said am i to understand that these were stolen at some time from one or other of you this term yes miss grayling said sally and the others nodded you think daphne took them said miss grayling after a pause the girls looked at one another well said sally at last we did think ellen had taken them miss grayling we knew she had been expelled you seeand we thought wait said miss grayling in such a sharp tone that the four girls jumped ellen expelled whatever do you mean she is in the san under matrons eye she went to her two nights ago with a blinding headache and we are keeping her under observation to try to find out what the matter is the girls were absolutely taken aback sally went brilliant red she oughtnt to have believed those rumours bat die had wanted to believe them because she didnt like ellen the girls couldnt find a word to say miss grayling eyed them sharply this is most extraordinary she said at last simply cannot understand it what made you think ellen should be expelled and why did you think she had taken these things she is surely not that type of girl at all as you know she won a scholarship here by means of very hard work and she came with a most excellent report as regards character from her last head mistress wewe thought she had token them began sally at least i said we ought not to accuse her till we had definite proofbut but i see you actually accused the unfortunate girl to her face i suppose when was this the evening before last miss grayling said sally trying to avoid the head mistresss eyes which had suddenly became gimlets and were boring into her the evening before last said miss grayling ah that explains matters it must have been because of that that ellen got so upset and was overcome by that fearful headache and went to matron and somehow you thought she had been expelledgoodness knows whysome silly rumour i suppose fostered by you because you wanted to believe it you may have done serious damage to an innocent girl darrell swallowed once or twice she was remembering how she had attacked ellen that night in the secondform room certainly ellen had been cheating but darrell had called her a thief and said unforgivable things to her she looked at miss grayling and knew that she must tell her what had happened between ellen and herself it was because of that she felt sure that ellen had been ill that night oh dearhow things did begin to go wrong once you were silly yourself can i say a word to you alone please miss grayling said darrell desperately its something the others dont know about but i think id better tell you wait outside the door for a minute or two ordered miss grayling nodding at sally belinda and irene i havent finished with you yet they went outside and shut the door feeling surprised whatever had darrell got to tell miss grayling she might at least have told them too darrell poured out the story of how she had followed ellen that night and caught her in the secondform room cupboard clutching the testpapers in her hand and i called her a cheat which she was said darrell and i called her a thief too and told her id tell sally in the morning and it would be reported and she would be expelled and i suppose it worried her so much that she got that awful headache and went to matron and i never knew and we all thought that somehow you must have found out she was a thief and had expelled her quietly without making a fuss well really said miss grayling when this outpouring had come to an end the things that go on in this school that nobody knows about its incredible do you actually mean to tell me darrell that you and ellen were fighting together on the floor of the secondform room in the middle of the night that is not at all a thing to be proud of i know said darrell im awfully sorry about it now but i just saw red miss graylingand lost my temper i cant bear cheats its very strange said miss grayling thoughtfully ellen is a scholarship girl and i have never known such a girl have any need to cheat i cant believe that ellen was cheating if she was there is some reason for it that must be found out dont any of you like ellen darrell darrell hesitated wellshes so nervy and snappy and irritable miss grayling she snaps if we jerk die table she shouts at us if we interrupt her reading shes terribly badtempered i think jean likes her more than any of us do shes been awfully patient with her i wish id known all this before said miss grayling now i know why ellen was so upset when i suggested sending her home i thought possibly she might feel better and happier at homeand she must have thought i was really meaning to expel her because somebody had come to me and told me she was stealing or cheating poor ellen i think she has overtaxed that brain of hers and this is the result darrell stood silent she felt that miss grayling was not very pleased with her im sorry for what i did she said trying to blink back the tears i know i keep on and on saying ill never lose my temper again or lose control of myself you wont believe me any more shall go on believing you and trusting you every single tune said miss grayling turning her deepblue eyes on darrell and smiling and one day youll be strong enough to keep your promise probably when you arc in the sixth form i now tell the others to come in again they came in miss grayling addressed them gravely what darrell told me i think it is better not to repeat to you for my own good reasons i think she should not repeat it to you either i will just say this ellen is not the thief you may be absolutely certain of that not the thief said sally butwe all thought she wasand alicia accused her to her face and sally had let alicias name slip without thinking miss grayling drummed on her desk with a pencil ohso alicia did the accusing did she she said then she has something to feel very guilty about i think that that public accusation brought ellens trouble to a head sally you are headgirl of the form i leave it to you to show alicia that a little more kindness and a little less hardness would be very much more admired by me by you and everyone else yes miss grayling said sally feeling extremely guilty herself but miss graylingwho was the thief it couldnt possibly have been daphne said irene nobody who did what daphne did last night could possibly be so mean why daphnes a heroine everyone says so and you think that if someone does a brave deed quite suddenly then he or she could never do a mean one asked miss grayling you are wrong irene we all have good and bad in us and we have to strive all the time to make the good cancel out the bad we can never be perfectwe all of us do mean or wrong things at timesbut we can at least make amends by trying to cancel out the wrong by doing something worthy later on daphne has done quite a bit of cancelling i thinkbut her heroic deed doesnt mean that she can never do a small mean one is she the thief then asked sally incredulously that is what i mean to find out said miss grayling if she is she shall tell you herself and you shall judge her now go back to your classroom i am going to see daphne in the san and by the way ellen could see someone today what about jean you said she liked ellen more than any of you did tell her to go and see ellen after tea and be nice to her can she tell her we know shes not the thief asked darrell anxiously and oh miss grayling could i see her for a few minutes too by myself yes said miss grayling but no more fighting darrell or matron will deal very promptly with you indeed daphne ellenand miss grayling miss grayling made her way to the san she spoke to matron who nodded yes daphne is quite all right now she has just got up the head mistress told matron to take daphne into the next room where they would be alone daphne went helped along by matron and sat down in an armchair wondering rather fearfully what the visit was about miss grayling looked so serious daphne said the head these things were found in the parcel mat marylou went to post for you you had packed them up yourself where did you get them and why did you want to send them away she suddenly tipped the purses and the little boxes on to daphnes knee the girl stared at them in absolute horror she went very pale and opened her mouth to speak but no words came shan i tell you where you got them from said miss grayling you took them out of desks and lockers and drawers you spent the money daphne you did in fact exactly what you have done in two other schools which had quietly intimated to your parents that they would rather have you removed but they did not tell your parents why how did you know whispered daphne her once pretty face white and haggard it is the custom at malory towers to get a confidential report of any new girls character from her previous head mistress said miss grayling we do not if we can help it take girls of bad character daphne why did you take me then asked daphne not daring to meet the heads eyes because daphne your last head mistress said that you were not dl bad said miss grayling she said that perhaps a fresh start in a fine school like this with its traditions of service for others for justice kindliness and truthfulness might help you to cancel out the bad and develop the good and i like to give people a chance i see said daphne but im worse than you think miss grayling i havent only stolenive told lies i said id never been to another school before because i was afraid the girls might get to know id been sent home twice from schools i pretended my people were very rich i had a photo on my dressingtable that wasnt my mother at allit was a very grand picture of a beautiful woman i know said miss grayling the staff were warned about you but not the girls i have heard many things that made me sad daphne made me think that you did not deserve the chance you had been given your greatest drawback is your prettinessyou want to make people admire you you want to make them think you come of handsome distinguished parents from a wealthy homeyou have to have envy and admiration dont you and because your parents are not as grand as you feel they ought to be with you for a daughter and cannot afford to give you as much pocketmoney and pretty things as the others you take what you wantyou steal tm no good said daphne and she looked down at her hands i know that im just no good and yet you have done a very brave thing said miss grayling look at me please daphne the girls admire you todaythey call you a heroine they want to cheer you and clap you you have plenty of good in you daphne had raised her head and was looking at miss grayling she flushed im to blame for what happened to marylou she said when i heard that ellen had been expelled for stealing the things i had really stolen myself i was afraid i was too much of a coward to own upbut i thought if the empty purses and the boxes were found my fingerprints would be on them and id be found out so i thought id send them away by post to a madeup address and marylou knew i was anxious to get the parcel off and thats how she met her accident i see said miss grayling i wondered why you sent away the things daphne it is a great mercy that you found marylou when you did otherwise your foolishness and wrongdoing might have caused a great tragedy suppose you will be sending me home miss grayling said daphne after a pause my parents will have to know why they will guess there is some serious reason they dont pay my fees you know they couldnt afford to my godmother does if she knows about this she will stop paying for my education i shall have spoilt ray whole life am i to be sent away miss grayling i am going to let the girls decide mat said miss grayling gravely that is if you are brave enough to let them daphne i want you to go to the second form and tell them the whole story confess everything to them and see what they say oh i cant said daphne and covered her face with her hands after all ive saidand boasted i cant well you have the choice said miss grayling getting up either i send you home without any more adoor you put yourself in the hands of your school fellows it is a hard thing to do but if you really want to make amends you will do it you have some good in you now is your chance to show it even if it means being braver than you were last night she left daphne and went in to see ellen she sat down by her bed ellen she said daphne is in great trouble the others will know soon and i have come to tell you myself it has been discovered that it was she who took all that money and the jewellery that was missing it took a moment for this to sink into ellens mind then she sat up daphne but the girls thought it was i who took them they accused me theyll never believe it was daphne they will said miss grayling because i rather think daphne herself is going to tell them and now ellen tell mewhat made you take those testpapers the other night you are a scholarship girl with brainsyou did not need to cheat ellen lay down again suddenly she was overcome with shame how did miss grayling know had darrell told everyone then of course she had nobody knows except darrell and myself said miss grayling darrell told me but told no one else so you need not worry but i want to know why you did it there is something you are worrying about ellen and these headaches of yours wont go until you are at peace with yourself and have lost whatever worry it is you have i did need to cheat said ellen in a small voice my brains wouldnt work any more and i got these headaches i knew i wouldnt even pass the testsand the girls that night accused me of being a thief which i wasntand i got all hopeless and thought that i might as well be a cheat if they all thought i was a thief i see said miss grayling but why wouldnt your brain work any more i dont know said ellen because id worked it a bit too hard i expect when i went in for the scholarship you see miss grayling im not really brilliant i get good results because i slog soi go on and on working and studying where perhaps a real scholarship girl can get better results with half the work i worked all through the hols too i was tired when i got herebut i did so badly want to do well mv first term did it matter so much asked miss grayling gently yes said ellen i didnt want to let my people down theyve had to pay out more than they can afford really for my uniform and things theyre so proud of me i must do well and now ive ruined everything not quite said miss grayling feeling very much relieved to find that simple overwork was at the root of ellens trouble and worry about what her family would think i shall write your parents a letter to tell them that you have worked hard and done well but that you are overstrained and must have a real holiday when it comes by next term you will be quite fresh again and you will have forgotten all this and be ready to rush up to the top of the form ellen smiled at the head and the little worried cleft in her forehead disappeared like magic thank you she said gratefully id like to say a lot more but i cant miss grayling popped in to have a word with marylou and then went bade to her own quarters so many girlsso many problemsso much responsibility in putting things right and getting the best oat of every girl no wonder miss grayling had more grey hairs than she should have had daphne owns up immediately after tea that day the second form were told by miss parker that they were to go to their commonroom and wait there why asked belinda in surprise youll see said miss parker go along now someone is waiting there for you they all went and rushed pellmell into the commonroom wondering what the mystery was marylou was there looking a little scared wrapped in her dressinggown matron had carried her down and daphne was there fully dressed the girls rushed at her daphne i youre a heroine daphne well done you saved marylous life daphne did not answer she sat there and looked at them rather white in the face and did not even smile whats the matter asked gwendoline sit down all of you said daphne ive got something to say then i shall go away and you wont see me again good gracious why all this melodrama asked jean disquieted by daphnes tragic voice listen said daphne youve got to listen im the thief i took those things ive been sent away from two schools already for much the same thing miss grayling knew that but she wanted to give me another chance so i came here i told you liesespecially gwen we havent a yacht we havent three or four cars i told you id never been to school before because i didnt want anyone to find out id been expelled i hadnt enough money to pay for some of the subs jean wanted and how could i say that when you all thought my father was a millionaire so i took money and purses and i took jewellery too because i eke pretty things and havent nearly enough myself she paused the faces round her were shocked and horrified gwendoline looked as if she was about to faint her grand friend with her millionaire father no wonder daphne had never asked her to stay for the holidays it was all lies you all look shocked i knew you would be miss grayling said i was to come and confess to you myself and you would judge me i can see you judging me now i dont blame you ive judged myself too and i hate myself i let you accuse ellen wrongly i let you and i fell into the trap and accused ellen said alicia in a shamed voice you are a beast daphne you could have stopped me i shall never forgive myself for doing that to poor old ellen there was a long pause then sally spoke is that all daphne isnt it enough said daphne bitterly perhaps you want to know why i got the wind up and sent away those things in a parcel which poor marylou took for me well when the rumour went round that ellen was expelled for thieving i was scared those purses and things might be discovered with my fingerprints on i know the police always look for prints so i thought id better pack them up put a false address on and send them away through the post then nobody would trace them to me and because of that idiotic idea marylou nearly got killed yesand because of that you came out after me and risked your own life for me said marylous soft voice she got up and went to daphne i dont care what the others say ill stick by you daphne i dont want you to go you wont ever take things again here now i know theres more good in you than bad well im sure i dont want to have anything more to do with her said gwendoline in a disgusted voice if my mother knew shut up gwendoline said darrell im sticking by daphne too ive done some pretty awful things this week myself though i cant tell you what and i think thiswhatever wrong daphne has done this term is cancelled out completely by her courage last night we thought her deed was brave and noble thenand what she has just told us now doesnt make it any less brave or noble i agree with you said sally shes cancelled out her wrong with a right as far as im concerned and whats more it wanted courage to come and face us all like this youve got plenty of that daphne if we stick by you and help you will it make any difference to you i meanwill you stop any underhand ways and mean tricks do you mean that said daphne a sudden hope making her face shine what about the others im with sally and darrell said jean so am i said belinda and irene nodded too emily thought for a moment and added her word as well yes ill agree she said i think youve behaved terribly badly daphneand terribly well too at any rate you ought to have a chance to make good you alicia said sally alicia had been very silent for the last few minutes she was overcome with remorse about ellen she raised her eyes it seems to me mat i need to have a chance given to me to make good as much as daphne she said shamefacedly ive been worse than any of you you have been very hard and merciless alicia said sally you jeer at me for wanting to get proof before we accuse people and for wanting to be fair and kindbut its better in the end i know said alicia i do know that fm sorry ive disliked you because you were headgirl instead of me this term sally ive been a perfect idiot fm not the one to judge daphne ill follow your lead you may be sure well it seems as if its only gwendoline who is standing out said sally turning to the sulkylooking girl poor gwendoline shes lost her grand friend and cant get over it well well go and tell miss grayling that we are all agreed on the matter except gwendoline we want to give daphne another chance and we dont want her to go no dont do that said gwendoline alarmed at the thought of appearing small and mean to miss grayling i agree too and you agree daphne said sally looking at the quiet girl in the chair thank you sally with all my heart said daphne and turned her head away it was a great moment in her lifethe forking of me ways it was up to her to take the right way and she knew it if only she was strong enough to a timid hand touched her arm it was marylou come back to matron now she said she told us we were to as soon as the meeting was over ill help you up the stairs daphne smiled for the first time and this time it was a real smile a sincere one not turned on for the sake of being charming youre the one that needs helping up she said come on or matron will be hounding us out of here jean went to see ellena very different ellen things seemed to be clearing up magically i feel miles better now said ellen im not doing any more real lessons this term jean and no work at all in the hols i shant snap and snarl any more either ive lost that awful headache that made me jumpy it suddenly went after id had a talk with miss grayling it was most extraordinary youre lucky to be in bed just now said jean the tests are simply awful you should have seen the maths one ellen honestly i could only do half the sums but the french one set by mamzelle dupont was wizard what with one thing and another the week of tests passed very quickly and then it was the last week of all mistresses began to look harassed as the task of adding up marks correcting papers making out reports grew heavier and heavier mamzelle dupont worked herself up into a frenzy because she had lost her beautifully addedup marks list and begged miss parker to do it for her again miss parker wouldnt ive enough worries of my own she said youre as bad as belinda mamzelle she managed to answer a history test when all the rest of me class were doing a geography paper dont ask me how that girl is the worst scatterbrain i ever saw in my life how she got hold of a history paper when i had given out geography tests but why didnt she point out the mistake to you asked mamzelle astonished she said she didnt even notice that the questions were history ones groaned miss parker these girls they will be the death of me thank goodness there are only two more days till the end of term only two more days but what hectic ones packing things looking for things losing things exchanging addresses tidying cupboards stacking books cleaning paintpots all the thrilling little things that come at the end of term and add to the excitement of going home its been a queer sort of term said darrell to sally dont you think so sally im not very pleased with some of the things ive done youve been fine though you always are rubbish said sally you dont know how many times ive hated alicia for defying me you dont know lots of things about me ive enjoyed this term though said darrell remembering everything its been interesting ellen and her snappinessand the way we all thought wrong things about herand now its all come right and shes quite different and she and jean are as thick as thieves together and then daphne said sally the word thieves bringing her to mind that was an extraordinary affair wasnt it darrell im glad we gave her a chance isnt it funny the way shes dropped that silly gwendoline mary and taken marylou for her friend jolly good thing said darrell marylou may be a timid little thingbut shes sound at heart and its much better for her to have a friend of her own than go tagging after us all the time but i shall always like little marylou gwendoline looks sour these days said sally nudging her friend as gwendoline went by alone nobodys darling now wont do her any harm said darrell hard heartedly shell soon be mothers darling and miss winters darling and have her bed made for her and everything done dear darling gwendoline mary she didnt come very well out of the daphne affair did she no she didnt perhaps shell be better next term said sally doubtfully ob my goodness what is belinda doing belinda shot by with a workbasket in her arms from which trailed yards and yards of wool and cotton it wound itself round peoples ankles and legs and at last forced her to stop get off my cottons she yelled indignantly youre holding me up oh belindayoull always be an idiot cried darrell unwinding some red wool from her right ankle go away im getting a forest of cotton round me belinda dont forget to bring back a whole lot of funny sketches after the hols i will said belinda with a grin and what about alicia thinking up a new trick for next term hie alicia weve thought of some holiday prep for you make up some super tricks for next term see right called alicia i will you can bank on that better than the oy on mamzelles back darrell oy what is an oy demanded mamzelle dupont bustling up an oy on my back what is this you have done to me now she screwed herself round trying to see what an oy was and the girls screamed with laughter its all right mamzelle its not there now but what is an oy demanded mamzelle shall ask miss parker but miss parker was not interested in mamzelles oys she was only interested in getting the girls safely away on holiday then she could sit down and breathe in peace and at last they were really off cars swung into the drive the traingirls went off singing belinda rushed frantically back for her suitcase which she had as usual forgotten goodbye malory towers yelled the girls goodbye potty goodbye nosey goodbye mamzelle oy theyre gone said mamzelle ah the dear dear girls how i love to see them
