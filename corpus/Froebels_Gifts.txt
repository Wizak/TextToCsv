contents froebels gifts thoughts on the gifts of froebel a correct comprehension of external material things is a preliminary to a just comprehension of intellectual relations friedrich froebel the a b c of things must precede the a b c of words and give to the words abstractions their true foundations it is because these foundations fail so often in the present time that there are so few men who think independently and express skillfully their inborn divine ideas friedrich froebel perception is the beginning and the preliminary condition for thinking ones own perceptions awaken ones own conceptions and these awaken ones own thinking in later stages of development let us have no precocity but natural that is consecutive development friedrich froebel every child brings with him into the world the natural disposition to see correctly what is before him or in other words the truth if things are shown to him in their connection his soul perceives them thus as a conception but if as often happens things are brought before his mind singly or piecemeal and in fragments then the natural disposition to see correctly is perverted to the opposite and the healthy mind is perplexed friedrich froebel the linking together which is everywhere seen and which holds the universe in its wholeness and unity the eye receives and thereby receives the representation but without understanding it except as an impression and an image but these first impressions are the rootfibres for the understanding that is developed later friedrich froebel the correct perception is a preparation for correct knowing and thinking friedrich froebel no new subject of instruction should come to the scholar of which he does not at least conjecture that it is grounded in the former subject and how it is so grounded as its application shows and concerning which he does not however dimly feel it to be a need of the human spirit friedrich froebel the sequences which the child builds as well as the sequence of the kindergarten gifts point on the one hand to physical evolution wherein each form remembers the next inferior and predicts the next higher and on the other to the process of historic development which magnifies the present by linking with it the past and the future susan e blow let us educate the senses train the faculty of speech the art of receiving storing and expressing impressions which is the natural gift of infants and we shall not need books to fill up the emptiness of our teaching until the child is at least seven years old e seguin as soon as we young or old have taken to the habit of asking the book for what it is in our power to learn from personal observation we dismiss our organs of perception and comprehension from their righteous charge and cover the emptiness of our own minds with the patchwork of others e seguin natural geometry taking the word in its limited sense of study of form in space is the object of a desire which generally precedes the artificial curiosity for the meaning of letters e seguin without an accurate acquaintance with the visible and tangible properties of things our conceptions must be erroneous our inferences fallacious and our operations unsuccessful herbert spencer the truths of number of form of relationship in position were all originally drawn from objects and to present these truths to the child in the concrete is to let him learn them as the race learned them herbert spencer if we consider it we shall find that exhaustive observation is an element of all great success herbert spencer learn to comprehend each thing in its entire history this is the maxim of science guided by the reason wm t harris geometrical facts and conceptions are easier to a child than those of arithmetic thomas hill instruction must begin with actual inspection not with verbal descriptions of things from such inspection it is that certain knowledge comes what is actually seen remains faster in the memory than description or enumeration a hundred times as often repeated comenius observation is the absolute basis of all knowledge the first object then in education must be to lead the child to observe with accuracy the second to express with correctness the results of his observation pestalozzi if in the external universe any one constructive principle can be detected it is the geometrical

thou plant for eternity then plant into the deep infinite faculties of man his fantasy and heart wouldst thou plant for year and day then plant into his shallow superficial faculties his selflove and arithmetical understanding what will grow there thos carlyle froebels first gift i wish to find the right forms for awakening the higher senses of the child what symbol does my ball offer to him that of unity the ball connects the child with nature as much as the universe connects man with god friedrich froebel line in nature is not found unit and universe are round nature centres into balls r w emerson from thy hand the worlds were cast yet every leaflet claims from that same hand its little shining sphere of starlit dew o w holmes the small a sphere as perfect as the great to the souls absoluteness robert browning the first gift consists of six soft woolen balls colored in the six standard colors derived from the spectrum namely red orange yellow green blue and violet the balls should be provided with strings for use in the various motions the string unites the ball symbol of the outer world with the child and is the means by which it can act upon his inner nature e g seymour froebel chose the ball as the first gift because it is the simplest shape and the one from which all others may subsequently be derived the shape most easily grasped by the hand as well as by the mind it is an object which attracts by its pleasing color and one which viewed from all directions ever makes the same impression the egyptians and the greeks hung geometrical forms over their cradles so as to strike the eyes of the child with lawful relations froebel introduces colored balls for the same purpose which considering the psychological and emotional condition of the child leads to the joyful conception of motion color and life emma marwedel the most important characteristics of the gift are unity activity color the various colors serve to distinguish these several playmates of the child by special characteristics and enable him to make his first clear analyses or abstractions since the color is the only point wherein the objects differ this contrast in color results in the abstraction of color from form since the ball is the most mobile of inanimate shapes it may be considered as the opposite equal of the living organism the quickness and ease of its motion as well as its elasticity cause the child to regard it as instinct with life while its softness renders him able to grasp and handle it readily its material is also of great advantage in that it lessens the possibility of startling noises which would distract the child from the contemplation of its qualities by its use he is first led to observation and then to selfexpression as the simplest typeform as well as the most universal it offers a satisfactory basis for the classification of objects in general while its indefiniteness and adaptability make it a useful medium for the expression of the childs vague ideas with the ball we give first impressions of unity form color material mobility motion direction and position the ball songs and plays are used as the first exercises in language singing and rhythm as the kindergarten gifts are designed to serve as an alphabet of form by whose use the child may learn to read all material objects it follows that they must form an organically connected sequence moving in logical order from an object which contains all qualities but directly emphasizes none to objects more specialized in nature and therefore more definitely suggestive as to use each successive gift in the series must not only be implicit in but demanded by its predecessor so froebel selects the ball with its simplicity but great adaptability for the startingpoint of his series connected contrasts of motion direction and position are shown in the first gift by the use of pigments the socalled secondary colors purple orange and green may be produced from the opposite hues red and blue red and yellow and blue and yellow the mind is aroused to attention and led to comparison by contrasts on the groundwork of comparison it is enabled to do the work of classification of clear abstraction of the formation of definite ideas by the connection of these contrasts suppose e g that the child by dint of repeated and varied playing with the blue ball of the first gift has succeeded in getting a tolerably clear notion of the blue ball if then you bring the yellow ball to his notice his mind will be led to examine more closely and to compare the two playthings resembling each other so fully in every respect yet differing so widely in color the other balls of the gift are introduced in judicious succession offering new yet milder contrasts these reconcile combine the contrasts first offered they are aided in this by the colors of surrounding objects the child begins to feel that these color impressions however widely they differ have a similar source he is connecting the contrasts and as he succeeds in this he succeeds too in separating abstracting the ball from its color w n hailmann the ball a universal plaything the presentiment of truth always goes before the recognition of it says froebel and it would seem indeed as it in selecting the first gift he looked far back into the past of humanity and there sought the thread which from the beginning connects all times and leads to the farthest future the ball is the last plaything of men as well as the first with children in kreutzers symbolik we read that the educators of the young god bacchus gave him golden balls to play with and also that the youthful princes of persia played with them and alone had this privilege it is a significant fact that we find balls even among the remains of the lake dwellers of northern italy and switzerland while small round balls resembling marbles have been found in the early egyptian tombs the teutons made ballplays national and built houses in which to indulge in these exercises in all sections of germany as late as the close of the sixteenth century the ancient aztecs used the game of ball as a training in warfare for the young men of the nation and that it was considered of great importance is evident from the fact that the tribute exacted by a certain aztec monarch from some of the cities conquered by him consisted of balls and amounted to sixteen thousand annually the ball entered into many of the favorite games alike of the greeks and the romans the former having a special place in their gymnasiums and a special master for it it may be noted also that nearly all our modern sports are based upon the effort to get possession of a ball froebels ideas of first gift froebel considered the ball as an external counterpart of the child in the first stages of his development its undivided unity corresponding to his mental condition and its movableness to his instinctive activity through its recognition he is led to separate himself from the external world and the external world from himself but as he grows he gathers much and learns the use of i and me and finds i am not that i see and other than the things i touch so rounds he to a separate mind from whence clear memory may begin as through the frame that binds him in his isolation grows defined tennysons in memoriam froebels intention was that the first gift should be used in the nursery but as this is for the most part neglected or imperfectly and unwisely done we begin the series of kindergarten playlessons with it illustrating its qualities and asking questions concerning them always diversifying the exercises with rhymes games and songs we must remember that to the young child as to primitive man the activity of an object is more pleasing than its qualities and we should therefore devise a series of games with the fascinating plaything which will lead the child to learn these qualities by practical experience many suggestions for the use of the ball in the nursery may be found in froebels pedagogics of the kindergarten translated by josephine jarvis manner of introduction before beginning any exercise we should fully decide in our own minds the main point or points to be brought out color form or direction for example then and only then will the child gain a clear definite impression and have a distinct remembrance of what we have been trying to teach by way of diversion every song or rhyme in which the ball can play a symbolic part in action and illustrate the point we wish to make is of use in the lessons see kindergarten chimes kate d wiggin pages oliver ditson publishing co with this dainty colored plaything we begin our first bit of education not instruction mere pouring in but true education drawing out developing the balls should be kept in a pretty basket as the beautiful should be cultivated in every way in the true kindergarten and when they are given to the class it should be with some little song sung by the kindergartner or one of the older children at the close of the lesson as the basket is passed each child may gently drop his ball into it saying simply thank you for my ball or naming its color at other times they may be called by the names of fruits or flowers the child saying i will give you a cherry or i will give you a violet method of introduction the qualities of the ball must of course be brought before the childs observation in some more or less definite order and it will be profitable to consider the relative claims of form and color to the first place we might say correctly that to illustrate the ball we should begin with its essential qualities the essential quality is unity unity depends on form and the balls form never changes therefore we might conclude that this should be the first subject under consideration since we always treat of the universal properties of objects before special ones proceeding from homogeneous to heterogeneous this view of the subject is supported by ratichs important maxim first the thing and then its properties the infant begins to examine forms from the commencement of his existence for without this knowledge it is doubtful if he could distinguish one object from another or even be aware of an external world gradually he begins to know objects apart and to recognize them and in time discerns resemblances which cause him to classify them w w speers form lessons conrad diehl on the other hand conrad diehl says color is the first sensation of which an infant is capable with the first ray of light that enters the retina of the eye the presence of color forces itself on the mind when light is present color is present the first impression which the eye receives of an object is its color its form is revealed by the action of light upon its surfaces we recognize at a distance the color of a leaf an apple a flower or berry long before we are able distinctly to make out their forms in the absence of light neither the color nor the form of an object can be seen conrad diehls elements of ornamentation and color herbert spencer spencer says the earliest impressions which the mind can assimilate are those given to it by the undecomposable sensations resistance light sound etc manifestly decomposable states of consciousness cannot exist before the states of consciousness out of which they are composed there can be no idea of form until some familiarity with light in its gradations and qualities or resistance in its different intensities has been acquired for as has long been known we recognize visible form by means of varieties of light and tangible form by means of varieties of resistance similarly no articulate sound is cognizable until the inarticulate sounds which go to make it up have been learned and thus must it be in every other case education page that priority of color to form which as already pointed out has a psychological basis and in virtue of which psychological basis arises this strong preference in the child should be recognized from the very beginning spencers education froebel the balance of authority seems to be on the whole upon the side of presenting color first to the young child as we appeal to the emotions at this age rather than to the intellect and while the senses revel in color form follows more the law of use let us hear however what the great pioneer of child study says upon this point froebel says as distinct and different as color and form may be in themselves they are to the young child indivisible as inseparable as body and life nay the idea of color seems to come to the child as perhaps to mankind in general through the forms so on the other hand the forms gain prominence and impressiveness by the colors hence ideas of colors must at first be coupled with ideas of form and vice versa color and form are in the beginning an undivided unity a person born blind and suddenly enabled to see would at first have no conception of in or out of eye and would be conscious of colors only not of objects when by his sense of touch he became acquainted with objects and had time to associate mentally the objects he touched with the colors he saw then and not till then would he begin to see objects preyers mind of the child page color cannot be abstracted from that which gives it vitality i e form from which it cannot be abstracted without rendering the color flat and meaningless geo l schreiber the color and form of the ball being indissolubly blended in the childs eyes we can scarcely teach them separately at first we may however consider each by itself in order to present the subject more clearly form to teach form in an interesting manner to make it plain to the child without giving him any terms but rather coaxing him by ingenuity to formulate his own knowledge is a difficult thing to do and should not be attempted at all with very young children it seems unnecessary to say that froebel did not intend the ball should be made a medium of object lessons for babies although this distorted view of his idea seems to have entered the minds of some critics the child when old enough to enter a kindergarten will generally know round objects and be somewhat familiar with the ball already in his home plays we should let him roll and grasp it in his tiny fingers till gradually in comparison with other objects handled in the same way he notices the absence of corners edges or any obstructions which would meet his touch or eye then we may ask him if he could make a ball out of a rough block of wood which we show some bright little one will guess that a carpenter could do it with his tools what would he have to do plane it off will perhaps be the answer where and how is he to plane may be the next inquiry and the child often answers all the rough parts and the parts that stick out why does he like to play ball he does not know exactly would he like to play ball with the scissors why not then why does he like to feel the ball in his hand after such preliminary conversations upon the form of the ball we may lead the children first to note other round things in the room and then to recall what they have at home of a similar shape and what they may have seen in the streets these exercises are always delightful to the little ones and are invaluable to the kindergartner as they furnish a thorough test of the childs comprehension of the subject she has been handling we should notice slight divergences from the spherical form in the objects the children name and speak of them they will soon be able to tell in every case where the egg or cobblestone is not just round finding forms of the same general shape as those taken as types is of the highest importance unless this is done pupils are not learning to pass from the particular to the general they are not taught to see many things through the one and the impression they gain is that the particular forms observed are the only forms of this kind unless that which the pupil observes aids him in interpreting something else it is of no value to him certain things are taught that through them other things may be seen pupils should not be trained to see for the sake of the seeing but that they may have the power to see w w speer lessons in form they will of course mention stovelids dinnerplates etc as round objects and the attempt to give a clear and definite understanding of the difference between solids and planes is difficult at first but they very soon discriminate between rounding objects that possess thickness and those that are flat but have curved edges a ball of putty or one of dough is a good thing with which to illustrate this difference we must remember that any abstract teaching on form is too difficult at this time much more difficult than color let the children during these first few weeks draw circles on the blackboard and on paper and sew and draw pictures of balls peaches or round fruits they may also make balls of wax dough or clay rousseau says a child may forget what he sees and sooner still what is said to him but he never forgets what he has made color the comprehension of the single tone of color gradually leads to the comprehension of the full chord the recognition of single colors leads to the recognition of shades and their harmonious connections thus step by step the capacity of comprehending nature in its beauty and with its treasures is developed emma marwedel childhoods poetry and studies page again suppose the playlesson for the day to be upon color of course the subject may be handled in a dozen different ways and serve for a dozen different lessons a few hints only are here given as in matters of detail it is better that each teacher should be free and unguided in the use of her own ingenuity we may take perhaps the red ball and holding it high in the air ask who has a ball exactly like mine look carefully now and then show me a volley of balls comprising every color in the rainbow will be shot into the air and then becomes necessary the task of discrimination we may find the red ones and gratify the children by naming those who possess them as it seems a great honor in their eyes now they should be led to find every bit of red in the room andrews stockings marys ribbon the tiny pipings on katies apron jims necktie your belt the flowers on the wall etc the scene will become intensely exciting the bright eyes will begin searching in every corner of the room and the transport which will greet us when anything far out of sight and of the right color is discovered is truly refreshing professor earl barnes of stanford university reports that in his various color experiments on the pacific coast children having been studied a very large majority selected red as their favorite color all the children as far as possible should be engaged in this diversion while the most timid and backward should be kept near and encouraged with word and smile the name of the color should not be asked for or given till it can be matched by all and found in surrounding objects we may ask what flowers they have seen which were like the color they are studying and show them some of the more familiar kinds also speak of the action of the sun in making certain fruits red the raspberries and strawberries for instance some rosyfaced little urchin in the class may be chosen and asked how he keeps such red cheeks and from this the idea of red as the color of warmth and life may be developed we may proceed with blue and yellow then with violet orange and green in like manner constantly diversifying the exercises with plays songs and appropriate stories hints on additional color exercises the formation of the socalled secondary colors will not be very obvious to the younger children nor is the fact to be taught scientifically or learned by them they will however be greatly interested in the mixing of paints in small dishes or the blending of different colored crayons on the blackboard red and yellow into orange yellow and blue into green blue and red into purple pieces of glass are serviceable objects with which to show the same thing or we can buy the gelatine films from any kindergarten supply store holding the red and yellow one on the other for instance the piece nearer the eye will of course determine the shade if the red piece be next the eye the orange color will be deeper than if the yellow were in the same position none of these experiments however will produce pure colors the green and purple being especially unsatisfactory among the devices with which to teach color may be recommended a color quilt made of various shades and shapes of woolens and silks or ribbons this may be used as a sort of chart to the great delight of the children and is one of the valuable aids in teaching because it calls out both individual and general action we may also make a clothesline of twine and suspend it from door to door or between any two suitable points attaching to it pieces of all colors and after a while of various tints and shades of worsted letting the children touch the ones designated or find bits of the same color as their balls cards wound with different tints and shades of the same color are also useful when the children have developed greater powers of discrimination and a chart or map may be made by pasting colored squares triangles oblongs or circles on a ground of gray bristol board then too we may have a box of tablets of the simple geometrical figures and giving a quantity to the children let them arrange the different colors in separate rows children of all ages will be fascinated by the spectrum natures palette of pure colors which the sunlight streaming through a prism shows upon the wall and as it can be supplemented by a spectrum chart for cloudy days they will delight to arrange their colored papers to imitate it the older children will gain much valuable knowledge by experimenting with the color tops and if a color wheel with the accompanying maxwell disks can be obtained the materials for color education will be quite complete it must not be forgotten that the purpose of all these exercises is that the child may learn to know the six standards and subsequently their intermediates and may in time learn to use and combine them harmoniously it is therefore essential that the colors supplied him shall be fresh and pure and that he not only have freedom to make his own experiments but materials to preserve them in permanent form when they prove successful care should be taken in the selection of all materials for color lessons to get as perfect foundation colors as possible no faded or poor shades are allowable as they lead the child astray when the children are just making friends with the teacher and with each other it is very interesting and profitable for them to formulate their mite of knowledge into a sentence each one holding his ball high in the air with the right hand and saying my ball is red like a cherry my ball is yellow like a lemon my ball is blue like the sky my ball is orange like a marigold my ball is green like the grass my ball is violet like a plum we should not however allow this to degenerate into mere recitation but let the child find his own objects of comparison and change them when he chooses for any others that occur to him this prevents parrot repetition and gives room for individuality and real selfexpression motion direction position the child of three or four years has seldom any conception of the terms rightleft here there up down near far over under frontback even if he has a dim idea of direction he cannot express himself regarding it nor is he certain enough of his knowledge to be able to move or place the ball according to dictation motion is always easy and delightful to the child and therefore he will move his ball in different directions as the words and music suggest when he would be too timid to express a thought and is willing and happy to do in unison what he would hesitate to do by himself the ball may be made a startingpoint in giving the child an idea of various simple facts about objects in general and in illustrating in movements the many terms with which we wish him to become familiar the meaning of the terms to swing hop jump roll spring run away come back fall draw bounce and push may be taught by a like movement of the ball urging the child to give his own interpretation of the motions in words all the children may then make their balls hop spring roll or swing at the same time accompanying the movements by appropriate rhymes the ball is more purely a plaything than anything which the child receives in the kindergarten and its mobility is so charming it so easily slips from his hands and travels so delightfully far when dropped that exercises with it soon become riotous if not carefully guided every playlesson on the ball should close with some active exercise in which the children may indulge their wish for a game with their dear playfellow and in which they may also gain greater skill and learn practically the laws of motion when sitting at their tables each pair of children may roll a ball to and fro all beginning at the same moment or the first pair may begin the second and third follow and so on until all are rolling they may throw balls against the wall or toss them in the air or throw them alternately first in the air then against the wall they may toss them to each other at increasing distances the whole company of children may be arranged in two rows and throw the balls to each other in unison or they may pass them from hand to hand as in a wandering game all the exercises being accompanied with appropriate songs or rhymes the laws of incidence and reflection may be simply taught by leading the children to note that if they strike the ball straight against the wall it will bound straight back and then asking them to see if it returns when thrown in a slanting direction symbolic stage of childs development in order to present the ball in a more attractive light in the kindergarten to suit it to the symbolic stage of the childs development and to bring it nearer to his sympathies we constantly in our play suppose it to be something which it resembles in certain of its characteristics by its color it may represent a fruit a flower or a gayly dressed child by its form an egg a downy chicken a tiny duckling by its mobility a bird a squirrel a baby or when fastened to its string a bucket in the well a toy wagon a pendulum or a pet lamb tethered by the roadside the child is always at home in the world of makebelieve and delights in the stories and the many charming songs to which this imaginative use of the ball gives rise perhaps we may wisely remind ourselves however that though the childs fancy is most vivid and though the ball is well adapted to represent many objects yet if it resemble in no single point the thing to which we liken it we are indulging in empty imaginings which will only hinder the childs comprehension of truth the resemblance of the symbol to the thing signified is a very important matter in education especially in kindergarten education geo p brown essentials of educational psychology coцperative exercises the teacher who truly understands the great principles on which froebel built the kindergarten will ever be mindful of one of the highest of these the brotherly union of those who are likeminded even in the simple plays with the first gift group work is easily possible the stringing of the first gift beads or the supplementary modeling in clay may be made into a coцperative exercise the work with the balls at the sandtable may have a similar aim and many of the ball games are well fitted to unite the whole community of children older and younger in a common aim a common purpose if therefore genuine brotherliness consideration and respect for playmates and fellowmen are again to become prevalent they can become so only by being connected with the feeling of community abiding in each man however much or little of it may be found and by fostering this feeling with the greatest care friedrich froebel education of man page what we should strive for we must remember that on a carefully prepared plan of procedure depends much of the value of any system of education therefore we must decide when the child comes under our tutelage what we wish to accomplish and what shall be our method of accomplishing it and yet as the first gift is not the last as it is but the first link in a chain of related objects it is obvious that it must be chiefly useful as a startingpoint each lesson should be carefully studied by the teacher for the foundation is being laid for all future acquisition the kindergarten gifts are designed to lead to the mastery of material objects but at the same time they are always connected with the childs experience and affection by being often transported into the region of fancy and feeling in a blending of realism and symbolism omitting everything which has reference to the moral and physical development and speaking now only of that which is intellectual what we should strive for at the beginning is that the child may acquire a habit of quick observation with clear and precise expression that in due time he may see not only quickly but accurately in short that a slight degree of judgment may begin to attend his perceptions so that he may know as well as observe it is not enough to awaken the curiosity of a child and to heap up in his memory a mass of good materials which will combine of themselves in due time and which the brain when more highly developed will arrange in systematic groups we should endeavor as far as possible to control the first impressions which sink unconsciously into a childs mind but still more careful should we be in the selection of those later ones which we try to inculcate and of the links which we wish to establish between such and such perceptions sentiments or actions we should seek to develop side by side with the perceptions the faculty of judging and acting rightly to give a child very little to observe at a time but to make him observe that little well and rightly is the true way of forming and storing his mind the process of receiving an idea must be through sensation attention and perception conception and judgment being later processes the curiosity to know must be kept alive for it is our greatest ally and the imagination must be fed for the child remembers only what interests him recognizing what is to be accomplished we say then a the ball is one of the first means used in awakening and developing the dawning consciousness and growing faculties of the child b the beginning must be well made or no later step will seem clear c if the first opportunity which occurs of dealing with the gift or with any instrumentality of education is wasted interest on the part of the child is permanently lessened d the mind retains clear impressions in proportion to the degree of spontaneous interest and attention with which they are received e the law of diminishing interest decrees that each point in a successful exercise shall be more interesting than the previous one f the lessons must not be confined to so narrow a channel that they become monotonous and they must leave room for the child to develop and not attempt to prescribe his mental action tiedemann says liberty of action even in imitated actions is one of the conditions of a childs happiness besides that it has the effect of exercising and developing all his faculties example is the first tutor and liberty the second in the order of evolution but the second is the better one for it has inclination for its assistant readings for the student from cradle to school bertha meyer pages education herbert spencer kindergarten culture w n hailmann

intimation in the cube of the unity which lies at the foundation of all manifoldness and from which the latter proceeds friedrich froebel notice has now become observation and observation leads to discrimination he sees and is curious by nature but it belongs to us to lead him to observe and inquire emily shirreff froebels second gift consists of a wooden sphere cube and cylinder two inches in diameter as now made with rods and standards for revolution the wooden sphere has no string like the balls of the first gift because the child no longer needs the outward connection he now realizes the spiritual connection between himself and the outer world e g seymour in the first gift the child received objects of the same shape and size but of different colors thus learning to separate color from form in the second gift he receives unlike objects and learns to distinguish them from each other by their individual peculiarities the first gift suggests unity and leads to the detection of resemblances the second suggests variety or manifoldness and emphasizes contrasts the most important characteristic of the gift is contrast of form leading to the distinction of different objects the mediation of contrasts here suggests the connection of all objects however widely separated the purpose of the gift is to stimulate observation and comparison by presentation of striking contrasts and to afford new bases for the classification of objects spencer says that any systematic ministrations to the perceptions ought to be based upon the general truth that in the development of every faculty markedly contrasted impressions are the first to be distinguished that hence sounds greatly differing in loudness and pitch colors very remote from each other and substances widely removed in hardness or texture should be the first supplied and that in each case the progression must be by slow degrees to impressions more nearly allied education page the geometrical forms illustrated in this gift are sphere cube solids cylinder double cone seen in motion conoid planes circles squares the sphere and cube are sharply contrasting forms and the cylinder illustrates the connecting link between the two possessing characteristics of both the cylinder is the first example froebel gives of the intermediate transition forms connecting opposites which he explains as the very ground plan of nature and on which his fundamental law of contrasts and connection of contrasts the law of all harmonious development and creative industry is based e shirreff points to be noted in each new gift that which follows is always conditioned upon that which goes before says froebel and he makes this apparent to children through his educational processes the gifts show this idea in concrete form we cannot evolve what has not first been involved in entering upon a consideration of the second gift one thing cannot fail to impress us and that is the continuous development in each new set of objects placed before the child together with an increase of difficulty or complexity which is never without a corresponding forethought careful arrangement and attention to logical sequence thus the newly introduced objects can never seem unnatural to him we shall find that in every new gift or occupation there is always a suggestion of the last enough to make it a pleasant reminder of knowledge gained and difficulties surmounted and so the child sees not everything painfully strange but something which at least recalls to his mind his former friend and familiar playfellow nothing charms us more than the recognition of the old in the new the man who hurries through a foreign city indifferent and inattentive to the passing crowd feels a quick thrill of pleasure when in the midst of all the strangers he recognizes a familiar face e minhinnick method of attack in first exercise in the first lesson with the second gift the child will quickly see the similarities between his former worsted ball and his new companion the wooden sphere let him take these two balls together and find out the similarities and dissimilarities remembering that before he compares objects consciously experiences should invariably be given him we should always draw attention to the universal properties of things first and then proceed to the specific the qualities common to all objects are the universal ones form size color material etc the invariable rule should be simple before complex concrete before abstract unity before variety universal qualities before special ones if we are in doubt as to whether we shall first direct attention to the similarities or to the dissimilarities between the ball and sphere we may recall the educational maxim the childs eye always at first seizes the analogous the point of union the whole connection of things and only after that begins to discern differences and opposition the infant mind is transparent to resemblance but opaque to difference susan e blow symbolic education page ball and sphere in comparing the ball and the sphere the child will observe in the first place that they are both round and both roll equally well but that one has color one being without one is soft the other hard one quiet one noisy one a little rough to the touch the other velvet smooth he should find for and by himself aided by our suggestive questioning the reasons for these evident differences it is absolutely necessary that each child should have one of the boxes containing the solids or at least the three forms of the gift without the box rods and standards and examine them thoroughly and often as he will be glad to do if the solids as ordinarily manufactured are too costly for a kindergartner of limited means she can substitute large marbles blocks and linen thread spools the material does not matter so long as each child has the objects to handle value of the discriminative power method by which it may be developed we need not be distressed if the lessons are a little noisy when the children are making the acquaintance of these wonderful new friends to be sure they will pound the wooden forms heartily up and down on the table if they are threeyear old babies they certainly would and should do so but within bounds what does it matter if it can be arranged so that other classes shall not be disturbed and each child can have the same opportunity for experimenting as his neighbor there will be no great harm done we are endeavoring to rouse all the latent energies of the child by the presentation of these objects to his observation and he must have full liberty to make the various experiments which suggest themselves to him his desire to hear the sound of the objects is so manifest that it would be folly to try and thwart it it is far better to use the desire for educational purposes and divert it into the channel of systematized noise let us suppose that we are carpenters today and pound the wooden objects on the floor in exact time with a building song let us play we are drummer boys and tap with our drumsticks for the soldiers to march or shall we make believe that the sphere is a woodpecker and let it tap on the trees while we recite some simple little rhyme for second gift songs see kindergarten chimes kate d wiggin pages oliver ditson publishing co this craving of young children for information says bernard perez is an emotional and intellectual absorbing power as dominant as the appetite for nutrition and equally needing to be watched over and regulated it is not alone the noise of the sphere which delights the child though this is always pleasing it is the knowledge he is gaining the new ideas that dawn upon him for the first time in recognizable form it is in fact a knowledge of cause and effect he has often dropped the woolen ball and pounded it on the table and it produced no sound he does the same with the sphere and recognizes the difference he will begin to experiment with other objects by and by to classify his knowledge and finally he will see and remember that like causes produce like effects and in progressing thus far will have made a tremendous stride the child will see all the more clearly in comparing the woolen ball and wooden sphere the difference between soft and hard rough and smooth light and heavy if he is allowed to perform his own experiments the sound is a yet higher sign of life to the child as he then and also later likes to lend speech to all dumb things therefore he also desires to hear sound and speech from everything froebels pedagogics page the cube we will now turn to the investigation of the cube and open a new world of information to the child and here we seem to deviate a little from the famous educational maxim proceed from the known to the unknown and almost to make a leap into the dark however we very soon give the cylinder and thus connect the opposites here he meets a dazzling quantity of new appearances the square sides or faces and the many edges and corners all of which must be viewed in comparison with the sphere we can give him an experience of the faces of the cube without conscious analysis by letting the ball roll against them mediation of contrasts of course we shall see the underlying idea of the gift to be the connection of opposites not too much can be said of this law so allimportant and significant in froebels system we should bear it constantly in mind and bring it in connection with every new phase of our work froebel cannot be understood clearly unless this deep principle which lies at the very root of his system is appreciated and comprehended at the same time it is when formulated an abstract and metaphysical statement which one cannot grasp at once but to which one must grow but each thing is recognized only when it is connected with the opposite of its kind and when the union accord similitude with this object are found and the connection with the opposite and the discovery of the uniting renders the recognition so much the more complete froebels education of man page it may be said that comparatively few kindergartners know its value nevertheless knowledge of this kind can never be useless or fruitless to the person who is forming the mind of the child and who should be a perfect mistress of her science and her art value of contrasts these contrasts of the second gift and all contrasts arouse the mind to attention we can have no judgment without comparison we should have no idea of heat or darkness if we had not a conception of cold and light the quality of sweetness would have no meaning if its opposite did not serve to stimulate comparison the sphere is sharply contrasted with the cube so that there may be a ready perception of the striking qualities of both the more abrupt the contrast the more readily noticed and described for it takes a more developed eye to discern the difference between a sphere and a spheroid for instance than between a sphere and a cube the contrasts of the first gift were contrasts of color mediations of them being shown also and contrasts of direction and position or situation another point less readily seen in the first gift perhaps was froebels thought that the ball in its perfect simplicity and unity when first given to the young child is regarded by him as another contrasted individuality almost as capable of life in its varied movements as he is himself mobility of sphere the sphere is the symbol of motion the cube the embodiment of rest and the fact should be illustrated in divers ways we may for instance place the sphere near the rim of a plate and by inclining the latter a little the sphere will roll rapidly round its own axis and round the rim a few simple little rhymes may be taught which the children may say or sing together while the sphere is journeying rapidly round and round the plate for as froebel says the thought always grows clearer to the child when word and motion go hand in hand sphere and cube the cube can only be moved on the contrary when force is exerted and then it merely slides to stop when the force is removed the children will soon see why the cube is so lazily inclined and why the sphere is ever rolling rolling about scarcely to be kept still for by various experiments we may show that the sphere stands only on a little part of its face the cube on the whole the sphere is always the same in whatever way regarded and to whatever tests subjected it is always an emblem of unity and cannot be robbed of its simplicity its unity its freedom from all that is puzzling the cube on the contrary being made to revolve on any one of its axes constantly shows a different aspect so that the child views it as a very extraordinary little block full of fascinating surprises and whimsical apparitions it is put upon the string and when whirled rapidly mysteriously loses its identity and appears to the little ones laughing gaze as an entirely different object and yet as the motion grows more sedate the new form fades away and the cube reappears so quickly as to make him rub his eyes and wonder if he has been dreaming counting faces the square faces of the cube in comparison with the one curved unbroken surface of the sphere must now be noted and may be counted if we are using the gift as a means of instruction we must beware however of making this counting exercise into a lesson or requiring that the number of faces shall be learned and recited every teacher of experience will corroborate mr w n hailmann when he says if the kindergartner sets the cube before the child and counts the faces edges and corners so that he may know all about it the childs interest if born at all will soon die if the faces are counted as they are all so exactly alike the children may sometimes be puzzled as to the number by enumerating the same one more than once this difficulty may be obviated by pasting a paper square of a different color on each face and then submitting it to examination giving each child an opportunity to count since independent selfactivity is to be more and more encouraged if the faces edges and corners be made the integral point of an interesting story or play the child will have little difficulty in recalling their number and character but we must remember that lively interest and steady progress come only from following and feeding the childs purposes cylinder we now proceed to the cylinder the reconciliation of the two opposites an object which having qualities possessed by both occupies a middle ground in which each has something in common froebel originally took the doll as the intermediate form uniting in itself the opposites of the sphere and cube and thus showed that he understood child nature well for no toy follows the ball with greater certainty than the doll but now as man both unites the single which finds its limits in itself and the manifold which is constantly developing and reconciles them within himself as opposites there results also to the child from both from sphere and cube outwardly united the expression of the animate and active especially as embodied in the doll froebels pedagogics page the cylinder however was subsequently selected as being more in line with the other geometrical forms shown in the sequence of gifts it is as easily moved as the sphere upon one side as prone to rest as the cube when placed upon the other it has the curved surface of the sphere and the flat faces of the cube it has no corners but two curved edges more edges than the sphere fewer than the cube less unity than the sphere more than the cube its importance as a mediation or connecting link is further shown by suspending the cube on a string by which it may be twisted rapidly and caused to revolve in this motion a cylinder being readily seen when the cylinder is spun in like manner a sphere suddenly appears and so the wonderful and subtle bond of union is complete on revolving the cylinder on an axis parallel to the circular faces we find that it incloses a solid opaque sphere teaching us the lesson not only that each member of the second gift contains each and all of the others but that whatever is in the universe is in every individual part of it that even the meanest holds the elements of the noblest that the highest life is even in what in shortsighted conceit we call death w n hailmann law of childhood page hints as to manner and method let the children call the cylinder a roller or barrel if they choose and tell them the right name when it is needful each gift must be thoroughly understood before we pass to the next or there will be no orderly development but as the impressions have all been made through the senses of the child we must not expect him to voice these impressions in logical phrases all at once so beware of making the lesson irksome or wearisome to him through a formal questioning that does not properly belong to childhood when the keen appetite for knowledge disappears we may well despair if several children in our class express dislike of a certain exercise or lesson and seem to dread its appearance we may be well assured that the fault lies in our method of putting it before them and strive in all humility for a better understanding of them of ourselves and of the subject we must not however be too hard in our selfjudgments and lose courage we are not responsible for a child who is born tired and who seems to have no interest in anything either in heaven above or in the earth beneath until by ingenuity and perseverance we are able to open the eyes and ears which see and hear not it will be remembered that in discussing the first play or lesson with the second gift great freedom was advised but let us note the difference between liberty and lawlessness between spontaneity and the confusion of selfassertion which is sometimes mistaken for it no lesson or play amounts to anything unless conducted with order and harmony unless at its close no matter how merry and hearty the enjoyment some quiet and lasting impression has been made on the mind many teachers miss the happy medium and in trying with the best intentions to allow the individuality of the child proper development only succeed in gaining excitement and disorder dangers of object lessons the second gift is more than any other too much used for mere object lessons and these are invariably dangerous because there is apt to be too much impressing of the teachers own ideas upon the mind and too little actual handling perceiving observing comparing judging concluding on the childs part and that is the only logical way in which he is able to form a clearly crystallized idea we can have no higher authority than dr alexander bain who says that the object lesson more than anything else demands a careful handling there being great danger lest an admirable device should settle down into a plausible but vicious formality how to deal successfully with second gift it is not uncommon to hear students in kindergarten training classes and even some fullfledged kindergartners express a distaste for the second gift and it is unfortunately even more common to find the children dealing with it either sunk in deepest apathy or mercifully oblivious of the matter in hand and chatting with their neighbors the fact is that we have too commonly made the exercises dull dreary affairs we have doled out the forms to the children and asked a series of formal questions about them giving no experiments no concerted work and no opportunity for action the children have been intensely bored therefore either stupid or wandering and the kindergartner has attributed her want of success to the gift and not to her method of dealing with it let the light of imagination shine on the scene and note the answering sparkle in the childrens eyes who cares for the names of all the faces on a stupid block but who doesnt care when its a house and johnnie cant find his mother though he looks in the front door and the back door the righthand door the lefthand door the cellardoor and finally the trapdoor leading to the roof nobody knows or wants to know when questioned if the cylinder rolls better on its flat circular face or on its rounding face but when its a log of wood in the forest and must be taken home for winter fires then it is worth while to experiment and see how it may be moved most easily the second gift too is delightful for groupwork in the sand table where the objects may be treated symbolically and likened to a hundred different things with the second gift beads which in the natural wood color are admirable supplements to the larger forms the children are always charmed assorting and stringing them according to fancy or dictation and with the addition of sticks making them into rows of soldiers trees in flowerpots kitchen utensils churns stoves lamps and divers other household objects the kindergartner may give many a lesson in the simple principles of mechanics with the second gift and its rods and standards allowing the children to experiment freely as well as to follow her suggestions the pulley the steelyard the capstan the pump the mechanical churn the wheelbarrow etc may all be made adding the beads where necessary and thus the child gain a real working knowledge of simple machinery treatment of previous gifts when passed over the preceding gift need not entirely disappear but be used occasionally for a pleasing review as a bond of friendly intercourse between older and younger pupils this will convey an indirect hint perhaps to the little ones that it is not well to neglect old friends for new ones but that they should still love and value the playthings and playmates of former days the giving of a new play by no means precludes the further use of the preceding and earlier plays but on the contrary the use of the preceding play for some time longer with the new play and alternating with it makes the application of the new play so much the easier and more widely significant froebels pedagogics page second gift forms in architecture and cube in ancient times these three objects the sphere cylinder and cube constitute a triad of forms united in architecture and sculpture producing the column which is made up of the pedestal or base the cube the shaft the cylinder and the capital the sphere in a book on egyptian antiquities we find that in the beginning of the culture of that country the three graces or goddesses of beauty were represented by three cubes leaning upon each other the egyptians did not of course know that it was the first regular form of solid bodies in nature or crystallization but the significant fact again brings us to the thought expressed in the first lecture it would seem indeed as though froebel in selecting his gifts looked far back into the past of humanity and there sought the thread which from the beginning connects all times and leads to the farthest future froebels monument and here we leave the second gift that trinity of forms which wrought in marble marks the place dear and sacred to all kindergartners the grave of froebel a simple monument to one so great yet so connected with our study and the childs experience that with all its simplicity it is strangely effective a still more enduring monument he has in the millions of happy children who have found their way to knowledge through the door which he opened to them indeed if half the children he has benefited could build a tower of these tiny blocks to commemorate his life and death its point would reach higher than st peters dome and draw the thoughts of men to heaven suggestions of the gift this gift can hardly be studied but that an inner unity born of these reconciled contrasts suggests itself to the imagination the cube seems to stand as the symbol of the inorganic the mineral kingdom with its wonderful crystals the cylinder as the type of vegetable life suggesting the roots stems and branches with their rounded sides and forming a beautiful connection between the cube that emblem of things in the earth beneath and the sphere which completes the trinity and speaks to us of a neverending and perfect whole having unity for its centre diversity for its circumference the cube seems to suggest rest immobility the cylinder in this connection growth and the sphere perfection completeness so delicately poised it is only kept in its proper place by the most exquisite adjustment and so to us sometimes the things that are visible become luminous with suggestions of greater realities which are yet unseen and in the least we discern a faint radiance of the greatest things that are small mirror things that are mighty the tiny sphere is an emblem of the big round world and the planetary systems the cube recalls the wonderful crystals and shows the form that men reflect in architecture and sculpture as for the cylinder it is natures special form and god has taught man through nature to use it in a thousand ways and indeed has himself fashioned man more or less in its shape mr hailmann says the second gift presents types of the principal phases of human development from the easy mobility of infancy and childhood the ball we pass through the halfsteady stages of boyhood and girlhood represented in the cylinder to the firm character of manhood and womanhood for which the cube furnishes the formula bishop brooks speaking from the words the length and the breadth of it are equal in his sermon on symmetry of life uses the cube as a symbol of perfect character the personal push of a life forward its outreach laterally or the going out in sympathy to others the upward reach toward god these he considers the three life dimensions but such building must be done without nervous haste the foundation must hint solidly of the threefold purpose length breadth and thickness must be kept in proportion if the perfect cube of life is ever to be found note on second gift the second gift even in the nursery calls for modifications from the form in which it comes to us from froebel it is incomparable in its rich symbolism for illustrating froebels thought to mature minds and answers quite a useful purpose in the nursery where it may help mamma tell her stories but in the kindergarten the child wants to build with blocks hence the third fourth fifth and sixth gifts are indicated the second gift as such is to say the least an anachronism only in the form of the beads or some similar expedient which gives many of these things for control will it satisfy the kindergarten child when he is expected to study the cube as an object lesson to count the squares and corners and tell where they are it is wholly unpalatable to him and entirely foreign to his plans w n hailmann thoughts on the discriminative power mind starts from discrimination the consciousness of difference is the beginning of every intellectual exercise our intelligence is therefore absolutely limited by our power of discrimination the other functions of intellect the retentive power for instance are not called into play until we have first discriminated a number of things the minuteness or delicacy of the feeling of difference is the measure of the variety and multitude of our primary impressions and therefore of our storedup recollections bear in mind the fact that until a difference is felt between two things intelligence has not yet made the first step the higher arts of comparison to impress difference are best illustrated when both differences and agreements have to be noted i e similarities and dissimilarities discrimination is the necessary prelude of every intellectual impression as the basis of our storedup knowledge or memory definition of the state of mind significantly named indifference the state where differing impressions fail to be recognized as distinct the retentive power works up to the height of the discriminative power it can do no more alex bain the most delightful and fruitful of all the intellectual energies is the perception of similarity and agreement by which we rise from the individual to the general trace sameness in diversity and master instead of being mastered by the multiplicity of nature friedrich froebel it is by comparisons that we ascertain the difference which exists between things and it is by comparisons also that we ascertain the general features of things and it is by comparisons that we reach general propositions in fact comparisons are at the bottom of all philosophy louis agassiz readings for the student from cradle to school bertha meyer pages the kindergarten emily shirreff

of the dust john ruskin mme a de portugalls synoptical table as given in essays on the kindergarten the building gifts the building gifts meet two very strongly marked tendencies in the child a the tendency to investigate b the tendency to transform the first and second gifts consist of undivided units each one of which stands in relation to a larger whole or to a class of objects the third fourth fifth and sixth gifts are divided units and their significance lies in the relationship of the parts to one another and to the whole of which they are the parts the effect of the building gifts is to develop the constructive powers of the child their secondary importance lies in the fact that they afford striking fundamental perceptions of form size number relation and position the following rules should govern the dictation exercises building rules use all material in order to keep the idea of relation of parts to a whole and because all unused material is wasted material in each construction the whole of the materials must be used or at least each separate piece must be arranged so as to stand in some actual relation to the whole while this awakens the thinking spirit it also strengthens and elevates the imagination because amidst so much variety the underlying unity is made visibly apparent froebels letters tr by michaelis and moore page build on the squares of the table in order to develop accuracy and symmetry induce the child to form other wholes gradually and systematically from the various parts of the cube in doing this the laws of contrast and development must be your guide koehler give names to each object constructed thereby bringing it into relation with the childs experience for the miniature model serves to interpret more clearly to him the object which it represents connect with the childs life and sympathy in order to increase his interest and develop the tendency to view things in their right relations the younger the child the more you should talk about the thing which you intend to construct you should intersperse passing observations or short songs as the children gain intelligence this conversation will be replaced by more formal descriptions of the things represented koehler begin with life forms and proceed from these to forms of beauty and knowledge allow no child to rely upon the blocks of his playmates in his building thus he will learn economy selfreliance and independence of action this should not be carried too far or rather the necessity and beauty of interdependence should also be taught herein indeed lies more than at first appears to make the most out of little is the great work of life to be contented with what one has and to make the best of it with happiness and contentment is surely no small lesson and one which is constantly though indirectly taught in the kindergarten work and plays and lessons group work or united building should frequently be introduced every direction given by the kindergartner should be followed by spontaneous work either in word or deed by the child this must not only be individual but synthesized for the community often encourage the class to imitate some specially attractive form which has been produced by a child and named according to his fancy accustom the child to develop figures or forms by slight changes rather than by rudely destroying each single one preparatory to constructing another from learning to be strictly methodical in his actions he will become so in his later reasoning let the child if possible correct his own mistakes and do not constantly interfere with his work whatever he is able to do for himself no one should do for him koehler froebels third gift all children have the building instinct and to make a house is a universal form of unguided play it is not a mere pastime but a key with which to open the outer world and a means of awakening the inner world this gift includes in itself more outward manifoldness and at the same time makes the inward manifoldness yet more perceptible and manifest the plaything shows also the ultimate type of structures put together by human hand which stand in their substantiality around the child friedrich froebel the definitely productive exercises begin with the third gift susan e blow the third gift is a wooden cube measuring two inches in each of its dimensions it is divided once in its height breadth and thickness according to the three dimensions which define a solid and thus eight smaller cubes are produced we pass from the undivided to the divided unit emphasizing the fact that unity still exists though divisibility enters as a new factor the most important characteristics of the gift are contrasts of size resulting in the abstraction of form from size increase of material as a whole decrease of size in parts increase of facilities in illustrating form and number the new experience to be found in this first divided body is the idea of relativity of the whole in its relation to the parts each an embryo whole and of the parts in relation to the whole the form of the parts is like the form of the whole but in shape alike the dissimilarity is in size the fact becoming more apparent by a variety of combinations of a different number of parts thus the relations of numbers are introduced to the observation of the child together with those of form and magnitude the third gift was intended by froebel to meet the necessities of the child at a period when no longer satisfied with the external appearances of things he strives to penetrate their internal conditions and begins to realize the many different possibilities of the same element the geometrical forms illustrated in this gift are cube solids square prism rectangular parallelopiped planes square oblong froebel intends the building exercise to be carried on in a certain way with a view of establishing a law to regulate the childs activity the upper and lower parts of the figure the contrasts are first brought into position and the balance is established by the intermediates right and left the cube itself is divided according to the law of mediation of contrasts the contrasts of exterior and interior whole and parts analysis and synthesis are also brought into relation with each other hailmann on third gift mr w n hailmann says that the third gift marks an important step in the mental life of the child heretofore he has had to do with playthings indivisible whole complete in themselves every impression or rather every fact came to him as a unit a one an indivisible whole the analyses and syntheses that are presented to him in the first and second gifts come readymade as it were so that the joyous exercise of his instinctive activity guided and directed by the judicious loving mother is sufficient to give him control of them indeed the first and second gifts hold to his mental development the same relation that the mothers milk holds to his physical growth but the third gift satisfies the growing desire for independent activity for the exercise of his own power of analysis and synthesis of taking apart and putting together the idea of separation gained here in concrete form becomes typical of that condition which must always exist in any growth the seed breaks through its coverings and seems to divide itself into distinct parts each having its function in the growth of the whole plant alice h putnam simplicity but adaptability of the gifts simple as this first building gift appears it is capable of great things it lends itself to a hundred practical lessons and a hundred charming transformations but if it is not thoroughly comprehended it will never be well or effectively used by the kindergartner and will be nothing more to her than to uninterested observers who see in it nothing more than eight commonplace little blocks in a wooden box froebel says if his educational materials are found useful it cannot be because of their exterior which is as plain as possible and contains nothing new but that their worth is to be found exclusively in their application how children are to be reached therefore these simple devices with which we carry on our education should never seem trifling for we are compelled in teaching very young children to put forth all gentle allurements to the gaining of knowledge they are to be reached chiefly by the charms of sense novelty and variety and consequently to please such active and imaginative little critics our lessons must be fresh vivid vigorous and to the point what is necessary on part of kindergartner to accomplish this we can see that not only is absolute knowledge necessary but that a well developed sensibility and imagination are needed in leading the child from the indefinite to the definite from universal to particular and from concrete to abstract the worth of the gifts then we repeat lies exclusively in their application the rude little forms must be used so that the childs imagination and sympathy will be reached imagination in child and kindergartner we may be thankful that this heavenborn imaginative faculty is the heritage of every child that it is hard to kill and lives on very short rations the little boy ties a string around a stone and drags it through dust and mire with happy conviction that it is a gocart the little girl wraps up a stocking or a towel with tender hands winds her shawl about it and at once the godgiven maternal instinct leaps into life in an instant she has it in her arms she kisses its cotton head and sings it to sleep in divine unconsciousness of any incompleteness for love supplies many deficiencies so let us cherish the child heart in ourselves and never look with scorn upon the rude suggestions of the forms the child has built but rather enter into the play enriching it with our own imaginative power the children will rarely perceive any incongruities and surely we need not hint them any more than we would remind a child needlessly that her doll is stuffed with sawdust and has a plaster head when she thinks it a responsive and affectionate little daughter middendorf said this is like a fresh bath for the human soul when we dare to be children again with children the burdens of life could not be borne were it not for real gayety of heart if we want to educate children we must be children with them ourselves martin luther if it were only the play and the mere outward apparatus says the baroness von marenholtzbьlow we might indeed find our daily teaching monotonous but the idea at the foundation of it and the contemplation of the being of man and its development in the child is an inexhaustible mine of interesting discovery reasons for choice of third gift this third gift satisfies the childs craving to take things to pieces froebel did not choose it arbitrarily for nature human and physical was an open handbook to him and if we study deeply and sympathetically the reasons for his choice they will always be comprehended fйnelon says the curiosity of children is a natural tendency which goes in the van of instruction destruction after all is only constructive faculty turned back upon itself the child having no legitimate outlet for his creative instinct pulls his playthings to pieces to see what is inside what they are made of and how they are put together but to his chagrin he finds it not so easy to reunite the tattered fragments what must we furnish to the child after the selfcontained ball after the hard sphere every part of which is similar and after the single solid cube it must be something firm which can be easily pulled apart by the childs strength and just as easily put together again therefore it must also be something which is simple yet multiform and what should this be after what we have perceived up to this point and in view of what the surrounding world affords us but the cube divided through the centre by three planes perpendicular to one another froebels pedagogics unmaking is as important as making to the child his destructive energy is as essential to him as his power of construction w t harris the child wishes to discover the inside of the thing being urged to this by an impulse he has not given to himself the impulse which rightly recognized and rightly guided seeks to know god in all his works where can the child seek for satisfaction of his impulse to research but from the thing itself friedrich froebel education of man in the divided cube however he can gratify his desires and at the same time possess the joy of doing right and destroying nothing for the eight little blocks can be quickly united into their original form and also into many other pleasing little forms each one complete in itself so that every analysis ends as it should in synthesis froebel calls this gift specifically the childrens delight and indeed it is responding so generously to their spontaneous activity while at the same time it suits their small capabilities for the possibilities of an object used for form study should not be too varied it must be suggestive through its limitations says miss blow for the young mind may be as easily crushed by excess as by defect an element which slumbers like a viper under roses is that which is now so frequently provided as a plaything for children it is in a word the already too complex and ornate too finished toy the child can begin no new thing with it cannot produce enough variety by means of it his power of creative imagination his power of giving outward form to his own idea are thus actually deadened froebels pedagogics froebel was left motherless at a very early age and during his first four years of life his father was entirely engrossed with parish duties and the child had only occasional supervision from a hardworked servant thus it happened that he was frequently alone long hours at a time in a dusky room overshadowed by the neighboring church and naturally strayed often to the window from whence he might look down upon the busy world outside he recalls that he was greatly interested at one time in some workmen who were repairing the church and that he constantly turned from his post of observation to try and imitate their labors but his only building material was the furniture of the room and chairs and tables clumsily resisted his efforts to pile them up into suitable form he tells us that this strong desire for building and the bitter disappointment of his repeated failures were still keenly remembered when he was a grown man and thus suggested to him that children ought to be provided with materials for building among their playthings he often noticed also in later years that all children seem to have the building instinct corresponding to what dr seguin calls the building mania in the infancy of peoples and that to make a house is the universal form of unguided play one of the greatest and most universal delights of children is to construct for themselves a habitation of some sort either in the garden or indoors where chairs have generally to serve their purpose instinct leads them as it does all animals to procure shelter and protection for their persons individual outward selfexistence and independence bertha von marenholtzbьlow child and child nature we now understand the meaning of the gift the reason for its importance in froebels plan and its capabilities as a vehicle for delightful instruction classes of forms there are three different classes of forms for dictation and invention variously named by kindergartners life forms or upright forms which are seen in the childs daily life as a pair of boots a chair table bed or sofa froebel calls them also object forms or forms of things the child demands that the object constructed stand in connection with himself his life or somebody or something in his life froebel mathematical forms or various combinations of the blocks upright and supine for mathematical exercises they correspond to the forms of knowledge in logic also called by froebel forms of truth forms of instruction forms of learning symmetrical forms or flat designs formed by opposites and their intermediates these are figures in which four of the blocks generally revolve in order around the other four as a centre also called by froebel picture forms flower forms star forms dance forms life forms life forms should be given first as the natural tendency of the young child is to pile things up and these forms seem simpler for dictation are more readily grasped by the mind and more fascinating to the imagination they are the images of things both dear and familiar to him and thus are particularly adapted to the beginning since the starting point of the childs development is the heart and the emotions it is easier for him to be an architect at first than an artist though each will be comprehended in the other after a time the building or piling up is with the child as with the development of the human race and as with the fixed forms in nature the first froebels education of man towers pyramids up up connecting themselves with something high voicing aspiration the representation of facts and circumstances of history of geography and especially of everyday life by means of building i hold to be in the highest degree important for children even if these representations are imperfect and fall far short of their originals the eye is at all events aroused and stimulated to observe with greater precision than before the object that has been represented and thus by means of perhaps a quite imperfect outward representation the inner perception is made more perfect froebels letters tr by michaelis and moore page the dictations should be given very simply clearly and slowly always using one set of terms to express a certain meaning and having those absolutely correct we should never give dictations from a book but from memory having prepared the lesson beforehand and should remember that every exercise we give should incite and develop selfactivity we must guard against mistakes or confusion in our own minds it is very easy to confuse the child and he will become inattentive and careless if he is unable to catch our meaning brief stories should occasionally be told just mere outlines to give color and force to the childs building and connect it with his experience if it is an armchair grandmother may sit in it knitting the babys stocking if it is a well describe the digging of it the lining with stones or brick the inflowing of the water the letting down of the bucket and long chain the clear cool water coming up from the deep dark hole in the ground on a hot summers day these of course are but the merest suggestions which experience may be trusted to develop it is better perhaps to give a bit of wordpainting to each object constructed than to wait till the end of the series for the day and tell a longer story as the interest is thus more easily sustained the children too should be encouraged to talk about the forms and tell little stories concerning them the form created should never be destroyed but transformed into the next in order by a few simple movements symmetrical forms these forms in spite of their regularity are called forms of beauty the mathematical forms which froebel designates forms of knowledge give only the skeleton from which the beautiful form develops itself symmetry of the parts which make up these simple figures gives the impression of beauty to the childish eye he must have the elements of the beautiful before he is in a condition to comprehend it in its whole extent only what is simple gives light to the child at first he can only operate with a small number of materials therefore froebel gives only eight cubes for this object at this time of course these three classes of forms are not to be kept arbitrarily separate and the children finish and lay aside one set before attempting another there are many cases where the three may be united as indeed they are morally speaking in the life of every human being when the distinctions are clear in our own minds our knowledge and tact will guide us to introduce the gift properly and carry it on in a natural orderly and rational manner not restricting the childs own productive powers if the children have had time to imbibe a love of symmetry and beauty and have been trained to observe and delight in them then this second class of forms will attract them as much after a little as the first though more difficult of execution each sequence starts from a definite point the four outside blocks revolving round the central four and going through or dancing through as froebel says all the successive figures before returning in the opposite direction all the dictations are most valuable intellectually but should not be longcontinued at one time as they require great concentration of mind and are consequently wearisome hints from ronges guide excellent exercises or suggestions for building can be found in ronges kindergarten guide he mentions one pleasant little play which i will quote when each in the class has produced a different form let the children rise and march round the table to observe the variety let them sing in the ascending and descending scales many pretty forms i see which one seems the best to me at another time let each child try to build the house he lives in and while this is being done let them join in singing some song about home it is well to encourage singing during the building exercises as we have so many appropriate selections see kindergarten chimes kate d wiggin oliver ditson publishing co building song pages trade game page the carpenter page group work with the first of the building gifts enters a new variety of group work which was not adapted for the first and second gifts the children may now be seated at square tables one at each side and build in unison in the centre the form produced being of course four times as large and fine as any one of the number could have produced alone all the suggestions or directions for building are necessarily carried out together and the success of the completed form is obviously dependent on the coцperation of all four children forms of beauty are very easily constructed in this manner as well as forms of life having four uniform sides and when the little ones are somewhat more expert builders life forms having opposite sides alike or even four different sides may be constructed the other various forms of coцperative work are of course never to be neglected that a social unity may be produced in which the might of each individual may be reinforced by the might of the whole mathematical forms a better idea of these may be obtained through a manipulation of the blocks and an arrangement of the geometrical forms in their regular order the child if he were taught as froebel intended would make his first acquaintance with numbers in the nursery beginning in a very small way and progressing slowly the pupils of the kindergarten are a little older and having already a slight knowledge of numbers though not of course in their abstract relations are able to accomplish greater things the child can with our guidance make all possible combinations of the parts of the number eight the principles of addition subtraction even multiplication and fractions can also be mastered without one tear of misery or pang of torture he grasps the whole first then by simple processes building with his own hands he finds out and demonstrates for himself halves fourths and eighths sometimes in different positions but always having the same contents method and manner of using the gift even yet we must not suffer this to become work the exercises should be repeated again and again but we must learn to break off when the play is still delightful and study ways to endow the next one with new life and charm though it carry with it the same old facts what we want to secure is not a formidable number of parrotlike statements but a firm foundation for future clearness of understanding depth of feeling and firmness of purpose so at the beginning of the exercise we should not ask john if he remembers what we talked about last time and expect him to answer clearly at once because he does not answer our formal questions which do not properly belong to babyhood we need not conclude he has learned nothing for a child can show to our dull eyes only a very tiny glimpse of his wonderful inner world let our aim be that the child shall little by little receive impressions so clearly that he will recognize them when they appear again and that he shall after a time know these impressions by their names it is nothing but play after all but it is in this childish play that deep meaning lies a child is far less interested in that which is given him complete than in that which needs something from him to make it perfect he loves to employ all his energies in conceiving and constructing forms the less you do for him the better he enjoys it if he has been trained to independence probably the chief wish of children is to do things for themselves instead of to have things done for them they would gladly live in a paradise of the homemade for example when we read how the prentices of london used to skate on sharp bones of animals which they bound about their feet we also wished at least to try that plan rather than to wear skates bought in shops andrew lang complete toys hinder the activity of children encourage laziness and thoughtlessness and do them more harm than can be told the active tendency in them turns to the distortion of what is complete and so becomes destructive any fusing together of lessons work and play is possible only when the objects with which the child plays allow room for independent mental and bodily activity i e when they are not themselves complete in the childs hand had man found everything in the world fixed and prepared for use had all means of culture of satisfaction for the spiritual and material wants of his nature been ready to his hand there would have been no development no civilization of the human race pedantry and dogmatism must be eliminated from all the dictations the life must not be shut out of the lessons in order that we may hear a pin drop nor should they be allowed to degenerate into a tedious formalism and mechanical puppetshow in which we pull the strings and the poor little dummies move with one accord yet most emphatically a certain order and harmony must prevail the forms must follow each other in natural sequence the blocks must invariably be taken carefully from the box so as to present a whole at the first glance and at the close of the lesson should always be neatly put together again into the original form and returned to the box as a whole in order to furnish to the child at once clearly and definitely the impression of the whole of the selfcontained the plaything before it is given to the child for his own free use must be opened as follows it will thus appear before the observing child as a cube closely united yet easily separated and again restored froebels pedagogics pages and now one last word of warning about doing too much for the children in these exercises and even guiding too much carrying system and method too far in dictation we must remember that an excess of systematizing crushes instead of developing originality and that it is all too easy even in the kindergarten to turn children into machines incapable of acting when the guiding hand is removed note in opening the boxes it is well to observe some simple form it is not irksome but on the contrary rather pleasing to the children who delight in doing things in concert boxes in centre of table draw the cover out one half space fingers of right hand placed on lefthand side of box turn

kindergarten h goldammer froebels fourth gift a new gift is demanded a gift wherein the length breadth and thickness of a solid body shall be distinguished from each other by difference of size such a gift will open the childs eyes to the three dimensions of space and will serve also as a means of recognizing and interpreting the manifold forms and structures with which he is constantly brought in contact the inner difference intimated in the three perpendicular axes of the cube and the sphere now becomes externally visible and abiding in each of its building blocks as a difference of size fr froebel the fourth gift incites the child to consider things in their relations to space and to the forces of nature and in his play with the bricks he is constantly engaged in efforts to adapt himself to the laws of their nature while rendering them subservient to his ends w n hailmann the fourth gift consists of a cube measuring two inches in each of its dimensions it is divided once vertically in its height and three times horizontally in its thickness giving eight parallelopipeds or bricks each two inches long one inch wide and one half inch thick like the third gift in form size material and use it is unlike it in division in the third gift the parts were like each other and like the whole in the fourth they are like each other but unlike the whole the most important characteristics of the gift are a approximation to surface in the symmetrical forms b greater height and greater extension resulting in a greater possible inclosure of space c the illustration of two philosophical laws viz the law of equilibrium or balance and the law of transmitted motion or propagation of force progress is shown in this gift as follows a in the difficulty of dictation and manipulation arising from the different character of the faces of the bricks and the many positions which each brick can assume b in the necessity of perfect balance c in a clearer illustration of dimension in the third gift the parts were equal in height breadth and thickness in the fourth they are unequal and therefore each dimension is emphasized as to progression the increase of difficulty suits the increase in the childs power of comprehension and receptivity he is being developed thus far not by rapid changes in material or greater exercise in number but by practice with differing forms each one bringing with it new knowledge and experience the organs of perception are being constantly made to grow by exercise with intention we are forming the scientific eye which can detect differences ever after at a glance the geometrical forms illustrated in this gift are solids rectangular parallelopipeds square prisms planes oblongs squares the fourth gift presents contrasts of dimension and as to the area of its faces contrasts of size and their mediation what the child has gained from third gift the use of the third gift opened to the child quite a new world of experiences each one of which was pleasant and instructive combining all the delights of mental and physical activity imagination practical industry and coцperation he has gained an idea distinct in proportion to the skill with which it has been placed before him of the cube as a solid body having surfaces corners and edges of a whole and its equal fractional parts of the power of combining those parts into new wholes and of the fact that form and size are two separate and distinct characteristics of objects he has also gained new dexterity his ten little fingers that seemed all thumbs as they arranged so carefully the clumsy little cubes of the low wall can now build the bunker hill monument with unerring skill and can even with the grave concentration that it demands drop the last difficult little block cornerwise into the top of the church window a child trained for one year in a kindergarten would acquire a skillful use of his hands and a habit of accurate measurement of the eye which would be his possession through life w t harris the child has counted his cubes from one to eight until he knows them like the children of a family and can divide them into sets of two and four with equal ease these are the deeds as to the new words the little box of blocks has brought him their number is legion comprising many terms of direction and position names of tools and implements buildings and places truly if the kindergartner has been wise and faithful the child has gained wonders from this simple unassuming toy one which is almost too plain and rude to fix the momentary attention of a modern spoiled child though even he will grow to appreciate its treasures if rightly guided differences between third and fourth gifts and now we approach another cubical box containing the fourth gift and on opening it see that it presents resemblances between and differences when compared with that just left behind we notice at once the new method of division and in separating it find that the parts evidently in number the same as before are entirely novel in form though the whole was familiar in its aspect if the child is old enough to understand the process of comparison he will see that the parts of the two gifts have each six surfaces eight corners and twelve edges but that while edges and corners are alike the faces differ greatly on the new block which he will probably call the brick as it is a familiar form and name to him this process of comparison will be greatly facilitated if he models the two cubes in clay and divides them with string or wire the one into inch cubes the other into bricks dr seguins objections to the cube as the primary figure in the kindergarten dr e seguin in his celebrated report on education says in regard to the use of the cube as the primary block or figure in the kindergarten had the kindergartners chosen it with their senses as it must speak to the senses of the child instead of with their mind they would certainly never have selected the cube a form in which similarity is everywhere difference nowhere a barren type incapable by itself of instigating the child to active comparison had they on the contrary from infantile reminiscences or from more philosophical indications selected a block of brickform the child would soon have discovered and made use of the similarity of the straight lines and of the difference of the three dimensions for example put a cube on your desk and let a pupil put one on his you change the position of yours he accordingly of his if you renew these moves till both of you are tired they will not make any perceptible change in the aspect of the object the movement has been barren of any modification perceptible to the senses and appreciable to the mind there has been no lesson unless you have by words speaking to the mind succeeded in making the child comprehend the idea of a cube derived from its intrinsic properties a body with six equal sides and eight equal angles answers to these objections with all deference to dr seguin whose opinions and deductions are generally indisputable we cannot regard as unwise the choice of the cube as the primary figure in the gifts in the first place froebel having a sequence of forms in his mind undoubtedly wished to introduce early in that sequence the one which would best serve him as a foundation for further division and subdivision this need is beyond question better met in the cube than in the brick which would lend itself awkwardly to regular division secondly although there is in the cube similarity everywhere difference nowhere and therefore it might be called in truth a barren type incapable by itself of instigating the child to comparison and action we do not introduce it by itself but in contrast with the sphere and cylinder then when it appears again in the building gifts as the simplest and most easily handled form element the kindergartner has every opportunity to use it so that it may lead the child to comparison and action and to develop the slowly dawning sense of difference and agreement without which she well knows knowledge has not yet made the first step but if the cube is a form speaking little to the senses of a child and requiring description by words spoken to the mind it is evident that we should use great care in dealing with the second gift lest we run needlessly into abstractions and strive to give the child ideas of which he can have no comprehension value of the brick form the brick is a form rich in impressions for we find that every position in which it is placed gives the child a new perception and the union of these perceptions furnishes him with a complete idea of the object and of its possible uses in relation to its form dr seguin does not rate it too highly when he says what a spring of effective movements of perceptions and of ideas in the exercises with this form where analogy and difference incessantly noted by the touch and the view challenge the mind to comparison and judgment dimension the fourth gift contains all that the three former gifts showed and introduces differences of dimension and equilibrium only hinted at before it also as froebel says throws into relief the perception of size by showing similarity of size with dissimilarity of dimension and position as to dimension the child built the shottower with the third gift and knew that it was high the platform and that it was broad the well and that it was deep the wall and saw that it was thick etc so that he has a conception of height length breadth but in the fourth gift he is shown these dimensions in a single block he is thus led from the known to the unknown they are united and contrasted in one object and therefore emphasized the three principal dimensions of space which in the cube only make themselves known as differences of position in the fourth gift become more prominent and manifest themselves as differences of size these three relations of size are in the fourth gift as abiding and changeless as the position of the three principal directions was before and still is froebels pedagogics page equilibrium as to the law of equilibrium it is very forcibly brought to the childs attention every time his forms fall to the table when constructed without due regard to its principles he soon sees its practical significance takes care to follow its manifest expression and to observe with more care the centre of gravity great liberties could be taken with the stolid little cubes and they seldom showed any resentment they quietly settled down into their places and resisted sturdily all the earthquake shocks which are apt to visit a kindergarten table during the building hour the bricks on the other hand have to be humored and treated with deference the moment one is placed upon another end to end the struggle begins and in any of the high life forms the utmost delicacy of touch is necessary as well as sure aim and steady hand here comes in too a necessity of calculation not before required the cubes could be placed on any side and always occupy the same space but the building with the bricks will vary according as they are placed on the broad the narrow or the short face they must also fit together and bear a certain relation to each other in the dictations it will be perceived that we now have to specify the position which the brick must take as well as the place which it is to occupy we designate the three faces of the brick as the broad face the narrow face and the short face or end fourth gift building the symmetrical forms are much more interesting than before and decidedly more artistic when viewed in comparison with the somewhat thick and clumsy designs made with the cubes the fourth gift forms cover more space approach nearer the surface and the bricks slide gracefully from one position to another and slip in and out of the different figures with a movement which seems like a swans compared with the goosestep of the stubby little cubes it is a noteworthy fact that the buds as froebel calls them of all the fourth gift beauty forms were contained in those of the third gift and have here opened into fuller bloom the life forms are much more artistic now and begin to imitate a little more nearly the objects they are intended to represent we can make more extensive buildings also since we have an additional height or length of eight inches over that of the third gift and thus can cover double the amount of surface and inclose a much greater space in the first play with the gift the childrens eyes so keen in seeing play possibilities quickly discover the value of the bricks in furnituremaking and set to work at once on tables and chairs or bureaus and sofas and bedsteads they engage too in a lively contest with the law of equilibrium and experiment long and patiently until they comprehend its practical workings when they understand the fourth gift fairly well know the different faces and can handle the bricks with some dexterity the third gift should be added and the two used together they complement each other admirably and give variety and strength to the building whether forms of life beauty or knowledge are constructed froebel however is most emphatic in directing that each set of blocks should be given to the child in its own box opened so as to present a whole at the first glance and carefully rebuilt and packed away when the play is over the cubes and bricks should never be left jumbled together at the close of the exercise nor should they be kept in and returned to a common receptacle unimportant as these little rules may appear he says they are essential to the clear and definite development of the child to his orderly apprehension of external objects and to the logical unfolding of his own concepts and judgments the box of building blocks should be regarded by the child he concludes as a worthy an appreciated and a loved comrade the mathematical forms are constructed and applied in precisely the same manner as before the fourth gift however offers a far greater number of these than its predecessor while it is particularly adapted to show that objects identical in form and size may be produced in quite different ways throughout all these guided plays it should be remembered that time is always to be allowed the child for free invention that the kindergartner should talk to him about what he has produced so that his thought may be discovered to himself and that in all possible ways group work should be encouraged in order that his own strength and attainments may be multiplied by that of his playfellows and swell the common stock of power froebel the great advocate of the together principle says isolation and exclusion destroy life union and participation create life the child is allowed the greatest possible freedom of invention the experience of the adult only accompanies and explains froebels pedagogics page pedagogics page it is perhaps needless to say that the philosophical laws which govern the outward manifestations of a moving force as equilibrium or selfpropagating activity are for personal study and are never to be spoken of abstractly to the child but merely to be illustrated with simple explanations transmitted motion to show simply the law of transmitted motion for instance let the child place his eight bricks on end in a row one half inch apart with their broad faces toward each other then ask him to give the one at the right a very gentle push towards the others and see what will happen the result is probably as great a delight as you could reasonably wish to put within his reach when he asks what makes them do so as every thoughtful child is apt to do let us ask the class the same question and set them thinking about it which brick did it we may say familiarly and they will see it all in a moment where the force originated how it gave itself to the next brick in order that one in turn doing the same and so on this law of transmitted motion when so simply illustrated in the fourth gift easily suggests to the children the force of example and indeed every physical law seems to have its correlate in the moral world we may make the children see it very clearly through the seven poor weak little bricks that fell down because they were touched by the first one they really could not help it now how about seven little boys or girls they can help doing things can they not by such simple exercises and appropriate comments the children may be made to realize their moral free agency readings for the student kindergarten at home emily shirreff pages kindergarten culture w n hailmann koehlers kindergarten practice tr by mary gurney

kindergarten toys h hoffmann froebels fifth gift the material for making forms increases by degrees progressing according to law as nature prescribes the simple wild rose existed before the double one was formed by careful culture children are too often overwhelmed with quantity and variety of material that makes formation impossible to them the demand of the new gift therefore is that the oblique line hitherto only transiently indicated shall become an abiding feature of its material in the forms made with the fifth gift there rules a living spirit of unity even members and directions which are apparently isolated are discovered to be related by significant connecting members and links and the whole shows itself in all its parts as one and living therefore also as a liferousing lifenurturing and lifedeveloping totality fr froebel the fifth gift is a threeinch cube which being divided equally twice in each dimension produces twentyseven oneinch cubes three of these are divided into halves by one diagonal cut and three others into quarters by two diagonal cuts crossing each other making in all thirtynine pieces twentyone of which are whole cubes the same size as those of the third gift the fifth gift seems to be an extension of the third from which it differs in the following points the third gift is a twoinch cube the fifth a threeinch cube the third is divided once in each dimension the fifth twice in the third all the parts are like each other and like the whole in the fourth they are like each other but unlike the whole and in the fifth they are not only for the most part unlike each other but eighteen of them are unlike the whole the third gift emphasized vertical and horizontal divisions producing entirely rectangular solids the fifth by introduction of the slanting line and triangular prism extends the element of form in the third gift the slanting direction was merely implied in a transitory way by the position of the blocks in the fifth it is definitely realized by their diagonal division in number the third gift emphasized two and multiples of two the fifth is related to the fourth in its advance in complexity of form and mathematical relations the most important characteristics of the gift are introduction of diagonal line and triangular form division into thirds ninths and twentysevenths illustration of the inclined plane and cuberoot as a result of these combined characteristics it is specially adapted to the production of symmetrical forms it includes not only multiplicity but for the first time diversity of material the fifth gift realizes a higher unity through a greater variety than has been illustrated previously it corresponds with the childs increasing power of analysis it offers increased complexity to satisfy his growing powers of creation and less definitely suggestive material in order to keep pace with his developing individuality the geometrical forms illustrated in this gift are cube rectangular parallelopiped square prism triangular prism solids rhomboidal prism trapezoidal prism pentagonal prism hexagonal prism heptagonal prism octagonal prism square oblong right isosceles triangle rhomboid planes trapezium trapezoid pentagon hexagon heptagon octagon the fifth gift shows the following contrasts and mediations the diagonal line a connection between the horizontal and vertical the right angle as a connection between the obtuse angle largest and the acute angle smallest in size of parts the half cube standing between the whole and quarter cubes we have thus far been proceeding from unity to variety from the whole to its parts from the simple to the complex from easily constructed forms to those more difficult of manipulation and dictation until we have arrived at the fifth gift effect of the study of froebels gifts on the kindergartner how instructive and delightful have we found this orderly procedure this development of great from little things this thoughtful association of new and practical ideas with all that is familiar to the child mind and heart every year the training teacher feels it anew herself and is sure of the growing interest and sympathy of her pupils many persons who fail to grasp the true meaning of the kindergarten seem to consider the balls and blocks and sticks with which we work most insignificant little objects but we think on the other hand that nothing in the universe is small or insignificant if viewed in its right connection and undertaken with earnestness and enthusiasm nothing in childhood is too slight for the notice too trivial for the sympathy of those on whom the father of all has bestowed the holy dignity of motherhood or teacherhood and to the kindergartner belongs the added dignity of approaching nearer the former than the latter for hers indeed is a sort of vicemotherhood we must always be impressed with the knowledge which we ourselves gain in studying these gifts and preparing the exercises with them in concentration of thought careful distinct precise and expressive language logical arrangement of ideas new love of order beauty symmetry fitness and proportion added ingenuity in adapting material to various uses жsthetic and practical in all these ways every practical student of froebel must constantly feel a decided advance in ability then too the simple rudiments of geometry have been reviewed in a new light we have dealt with solid bodies and planes and studied them critically so that we might draw the childs attention to all points of resemblance or difference we have found some beautifully simple illustrations of familiar philosophical truths and best of all have simplified and crystallized our knowledge of the relations of numbers so that the childs impressions of them may be easily and clearly gained why we are required to study deeply and to know more than we teach we have been required to look at each gift in its broadest aspect and to observe it patiently and minutely in all its possibilities for the larger the amount of knowledge the kindergartner possesses the more free from error will be her practice unless we know more than we expect to teach we shall find that our lessons will be stiff formal affairs lacking variety elasticity and freshness and marred continually by lack of illustration and spontaneity lack of interest in the teacher is as fatal as lack of interest in the child in fact the one follows directly upon the heels of the other for this reason continued study is vitally necessary that new phases of truth may continually be seen above all other people the teacher should go through life with eyes and ears open unless she is constantly accumulating new information her mind will not only become like a stagnant pool but she will find out that what she possesses is gradually evaporating there is no state of equilibrium here she who does not progress retrogresses it should be a comparatively simple matter to gain enough knowledge for teaching the difficult thing is the art of imparting it said lord bacon the art of well delivering the knowledge we possess to others is among the secrets left to be discovered by future generations relation between gifts and their relation to the childs mental and moral growth these are a few of the technicalities which have been mastered up to this time by a faithful study of the gifts of froebel and yet they are only technicalities and do not include the half of what has been gained in ways more difficult to describe to clearly comprehend the gifts either individually or collectively we must clearly conceive their relation to and dependence on each other for it is only in this intimate connection that they gain importance or value if the kindergartner does not recognize the relationship which exists between them and their relation to the childs mental and moral growth she uses them with no power or intelligence we conceive nothing truly so long as we conceive it by itself the individual example must be referred to the universal law before we can rightly apprehend its significance and for a clear insight into anything whatsoever we must view it in relation to the class to which it belongs we can never really know the part unless we know the whole neither can we know the whole unless we know the part pleasure of child at new gift in the fifth gift which it may be said can commonly only be used with profit after the child has neared or attained his fifth year we find that we have not parted from our good old friend the cube that has taught us so many valuable lessons we always find contained in each gift a reminder of the previous one together with new elements which may have been implied before but not realized so therefore we have again the cube but greatly enlarged divided and diversified when the child sees for the first time even the larger box containing his new plaything he feels joyful anticipation surmising that as he has grown more careful and capable he has been entrusted with something of considerable importance if he has been allowed to use the third and fourth gifts together frequently he will not be embarrassed by the amount of material in the new object lest he be overwhelmed however by its variety as much as by its quantity it might be well before presenting the new material as a whole to allow the child to play with a third gift in which one cube cut in halves and one in quarters have been substituted for two whole cubes he will joyfully discover the new forms study them carefully and find out their distinctive peculiarities and their value in building when he has used them successfully once or twice and has learned how to place the triangular prisms to form the cube then the mass of new material as a whole can have no terrors for him how great is his pleasure when he withdraws the cover and finds indeed something full of immense possibilities he feels too a command of his faculties which leads him to regard the new materials not with doubt or misgiving but with a conscious power of comprehension its new features at the first glance the most striking characteristics are its greater size and greater number of divisions into thirds ninths and twentysevenths instead of halves quarters and eighths these divisions open a new field in number lessons while the introduction of the slanting line and triangular prism makes a decided advance in form and architectural possibilities importance of triangular form the triangle by the way is a valuable addition in building exercises for as a fundamental form in architecture it occurs very frequently in the formation of all familiar objects indeed the new form and its various uses in building constitute the most striking and valuable feature of the gift we find it an interesting fact that all the grand divisions of the earths surface have a triangular form and that the larger islands assume this shape more or less the operation of dividing the earths surface into greater and lesser triangles is used in making a trigonometrical survey and in ascertaining the length of a degree of latitude or longitude the triangle is also of great use in the various departments of mechanical work as will be noted hereafter in connection with the seventh gift difficulties of the fifth gift the difficulties of the fifth gift are only apparent for the welltrained child of the kindergarten sees more than any other and he will grasp the small complexities with wonderful ease smoothing out a path for himself while we are wondering how we shall make it plain to him effect of good training but here let us note that we can only succeed in attaining satisfactory results in kindergarten work by beginning intelligently and never discontinuing our patient watchfulness selfcommand and firmness of purpose firmness remember not stubbornness for it is a rare gift to be able to yield rightly and at the proper time if we help the little one too much in his first simple lessons or dictations if we supply the word he ought to give if to save time and produce a symmetrical effect we move a block here and there in weariness at some childs apparent stupidity we shall never fail to reap the natural results the effect of a rational conscientious and consistent behavior to the child in all our dealings with him is very great and every little slip from the loving yet firm and straightforward course brings its immediate fruit the perfectly developed child welcomes each new difficulty and invites it the imperfectly trained pupil shrinks in halfterror and helplessness feeling no hope of becoming master of these strange new impressions arrangement of pieces to return to the specific consideration of the gift there must be a plan of arranging the various pieces which go to make up the whole cube we have now for the first time the slanting line the mediation of the two opposites vertical and horizontal and by this three of the small cubes are divided into halves and three into quarters it is advisable when building the cube to place nine whole cubes in each of the two lower layers keeping all the divided cubes in the upper or third layer halves in the middle row quarters at the back then we may slide the box gently over the cube as in the third and fourth gifts which enables us to have the blocks separated properly when taken out again and forms the only expedient way of handling the pieces this procedure is by no means intended merely to make the withdrawal of the box easy for the child but on the contrary brings to him much inner profit it is well for him to receive his playthings in an orderly manner not to have them tossed to him as fodder is tossed to animals it is good for the child to begin his play with the perception of a whole a simple selfcontained unit and from this unity to develop his representations finally it is essential that the playing child should receive his material so arranged that its various elements are discernible and that by seeing them his mind may unconsciously form plans for using them receiving his material thus arranged the child will use it with everrecurrent and increasing satisfaction and his play will produce far more abiding results than the play of one whose material lies before him like a heap of cobblestones froebels pedagogics page the exercises with this gift are like those which have preceded it exercises of the gift informal questions by the kindergartner and answers by the children on its introduction that it may be well understood this should be made entirely conversational familiar and playful but a logical plan of development should be kept in mind a consideration of the various pieces of the gift may occupy a part of each building or number lesson dictation building by suggestion and cooperative plays in the various forms with all except advanced children the life forms are most useful and desirable the child in a word follows the same path as the man and advances from use to beauty and from beauty to truth froebels pedagogics page free invention with each lesson number and form lessons in number there will of course be some repetition of what has been done before but a sufficient amount of new presentation to awaken interest it is only by constant review and repetition that we can assist children to remember these things and to receive them among their natural experiences and fortunately the habit of repetition in childhood is a natural one and therefore seldom irksome errors in form teaching as to the form lessons we must remember that our method has nothing to do with scientific geometry but is based entirely on inspection and practice it lays the foundation of instruction in drawing and forms an admirable preparation for different trades as carpentry cabinetmaking masonry locksmithing patternmaking etc even in the primary schools and how much more in the kindergarten the form or geometrical work should be essentially practical and given by inspection even there all scientific demonstration should be prohibited and the teacher should be sparing in definitions it is enough if the children recognize the forms by their special characteristics and by perceiving their relations and can reproduce the solids in modeling and the planes and outlines in tablets sticks rings slats drawing and sewing the conference recommends that the childs geometrical education should begin as early as possible in the kindergarten if he attends a kindergarten or if not in the primary school he should at first gain familiarity through the senses with simple geometrical figures and forms plane and solid should handle draw measure and model them and should gradually learn some of their simpler properties and relations report of committee of ten page life forms we can now be quite methodical and workmanlike in our building and can learn to use all the parts economically and according to principle we can discuss ground plans cellars foundations basements roofs eaves chimneys entrances and windows and thus can make almost habitable dwellings and miniature models of larger objects the childs life moves from the house and its livingrooms through kitchen and cellar through yard and garden to the wider space and activity of street and market and this expansion of life is clearly reflected in the order and development of his productions froebels pedagogics page the child is a real carpenter now and innocently happy in his labor who can doubt that in these cheerful daily avocations he becomes in love with industry and perseverance and as character is nothing but crystallized habit he gets a decided bias in these directions which affects him for many a year afterward in some german kindergartens large buildinglogs are supplied in one corner of the play garden these logs are a foot or more in length three inches wide and one inch thick several hundred of these are kept neatly piled against the fence and the children are expected to leave them in good order this bit of voluntary discipline has its good uses on the playground and the free building allowed with this larger material gives rise to individual effort and tests the power of the children in a way which makes the later more organized work at the tables far more full of meaning kindergarten magazine november objects which he meets in his daily walks are to be constructed and also objects with which he is not so familiar so that by pleasant conversation the realm of his knowledge may be extended and the sphere of his affections and fancies enlarged for these exercises when properly conducted address equally head heart and hand as these building gifts afford a means of clearing the perceptions of the child they give occasion for extending these perceptions and for representing in their essential parts objects of which the child has only heard froebels pedagogics page froebel says of all this building it is essential to proceed from the cube as a whole in this way the conception of the whole of uniting stamps itself upon the childs mind and the evolution of the particular partial and manifold from unity is illustrated group work our opportunities for group work or united building are greatly extended and none of them should be neglected as it is essential to inculcate thus early the value of coцperation we have material enough to call into being many different things on the childrens tables the house where they live the church they see on sunday the factory where their fathers or brothers work the schoolhouse the city hall the public fountain the stable and the shops thus we may create an entire village with united effort and systematic harmonious action each object may be brought into intimate relation with the others by telling a story in which every form is introduced this always increases the interest of the class and the story itself seems to be more distinctly remembered by the child when brought into connection with what he has himself constructed the third gift may be used with the fifth if we wish to increase the number of blocks for coцperative work and is particularly adapted to the laying of foundations for large buildings in the sandtable a large fifth gift constructed on the scale of a foot instead of an inch is very useful for united building one child or the kindergartner may be the architect of the monument or other large form which is to be erected in the centre of the circle the various children then bring the whole cubes the halves and quarters and lay them in their appropriate places and the erection when complete is the work of every member of the community symmetrical forms these are in number and variety almost endless as we have thirtynine pieces of different characters edward wiebe says he who is not a stranger in mathematics knows that the number of combinations and permutations of thirtynine different bodies cannot be counted by hundreds nor expressed by thousands but that millions hardly suffice to exhaust all possible combinations these forms naturally separate themselves froebel says into two distinct series i e the series of squares and the series of triangles and move from these to the circle as the conclusion of the whole series of representations from these forms approximating to the circle there is an easy transition to the representation of the different kinds of cogwheels and hence to a crude preliminary idea of mechanics if the movements begin with the exterior part of the figure instead of the interior we should make all the changes we wish in that direction before touching the centre and vice versa each definite beginning conditions a certain process of its own and however much liberty in regard to changes may be allowed they are always to be introduced within certain limits we should leave ample room for the childs own powers of creation but never disregard froebels principle of connection of opposites this alone will furnish him with the inward guide which he needs it is only by becoming accustomed to a logical mode of action that the child can use this amount of material to good advantage with these forms of beauty it is above all important that they be developed one from another each form in the series should be a modification or transformation of its predecessor no form should be entirely destroyed it is also essential that the series should be developed so that each step should show either an evolution into greater manifoldness and variety or a return to greater simplicity froebels pedagogics page this free activity is only possible when the law of free creativeness is known and applied for that a free creativeness only can be a lawful one we are taught by the smallest blade of grass whose development takes place only according to immutable laws reminiscences of froebel page dangers of dictation the dictations should be made with great care and simplicity the childs mind must never be forced if it shows weariness nor the more difficult lessons given in too noisy a room as the nervous strain is very great under such circumstances we should remember that great concentration is needed for a young child to follow these dictations and we must be exceedingly careful in enforcing that strict attention for too long a time a wellknown specialist says that such exercises should not be allowed at first to take up more than a minute or two at a time then that their duration should gradually extend to five and ten minutes the length of time which children closely and voluntarily attend to an exercise is as follows children from five to seven years about fifteen minutes from seven to ten years twenty minutes from twelve to eighteen years thirty minutes a magnetic teacher can obtain attention somewhat longer but it will always be at the expense of the succeeding lesson by teachers of high pretensions lessons are often carried on greatly and grievously in excess of the proper limits but when the results are examined they show that after a certain time has been exceeded everything forced upon the brain only tends to drive out or to confuse what has been previously stored in it we find of course that the mind can sustain more labor for a longer time when all the faculties are employed than when a single faculty is exerted but the ambitious teacher needs to remind herself every day that no error is more fatal than to overwork the brain of a young child other errors may perhaps be corrected but the effects of this end only with life to force upon him knowledge which is too advanced for his present comprehension or to demand from him greater concentration and for a longer period than he is physically fitted to give is to produce arrested development whoever sacrifices health to wisdom has generally sacrificed wisdom too jean paul mathematical forms we must beware of abstractions in these forms of knowledge and let the child see and build for himself then lead him to express in numbers what he has seen and built he will not call it arithmetic nor be troubled with any visions of mathematics as an abstract science perceptions and recognitions which are with difficulty gained from words are easily gained from facts and deeds through actual experience the child gains in a trice a total concept whereas the same concept expressed in words would be only grasped in a partial manner the rare merit the vivifying influence of this playmaterial is that through the representations it makes possible concepts are recognized at once in their wholeness and unity whereas such an idea of a whole can only very gradually be gained from its verbal expression it must however be added that later through words the concept can be brought into higher and clearer consciousness froebels pedagogics page the cube may be divided into thirds ninths and twentysevenths and the fact thus practically shown that whether the thirds are in one form or another in long lines or squares upright or flat the contents remain the same we may also illustrate by building that like forms may be produced which shall have different contents or different forms having the same contents halves and quarters may be discussed and fully illustrated and addition subtraction multiplication and division may be continued as fully as the comprehension of the child will allow during the practice with the forms of knowledge we should frequently illustrate the lawful evolution of one form from another as in the series moving from the parallelopiped to the hexagonal prism it should not be forgotten that whenever the cube is separated and divided recombination should follow and that the gift plays should always close with synthetic processes some of the mathematical truths shown in the fifth gift were also seen in the third but repeated experiences as froebel says are of great profit to the child we should allow no memorizing in any of these exercises or meaningless and singsong repetitions of words we must always talk enough to make the lesson a living one but not too much lest the child be deprived of the use of his own thoughts and abilities it is through frequent return to a subject and intense activity upon it for short periods that it soaks in and becomes influential in the building of character especially is this true if the principles of apperception and concentration are not forgotten by the teacher in working upon the disciplinary subjects geo p brown the fifth gift b there is a supplemental box of blocks called in germany the fifth gift b which may be regarded as a combination of the second and fifth gifts and whose place in the regular line of material is between the fifth and sixth it was brought out in berlin more than thirteen years ago but has not so far been used to any extent in this country it is a threeinch wooden cube divided into twelve oneinch cubes eight additional cubes from each of which one corner is removed and which correspond in size to a quarter of a cylinder six oneinch cylinders divided in halves and three oneinch cubes divided diagonally into quarters like those of the fifth gift hermann goldammer argues its necessity in his book the gifts of the kindergarten berlin when he says that the curved line has been kept too much in the background by kindergartners and that the new blocks will enable children to construct forms derived from the sphere and cylinder as well as from the cube goldammers remark in regard to the curved line is undoubtedly true but it would seem that he himself indicates that the place of the new blocks or of some gift containing curved lines should be supplemental to the third rather than the fifth as they would there carry out more strictly the logical order of development and amplify the suggestions of the sphere cube and cylinder it is possible that we need a third gift b and a fourth gift b as well as some modifications of the one already existing all of which should include forms dealing with the curve goldammer says further in froebels building boxes there are two series of development intended to render a child by his own researches and personal activity familiar with the general properties of solid bodies and the special properties of the cube and forms derived from it these two series hitherto had the sixth gift as their last stage although froebel himself wished to see them continued by two new boxes he never constructed them however nor are the indications which he has left us with regard to those intended additions sufficiently clear to be followed by others the curved forms of the fifth gift b are of course of marked advantage in building especially in constructing entrances wells vestibules rosewindows covered bridges railroad stations viaducts steam and horse cars houseboats fountains lighthouses as well as familiar household furniture such as pianos tall clocks bookshelves cradles etc though one may perhaps consider the fifth gift b as not entirely well placed in point of sequence and needing some modification of its present form yet no one can fail to enjoy its practical use or to recognize the validity of the arguments for its introduction readings for the student paradise of childhood edward wiebe pages kindergarten guide j and b

n hailmann the sixth gift is a threeinch cube divided by various cuts into thirtysix pieces eighteen of which are rectangular parallelopipeds or bricks the same size as those of the fourth gift two inches long one inch wide and one half inch thick twelve additional pieces are formed by cutting six of these parallelopipeds or units of measure in halves breadthwise giving blocks with two square and four oblong faces the remaining six pieces are formed by cutting three parallelopipeds or units of measure in halves lengthwise giving square prisms columns or pillars the sixth is the last of the solid gifts and is an extension of the fourth from which it differs in size and number of parts it deals with multiples of the number two and three also with halves rather than with quarters or thirds the half being treated in a new manner i e by dividing the unit of measure both in its length and breadth giving two solids different in form but alike in cubical contents the most important characteristics of the gift are a irregularity of division b introduction of column c extent of surface covered by symmetrical forms d greater inclosure of space in symmetrical forms e introduction of distinct style of architecture f greater height of life forms g severe simplicity of life forms produced by the rectangular solids the sixth gift has no great increase of difficulty and though new forms are presented there is little complexity in dictation the building needs a somewhat more careful handling inasmuch as the life forms rise to considerable height and need the most exact balance the child sees solids whose faces are all either squares or oblongs but of different sizes viz oblongs of three sizes squares of two sizes this is the last of the building gifts the child having received sufficient knowledge to be introduced step by step into the domain of the abstract the first step being the planes of the seventh gift the geometrical forms illustrated in this gift are rectangular parallelopipeds solids square prisms cubes planes squares oblongs the brick of the sixth gift is identical with that of the fourth therefore it presents the same contrasts and mediations in number the different classes of blocks stand to each other as we may add that the brick is the foundation form of the gift and that we gain the remaining two forms the square block and pillar by dividing it in exactly opposite directions introduction of the gift the sixth gift is so evidently an enlarged and diversified fourth gift that it is well to compare it on its introduction with the fourth as well as with its immediate predecessor in the series when the fourth is placed beside it and the contents of the two boxes brought to view it is evident at once to the child that a higher round in the ladder of evolution has been reached and a new and highly specialized form developed he is fired at once with creative activity and his eager hands so quiver with impatience to investigate the possibilities of the new blocks that the wise kindergartner does not detain him long with comparisons only assuring herself that he notes the relation of the new gift to the former ones that he compares the two new solids to the brick or unit of measure and to each other and discovers how each has been produced difficulties of the new gift the difficulties of the new gift are very slight as has been said consisting neither in dictation in mass of material nor in new forms lines or angles equilibrium alone presents novel problems but this law the child now understands fairly well in its practical workings while he has gained so much dexterity in his use of the other blocks that the height and delicate poise of the new forms are added attractions rather than obstacles forms of life the sixth gift far surpasses all the other building blocks in its decided adaptation to the purely architectural forms the bricks of the fourth gift may be used as a foundation for the construction of large and ambitious structures and with this additional material the sixth gift may excel in producing elegant and graceful forms the bricks of course admit of a much greater superficial extension and the inclosure of a more extensive space than has heretofore been possible the children will unaided construct familiar objects such as household furniture and implements churches fences walled inclosures and towers with the new blocks and seize with delight upon the possibilities of the column which is really the distinctive feature of the gift so far the building of object forms will closely resemble those of the previous gifts but a step in advance may be made by the children if the kindergartner is complete mistress of the new forms and knows their capabilities the gift may serve as a primer of architecture if its materials are thoroughly exploited and may lead later on to a healthy discontent with incorrect outline with vulgar ornamentation and with crudity of form the sense of beauty must be awakened in the soul in childhood if in later life he is to create the beautiful reminiscences of froebel page froebel himself who had made exhaustive studies in architecture and obtained the training necessary to enable him to take it up as a profession has left us many examples of sixth gift building which are to be found in all the german guides the structures are no longer rude representations but have a marked grace and symmetry and in their simplicity clearness of outline and fine proportion strongly resemble early greek architecture colonnades commemorative columns faзades of palaces belvederes temples arches city gates monuments fountains portals fonts observatories all can be constructed in miniature with due regard to law fitness and proportion and as the soft creamywhite structures rise on the various tables we see borne out froebels saying that the order of his building gifts was such that the child might be led in their use through the worlds great architectural epochs from egypt to rome as the gifts proceed from the first to the sixth observation is demanded with increasing strictness relativity more and more appreciated and the opportunity afforded for endless manifestations of the constructive faculty while all the time impressions are forming in the mind which in due time will bear rich fruits of mathematical and practical knowledge as well as жsthetic culture for the dawning sense of the beautiful as well as of the true is gaining consistency and power karl froebel forms of symmetry although with this gift we cannot produce symmetrical forms in as great diversity as with the fifth yet the materials are productive to the inventive mind and when the pieces are arranged with care and taste beautiful figures may always be developed those having a triangular centre being novel and especially pleasing although not as diversified however they have the added advantage of approaching nearer the plane and that this progression may be more clearly shown it seems evident that the symmetrical forms should only be produced by laying the columns squarefaced blocks and bricks flat upon the table and that the practice advised by some authorities of changing the figures by placing the blocks erect or half erect should be discouraged forms of knowledge in the forms of knowledge we find again much less diversity than in the fifth gift the rectilinear solids and consequent absence of oblique angles limiting us in the construction of geometrical forms the blocks however offer excellent means for general arithmetical instruction for working out problems as to areas for further illustration of dimension and for building many varieties of parallelopipeds square prisms and cubes and studying the parallelograms which bound them the elements of this knowledge it is true were gained with the fourth gift but we must remember that interest in any subject is not necessarily decreased by repetition and that the value of review depends upon whether or not it is mechanical what makes froebels gifts particularly instructive is indeed the fact that the most varied materials constantly lead to the same observations but always under different conditions so that we obtain the necessary repetitions without the dryness the tiresomeness the fatigue inseparable from constant unvaried iteration but they also accustom the child to discover similarity in things that appear to differ to find resemblance in contrasts unity in diversity connection in what appears unconnected h goldammers the kindergarten page coцperative work the group work at the square tables is now especially beautiful both when forms of symmetry or object forms are constructed the fourth gift may be used as has been said if more material is needed and of course combines perfectly with the sixth gift blocks a large sixth gift made as was suggested for the fifth on the scale of a foot instead of an inch is most useful for coцperative exercises in the centre of the ring and the slender graceful columns for instance which may thus be built in unison to commemorate some historic birthday are so many concrete evidences to the childs eyes of the value of united effort the gifts and their treatment by the kindergartner every gift and occupation and exercise of the kindergarten has been developed with infinite love and forethought to meet the childs wishes and capabilities every one of them has been so delicately adjusted to meet the demands of the case and so gently drawn into the natural and legitimate channel of childlike play that they never fail to meet with an enthusiastic reception from the child nor to awaken the strongest interest in him the kindergartner should be careful that he never builds hastily or lawlessly and above all she should guide him to those forms which he will be able to construct with perfection and accuracy she should always follow him in his work answering his questions and suggesting new ideas letting him feel in every way that she is in sympathy with him and that none of his plans or experiments however small they may be are indifferent to her it is always a delight to the child if his productions are understood by grownup people for he often feels somewhat doubtful of the value of his work until the seal of approval has been set upon it by a superior mind underlying idea of froebels gifts if we have grasped the underlying idea which welds the mass of material which forms the kindergarten gifts into a harmoniously connected whole if we have developed the analytical faculty sufficiently to perceive their relation to the child the childs relation to them and the reasons for their selection as mediums of education if we see clearly why each object is given what connection it has with the childs development and what natural laws should govern it in play then we comprehend froebels own idea of their use education vs cramming certainly the ignorant and unsympathetic kindergartner may err in dealing with them and introduce the cramming process into her field of labor as easily as the public school teacher for it is as easy to cram with objects as with books and should this occur there is cause for grave uneasiness since the opportunity for injuring the brain of the child is greater during these first years than at any other time if we force the child or make the lesson seem work to him his faculties will rebel he will be dull inattentive or restless according to his temperament or physical state he will not be interested in what we teach him and therefore it will make no impression on him the child has memory enough he remembers the picnic in the woods the glorious sail across the bay the white foam in the wake of the boat the very tint of the flowers that he gathered in fact he remembers everything in which he is interested if we would have him remember our teachings forever we must make them worthy of being remembered forever and to this end it is essential that only the best teachers be provided for little children the ideal teacher should know her subject thoroughly but should be able to boil it down to condense it so that the concentrated extract alone will remain and this be presented to her pupils if you would be pungent be brief for it is with words as with sunbeams the more they are condensed the deeper they burn in leaving these first six gifts we need finally to remember these things suggestions as to method first that we must not be too anxious to resolve these plays into the routine of lessons with our younger pupils especially this is not admissible and we must guard against it in all exercises with the kindergarten materials second we may assure ourselves in all modesty that it is a difficult matter indeed to direct these plays properly that is to have system and method enough to guard the children from all lawlessness idleness and disorder and yet to keep from falling into a mechanical drill which will never produce the wishedfor results play is the natural the appropriate business and occupation of the child left to his own resources and we must strive to turn our lessons into that channel only thus shall we reach the highest measure of true success third we must strive by constant study and thought by entering into the innermost chambers of the childnature and estimating its cravings and necessities to penetrate the secret the soul of the froebel gifts then we shall never more be satisfied with their external appearances and superficial uses note in arranging the blocks of the sixth gift place the eighteen bricks erect in three rows with their broad faces together on top of these place nine of the squarefaced blocks thus forming a second layer the third layer is formed by placing the remaining three blocks of this class on the back row and filling in the space in front with the six pillars placed side by side readings for the

nature of powers the effects of material begin to disclose themselves to him color rhythm tone and figure come forward at the buddingpoint and in their individual value the child begins already to distinguish with precision nature and the world of art and looks with certainty upon the outer world as separate from himself friedrich froebel froebels thin colored planes correspond with the mosaic wood or stone work of early man h poesche there is nothing in the whole present system of education more deserving of serious consideration than the sudden and violent transition from the material to the abstract which our children have to go through on quitting the parental house to enter a school froebel therefore made it a point to bridge over this transition by a whole series of playmaterial and in this series it is the layingtablets which occupy the first place h goldammer the seventh gift consists of variously colored square and triangular tablets made of wood or pasteboard the sides of the pieces being about one inch in length circular and oblong pasteboard tablets have lately been introduced as well as whole and half circles in polished woods the first six gifts illustrated solids while the seventh moving from the concrete towards the abstract makes the transition to the surface the building gifts presented to the child divided units from which he constructed new wholes through these he became familiar with the idea of a whole and parts and was prepared for the seventh gift which offers him not an object to transform but independent elements to be combined into varied forms these divided solids also offered the child a certain fixed amount of material for his use after the introduction of the seventh gift the amount to be used is optional with the kindergartner the child up to this time has seen the surface in connection with solids he now receives the embodied surface separated from the solid and gradually abstracts the general idea of surface learning to regard it not only as a part but as an individual whole this gift also emphasizes color and the various triangular forms besides imparting the idea of pictorial representation or the representation of objects by means of plane surfaces the gift leads the child from the object itself towards the representation of the object thus sharpening the observation and preparing the way for drawing it is also less definitely suggestive than previous gifts and demands more creative power for its proper use it appeals to the sense of form sense of place sense of color and sense of number the geometrical forms illustrated in this gift are squares right isosceles obtuse isosceles triangles equilateral rightangled scalene oblong rhombus rhomboid trapezoid in combination trapezium pentagon hexagon heptagon octagon the law of mediation of contrasts is shown in the forms of the gift we have in the triangles for instance two lines running in opposite directions connected by a third which serves as the mediation contrasts and their mediations are also shown in the squares and in the forms made by combination this gift representing the plane is a link between the divided solid and the line step from solid to plane we have now left the solid and are approaching abstraction when we begin the study of planes all mental development has ever begun and must begin with the concrete and progress by successive stages toward the abstract and it was froebels idea that his playmaterial might be used to form a series of steps up which the child might climb in his journey toward the abstract beginning with the ball a perfect type of wholeness and unity we are led through diversity as shown in the three solids of the second gift toward divisibility in the building gifts and approximation to surface in the sixth gift the next move in advance is the partial abstraction of surface shown in the tablets of the seventh gift the tablets show two dimensions length and breadth the thickness being so trifling relatively that it need not be considered as it does not mar the childs perception and idea of the plane they are intended to represent surfaces and should be made as thin as is consistent with durability systematic relation between the tablets the various tablets as first introduced in germany and in this country were commonly quite different in size and degrees of angles in the different kindergartens as they were either cut out hastily by the teachers themselves or made by manufacturers who knew very little of the subject the former practice of dividing an oblong from corner to corner to produce the rightangled scalene triangle was much to be condemned as it entirely set aside the law of systematic relation between the tablets and rendered it impossible to produce the standard angles which are so valuable a feature of the gift one of the principal advantages of the kindergarten system is that it lays the foundation for a systematic scientific education which will help the masses to become expert and artistic workmen in whatever occupation they may be engaged pamphlet on the seventh gift milton bradley co in this direction the seventh gift has doubtless immense capabilities but much of its force and value has been lost much of the work thrown away which it has accomplished for want of proper and systematic relation between the tablets the order in which these are now derived and introduced is as follows the square tablet is of course the type of quadrilaterals and when it is divided from corner to corner a threesided figure is seen the half square or right isosceles triangle but one which is not the type of threesided figures the typical and simplest triangle the equilateral is next presented and if this be divided by a line bisecting one angle the result will be two triangles of still different shape the rightangled scalene if these two are placed with shortest sides together we have another form the obtuseangled triangle and this gives us all the five forms of the seventh gift the square educates the eye to judge correctly of a right angle and the division of the square gives the angle of or the mitre the equilateral has three angles of each the divided equilateral or rightangled scalene has one angle of one of and one of while the obtuse isosceles has one angle of and the remaining two each these are the standard angles and used by carpenter joiner cabinetmaker blacksmith in fact in all the trades and many of the professions and the childs eye should become as familiar with them as with the size of the squares on his table possibilities of the gift in mathematical instruction edward wiebe says in regard to the relation of the seventh gift to geometry and general mathematical instruction who can doubt that the contemplation of these figures and the occupations with them must tend to facilitate the understanding of geometrical axioms in the future and who can doubt that all mathematical instruction by means of froebels system must needs be facilitated and better results obtained that such instruction will be rendered fruitful in practical life is a fact which will be obvious to all who simply glance at the sequence of figures even without a thorough explanation for they contain demonstratively the larger number of those axioms in elementary geometry which relate to the conditions of the plane in regular figures as the tablets are used in the kindergarten they are intended only to increase the sum of general experience in regard to the qualities of things but they may be made the medium of really advanced instruction in mathematics such as would be suitable for a connectingclass or a primary school all this training too may be given in the concrete and so lay the foundation for future mathematical work on the rock of practical observation the kindergarten child is expected only to know the different kinds of triangles from each other and to be familiar with their simple names to recognize the standard angles and to know practically that all right angles are equally large obtuse angles greater and acute less than right angles all this he will learn by means of play with the tablets by dictations and inventions and by constant comparison and use of the various forms how and when tablets should be introduced as to the introduction of the tablets the square is first of all of course given to the child a small cube of the third gift may be taken and surrounded on all its faces by square tablets and then each one peeled off disclosing as it were the hidden solid we may also mould cubes of clay and have the children slice off one of the square faces as both processes show conclusively the relation the square plane bears to the cube whose faces are squares if the first tablets introduced are of pasteboard as probably will be the case the new material should be noted and some idea given of the manufacture of paper there is a vast difference in opinion concerning the introduction of this seventh gift and it is used by the child in the various kindergartens at all times from the beginning of his ball plays up to his laying aside of the fifth gift it seems very clear however that he should not use the square plane until after he has received some impression of the three dimensions as they are shown in solid bodies and this mr hailmann tells us he has no proper means of gaining save through the fourth gift the perception of the difference between a surfaceextension and an extension in three dimensions begins late and is established slowly w preyer the mind of the child page as to the triangular tablets it is evident enough they should not be dealt with until after the child has seen the triangular plane on the solid forms of the fifth gift mr hailmann says that a clear idea of the extension of solids in three dimensions can only come from a familiarity with the bricks and again that the abstractions of the tablet should not be obtruded on the childs notice until he has that clear idea though the six tablets which surround the cube may be given to the child at the first exercise it is better to dictate simple positions of one or two squares first and let him use the six in dictation and many more in invention order of introducing triangles the first triangle given is the right isosceles showing the angle of fortyfive degrees and formed by bisecting the square with a diagonal line the child should be given a square of paper and scissors and allowed to discover the new form for himself letting him experiment until the desired triangle is obtained he should then study the new form its edges and angles and then join his two rightangled triangles into a square a larger triangle etc then let him observe how many positions these triangles may assume by moving one round the other he will find them acting according to the law of opposites already familiar to him and if not comprehended yet furnishing him with an infallible criterion for his inventive work with this law i give children a guide for creating and because it is the law according to which they as creatures of god have themselves been created they can easily apply it it is born with them reminiscences of froebel page the equilateral is then taken up is compared with the halfsquare and then studied by itself its three equal sides and angles each sixty degrees being noted as well as the obtuse angles made by all possible combinations of the equilateral next as we have said comes the rightangled scalene triangle with its inequality of sides and angles which must be studied and compared with the equilateral and last of all the obtuse isosceles triangle which is dealt with in the same way here again it should be noted that the two last forms should always be discovered by the child in his play with the equilateral and that he should cut them himself from paper before he is given the regular pasteboard or wooden triangles for study if presented for the first time in this latter form they can never mean as much to him as if he had found them out for himself dictations the dictations should invariably be given so that opposites and their intermediates may be readily seen the different triangles may be studied each in the same way introducing them one at a time in the order named afterwards allowing as free a combination as will produce symmetrical figures it is best always to study one of a new kind then two then gradually give larger numbers great possibilities undoubtedly lie in this gift but it is well to remember that with young children it must not be made the vehicle of too abstract instruction in order to make the dictations simple the child must be perfectly familiar with the terms of direction up down right left centre with the simple names of the planes squares halfsquares equalsided blunt and sharpangled triangles etc and he must learn to know the longest edge of each triangle that he may be able to place it according to direction the children should be encouraged to invent to give the dictation exercises to one another and to copy the simpler forms of the lesson on blackboard or paper some duplicate copies in colored papers may be made from their inventions and the walls of the schoolroom ornamented with them it will be a pleasure to the little ones themselves and demonstrate to others how wonderful a gift this is and how charmingly the children use it no exercise should be given without previous study and in the first years teaching it is wiser to draw or make the figures before giving the dictations the materials too should be prepared beforehand in such a form that they can be given out readily and quietly by the children at the opening of the exercise to require a class of a dozen or more pupils to wait while the kindergartner assorts and counts the various colors and shapes of tablets to be used is positively to invite loss of interest on the childrens part and to produce in the teacher a hurry and worry and nervous tension which will infallibly ruin the play life forms the life forms are no longer absolute representations but only more or less suggestive images of certain objects and thus show still more clearly the orderly movement from concrete to abstract hitherto in life forms the child has produced more or less real objects for instance he built a miniature house a fountain a chair or a sofa they were not absolutely real and therefore in one way merely images but they were bodily images he could place a little dish on the table a tiny cup on the edge of the fountain a doll could sit in the chair and therefore they were all real for purposes of play at least with the tablets however the child can no longer make a chair though by a certain arrangement of them he can make an image of it the child will notice that many of the forms made with squares are flat pictures of those made with the third gift and with the addition of the right isosceles triangles he can reproduce the faзades of many of the elaborate object forms of the fifth the various triangles differ greatly in their capabilities of producing life forms the equilateral and the obtuse isosceles being especially deficient in this regard and requiring to be combined with the other tablets the fact that both the right isosceles and right scalene triangles produce life forms in great variety seems to prove that as goldammer says the right angle predominates in the products of human activity symmetrical forms the symmetrical forms are more varied and innumerable than those of any other gift and with the addition of the brilliant colors of the pasteboard or the soft shades of the wooden tablets make figures which are undeniably beautiful and which are mosaiclike in their effect the whirling figures are interesting and new and the child with developed eye and growing artistic taste will delight in their oddity and yet be able to find opposites and their intermediates and make them as correctly as in the more methodical figures where the exact right and left balanced the upper and lower extremes here we note that the equilateral and obtuse isosceles triangles so ill fitted to produce life forms lend themselves to forms of symmetry in great variety the various sequences of the latter in the third and fifth gifts may of course be faithfully reproduced in surfaceextension with the tablets and thus gain an added charm the amount of material given to the child is now a matter for the decision of the kindergartner and is dependent only on the ability of the child to use it to advantage this increase of material presents a further difficulty and it is time for us to add still another that is to expect more of the child and to require that he produce not only something original but something which shall though simple be really beautiful inventions in borders are a new and charming feature of this gift and the circular and oblong tablets as well as the squares and various triangles are well adapted to produce them the various borders laid horizontally across the tablets may be divided by lines of sticks and thus make an effect altogether different from anything we have had before mathematical forms the work with forms of knowledge as has been fully shown will be in geometry than in arithmetic to which indeed the gift is not especially well adapted in addition to the study and comparison of the various forms their lines and angles we have a great variety of figures to be produced by combination we can make the nine regular forms already mentioned in the introduction in a variety of ways and thus give new charm to the old truths we must allow the child to experiment by himself very frequently and interpret to him his discoveries when he makes them the seventh gift in weaving the square tablets afford a valuable aid to the occupation of weaving as all the simple patterns can be formed with them the child laying them upon his table until he has mastered the numerical principle upon which they are constructed we can easily see how these same patterns may be further utilized as designs for inlaid tiles or parquetry floors thus the seventh gift may introduce children to subsequent practical life and serve as a useful preparation for various branches of artwork seventh gift parquetry it is easy to see when we begin the practical use of the tablets that the essential characteristics of the gifts in their progress from solid to point are now becoming less marked and that they begin to merge into the occupations which develop from point to solid the meetingplace of the two series is close at hand and like drops of water fallen near each other they tremble with impatience to rush into one the inventions which the child makes with tablets he now very commonly expresses a desire to give away or to take home with him a thought which he seldom had with the gifts wishing rather to show them in their place upon the tables as this is a natural and legitimate desire a supplement to the seventh gift has been devised consisting of paper substitutes for the various forms of the same size and appropriate coloring and to be had either plain or gummed on the back after the inventions have been made they are easily transferred to paper with parquetry and so can be bestowed according to the will of the inventor group work the parquetry of the seventh gift lends an added grace to coцperative work for the children can now combine all their material in one form to decorate the room or perhaps to send as a gift to an absent playmate they may make an inlaid floor for the dolls house a brightly colored windowpane for the sun to stream through and with larger forms may even design an effective border for the wainscoting of the schoolroom the utility of this united action is not to be overlooked the children all proceed according to one and the same law they all work to produce one and the same result the same purpose unites them all in short we see here in the childrens play all that forms the base of every human society all that renders it possible for men to act together in organized communities such as are the family the state and the church and to prepare for the future to be mindful even amidst play of that which a child will afterwards require in order worthily to fill his place in the world ought surely not to be among the least important ends of an education claiming to be in conformity with nature and reason h goldammer the kindergarten page the group work at the square tables is also carried on very fully with the tablets the symmetrical figures when the colors are well combined being quite dazzling in beauty color with seventh gift in this connection a danger may be noted in the treatment of the gifts both by kindergartner and children color appears again here in almost bewildering profusion after its long absence in the series and is another straw to prove that the wind is blowing strongly toward the occupations many of the pasteboard tablets are of different colors on the opposite sides and though this is of great use in beauty forms when properly treated it is quite often unfortunate in forms of life unless careful attention is given to arranging the material beforehand the effect of a barn for instance with its front view checkered with violet red and yellow squares may be imagined or of a pigeonhouse with a particolored green and blue roof an orange standard and red supports yet these are no fancy pictures i have painted and if the child places the tablets in this fashion they are often allowed so to remain without criticism from the purblind kindergartner she even sometimes dictates herself extravagant and vulgar combinations of color such as a violet centrepiece with green corners and an orange border there needs no reasoning to prove that such a person is radically unfit to handle the subject of colorteaching and is sure to corrupt the children under her charge for in general if ordinarily well trained they should now be far beyond the stage in which they would be satisfied with such crudity of combination they have had their season of playing with brightness as mr hailmann calls it and should now begin to have really good ideas as to harmonious arrangement of hues if they have not if they really seem to prefer the pigeonhouse or barn above mentioned then they are viciously illtaught or altogether deficient in color sense it has been noted that the older children often choose the light and dark wooden tablets for invention rather than the gay pasteboard forms but this may be on account of the high polish of the wood and its novelty in this guise rather than because as has been suggested they have been surfeited with brightness readings for the student paradise of childhood edward wiebe pages law of childhood w n hailmann kindergarten guide krausboelte koehlers kindergarten

were carved the runes and magic symbols of our primitive ancestors hermann poesche it will be readily seen how useful sticklaying may become in perspective drawing in the study of planes and solids in crystallography how while it insures an enjoyable familiarity with geometrical forms and secures everincreasing manual skill and delicacy of touch it develops at the same time the artistic sense of the children in a high degree w n hailmann the wooden staffs of the eighth gift sometimes called the tenth are of various lengths but have for their uniform thickness the tenth of an inch they present as now made flat sides and square ends are sometimes uncolored and sometimes dyed in the six primary colors the previous gifts dealt with solids and plane surfaces wholes or divided wholes while this one illustrates the edge or line the previous gifts more definitely suggested their uses by their prominent characteristics this depends for its value largely upon the ingenuity of the teacher we have contrasts of size in the preceding gifts both in the units themselves and in the component parts of which the divided units are made but in this gift the dimension length is alone emphasized the most important characteristic of the gift is the representation of the line the relations of position and form enter as essential elements of usefulness the laying of sticks may be used as an occupation very early in the kindergarten course and thus serve as a preparation for the first drawing exercises but there should be no attempt at this time to give them their legitimate connection with the cube as the edge of the solid and with the tablet as a portion of the surface later they may be introduced in their proper place in the sequence of gifts and thus assume their true relation in the childs mind this relation is made more evident as we can and should reproduce the lessons with the solids in outline with the sticks when the child is more advanced the connection of the sticks with the preceding objects will be more clearly explained and intelligently comprehended and then they may be used in connection with softened peas or tiny corks which serve to illustrate the points of contact of the sides of surfaces and edges of solids whose skeletons the child can then construct with these materials the geometrical forms illustrated in this gift are angles of every degree triangles quadrilaterals and additional polygons skeletons of solids by means of corks or peas the law of the mediation of contrasts is shown in the fact that every line is a connection between opposite points as in the other gifts the law governs the use of the line in the formation of all outlines of objects and all symmetrical designs as we have already noted the gifts of froebel are thus far solids divided solids planes and divided planes relation of the single and jointed slats to the other gifts how both are used with the single and jointed slats we shall not deal separately merely stating that they form a transition between the surface and the line having more breadth and relation to the surface itself than to the edge but manifestly tending towards the embodied line of which the little stick given by froebel is the realization the jointed slats generally ruled in half and quarter inches for measuring may be used to show how one form is developed from another for instance the rhombus from the square the rhomboid from the oblong and they are very useful also for explaining and illustrating the different kinds of angles as the opening between the joints may be made narrower or wider at pleasure the disconnected slats are used for the occasional play or exercise of interlacing forming a variety of figures geometrical and artistic which hold together when carefully treated the slats form in some sort the transition from the surfacepictures of the layingtablets to the lineal representations of the layingsticks but have this advantage over both tablets and sticks that the forms constructed with them are not bound down to the surface of the table but possess sufficient solidity to bear being removed from it h goldammer the kindergarten page materials of froebels gifts as to the unpretentious little sticks themselves the use of these bits of waste wood is entirely unique and characteristic no one else would have deemed them worthy of a place in school apparatus or among educational appliances but froebel had the eye and mind of a true philosopher ever seeing the great in the small ever bringing out of the commonplace material which lies unused on every hand all its inherent possibilities and capabilities of usefulness froebel was no destructive reformer but the most conservative of philosophers how the stick is to be regarded the stick of course is to be regarded in its relation to what comes before and after it as the embodied edge of the cube as the tablet was its embodied face the child should at last identify his stick the embodiment of the straight line with the axis of the sphere the edge of the cube and the side of the square the sticks and rings are properly speaking one gift contrasting the curved and straight lines just as we obtained the tablets from the cubes of which they are the embodied faces so now we obtain also the layingsticks from the cube whose edges they represent but they are contained also in the layingtablets for one may regard the surface as produced by the progressive movement of a line and this may be made clear to the child by slicing a square tablet into a number of sticks h goldammer the kindergarten page method and manner of lessons although the stick exercises should make their appearance at least once every week after their introduction they may always be varied by stories and when occasionally connected with other objects cut from paper to illustrate some point are among the pleasantest and most fruitful exercises of the kindergarten the sticks may be used for teaching number and elementary geometry both in the kindergarten and school or for reviewing and fixing knowledge already gained in these directions for practice in the elements of designing for giving a correct idea of outlines of familiar objects and should constantly serve as an introduction to drawing and sewing lessons to which they are the natural prelude they should be used strictly after the manner of the other gifts beginning with careful dictations in which the various positions of one stick should be exhausted before proceeding to a greater number with coцperative work and with free invention these exercises and original designs may be put into permanent form in parquetry which is furnished for this gift in the various colored papers as well as for the tablets the inventions may also be transferred to paper by drawing and to cardboard by sewing the exercises may continue from the various simple positions which one stick may assume to really complex dictations requiring from fifteen to twentyfive sticks and introducing many difficult positions and outlines of new geometrical figures forms of knowledge and number work when we consider that the length of the sticks varies from one to six inches and that the number given to the child is limited only by his capacity for using them successfully we can see that the outlines of all the rectilinear plane figures can easily be made by their use of course in these exercises there must be a great deal of incidental arithmetic but the gift may also be used for definite number work and is far better adapted to this purpose than any other in the series since it presents a number of separate units which may be grouped or combined to suit any simple arithmetical process representing the line as it does it has less bodily substance than any previous gift and hence comes nearest to the numerical symbols as the next step to using a line would obviously be making one it also offers very much the same materials for calculation as were used by the race in its childhood and hence fits in with the inherited instincts of the undeveloped human being each following generation and each following individual man is to pass through the whole earlier development and cultivation of the human race and he does pass it otherwise he would not understand the world past and present but not by the dead way of imitation of copying but by the living way of individual free active development and cultivation friedrich froebel education of man page who has not seen him arranging twigs and branches in his play counting them over and over or simulating the process and delighting to divide them into groups so the cavedweller used them doubtless not in play but in serious earnest for some such purpose as keeping tally of the wild beasts he had killed or the number of his enemies vanquished with a few packets of froebels sticks as has been very well said the child is provided with an excellent calculating machine the use of this machine in the primary school in word making as well as in number work is practically unlimited but in the kindergarten it may very well give a clear practical understanding of the first four rules of arithmetic an understanding which will be based on personal activity and experience thus the childs sphere of knowledge the world of his life is again extended by the observation and recognition by the development and cultivation of the capacity of number and an essential need of his inner nature a certain yearning of his spirit are thereby satisfied the knowledge of the relations of quantity extraordinarily heightens the life of the child friedrich froebel education of man page evolution of the kindergarten stick it is well by way of prelude to the first few lessons to draw from the children the origin and history of the tiny bit of wood given them for their play and they will henceforth regard it in a new light and treat it with greater respect and care let us trace it carefully from its baby beginnings in the seed its germination and growth the influences which surround and foster it from day to day its steady increase in size and strength its downward grasp and its upward reach the hardening of the tender stem and slender cylindrical trunk into the massive oak or pine the growth of its tough strong garment of bark its winter times of rest and spring times of renewal until from the tender green twig so frail and pliant it has become too large to clasp with the arms and high enough to swing its dry leaves into the church tower then let us follow out its usefulness for instance we might first paint a glowing wordpicture of the loggingcamp the chopping and hewing and felling the life of the busy woodcutter in the leafy woods in autumn or in the dense forests in winter time when the snow cold and white and dazzling covers the ground with its fleecy carpet again let us depict the road and the busy teamsters driving their yokes of strong oxen with their heavy loads of logs to the towns and cities where they are to be sold a scene a perfect wordpicture should be painted of everything concerning the trip the crunching of the oxens hoofs on the pressed snow the creaking of the heavy truck as its runners slip along the smooth surface the breath of the men and animals rising like steam into the clear cold air all these things rise in image before the childs eye and are not soon forgotten you may be sure the work and life of the riverdrivers might also be described and their manner of floating the logs down river in springtime when the water is high and the current strong then perhaps the children will help to tell us about the mill of which they doubtless know something where the sawmills are built how the water helps in turning the great wheel the buzzing and hissing of the big saws and the way in which they quickly make boards of the long strong logs this and much more may be said and if it is well said no child can ever look at the tiny stick afterwards and entirely forget the charm which once surrounded it these terse graphic descriptions of objects will be found very serviceable in sharpening and intensifying the powers of observation as well as securing clearness distinctness accuracy and life in verbal description here the pupil learns practically to give due prominence to essentials and to appreciate the full value of accessories to look for and discover the fundamental ideas of which things are the modified adorned garbled or stunted expression to seek and find the very soul of things w n hailmann primary helps page group work with sticks the sticks are especially serviceable for group work of various kinds either at the long or square tables as the children have now an abundance of material they can make all the objects perhaps which may be mentioned in a story the kindergartner tells if it is about the origin of thanksgiving day for instance abby who sits at one end of the line may make a picture of the mayflower and john her neighbor make the speedwell the next child may construct a cradle for oceanus the little pilgrim baby born on shipboard the next use his material for the indian huts the settlers saw after landing and so on each child making a different object which remains upon his table until the close of the story when this is completed it will have been fully illustrated by the children with their sticks and they will be delighted to inspect the different pictures which they will plainly see are much more varied and beautiful than any one of them could have made alone thus the value of coцperation will be plainly shown without a word from the kindergartner in this group work it is desirable that the common aims should be fully within the comprehension of each little worker yet sufficiently beyond his powers of execution and endurance to make him sensible of the need of assistance the former secures the possibility of individual enjoyment and hence the only reliable incentive to persistence the latter insures free subordination to the will of the whole the essential condition of success w n hailmann primary helps page forms of life as to life forms in general their number is practically unlimited though as they are only linepictures and heavy lines at that they are not as real as those made in the building gifts they are easily made however and the veriest baby in the kindergarten who handles the sticks as a prelude to his drawing exercises invents with them all sorts of rude forms which he calls by appropriate names the question of color as it enters into these forms needs perhaps a moments consideration here as the gift includes both white and colored sticks would it not be well to use the former for all dictations in life forms reserving the brilliant hues for the forms of symmetry whose charms they would greatly enhance connection of other objects with stick dictations we may sometimes connect simple inexpensive objects with stick dictations with a view to making them more realistic and delightful when the little ones are just getting the various positions and corresponding terms into their minds and when therefore it is advisable to keep them amused and happy with one to three sticks as long as possible that is until the fundamental principles have become very familiar these objects are most invaluable innumerable lessons may be practiced with one stick only calling it at last a whipstock and giving it a bit of curly paper for a lash far from being an instrument of punishment it makes every child laugh with the glee of possession with two sticks laid horizontally we may give a little paper horsecar or when one is vertical and the other runs horizontally across its end we may call it a candlestick and snip a halfcircle of paper into the semblance of a flame the effect is electrical though the light be only one candlepower and so on ad infinitum it is enough to give the hint for the play we can cut little paper birds for the birdcages tumblers for the rude little tables green leaves for the trees etc making the stick exercise even in its first more difficult details a time of great satisfaction and gladness complete sets of these cardboard objects one for each child should always be kept on hand if well made they will last a year forms of beauty enough has already been said of the possibilities of the sticks to show that they are most valuable for symmetrical forms they may be combined with the tablets and thus very pretty effects be made and when four children unite their material at the group work tables the dictations and inventions produced are of course very large and may be really beautiful if constructed on artistic principles border work may be very fully carried out with the sticks and another charming feature of the gift is the way in which it lends itself to the making of snow crystals these are symmetrical combinations and modifications of familiar geometrical forms around the hexagon mr w n hailmann says regarding them at first it is best to give each child only six or twelve sticks and to dictate the central figure a hexagon or hexagonal star verbally or by means of a drawing on the blackboard they may then receive a number of additional sticks and let the central figure grow all obeying the teachers dictation or each following his own inventive genius these forms are invaluable even as silent teachers of geometrical and numerical relations used judiciously in conversational lessons leading to partial or complete analysis of the figures in spoken or written descriptions their teaching power is inexhaustible w n hailmanns primary helps page in this gift as well as in the seventh the childs imitative and inventive powers are obviously more greatly taxed than in the others and the danger will be if he is not well trained that as he apparently can do anything with the material he will end by doing nothing the greater the freedom given to the child the greater the necessity of teaching him to use that liberty in and through the law and not to abuse it by failing to reach with its aid the highest ends connection of sticks with drawing we may make the laying of oneinch sticks in vertical and horizontal positions in angles and squares a prelude to the drawing of similar lines and the copying of stick dictations either from the table or from memory into drawing is a most excellent exercise calling into requisition great correctness and good judgment besides an unusual amount of calculation since the stick dictation will be on a scale of one inch and the drawing on a scale of one fourth inch reducing the original design to one in miniature the child will almost always begin by attempting to make the picture exactly like his model in size without counting the inches and trying to make it mathematically correct but after the idea is carefully explained and fully illustrated he will have no further difficulty excepting perhaps with the more complicated figures containing slanting lines ambidexterity we should encourage in all possible ways the use of both hands in all the exercises with gifts and occupations not only that one may be as skillful as the other but also to avoid a onesided position of the body which frequently leads to curvature of the spine the wellknown physiologist professor brownsйquard insists on the equal use of both hands in order to induce the necessary equal flow of blood to the brain through the effect of our irregular and abnormal development the cause of which is the too persistent use of the right hand one lobe of our brains and one side of our bodies are in a neglected and weakened condition and the evils resulting from this weakness are many and widespread dr daniel wilson says in the majority of cases the defect though it cannot be wholly overcome may be in great part cured by early training which will strengthen at once both the body and mind whenever the early and persistent cultivation of the full use of both hands has been accomplished the result is greater efficiency without any corresponding awkwardness or defect in certain arts and professions both hands are necessarily called into play the skillful surgeon finds an enormous advantage in being able to transfer his instrument from one hand to the other the dentist has to multiply instruments to make up for the lack of such acquired power the fencer who can transfer his weapon to the left hand places his adversary at a disadvantage the lumberer finds it indispensable in the operation of his woodcraft to learn to chop timber rightandlefthanded and the carpenter may be frequently seen using the saw and hammer in either hand and thereby not only resting his arm but greatly facilitating his work in all the fine arts the mastery of both hands is advantageous the sculptor the carver the draughtsman the engraver the cameocutter each has recourse at times to the left hand for special manipulative dexterity the pianist depends little less on the left hand than on the right and as for the organist with the numerous pedals and stops of the modern grand organ a quadrumanous musician would still find reason to envy the ampler scope which a briareus could command dr daniel wilson lefthandedness a hint for educators abuse of eighth gift no materials of the kindergarten save the beans lentils etc which serve to represent the point have been so overused and so abused as the sticks when no other work was prepared for the children when helpers were few and it was desirable to give something which needed no supervision when inexperienced students were to take charge of classes when the kindergartner was weary and wanted a quiet moment to rest when everybody was in a hurry when the weather was very cold or oppressively warm when there was a torrent of rain or had been a long drought the sticks were hastily brought forth from the closet and as hastily thrust upon the children these small sufferers being thus provided with workmaterials in which it was obvious that superior grown people took no interest immediately lost interest themselves in riotous kindergartens the sticks were broken poked into pockets and thrown on the floor in the orderly ones they were gazed at apathetically no one deeming it worth while to stir a hand to arrange them save under pressure sticks had been presented so often and in so tiresome a manner that they produced a kind of mental atrophy in the child they were arresting his development instead of forwarding it such an abuse of material is entirely unnecessary in the kindergarten where so many ways are provided of presenting the same truths in all sorts of different and charming guises it is unnecessary and most unfortunate for it has frequently thrown undeserved contempt on an innocent and attractive gift which when properly treated is one of the most pleasing and useful which froebel has bequeathed to us readings for the student

are whole circles three inches two inches and one inch in diameter with their respective halves and quarters as the first six gifts emphasized solids and divided solids the seventh the plane and the eighth the straight line so the ninth the ring embodies the curve and illustrates the circumference of the sphere and the edge of the cylinder all the objects hitherto used have with the exception of the ball and cylinder dealt with straight lines and the figures formed by those lines we now begin a series of exercises with the curve and the variety of symmetrical figures that can be constructed is immensely increased much new knowledge can be conveyed by means of this fresh material a complete set of new figures may be produced and the imitation of objects passes from that of things constructed by man which are mostly rectilinear to those of nature in which curved lines in every possible variety prevail the geometrical forms illustrated in this gift are circles semicircles planes quadrants sectors segments by the union of straight and curved lines sticks and rings the entire geometry of the circle may be illustrated and the child may thus become acquainted with the appearance of the diameter radius circumference chord arc the law of mediation of contrasts is shown as follows the semicircles when placed on the table with ends towards right or left connect points of opposite direction up and down and when placed with ends pointing upward or downward they connect the right with the left side the circle is of course an unending line traced from a given point back to itself according to certain laws but it is also a union of two semicircles curving outward in opposite directions it is a representation of the general law since the periphery and centre stand in contrast to each other and are connected by the radii froebel the new gift and its charms having already analyzed straight lines in the sticks we will pass directly to the consideration of the ninth in the series of froebels gifts the rings which are whole half and quarter circles of bright silvered wire if the sticks were fascinating to the child as the embodied straight edge or line and perfect treasurehouses of new possibilities to the kindergartner the rings are just a bit more delightful as with their glittering surface and curved lines and their wonderful property of having neither beginning nor end they are quite different in appearance from anything which precedes or follows them of course the child sees at once that here is an entirely new field for invention and he hastens to possess it fully conscious of his power of combining the new elements introduction of the ring we must first discuss the new form with the children so as to be certain that they fully understand its relation to the other gifts perhaps in a previous exercise with the eighth gift we have allowed the children to experiment with a stick and to break it partially in a number of places so as to produce a measurably correct curved line afterwards promising them that they should soon have perfect curves to play with this exercise has its value because it illustrates practically that a curved line is one which changes its direction at every point let us see when todays play begins if the children can think of any way to make such curves save by the stick already used some quickwitted little one will remember at once the surface of the ball and his repeated experiments in dividing it and will suggest in sufficiently plain words that a curved line might be made from a clay sphere his neighbor thinks a clay cylinder would make one more easily and both experiments are tried by all the children with a resultant of quite perfect clay rings then some one wants to make paper rings and some one else cloth rings and the wise kindergartner encourages all this experimenting knowing that the power of memory increases in the same ratio as delight animation and joy are connected with free mental activity material of the rings when the wire rings are at last given some conversation about their material will be pleasant and timely as it is of a kind we have not had before in the gifts and shall not have again the children will see that it is akin to the substance of which their sewing and weaving needles and their scissors are made and possibly some one may know that both are products of iron at this juncture it may be well to show a piece of iron to let the children handle it and note its various properties and while this is being done to tell them of the many parts of the world in which it is found of its great strength and usefulness and that its value is greater than that of the shining yellow gold a description of iron mines will easily follow and the children will delight to hear of the great shafts sunk deep in the earth of the baskets in which the miners travel up and down of the darkness underground where they toil all day with pick and shovel of the safety lamps they carry in their caps of the mules that drag the loads of iron ore to and fro and startling fact at which round eyes are invariably opened that some of these mules have their stables down in the ground below and never come up where the sun shines and the flowers bloom if there is a foundry in the vicinity of the kindergarten and we can take the little ones to see the huge furnaces the intense fires the molten iron and the various roasting melting and moulding processes necessary in refining the ore they will gain an ineffaceable idea of the value of the metal in human labor and of the endless chain of hands clasped each in the other through which the slender wire rings have passed to reach them first exercises in the first dictation exercise several whole circles of the same size may be given and their equality shown by laying one on top of the other then we may lay them side by side in actual contact and the important fact will be discovered by the children that circles can touch each other at one point only subsequent exercises take up rings of different sizes when concentric circles are of course made showing one thing completely inclosed in another and next follow the half and quarter rings which the children must be led as heretofore to discover and make for themselves with the semicircles which offer still richer suggestions for invention than the whole rings another property of the curved line is seen two blocks two tablets two sticks could not touch each other without forming new angles nor could they be so placed as to produce a complete figure two semicircles on the other hand form no new angles when they touch and they may be joined completely and leave no opening in his work with the sticks the child became well versed in handling a comparatively large amount of material so that now he can deal successfully from the first exercise with a fair number of whole half and quarter rings we must be careful however not to give him too many of these in the beginning lest he be overwhelmed with the riches at his command the number of rings should only gradually be augmented satiety destroys every impulse of creation emma marwedel childhoods poetry and studies page when the rings should be introduced the rings should not be used freely until the child is familiar with vertical horizontal and slanting lines and not only familiar in the sense of being able to receive and obey dictations intelligently but in constantly making correct and artistic use of them in his creations the practice with them however is often deferred entirely too long and the intense pleasure and profit which the child gains from the beautiful and satisfying curved line are not given him until very late in the kindergarten course this is manifestly unnecessary for although if we introduce froebels gifts and occupations in orderly sequence we make greater use of the straight line after the first and second gifts are passed than we do of the curve yet we should not end with it nor accept it as a finality neither should we keep the child tied down altogether to the contemplation of such lines there is no need of exhausting all the possibilities of the straight line before beginning work with the curve for sufficient difficulties could be devised with the former to last an indefinite length of time if the child understands the relation of the edge to the solid and of the outline to the body if he is skilled in the use of six to a dozen sticks laid in various positions he can appreciate perfectly the relation of the curved edge or line to the spherical and circular objects which he has seen in the kindergarten he remembers the faces of the cylinder the conversation about spherical and flat rounding objects in his plays with the ball and he has seen the circular as well as square paperfolding he will be accustomed in that to the appearance of the semicircle segment quadrant and sector and will take great delight in cutting and drawing rings and crescents if we open the way for him how we may keep the curve before the childs eye although the gifts from third to ninth illustrate straight lines angles and rectilinear figures yet the occupations present many facilities for keeping the curve before the eye of the child in sewing we introduce curving outlines during the study of the ball and work out a series of objects in the vegetable and animal world in order to vary the mathematical precision of the making of lines angles and geometrical figures as well as to illustrate more fully the spherical form we may also use the circular paperfolding in some simple sequence as early as the childs development will permit and we have of course at the very outset the occupation of modeling which is one of the most valuable of aids in this matter and the stringing of wooden spheres and beads the thread game enters here also and makes a useful supplement to the rings as the wet thread may be pushed while it lies on the surface of the table or slate into numberless different forms all of which may be included under curving outlines in linear drawing we give the child lines running in various directions at the earliest possible time so that he may not grow into a strained and unnatural position of the hand for this constant drawing of the vertical line which is necessary to its execution with perfect precision by the young child limits the freedom of the wrist and muscles and instead of preparing him to write a good hand does absolutely the reverse the various exercises on the other hand in drawing the curves of circle and oval and their combinations are quite perfect preparations for clear graceful penmanship we also have in drawing miss emma marwedels circular system and the outline work performed by means of pasteboard patterns most of which are of the curving outlines of leaves flowers fruits and vegetables when the children can draw quite well from these patterns we always encourage the drawing without them merely looking at the object to be copied these exercises are of the greatest value as connected with modeling when the subjects chosen for invention are comprehended under the sphere prolate and oblate spheroid ovoid cone etc the cube with its straight lines coming last of all in this way while keeping up the regular sequence of lessons and occupations with the straight line we do not debar the child from the contemplation of the line of beauty uniting the straight and curved lines after this he takes great pleasure in uniting the straight and curved lines in his inventions with the sticks and rings given him together and is quite able to use them separately or unitedly in his creative work about this time the fruit of these exercises will begin to appear in his drawing he will attempt to unite his straight lines by curves and even essay large designs in curves which will be far from perfect but nevertheless will not be without their value copying inventions the first trials of this kind may be in copying the inventions in rings which he has made on his table exactly as he previously transferred his stick inventions to the slate the spaces should be just as carefully counted and accuracy expected in preserving the numerical proportions but this needs much tact and patience on the part of the kindergartner as well as skill in teaching for the principles of drawing the curve are much less obvious to the child and much more difficult for him to comprehend than the measurement and calculation of straight lines with their various lengths and inclinations these inventions with rings which are often wonderfully beautiful so beautiful in fact that the uninstructed person is sometimes skeptical as to their production by the children may also be preserved in permanent form by parquetry it is furnished in various colors for this gift as for the seventh and eighth and is greatly enjoyed by the children if any should fear that the long contemplation of rectangular solids planes and straight lines in froebels gifts should tend towards too great rigidity and barrenness of imagination in inventive work it is obviously within our power as has been shown to vary this mathematical exactness which is no doubt less agreeable to the child than the graceful image of his own fancy could he attain it by introducing the curve freely into many of the occupations and exercises with the kindergarten material in general forms of life beauty and knowledge the rings are of course not as well adapted to the production of objects constructed by man as were the sticks but nevertheless the material is not without value in this direction various fruits flowers and leaves may be made as well as such objects as bowls goblets hourglasses baskets and vases when connected with sticks the number of life forms is obviously much increased on account of the union of straight and curved lines thus made possible tablets may also be added and contribute a new element to the possibilities for invention for symmetrical forms however the gift is admirably adapted since the child can hardly put two rings together without producing something pleasing borders enter here in great variety tablets and sticks being added when desirable and the group work forms combining the seventh eighth and ninth gifts give full play to the creative impulses of the child while calling constantly upon those principles of design which he has learned empirically it is true that the child produces forms of beauty with other material also but it is the curved line which offers the strongest inducements to attempt such forms since even the simplest combinations of a small number of semicircles and circles yield figures bearing the stamp of beauty h goldammers the kindergarten page the forms of knowledge which can be made with the ninth gift are necessarily few it is not especially well fitted for number work and development of geometrical form is limited to the planes and lines of the circle wooden rings miss emma marwedel introduced a supplement to the ninth gift in the form of wooden circles and halfcircles in many colors these are much heavier than the metal rings therefore somewhat easier to handle and give as she claims the childs creative powers a much larger field for жsthetic development of course this larger field is to be found in color blending not in beauty of design as the form elements remain the same the bright hues are undoubtedly a great attraction however and perhaps are in line with that return to color which was noted in the seventh gift when the architectural forms were laid aside if we adopt the wooden rings we need not on that account lay aside the metal ones for the two materials may be combined to great advantage difficulties of the gift the gift presents little difficulty the dictations requiring less concentration than heretofore as the positions in which the rings may be placed are few and simple froebels purpose evidently was that the child should now concentrate his activity entirely upon design and that he should use the material by itself and in connection with sticks and tablets to give out in visible form whatever жsthetic impressions he had received through the preceding gifts the office of the kindergartner is hardly now more than to suggest merely to watch the child in his creative work and to advise when necessary as to the most artistic disposition of the simple material she may here if she adopts this attitude have the experience of seeing the direct result of her teachings for the childs work will be a mirror in which she can see reflected her successes or her failures froebels idea the idea of froebel in devising all these gifts was not it seems hardly necessary to say to instruct the child in abstractions which do not properly belong to childhood but to lead him early in life to the practical knowledge of things about him to inculcate the love of industry helpfulness independence of thought and action neatness accuracy economy beauty harmony truth and order the gifts and occupations are only means to a great end and if used in this sense will attain their highest usefulness no dictation with any of the kindergarten materials no study of lines angles oblongs triangles and pentagons no work with numbers either concrete or abstract are fit employments for little children if not connected in every possible way with their home pleasures and the natural objects of their love only when thus connected do they produce real interest only thus can agreement with the childs inner wants be secured actual experiences in the childs life are its most natural and potent teachers we need constantly to remember that the prime value of the kindergarten lies in its personal influence upon individuals and seek to develop each separate member of our class according to his possibilities an objection answered the objection has been made that the study and practice with straight lines angles geometrical forms cubes and other rectangular solids would fit the child for later work in the exact and mathematical sciences more than for other branches of study but yet it is difficult to see how when the childs powers of observation are so carefully trained in every way when he is constantly led to notice objects in nature and reproduce them with clay pencil chalk or needle when these objects are so frequently presented for his critical inspection and comparison when he is led to see in the flowers plants rocks and stars the unity which holds together everything in the universe when beauty and harmony mingled freely constitute the atmosphere of the ideal kindergarten it is difficult indeed to see how he can receive anything but benefit from the gift plays which present at first mainly the straight line seemingly deferring the curve to a later period when it can be managed more

of information of the bureau of education no froebels tenth gift the point the awakening mind of the child is led from the material body and its regular division to the contemplation of the surface from this to the contemplation of the line and to the point made visible friedrich froebel and it is precisely thus that the first artistic work of primeval man occurs he begins by the forming of simple rows as strings of beads or of shells for instance h poesche for the last step in this analysis the child receives small lentil seeds or pebbles concrete points so to speak with which he constructs the most wonderful pictures w n hailmann the point made concrete which forms the tenth and last of froebels gifts is represented by many natural objects by beans lentils pebbles shells leaves and buds of flowers by seeds of various kinds as well as by tiny spheres of clay and bits of wood and cork we have been moving by gradual analysis from the solid through the divided solid the plane and the line and thus have reached in logical sequence the point into a series of which the line may be resolved the point which was visible in the preceding gifts but inseparable from them now in the tenth gift has an existence of its own although it is an imaginary quantity having neither length breadth nor thickness yet it is here illustrated by tangible objects which the child can handle by its very lack of individuality it lends itself to many charming plays and transformations by the use of the point the child learns practically the composition of the line that its direction is determined by two points that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line and that a curved line is one which changes its direction at every point the gift closes the series of objects obtained by analysis from the solid and prepares for the occupations which are developed by synthesis from the point the outlines of all geometrical plane figures both rectilinear and curvilinear may be illustrated with the point as well as straight and curved lines and angles of every degree the law of mediation of contrasts is no longer illustrated in the gift itself but simply governs the use of the material all lines and outlines of planes made with a series of dots show its workings and the symmetrical figures as we have noted from the first owe to it their very existence meetingplace of gifts and occupations when we begin upon a consideration of the tenth gift the last link in the chain of objects which froebel devised to produce an allsided development of the child we see at once that the meetingplace of gift and occupation has been reached the two series are now in fact so nearly one that the point is much more often used for occupation work than as a gift this convergence of the series in regard to their practical use was first noted in the tablets and has grown more and more marked with each succeeding object though the point is in truth the last step which the child takes in the sequence of gifts as he journeys toward the abstract yet we are met at once in practice by the apparently inconsistent fact that it is one of the first presented in the kindergarten this can only be explained by the statement that it is in truth quite as much of an occupation as a gift and is used in the former sense among the childs first workmaterials as a preparation for later pointmaking perforating and as an exercise in eyetraining and accuracy of measurement it is not an occupation of course for the reason that permanent results cannot be produced with it and because no transformation of its material is possible the point as a gift before the child completes his kindergarten course however he should certainly be led to an intellectual perception of the interrelation of the gifts and their gradual development from solid to point for their orderly progression according to law though it be but dimly apprehended will be most useful and strengthening to the mind to discern the logical order of a single series of objects is a step toward the comprehension of worldorder in mature life this comingout of the child from the outer and superficial and his entrance into the inner view of things which because it is inner leads to recognition insight and consciousness this comingout of the child from the houseorder to the higher worldorder makes the boy a scholar friedrich froebel education of man page the mind in later childhood should be what froebel describes his own to have been i often felt he says as if my mind were a smooth still pool scarce a handbreadth over or even a single waterdrop in which surrounding things were clearly mirrored while the blue vault of the sky was seen as well reaching far away and above when the derivation of plane and of straight and curved line and their place in the gifts are clearly understood by the child there will be no difficulty in gaining an equally clear apprehension of the point and its position in the series this may be done somewhat as follows when the children are playing with blocks on some occasion we may direct the conversation to the essential characteristics of the cube its faces edges and corners do they remember which one of their playthings is like the face of the cube do they remember cutting clay tablets from the clay blocks it is most unlikely that this experiment will have been forgotten but if it has been it may be easily repeated speak next of the edges of the cube and let the children recall the derivation of the stick that portion of the cube not yet discussed will now be seized upon by the children and they will ask if any of their playthings are like the cubes corners can they think of anything shall we not try to make something now the clay appears cubes are quickly fashioned and each child is allowed to cut off the eight corners of his block he has no sooner done this than he sees the nearest approach we can make to a point and proceeds to make a design from them while he recalls the beans shells lentils etc he has used before in a similar way it is well here to suggest making the bits of clay into tiny oblate spheroids and laying them away to dry so that we may make a group work invention of them tomorrow better still however is the instant introduction of sticks or wires to connect with the clay points and thus form at once the skeleton of the solid which will give an ineffaceable impression of the relation of point and line to each other pleasure of child in pointlaying and stringing the pleasure the child finds in pointlaying is not confined to the kindergarten for playing with beads and pinheads is an ordinary nursery occupation in all countries and which of us cannot recall long happy hours on the seashore or by the brookside when we gathered and sorted shells and smooth glistening pebbles and laid them in rows and patterns the mere handling of a great store of these gave a midaslike delight and what primitive artistic pleasure we felt as we arranged them according to the principle of repetition to border our gardenbeds or to inclose our miniature parks and playgrounds the same joy is felt in plucking arranging and stringing rosehips the seeds of the ailantus the nasturtium the pumpkin or the cheeses of the mallow and wild geranium miscellaneous materials it will commonly be found that the child enjoys tenfold more the objects for pointwork which he finds himself than the more perfect schoolmaterials imagine the joy for instance of a bevy of kindergarten children set free on pescadero beach california and allowed to ramble up and down its shining sands to pick up the wonderful pescadero pebbles what colors of dull red and amber of pink and palest green what opaline lights and smooth glimmering surfaces busy work with such materials would be worth while indeed yet easy to obtain as they are they are almost never seen in use smooth white pebbles washed entirely clean and sorted according to size are not uncommonly seen in the kindergartens however and are especially useful in the sandtable and if these and the shining creamcolored shells could be found by the children themselves their pleasure in them would be immensely increased that this is true is proved by the experience of many teachers with seedwork one of our own brood of kindergartners once had a birthday melon party for one of her children the melons were brought to the kindergarten room and there divided the small host serving his guests himself great interest was immediately shown in the jetblack seeds of the watermelon in contrast with the smaller lightcolored seeds of the muskmelon and unanimous appeals were made to the kindergartner that they might be saved and used for inventions this was done and they were always called for afterwards in pointwork rather than the beans or vegetable and wooden lentils in those kindergartens where the seeds of all fruits are saved by the children at lunch hour it is also noted that the collection thus made is always the object of universal interest and preference use of the gift one of the first uses of the point may be in following the outline of some form of life which the kindergartner has drawn in white or colored chalk on the childs table this is much more fascinating work than the placing of seeds one space apart three in a row etc for the latter belongs to the knowledgeacquiring side of the game which as froebel says is the quickly tiring side only to be given quite casually at first and as chance may provide suitable openings for it the forms drawn in chalk may very well be of curving outlines of vegetables fruits leaves and flowers to connect with the study of the first gift and may include any other simple appropriate object which the kindergartner is capable of drawing the more advanced child can of course make his own life forms without the aid of drawing and if he is given different sizes and kinds of shells seeds or pebbles often arranges them with great ability to imitate the shading of the object the beginning of the forms of knowledge is in placing the points in regular order on the squared tables at the intersection of vertical and horizontal lines next the child lays one space vertical lines three points in a line then two space lines with five points then horizontal lines angles parallelograms borders etc following out the school of linear drawing and in this way progresses in an orderly manner to the designing of symmetrical forms curved lines of course are quite as easily represented as the straight and really beautiful designs are often made by the children with them tenth gift parquetry tiny circles and squares of colored paper corresponding to the wooden lentils are also to be had with this gift and afford a means of preserving the designs in permanent form they are so small however as to give occasion for considerable patience in pasting them and are rather difficult to arrange with regularity without first drawing the design it is doubtful in our opinion if they may be considered to be of any particular educational benefit if indeed they are not a positive harm to the child in that they require a too minute and longsustained use of the finer muscles objections to the gift these strictures on the tenth gift parquetry bring us naturally to the criticisms lately made by eminent authorities upon some of the froebel materials the objection that many of them require too minute handling and too close attention on the part of children of the kindergarten age seems as far as the gifts are concerned to hold especial weight in regard to pointwork the development of motorability in children and its furtherance or arrest by the kindergarten materials concerns the occupations more particularly and as such will receive full consideration in a later volume we need not consider here the physiopsychological tests lately made of the early motorability of children and the results which these have shown but simply concern ourselves with what we have seen and noted many times in daily kindergarten practice is it not true that the laying of beans and lentils one inch apart on the tables for instance is an occupation which requires very delicate handling on account of the smallness of the object its easy mobility and the exactness required to place it precisely at the crossingpoint of vertical and horizontal lines is it not true that such work requires considerable effort from the kindergartner to make it interesting to the child is it not true that there is a cramp of the fingers shown by a slight trembling in getting hold of the tiny object and placing it a cramp of the eye in foreseeing and following the movement and a cramp of the body accompanying the tension of hand and arm if all these observations are correct or measurably so if they hold with a majority of children then pointlaying as an occupation clearly needs considerable modification in the kindergarten what are then the objections to the point as illustrated in bean coffeeberry seed and wooden lentil in a word that when represented as above it becomes too small and too mobile the difficulty of using these materials is immensely increased by the fact that a slight movement of the childs table will send them all on the floor while even an illtimed cough or sneeze or puff of wind will blow them out of position pointlaying is quite difficult enough for the childs small powers under the best conditions and need not be made more so by undue mobility in the materials with which it is carried on this criticism would not hold of course as against large shells or pebbles or as against miss marwedels hemispheres and ellipsoids how these objections may be obviated the only good reason for using the small materials to which the preceding objections have been made is a very good one viz that if we are to take any concrete object to represent the point it should be as small as possible since the point is in reality an intangible something having no one of the three dimensions this reasoning seems to be logical enough and it is surely equally so to insist that the child shall at some time derive his own points from the cube and make them as small as possible that he may the better understand their relation to line plane and solid when once this relation is understood however and before it is suggested to his mind why may he not use the larger materials even though they do not illustrate the point as perfectly any lack in perfect representation would probably be more than compensated by the removal of the strain on the accessory muscles and the gain in artistic development this latter point indeed needs special consideration for there seems no doubt that the continued use of such small objects for design leads to accuracy and prettiness rather than breadth and power the marwedel materials if we throw out all the smaller materials used for pointlaying and it seems advisable so to do we still have left smooth pebbles from one half to three fourths of an inch in diameter and shells of any univalve such as the moneycowry cyproea moneta these should be polished as free from convolutions as possible and not less than half an inch in diameter to these we may add miss emma marwedels wooden ellipsoids and hemispheres already mentioned which are satisfactory in size and add the delights of color marwedels materials for childculture d c heath co the hemispheres which are about one half inch in diameter come in eight colors and also in the natural wood are pierced for stringing and are similar to ordinary buttonmoulds having of course one flat side the ellipsoids in the six rainbow hues black gray brown and wood colors resemble elliptical shells having one flat side are also pierced for stringing and vary in length from three fourths of to something over an inch being nearly an inch wide perhaps and a half inch thick the children are invariably delighted with both hemispheres and ellipsoids and need no stimulus from the kindergartner in their use mindpictures in some of miss marwedels pamphlets on the use of these materials she speaks of the mindpictures which can be made with them and which are of course quite possible with any of the other gifts these mindpictures showing form and number groups are drawn by the kindergartner on the blackboard where they are left a second and then erased they are then copied from memory and the results compared described and criticised by the children this constitutes a valuable mental exercise and if the tests are simple at first and made gradually more difficult will be most valuable in increasing the memoryspan as well as in developing language power abuse of the gift if some of the materials used in the kindergarten are unwisely chosen and if this objection applies in the gifts especially to the point then the kindergartner has been and still is unnecessarily increasing her sum of error for no one of the connected series of objects save the stick is commonly so forced upon the child it is somewhat unusual for this reason to find a whole class of children really enjoying pointwork though several conscientious and industrious members of the group may be toiling away with praiseworthy diligence sometimes the childrens feeling toward the gift goes beyond indifference and passes into active dislike but in either attitude of mind the beans lentils etc are likely to be mistreated it is not that the work with them is not in itself pleasing to the child but that it has been forced upon him ad nauseam and that the kindergartner has lacked interest in presenting it his own interest has in consequence gradually died out and when once the fire is cold who shall light it again that there is no need of this abuse of the gift is clear enough and it can only come from entire lack of originality in using froebels materials or from a mental or physical inertia on the part of the kindergartner which causes her to prefer giving out such work as needs neither preparation nor previous thought readings for the student kindergarten guide

series of talks upon froebels gifts and look back over the ground that has been covered we see that a number of important subjects have been only lightly touched upon while we have been altogether silent regarding others equally as vital this is doubtless inevitable in any work upon the kindergarten which does not aim to be encyclopжdic in character but a few of the more serious omissions may be supplied before we close our consideration of the gifts and enter upon that of the occupations first then a word on the subject of attention difficulty of holding childs attention it is not uncommon when discussing any exercises with kindergarten materials which require dictation or guidance to hear complaints of the difficulty of holding the childrens attention it may generally be said doubtless that when little children fail to give attention it is because they are not interested and if the teacher finds the majority of her pupils listless indifferent and vagrantminded she may reasonably conclude that something is amiss either with the subject or with her presentation of it the child is as yet too young to command his mental powers and drive himself on by his own selfdetermination and if we enforce an attention which he gives through fear we lose the motive power of interest which froebel sought to utilize in the plays of the kindergarten dr george p brown in a late article on metaphysics and pedagogics says every one admits that there is much that must be done by the child in his elementary education which is a task for the reason that his ideas of its worth to himself cannot be sufficiently appreciated to arouse a lively and impelling interest in the doing of it and he adds garfield once complained that he had done so long those things in which he was interested that he was losing his power to do that which did not interest him which suggests the danger of relying entirely upon interest as an incentive to learn public school journal july that there is a danger here cannot be denied but it is one which need hardly be considered at the kindergarten age when that interest which comes from continued agreement between the work in hand and the childs inner wants is absolutely essential to the gaining of knowledge mr w n hailmann puts the whole matter in a nutshell when he says if the kindergartner has the penetration to discover these inner wants and the skill to adapt the circumstances and her own purposes to these she will find it easy to secure and hold the childs attention without this penetration and skill all else is unavailing she may sing and cajole herself into hoarseness she may smile and gesticulate herself into a mild sort of tarantism or freeze herself at one end of the table into a statue of suppressed reproach if the instruction or dictation has no natural connection with the purposes of the children these will remain uninterested or bored victims of her illdirected enthusiasm language teaching the plays with the gifts open wide avenues for language teaching if conducted as froebel intended he says many wise things on this subject in his education of man and the following is of absolute application our children will attain he says to a far more fundamental insight into language if we when teaching them connect the words more with the actual perception of the thing and the object our language would then again become a true language of life that is born of life and producing life while it threatens otherwise by merely outward consideration to become more and more dead education of man page from the first the child should be led to voice his small observations on the gifts in clear language and in approximately complete sentences brief though they be he can as easily say i would like a blue ball please if asked what color he prefers as to jerk out a monosyllabic blue after a little practice he will use a short sentence when comparing two objects for instance but as he naturally moves along the line of least resistance it is hardly to be expected that he will take the trouble to form complete sentences unless gently stimulated to do so the stimulus must be gentle however and given at the right time for any feeling that his words are criticised will lead him to selfrepression not expression in gift work too he explains to the kindergartner what he is inventing and for what purpose he weaves gossamer threads of fancy about the objects constructed or describes the forms of beauty and knowledge he has built by dictation there is and should be constant interchange of conversation during the gift plays and the kindergartner who directs them like a drillsergeant requiring her recruits only to be silent and obey has entirely misconceived froebels idea it is a difficult thing to find the via media between complete silence on the part of the children save when answering questions and a confusion of tongues like that at the building of babel but there is such a via media and it can be found by those who seek it diligently it is undeniably much easier for the teacher to do all the talking the children serving as audience but the ideal to be reached is that she shall be the audience herself or rather the chairman of the meeting guiding the conversation asking suggestive questions and making wise comments our language teaching however is not confined to the cultivation of greater powers of expression for there is a direct gain in the childs vocabulary consequent upon his kindergarten experience he absorbs many new words from his teachers but many others he learns through his daily work and play and these are his absolute possession the thing and the word together an interesting series of experiments was once made in the san francisco free kindergartens relative to the number of new words which the child had mastered and used easily and freely after three years in the childgarden these included terms of dictation geometrical terms names of tools colors materials plants animals buildings and places new and poetic words of songs games and stories etc and the experiments established the fact that the childs vocabulary was fully as great as that of his parents and decidedly more choice relation of word to object it should be said here that there is great value to the child in learning to name things correctly from the very beginning if the new word is a simple one he can learn it with perfect ease and then the object is properly labeled so to speak for future use familiar names are sometimes used in the kindergarten when the correct term would be quite as easy to pronounce this practice often arises from a false conception of symbolism and is continued with an idea that it is pleasing to the child sometimes the pseudonyms are absolutely misleading as in the frequent speaking of squares as boxes which must of course confuse the child as to the real nature of a plane there are many cases where the geometrical name of a form can easily be taught if it is given after the object is clearly understood at all stages of learning the mother tongue the purely verbal exercises are more or less accompanied with the occupation of the mind upon things if we suppose the child to become acquainted in the first instance with a variety of objects the imparting of the names is a welcome operation and the mental fusion of each name and thing is rapidly brought about if the objects are in any way interesting if they arouse or excite attention their names are eagerly embraced on the other hand if objects are but languidly cared for or if they are inconspicuous or confused with other things we are indifferent both to the things themselves and to their designations alexander bain language is the necessary tool of thought used in the conduct of the analysis and synthesis of investigation w t harris what we are really seeking is the meaning and the word one is of no value without the other in the education of the child there is no such thing as a valuable observation and investigation of natural objects without language in which to embody the results at every step geo p brown report on correlation of studies by committee of fifteen with annotations by geo p brown there is a distinction here as to age which should be noted though with babies of three years it is not only delightful but necessary to use objects symbolically to give playnames to the lines they make etc with older children who are nearing the age of school instruction and therefore passing away from the sense relations of things it is just as essential to begin a more scientific nomenclature value of knowledge gained by individual effort one of the commonest errors in the kindergarten as well as one of the most pernicious is that of assisting the child too much in all his work this is perhaps more universally true of the plays with the occupations than with the gifts but even in the latter direction the practice is far too widespread of course there is great difference between the disciplinary value of that study in which the pupil solves his own difficulties and that teaching in which the teacher accompanies the pupil supplying the needed information or suggestion at every step of his progress the latter is not worth much for character building for the reason that it is not apt to become a part of the organized self the school cannot afford to expend much energy in acquiring such knowledge geo p brown report on correlation of studies by committee of fifteen with annotations by geo p brown the kindergartner often forms his sentences for the child overdirects him when he is matching colors gives names to the objects he constructs without waiting for him to do so moves his blocks sticks tablets rings into more accurate position changes his spacing when incorrect rearranges his inventions selects the colors for his parquetry work and all for what reasons primarily to produce a better effect it is probable glorying in the consciousness that the work on every childs table is exactly right and blind to the truth that uniformity must always be mechanical and secondarily to quiet her own feeling of impatience which sometimes comes from nervous exhaustion and sometimes from an overeagerness to get a quantity of work done regardless of the method by which it is obtained there is a thirdly too which is that the inaccurate work the awkward designs the unfortunate blending of colors which the little one inevitably makes at first so offend her artistic eye that she trembles with eagerness to set them right forgetting that by so doing she is imposing her superior taste upon the child and thereby failing to develop his we shall never see this matter clearly nor know how to bear with the crudity of the childs work until we learn that the crudity is natural and therefore to be respected and that it is in a sense beautiful after all for it is a stage of being this vice for it is a vice of assisting the child too much causes him to lose his own power of bravely and persistently overcoming difficulties and makes him weak and dependent it gives occasion for teachers to say and apparently with justice that kindergarten children need constant assistance in their school work that they are always crying out for help and seem incapable of taking a step alone that this is not true of all kindergarten children we know but that it should be true of any is a disgrace to our interpretation of froebels system which is in reality a very treasurehouse of selfreliance of selfdevelopment and of independence of thought and action value of interrelation in kindergarten work one of the highest essentials of gift work is that it should not be isolated from other experiences of the child and concern itself merely with first principles of mathematics with elements of construction reproduction and design and with unrelated bits of knowledge froebel says in the motto to one of the poems in the mutterspiel und koselieder whatever singly with a child youve played weave it together till a whole youve made thus it will dawn upon his childish soul the smallest thing belongs to some great whole and again silently cherish your babys dim thought that life in itself is as unity wrought nothing is more evident in all his writings in his more formal works as well as in his autobiography his volumes of letters and his reminiscences than that his lifelong struggle was for unity in all things he would have this unity expressed in simple concrete form in the kindergarten by a complete interrelation of all the activities of the child and the gifts as outward representations of his internal mental world may be trusted to furnish us with an absolute test as to how far we are carrying out this principle in our teaching whether or not the necessity of correlation decreases as age increases we need not discuss here but that there is absolute need of it in the kindergarten probably no one will deny if a single aim does not unify the kindergarten day or month or season it will be a succession of scrappy experiences of surface impressions no one of which can be permanent because it was slight by itself and received no reinforcement from others such instruction only serves to dissipate the mind to blot out the dim feeling of unity inscribed there by its maker and to render the child incapable and undesirous of binding his thoughts into a whole in the broad view we are safe in affirming that all truth is congruous and that truth in one department of human knowledge will always reinforce truth in any other department there is a unity in all truth while it is true as dr harris affirms in his report on the correlation of studies that the student does not come into the full consciousness of this fact before he attains the university is it not also true that he can be so taught that he will feel this unity before he can think it and that his feeling it will hasten the development of the power to think it geo p brown congruence in teaching public school journal sept what the subjects should be around which the childs mental physical and spiritual activities may crystallize furnishes a fruitful field for discussion but above all they should be vital ones for as miss blow says serious injury may be done the mind by developing concentric exercises which belong not to the centre but the circumference of thought it would be fruitless to suggest suitable subjects here for if they do not on the one hand conform to the growing mind of the particular child or class of children they may either arrest or overtax development and if on the other hand they do not proceed from the kindergartners insight into principle it would be but superstitious imitation for her to follow them out no manual no guidebook no treatise no lecture can supply the want of fine intelligence and judgment in all these matters and not until the teacher comprehends the genesis of any principle from deeper principles can she emancipate herself from even the hypnotic suggestion of the principle itself and convert external authority into inward freedom w t harris effect of froebels gifts on the kindergartner although uninterested and uninitiated persons doubtless regard the various gifts of froebel as very ordinary objects made from commonplace materials yet that this view of the matter is only a peep through a pinhole is abundantly proven by their effect on the kindergartner those of us who have seen successive groups of young women in trainingclasses approach the first few gifts have noted that interest is commonly mingled at first with a slight surprise that the objects should be considered worthy of so much study while underneath lies a halfconcealed amusement at the simple forms produced yet this attitude of mind endures but for a season for as soon as the gifts are studied and used practically it is seen that they contain possibilities of indefinite expansion when they are looked at through the glasses of imagination it is wonderful how large they appear and when one has toiled long hours to invent some sequence with them one wonders at the reality and fascination of the forms produced the outsider who glanced at the materials hastily would undoubtedly suppose them capable of only a limited number of changes and combinations but the fact remains that every year kindergarten students invent hundreds of new forms with these simple insignificant blocks and sticks and beans how then does this change come about how is it that the same student who once halfscorned the gifts now upon the completion of her course of training looks upon them with affection admiration and respect it is that her eyes have been opened and whereas she was blind now she sees her imagination has been awakened her literary instinct has been stirred and she has come to look at things in the child way which is always the poetic way effect of froebels gifts upon the child the effect of froebels gifts upon the child has been shown directly and indirectly through the entire series of talks and need not now be recapitulated if they are wisely presented and wisely conducted inward and outward the limits of their influence and scope lie in infinity froebel says in one of his letters no one would believe without seeing it how the childsoul the childlife develops when treated as a whole and in the sense of forming a part of the great connected life of the world by some skilled kindergartner nay even by one who is only simplehearted thoughtful and attentive nor how it blooms into delicious harmonies like a beautifully tinted flower oh if i could only shout aloud with ten thousand lungpower the truth that i now tell you in silence then would i make the ears of a hundred thousand men ring with it what keenness of sensation what a soul what a mind what force of will and active energy what dexterity and skill of muscular movement and of perception and what calm and patience will not all these things call out in the children froebels letters on the kindergarten page it is not that we regard the connected series of gifts as inspired nor as incapable of improvement for it may be that as our psychological observations of children grow wiser more sympathetic and more subtle we shall see cause to make radical changes in the objects which are froebels legacy to the kindergarten this we may do but we can never improve upon the motherly tenderness of spirit with which they were devised by the great pioneer of childstudy nor upon the philosophic insight which based them on the universal instincts of childhood by mrs wiggin the birds christmas carol illustrated square mo boards cents the
