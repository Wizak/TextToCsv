dead white wulff a continuing adventure of the colorblind detective by bill capron when someone says rods and cones most people think of fishing and ice cream for me rods and cones are the central focal point of my being or more correctly their lack thereof in some ways its like being black it infuses everything i do every place i go when someone says they love the changing colors of the leaves the green of the grass the red of the cardinal i am flooded with a sense of differentness something that makes me abnormal in a normal colored world black white and gray all i need to function well in my world or any world from where i stand color seems more like a defect of sight clouding out the very purpose of the eye to see whats going on still a person didnt need to be colorblind to see what was happening at streamside on that chilly june morning in southwest washington i was knee deep in canyon creek stalking the rainbow trout so named because its sides bore the layered grays of the rainbow the season was just a few days old and the stream was high with snow melt from mt st helens and would be until midjuly although the stream had been stocked five miles up those fish had not made their way to the lower stretch yet so i was fishing last years survivors and a small number of native fish that made their way up from yale reservoir to feed in the cold fast waters it was nearing noon and id had a great morning catching and releasing twenty trout two over fifteen inches i used a fly of my own invention a whitegray elkhair caddis with squared off sponge wings visible in the whitest water and it wouldnt sink i like to be able to see the fish take the fly the excitement is in the strike the flash of the tail the boil of the water bringing the fish in is almost anticlimactic still my friends would tell me it wasnt a dry caddis time of day or year but i believe that trout are at the bottom of the food chain for a reason so i use whatever fishing wiles i have to convince them that caddis is the fly de jour i was fifteen the last time i was skunked on a stream with a caddis i dont ever expect it to happen again when youre fishing in high water you have to keep an eye out for debris in the current i was once hit in the back of the legs by a log and thrown into a pool where all that money id saved on swimming lessons almost cost me my life so i was on the lookout when i saw the shape roll through the stretch of white water above me i moved myself out of the current and kept casting until it entered my field of vision i splashed out hip deep and pulled the body to the shore his waders were filled with water but drowning wasnt the problem it was the bullet hole in the head thatd done him in there wasnt any blood the water had washed the wound clean leaving a gray slightly lighter than his skin there were black grains stuck in his skin around the hole so the gun hadnt been more than a foot away and it must have been a jacketed slug since the exit wound hadnt taken the back of his head off i turned his body on its back then touched the white winged royal wulff stuck in his lip it was a poorly tied fly not like some amateur but intentionally bad workmanship like some kind of affront to the dead fisherman i used my handkerchief to pull the fly box out of his jacket then popped it open the fly in his lip didnt come from the box which contained the ultimate examples of a tiers art an assortment of sizes and types arranged by shades of black white and gray in showman fashion almost too beautiful to spend on a fish there was a clap of thunder overhead rain would not be far behind i slogged against the current to find where hed been killed before all the clues were washed away it was only a half mile up under the bridge on an easy stream access hed looked to be in his late sixties not in the shape for the more strenuous accesses downstream his rig was resting half in the water a fine winston rod with a handtooled stratos reel i pulled in the line he was fishing with dark gray nymphs there was a half eaten hersheys special dark chocolate bar in the rocks his fullsized dodge four wheel truck was parked with the doors locked there were no other footprints in the muddy soil but the tops of the rocks crossing the stream were marked with wet mud i took the same route over the rushing water then climbed a precariously steep path up to the road the tire marks were more than a foot wide from one of those jackedup fourwheeling suvs there were two sets of foot prints one from a man with sized twelve or larger felt bottomed boots still substantially smaller than my sixteen the other a woman in street shoes i made my way back to the body and looked for his wallet it was in his fishing jacket dry in a plastic baggy i left it there since that might be more tampering than the police would condone gripping the dark gray and white fly in his mouth i pulled down on the dead mans lower lip there was still black chocolate between his teeth i scurried up the hill accompanied by thunder but still no rain i drove to the local store at the tee in the road a last outpost in the middle of nowhere or what used to be nowhere but clark county was growing and even nowhere was getting pretty crowded farms were being sold and grand homes raised in their stead it was just the way it was there were never fewer people fewer homes fewer cars fewer fishermen i didnt like it but im not one of those people who think they should blockade the state once im in still its tough sharing sometimes and a resource like canyon creek would soon become a recreational haven no longer extending its welcoming silence to fishermen with all the people came crime and cops i dont know how close the nearest county cop was what with the new community policing they might be as close as amboy i dialed and told the dispatcher my story she said two officers were out my way dealing with an accidental shooting in yacolt and would be there in fifteen minutes i walked back into the gas station store which over the last decade had grown in little leaps each year in response to the increasing traffic north to fishing hunting and general recreation on the reservoirs of the north fork lewis as well as increasing local traffic it was one step up from convenience store and one giant leap short of a super market but in its small community it was the prime gathering place for local teenagers they sat outside with their cokes a couple at the end smoking a joint and inside six of them were gathered around a video game their vulgar language a sharp contrast to my boyhood experience the owner a balding giant of a man boomed aggressively pipe it down back there and there was silence i bought a coffee and doughnut then went outside dropped the tailgate of my truck and sat to wait for the cops a sign on the store said logging dollars at work tum tum mountain was off to my left dominating the sky with its weyerhaeuser delivered mohawk haircut a sign of mans greed to some but a justifiable use of valuable renewable resources to me this was logging country and over the last twenty years a lot of trees had been taken ending a long drought from the yacolt fire in that burned everything from yacolt to twenty miles north in cougar long before yale reservoir became a man made fire break two extended cab trucks of loggers skidded to a stop in the dirt park and ride on the other side of the street they tossed their saws and lunchboxes into their old trucks and cars rednecks all much more romantic from a distance than in real life just like most of us their vehicles tore out of the lot leaving a dissipating memory of their presence in the dust home to wives and children some waiting in anticipation some in fear most not giving it any thought id worked as a logger once for twentytwo days while i was on summer break from college the work was too hard to just be called tough and i had to get out some of these men had done if for forty years theyd earned my wonder if not my respect the siren cut through the countryside like the noise pollution it was and all heads turned the store clerk came out as the black and white skidded to a stop behind my truck both officers were in light gray uniforms and that was about as close as they got to sharing anything he was driving maybe thirtyfive pot belly blotchy face with a big veined nose and thick dark gray lips uniform wrinkled and dirty very unappealing now next to him was another story she was in her late twenties or a little older fivetwo coal black hair with almost transparent gray eyes her nose turned up a bit and her lips wore an enigmatic smile that seemed to be apologizing for her partner before he said anything the very first words out of his mouth i kid you not were im sergeant willis and im in charge here i didnt blink but instead kept my eyes on the obvious brains of the outfit she rolled her eyes but held her tongue i raised my hand and said officer im the one who phoned so whats your name i gave it to him and he threw over his shoulder jackson check this guy in the computer she sat down and started working i said maybe we should get to the crime scene before it starts raining officer he gave me an official stare when im ready when im ready without turning his head he asked anything on this guy jackson yelled yeah hes a private detective licensed in oregon and washington i think he has a good idea we should get to the scene right now the fat cop ignored her so what are you doing here mister deetective i got a little sarcastic i was fishing what does it look like i spread my vest and shrugged my shoulders he started to move towards me dont get snippy with me jerk i got in his face im a witness officer so you watch your lip or im not going to tell you a thing i cut off his interruption with ill get back on the phone and tell them i need a cop without an asshole for a mouth you dont think so you just push my buttons one more time jerkwater and well wait for a real cop he was speechless but what could he do hed offended a willing witness then tried to brow beat him all in one short minute and now he had nowhere else to go jackson took the steam out of the moment she told me lead the way well be right behind you willis gave me a hard stare then got behind the wheel he backed up and gave me just enough room to pull out then tailgated me the three miles to the stream the half mile hike down the canyon left him huffing and puffing and the dirty knees marked two falls on the slippery trail i sat back while he examined the body jackson took notes as he spoke he wouldnt condescend to ask me what i might think deciding instead to interrogate me as a suspect i said look officer you can question me at the station right now shouldnt you be finding out where he was killed even his irritability couldnt hide the ignorance what do you mean i put on my third grade teacher hat well he was drifting downstream and i pulled him out hes obviously old so hed need an easy access probably upstream a half mile jackson said how do we get there its a little treacherous but we can go along the stream lets go was the sergeants gruff reply jackson interrupted what about a wallet she reached a gloved hand into the lower pocket on his fishing vest she pulled the ziplock open and read to no one in particular she asked dan cobin sounds familiar she looked up at me every heard of him i said yes hes a pretty famous fly tier here abouts willis turned on me so you know him no i dont know him i just know of him he cracked wise while jackson covered the body with the navy gray tarp shed carried down with her suddenly the skies opened up and the rain came down i led them slowly across the rocks until we found cobins rod and truck the footprints were washed off the rocks as were mine to his truck and for sure the tire tracks on the other side of the stream i was at a decision point tell them id already been there and what id learned put up with more threats from a cop i didnt like i just kept it to myself a person cant know what its like to waste time until theyve spent it in a police station because they did the right thing they ran me through my statement four times with a halfhour or more cooling my heels between each twice i felt like a suspect when bad cop willis lead the interrogation the other two times like a witness with good cop jackson i stuck to my story and by the end of the day i thought they might actually have believed me being in the station can be pretty informative and i learned just eavesdropping that the body had been taken to the morgue and that the wife had been located and had identified it as dan cobin also she would be in the station at seven that night when deputy jackson said i could go i told her i was hungry and asked if she wanted to have a bite to eat she said okay that she was through for the day what you dont get in on the interrogation of mrs cobin her smile was wan hey im at the bottom of the list here willis will take all the credit and if anything was forgotten ill take the blame thats how it works just part of putting in your time anyway they needed me to butter you up and when i didnt get that done my services such as they were were over i laughed i trust you wont be like sergeant willis when you grow up she shook her head well if it makes you feel any better i thought you did a great job of buttering me up usually the good cop doesnt look so good her face clouded but the embarrassed smile was genuine i think you were the only bright spot in my day we walked a hundred yards to the subway ordered then sat down with our turkey sandwiches learn anything important about cobin today i asked she shook her head little hard to do considering you were the only witness we spoke to took a while to find the wife then wistfully shes coming in tonight i might go back and listen in willis wont like it but what the hell there was a slight tinge of bitterness but she got by it she focused her light eyes on mine a knowing look so did you tell us everything i took a deep breath then decided i told you all the news thats fit to print if i learn anything else though youll be the first to know she warned youre on pretty thin ice without a client i shrugged my life is thin ice officer so whats the sergeant got against me her laugh caught us both unexpectedly youll never believe it she looked around like she was conveying a wellkept secret hes a bait fisherman and he thinks you fly guys look down at him i smiled we do i liked her a lot so what do they call you outside of work you can call me windy strange name she explained not for the first time sixties generation hippie parents its short for winsome like somehow my name will affect my future not so strange youre not a bertha or maude id say windy is winsome she laughed but didnt say anything i filled the void so how did windy get into law enforcement she leaned her elbows on the table and sipped her lemonade after getting dehippyized my dad became a cop down in la he got caught up with some ethical problems and retired early but he was a good cop and he pushed me albeit willingly in that direction he instilled in me a sense of justice something i need every day to sort of blank out what im learning from willis cant get a different assignment her smile was crooked knowing i could but itd be the end of any real career opportunities whos going to promote a cop who cant stand the heat of a bad partner i think the brass knows im good willis is sort of a trial dont worry about me im tougher than i look i bet you are i kept my eyes on hers and reached across the table to wipe the mustard from the corner of her mouth she fidgeted a little then asked so much for why im in law enforcement what about you i leaned forward steepled my fingers and set my chin at the point im in it to do good deeds she laughed i know it sounds corny but that doesnt make it less real i was in business for years and pretty good at it but something was missing id see injustice all around me and there wasnt a thing i could do about it just rail at the television so i quit that life and became a pi the dedicated servant to justice you found justice lone ranger she asked through narrowed eyes i thought hard about whether what i found was justice then nodded my head yes ive found justice but too often its not connected to the law she frowned at that i make justice happen no thats not it i let justice happen sometimes i create situations where if what i believe is true justice finds her own way exacts her own punishment the question was begged ah so justice is a woman maybe especially when vengeance is needed then justice is a woman does this describe how you feel about women the look on her face was expectant no its how i feel about justice so windy how do you feel about justice she shook her head the short black hair a half beat behind im not in the justice business ive finally reconciled to that but if i do my job right the chances of justice happening as you say are much better she crumbled up her wrapper and we stood i said id like to get a chance to continue this conversation sometime if you dont mind she said i think id like that lone ranger then she was gone i waited outside the police station i figured mrs cobin was still there because the license plate on the suv outside was flytyer at eightthirty willis showed her out of the station and walked with her to the vehicle a wide smile on his face what did she have that i didnt sure she was tall handsome less than half the age of her husband but except for my age so was i well maybe not that handsome she was a knockout even from a hundred feet the sad smile on her face looked a little too practiced for me i held a finger up covering her lips and it looked like her eyes were smiling as the sergeant tapped her hood twice i saw it wasnt her lips he was looking at she backed up then waved before moving forward the fat cop waved his eyes following her as she drove away i didnt start my engine until he was back in the station then i broke the speed limit to catch her before she got onto north she left the highway in woodland and drove to one of the new homes above the town on the south side of the lewis river only twenty minutes from where he died as she neared the front door she tossed her keys into the air and grabbed them in what could only be described as a joyful leap i pulled my stakeout kit from the back compartment of my truck and ate some jerky washing it down with a diet coke i used my cellphone to call a good friend whod been involved with fishing organizations in washington since he was a child in the second world war he told me hed known cobin for more than forty years and throughout that time theyd been on opposite sides of the logging issue my friend one of the first environmental wackos was against logging cobin owned pieces in three logging companies and was all for it for that reason he was a pariah to much of the fishing community but there was no denying his artistry even people who hated him coveted his fly collections but for most common people the price was just too dear so the flies were gobbled up by celebrity fisherman for prices totally separated from reality considering the use of the product four years earlier cobin was diagnosed with parkinsons and though the rich and famous didnt know it his flies were tied by a talented he mentioned that she was sinfully young girl who last year became his wife i waited only a halfhour before she came running out of the house ample breasts jiggling loosely in an earth in the lurch teeshirt she pulled on a sweatshirt against the night chill she backed out into the street and left a little rubber as she changed directions she turned back towards the highway but made the right hand turn for the road on the north side of the lewis she was in a rush and i tested the envelope of my topheavy truck as she sped around the curvy road in her lower suv she made the right hand turn at jacks onto south two miles later she turned into a long driveway a lit up cabin was set well back in the woods it was dark so i parked on the other side of the road and made my way carefully down the rutted driveway there was a raised up toyota pickup with super large tires parked at the front door mrs cobin had parked right up against it the bumper sticker on the truck said fly fishermen catch the best girls with any luck that might prove to be true for me i noted the earth first logo in the back window i edged closer to the window which was opened a crack i heard the sounds of sex no small talk pillow talk just panting and moaning then it was over the female voice asked when do you have to leave i could hear clothes being pulled on im going right now diane ill learn about the death tomorrow morning and ill be on an airplane back by noon kiss me goodbye there was a smacking then she asked was it worth it jack i could hear hatred in his voice of course it was worth it what were you going to do go on making love to that old fart until he died anyway were rich and the devil is dead another smack of lips then he said no diane i have to go now noooooo okay twenty minutes later he was out the door a goodlooking man of thirty or so tall lean dark hair large nose but it matched a wide mouth she wasnt more than ten minutes behind him she locked the door behind her i waited ten minutes just in case either of them forgot something and returned i pushed open an unlocked window and entered the one room cabin i turned on the light in the center was a potbellied stove still warm the bed was against the windowless north wall it still smelled of sex there was a small dinette table in an efficient kitchen area i opened the door to a fairly modern bathroom set on the northwest corner of the structure the southwest corner behind the picture window overlooking merwyn reservoir where the lewis river entered it was an elaborate fly tying table in the vise was an incomplete totally unusable royal wulff on the wall was a foam bar about three feet long with more royal wulffs each with a date beneath it each a little worse than the one before dan cobin was using the wulffs to track the progress of his disease to make real his failing functions the fly from three months earlier had been removed from the foam i knew where it was now in a drawer was a smith wessen and the smell of cordite there was a picture of his new wife diane pinned to the wall and just below it a picture of the dead man with a pretty woman both about forty at the time a young boy stood between them a young boy who believed fly fishermen catch the best women i started the long ride home as soon as i got into cellphone range i called my fishing friend again i had some more questions and he knew the answers cobin hadnt talked with his son in ten years or more likely it was the other way around they just never got along and cobin wasnt such an easy guy to get along with anyway unfriendly irascible any word you wanted to describe it but father and son parted on more than a general disagreement seems the boy jack saw the light environmentally that is he was against cutting trees his father made his fortune from it he was against hunting and guns his father when he couldnt use a rod used a rifle about all they shared was a love for fishing so for about a year they fought then jack joined earth first and the old man blew up they hadnt talked since though my friend had known cobin forty years he didnt know about the cabin my guess was no one else did either after i hung up i dialed windy jacksons number she picked up on the fourth ring sleep clogged her voice i told her it was me and she asked why i was calling not without some irritability of her own i said look windy tomorrow youre going to find out that cobins son is flying in she made a comment and i answered i dont know where from hes going to fly in and meet with your sergeant when he leaves youre going to follow him on your own dont tell willis just take off call me on my cellphone i read her my number ill find a way to intercept you why should i do that she asked because you trust me i heard a sharp intake of breath and because i dont want that ass willis getting the collar thats not right she argued windy im looking for justice and youre just going to have to take it on my terms i hung up i picked up the phone and said hello hi its me windy the son got in at noon and spent an hour with willis then the wife picked him up outside the station ive been behind them ever since and from here they seem a bit chummy were heading north on five im at the fairgrounds chummy officer jackson what would they be doing if they were friendly you dont want to know was all she said im parked at the am pm in woodland just right after the exit shell be getting off there ill be standing by the road just slow down if she doesnt get off call me again she pulled over in a little dark gray miata and i shoe horned myself into the front seat you must only date short guys i said she chuckled i usually let them drive its less intimidating you dont seem to intimidate so easily an outright laugh i meant them less intimidating to them i commented doesnt look like shes taking him home she gave me a confused look home was the right turn but were going straight to the cabin what cabin so i caught her uptodate as she kept dianes suv in sight her face made plain her feelings and i could tell she wasnt all that grateful she blurted i should tell willis why so he can take credit for cracking the case i touched her shoulder i broke the case and im giving it to you not willis thats justice officer jackson i wont take credit for someone elses work there was a harsh note of finality i shrugged then tell them you got it working with me that i wouldnt work with willis its even true officer i motioned for her to park where id parked the day before we worked our way around to the cabin on the windowless side at the same slightly opened window i again heard the sounds of sex a bit more vocal than the other night windys face darkened then she pulled me back to the road her cellphone could not make a connection so we drove back to jacks and she called in to the station willis was out and the officer at the desk did not know where she was transferred to the sheriff and in the most concise language ive ever heard told him everything he said hed be there in an hour with a search warrant she told him how to get there and that shed wait she turned to me and said lets go not me windy you told him where you learned all this but he doesnt know im here ill hitch a ride back into town to get my car i pointed a finger at her you took it upon yourself using whatever intuition you want to claim that i was telling the truth and broke this me im going to have some breakfast for supper ill call you later i turned my back i didnt want her changing her mind or mine i got to talking with two fishermen at the next table they were on the way back to woodland and i cadged a ride we turned out of the parking lot just as three police cars lights and sirens silent turned squealing tires up it was big news even making the networks for the evening broadcasts world famous fly tier killed by his wife and son both dedicated members of earth first it appeared they had plans to donate their inheritances to the mother organization so it was a black eye for the dark force incarnate now there was icing on the cake of justice pictures of them being led away in cuffs showed them defiant but by nightfall the realization of their futures would settle in and killing for the cause would seem like less of a good idea on the morning local news it was apparent officer jackson was a little shy about being the center of attention but the sheriff must have explained to her how some private dick in portland wasnt going to get the credit by the noon news she was a bit more used to the idea and when she showed up on the network news she was acting like a star nowhere did they name the senior officer she had bypassed to follow her instincts willis must be steaming but then that was an added dollop of justice my cellphone rang and i answered hi its windy officer ive been watching you all day on television justice has never looked prettier she was quiet for a moment then i dont know how to say thanks well after this has all died away and youre a normal person again maybe we can have some supper together you mean a date yes officer i mean a date for the second time id like that i think she meant it i said i didnt tell you but im colorblind she laughed i know and hung up i guessed id have to get someone over to rematch my clothes ive been accused of having a warped idea of justice but i dont think so i believe the bad guys should be punished in a manner fitting their crime and our criminal justice system is set up to do that its just that in the actual working something has failed the system functioned equally well with or without justice being done i dont i need justice to be done and there is no amount of time i wont spend to make it happen i dont need to be efficient i dont even need to be paid in fact corny as it sounds justice is its own reward for me justice isnt blind but she is colorblind dealing in black and white lies and truth evil and good and i like cops the williss aside they are our knights tilting against windmills for a system that too often treats them like the offal weve hired them to clean up and sometimes they go to the other side or maybe theyre pushed there whatever i try to be understanding did i say i like cops and if they happen to be beautiful its okay too she flopped her limp arm onto my chest then parted with a mmmm and opened her eyes youre awake she ran a finger down the side of my face what are you thinking about justice i was right justice is female i pulled her to me and she nuzzled would you call this chummy i asked she kissed my shoulder no this is downright friendly yes i got the girl and that too was justice the end
