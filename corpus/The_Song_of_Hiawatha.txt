included in his algic researches and a revision published in as the myth of hiawatha it was this latter revision that longfellow used as the basis for the song of hiawatha longfellow began hiawatha on june he completed it on march and it was published november as soon as the poem was published its popularity was assured however it also was severely criticized as a plagiary of the finnish epic poem kalevala longfellow made no secret of the fact that he had used the meter of the kalevala but as for the legends he openly gave credit to schoolcraft in his notes to the poem i would add a personal

and the cornfields and beyond them stood the forest stood the groves of singing pinetrees green in summer white in winter ever sighing ever singing and the pleasant watercourses you could trace them through the valley by the rushing in the springtime by the alders in the summer by the white fog in the autumn by the black line in the winter and beside them dwelt the singer in the vale of tawasentha in the green and silent valley there he sang of hiawatha sang the song of hiawatha sang his wondrous birth and being how he prayed and how be fasted how he lived and toiled and suffered that the tribes of men might prosper that he might advance his people ye who love the haunts of nature love the sunshine of the meadow love the shadow of the forest love the wind among the branches

and nature who believe that in all ages every human heart is human that in even savage bosoms there are longings yearnings strivings for the good they comprehend not that the feeble hands and helpless groping blindly in the darkness touch gods right hand in that darkness and are lifted up and strengthened listen to this simple story to this song of hiawatha ye who sometimes in your rambles through the green lanes of the country where the tangled barberrybushes hang their tufts of crimson berries over stone walls gray with mosses pause by some neglected graveyard for a while to muse and ponder on a halfeffaced inscription written with little skill of songcraft homely phrases but each letter full of hope and yet of heartbreak full of all the tender pathos of the here and the hereafter stay and read this rude inscription read this song of hiawatha i the peacepipe on the mountains of the prairie on the great red pipestone quarry gitche manito the mighty he the master of life descending on the red crags of the quarry stood erect and called the nations called the tribes of men together from his footprints flowed a river leaped into the light of morning oer the precipice plunging downward gleamed like ishkoodah the comet and the spirit stooping earthward with his finger on the meadow traced a winding pathway for it saying to it run in this way from the red stone of the quarry with his hand he broke a fragment moulded it into a pipehead shaped and fashioned it with figures from the margin of the river took a long reed for a pipestem with its dark green leaves upon it filled the pipe with bark of willow with the bark of the red willow breathed upon the neighboring forest made its great boughs chafe together till in flame they burst and kindled and erect upon the mountains gitche manito the mighty smoked the calumet the peacepipe as a signal to the nations and the smoke rose slowly slowly through the tranquil air of morning first a single line of darkness then a denser bluer vapor then a snowwhite cloud unfolding like the treetops of the forest ever rising rising rising till it touched the top of heaven till it broke against the heaven and rolled outward all around it from the vale of tawasentha from the valley of wyoming from the groves of tuscaloosa from the faroff rocky mountains from the northern lakes and rivers all the tribes beheld the signal saw the distant smoke ascending the pukwana of the peacepipe and the prophets of the nations said behold it the pukwana by the signal of the peacepipe bending like a wand of willow waving like a hand that beckons gitche manito the mighty calls the tribes of men together calls the warriors to his council down the rivers oer the prairies came the warriors of the nations came the delawares and mohawks came the choctaws and camanches came the shoshonies and blackfeet came the pawnees and omahas came the mandans and dacotahs came the hurons and ojibways all the warriors drawn together by the signal of the peacepipe to the mountains of the prairie to the great red pipestone quarry and they stood there on the meadow with their weapons and their wargear painted like the leaves of autumn painted like the sky of morning wildly glaring at each other in their faces stem defiance in their hearts the feuds of ages the hereditary hatred the ancestral thirst of vengeance gitche manito the mighty the creator of the nations looked upon them with compassion with paternal love and pity looked upon their wrath and wrangling but as quarrels among children but as feuds and fights of children over them he stretched his right hand to subdue their stubborn natures to allay their thirst and fever by the shadow of his right hand spake to them with voice majestic as the sound of faroff waters falling into deep abysses warning chiding spake in this wise o my children my poor children listen to the words of wisdom listen to the words of warning from the lips of the great spirit from the master of life who made you i have given you lands to hunt in i have given you streams to fish in i have given you bear and bison i have given you roe and reindeer i have given you brant and beaver filled the marshes full of wildfowl filled the rivers full of fishes why then are you not contented why then will you hunt each other i am weary of your quarrels weary of your wars and bloodshed weary of your prayers for vengeance of your wranglings and dissensions all your strength is in your union all your danger is in discord therefore be at peace henceforward and as brothers live together i will send a prophet to you a deliverer of the nations who shall guide you and shall teach you who shall toil and suffer with you if you listen to his counsels you will multiply and prosper if his warnings pass unheeded you will fade away and perish bathe now in the stream before you wash the warpaint from your faces wash the bloodstains from your fingers bury your warclubs and your weapons break the red stone from this quarry mould and make it into peacepipes take the reeds that grow beside you deck them with your brightest feathers smoke the calumet together and as brothers live henceforward then upon the ground the warriors threw their cloaks and shirts of deerskin threw their weapons and their wargear leaped into the rushing river washed the warpaint from their faces clear above them flowed the water clear and limpid from the footprints of the master of life descending dark below them flowed the water soiled and stained with streaks of crimson as if blood were mingled with it from the river came the warriors clean and washed from all their warpaint on the banks their clubs they buried buried all their warlike weapons gitche manito the mighty the great spirit the creator smiled upon his helpless children and in silence all the warriors broke the red stone of the quarry smoothed and formed it into peacepipes broke the long reeds by the river decked them with their brightest feathers and departed each one homeward while the master of life ascending through the opening of cloudcurtains through the doorways of the heaven vanished from before their faces in the smoke that rolled around him the pukwana of the peacepipe ii the four winds honor be to mudjekeewis cried the warriors cried the old men when he came in triumph homeward with the sacred belt of wampum from the regions of the northwind from the kingdom of wabasso from the land of the white rabbit he had stolen the belt of wampum from the neck of mishemokwa from the great bear of the mountains from the terror of the nations as he lay asleep and cumbrous on the summit of the mountains like a rock with mosses on it spotted brown and gray with mosses silently he stole upon him till the red nails of the monster almost touched him almost scared him till the hot breath of his nostrils warmed the hands of mudjekeewis as he drew the belt of wampum over the round ears that heard not over the small eyes that saw not over the long nose and nostrils the black muffle of the nostrils out of which the heavy breathing warmed the hands of mudjekeewis then he swung aloft his warclub shouted loud and long his warcry smote the mighty mishemokwa in the middle of the forehead right between the eyes he smote him with the heavy blow bewildered rose the great bear of the mountains but his knees beneath him trembled and he whimpered like a woman as he reeled and staggered forward as he sat upon his haunches and the mighty mudjekeewis standing fearlessly before him taunted him in loud derision spake disdainfully in this wise hark you bear you are a coward and no brave as you pretended else you would not cry and whimper like a miserable woman bear you know our tribes are hostile long have been at war together now you find that we are strongest you go sneaking in the forest you go hiding in the mountains had you conquered me in battle not a groan would i have uttered but you bear sit here and whimper and disgrace your tribe by crying like a wretched shaugodaya like a cowardly old woman then again he raised his warclub smote again the mishemokwa in the middle of his forehead broke his skull as ice is broken when one goes to fish in winter thus was slain the mishemokwa he the great bear of the mountains he the terror of the nations honor be to mudjekeewis with a shout exclaimed the people honor be to mudjekeewis henceforth he shall be the westwind and hereafter and forever shall he hold supreme dominion over all the winds of heaven call him no more mudjekeewis call him kabeyun the westwind thus was mudjekeewis chosen father of the winds of heaven for himself he kept the westwind gave the others to his children unto wabun gave the eastwind gave the south to shawondasee and the northwind wild and cruel to the fierce kabibonokka young and beautiful was wabun he it was who brought the morning he it was whose silver arrows chased the dark oer hill and valley he it was whose cheeks were painted with the brightest streaks of crimson and whose voice awoke the village called the deer and called the hunter lonely in the sky was wabun though the birds sang gayly to him though the wildflowers of the meadow filled the air with odors for him though the forests and the rivers sang and shouted at his coming still his heart was sad within him for he was alone in heaven but one morning gazing earthward while the village still was sleeping and the fog lay on the river like a ghost that goes at sunrise he beheld a maiden walking all alone upon a meadow gathering waterflags and rushes by a river in the meadow every morning gazing earthward still the first thing he beheld there was her blue eyes looking at him two blue lakes among the rushes and he loved the lonely maiden who thus waited for his coming for they both were solitary she on earth and he in heaven and he wooed her with caresses wooed her with his smile of sunshine with his flattering words he wooed her with his sighing and his singing gentlest whispers in the branches softest music sweetest odors till he drew her to his bosom folded in his robes of crimson till into a star he changed her trembling still upon his bosom and forever in the heavens they are seen together walking wabun and the wabunannung wabun and the star of morning but the fierce kabibonokka had his dwelling among icebergs in the everlasting snowdrifts in the kingdom of wabasso in the land of the white rabbit he it was whose hand in autumn painted all the trees with scarlet stained the leaves with red and yellow he it was who sent the snowflake sifting hissing through the forest froze the ponds the lakes the rivers drove the loon and seagull southward drove the cormorant and curlew to their nests of sedge and seatang in the realms of shawondasee once the fierce kabibonokka issued from his lodge of snowdrifts from his home among the icebergs and his hair with snow besprinkled streamed behind him like a river like a black and wintry river as he howled and hurried southward over frozen lakes and moorlands there among the reeds and rushes found he shingebis the diver trailing strings of fish behind him oer the frozen fens and moorlands lingering still among the moorlands though his tribe had long departed to the land of shawondasee cried the fierce kabibonokka who is this that dares to brave me dares to stay in my dominions when the wawa has departed when the wildgoose has gone southward and the heron the shuhshuhgah long ago departed southward i will go into his wigwam i will put his smouldering fire out and at night kabibonokka to the lodge came wild and wailing heaped the snow in drifts about it shouted down into the smokeflue shook the lodgepoles in his fury flapped the curtain of the doorway shingebis the diver feared not shingebis the diver cared not four great logs had he for firewood one for each moon of the winter and for food the fishes served him by his blazing fire he sat there warm and merry eating laughing singing o kabibonokka you are but my fellowmortal then kabibonokka entered and though shingebis the diver felt his presence by the coldness felt his icy breath upon him still he did not cease his singing still he did not leave his laughing only turned the log a little only made the fire burn brighter made the sparks fly up the smokeflue from kabibonokkas forehead from his snowbesprinkled tresses drops of sweat fell fast and heavy making dints upon the ashes as along the eaves of lodges as from drooping boughs of hemlock drips the melting snow in springtime making hollows in the snowdrifts till at last he rose defeated could not bear the heat and laughter could not bear the merry singing but rushed headlong through the doorway stamped upon the crusted snowdrifts stamped upon the lakes and rivers made the snow upon them harder made the ice upon them thicker challenged shingebis the diver to come forth and wrestle with him to come forth and wrestle naked on the frozen fens and moorlands forth went shingebis the diver wrestled all night with the northwind wrestled naked on the moorlands with the fierce kabibonokka till his panting breath grew fainter till his frozen grasp grew feebler till he reeled and staggered backward and retreated baffled beaten to the kingdom of wabasso to the land of the white rabbit hearing still the gusty laughter hearing shingebis the diver singing o kabibonokka you are but my fellowmortal shawondasee fat and lazy had his dwelling far to southward in the drowsy dreamy sunshine in the neverending summer he it was who sent the woodbirds sent the robin the opechee sent the bluebird the owaissa sent the shawshaw sent the swallow sent the wildgoose wawa northward sent the melons and tobacco and the grapes in purple clusters from his pipe the smoke ascending filled the sky with haze and vapor filled the air with dreamy softness gave a twinkle to the water touched the rugged hills with smoothness brought the tender indian summer to the melancholy northland in the dreary moon of snowshoes listless careless shawondasee in his life he had one shadow in his heart one sorrow had he once as he was gazing northward far away upon a prairie he beheld a maiden standing saw a tall and slender maiden all alone upon a prairie brightest green were all her garments and her hair was like the sunshine day by day he gazed upon her day by day he sighed with passion day by day his heart within him grew more hot with love and longing for the maid with yellow tresses but he was too fat and lazy to bestir himself and woo her yes too indolent and easy to pursue her and persuade her so he only gazed upon her only sat and sighed with passion for the maiden of the prairie till one morning looking northward he beheld her yellow tresses changed and covered oer with whiteness covered as with whitest snowflakes ah my brother from the northland from the kingdom of wabasso from the land of the white rabbit you have stolen the maiden from me you have laid your hand upon her you have wooed and won my maiden with your stories of the northland thus the wretched shawondasee breathed into the air his sorrow and the southwind oer the prairie wandered warm with sighs of passion with the sighs of shawondasee till the air seemed full of snowflakes full of thistledown the prairie and the maid with hair like sunshine vanished from his sight forever never more did shawondasee see the maid with yellow tresses poor deluded shawondasee t was no woman that you gazed at t was no maiden that you sighed for t was the prairie dandelion that through all the dreamy summer you had gazed at with such longing you had sighed for with such passion and had puffed away forever blown into the air with sighing ah deluded shawondasee thus the four winds were divided thus the sons of mudjekeewis had their stations in the heavens at the corners of the heavens for himself the westwind only kept the mighty mudjekeewis iii hiawathas childhood downward through the evening twilight in the days that are forgotten in the unremembered ages from the full moon fell nokomis fell the beautiful nokomis she a wife but not a mother she was sporting with her women swinging in a swing of grapevines when her rival the rejected full of jealousy and hatred cut the leafy swing asunder cut in twain the twisted grapevines and nokomis fell affrighted downward through the evening twilight on the muskoday the meadow on the prairie full of blossoms see a star falls said the people from the sky a star is falling there among the ferns and mosses there among the prairie lilies on the muskoday the meadow in the moonlight and the starlight fair nokomis bore a daughter and she called her name wenonah as the firstborn of her daughters and the daughter of nokomis grew up like the prairie lilies grew a tall and slender maiden with the beauty of the moonlight with the beauty of the starlight and nokomis warned her often saying oft and oft repeating oh beware of mudjekeewis of the westwind mudjekeewis listen not to what he tells you lie not down upon the meadow stoop not down among the lilies lest the westwind come and harm you but she heeded not the warning heeded not those words of wisdom and the westwind came at evening walking lightly oer the prairie whispering to the leaves and blossoms bending low the flowers and grasses found the beautiful wenonah lying there among the lilies wooed her with his words of sweetness wooed her with his soft caresses till she bore a son in sorrow bore a son of love and sorrow thus was born my hiawatha thus was born the child of wonder but the daughter of nokomis hiawathas gentle mother in her anguish died deserted by the westwind false and faithless by the heartless mudjekeewis for her daughter long and loudly wailed and wept the sad nokomis oh that i were dead she murmured oh that i were dead as thou art no more work and no more weeping wahonowin wahonowin by the shores of gitche gumee by the shining bigseawater stood the wigwam of nokomis daughter of the moon nokomis dark behind it rose the forest rose the black and gloomy pinetrees rose the firs with cones upon them bright before it beat the water beat the clear and sunny water beat the shining bigseawater there the wrinkled old nokomis nursed the little hiawatha rocked him in his linden cradle bedded soft in moss and rushes safely bound with reindeer sinews stilled his fretful wail by saying hush the naked bear will hear thee lulled him into slumber singing ewayea my little owlet who is this that lights the wigwam with his great eyes lights the wigwam ewayea my little owlet many things nokomis taught him of the stars that shine in heaven showed him ishkoodah the comet ishkoodah with fiery tresses showed the deathdance of the spirits warriors with their plumes and warclubs flaring far away to northward in the frosty nights of winter showed the broad white road in heaven pathway of the ghosts the shadows running straight across the heavens crowded with the ghosts the shadows at the door on summer evenings sat the little hiawatha heard the whispering of the pinetrees heard the lapping of the waters sounds of music words of wonder minnewawa said the pinetrees mudwayaushka said the water saw the firefly wahwahtaysee flitting through the dusk of evening with the twinkle of its candle lighting up the brakes and bushes and he sang the song of children sang the song nokomis taught him wahwahtaysee little firefly little flitting whitefire insect little dancing whitefire creature light me with your little candle ere upon my bed i lay me ere in sleep i close my eyelids saw the moon rise from the water rippling rounding from the water saw the flecks and shadows on it whispered what is that nokomis and the good nokomis answered once a warrior very angry seized his grandmother and threw her up into the sky at midnight right against the moon he threw her t is her body that you see there saw the rainbow in the heaven in the eastern sky the rainbow whispered what is that nokomis and the good nokomis answered t is the heaven of flowers you see there all the wildflowers of the forest all the lilies of the prairie when on earth they fade and perish blossom in that heaven above us when he heard the owls at midnight hooting laughing in the forest what is that he cried in terror what is that he said nokomis and the good nokomis answered that is but the owl and owlet talking in their native language talking scolding at each other then the little hiawatha learned of every bird its language learned their names and all their secrets how they built their nests in summer where they hid themselves in winter talked with them wheneer he met them called them hiawathas chickens of all beasts he learned the language learned their names and all their secrets how the beavers built their lodges where the squirrels hid their acorns how the reindeer ran so swiftly why the rabbit was so timid talked with them wheneer he met them called them hiawathas brothers then iagoo the great boaster he the marvellous storyteller he the traveller and the talker he the friend of old nokomis made a bow for hiawatha from a branch of ash he made it from an oakbough made the arrows tipped with flint and winged with feathers and the cord he made of deerskin then he said to hiawatha go my son into the forest where the red deer herd together kill for us a famous roebuck kill for us a deer with antlers forth into the forest straightway all alone walked hiawatha proudly with his bow and arrows and the birds sang round him oer him do not shoot us hiawatha sang the robin the opechee sang the bluebird the owaissa do not shoot us hiawatha up the oaktree close beside him sprang the squirrel adjidaumo in and out among the branches coughed and chattered from the oaktree laughed and said between his laughing do not shoot me hiawatha and the rabbit from his pathway leaped aside and at a distance sat erect upon his haunches half in fear and half in frolic saying to the little hunter do not shoot me hiawatha but he heeded not nor heard them for his thoughts were with the red deer on their tracks his eyes were fastened leading downward to the river to the ford across the river and as one in slumber walked he hidden in the alderbushes there he waited till the deer came till he saw two antlers lifted saw two eyes look from the thicket saw two nostrils point to windward and a deer came down the pathway flecked with leafy light and shadow and his heart within him fluttered trembled like the leaves above him like the birchleaf palpitated as the deer came down the pathway then upon one knee uprising hiawatha aimed an arrow scarce a twig moved with his motion scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled but the wary roebuck started stamped with all his hoofs together listened with one foot uplifted leaped as if to meet the arrow ah the singing fatal arrow like a wasp it buzzed and stung him dead he lay there in the forest by the ford across the river beat his timid heart no longer but the heart of hiawatha throbbed and shouted and exulted as he bore the red deer homeward and iagoo and nokomis hailed his coming with applauses from the red deers hide nokomis made a cloak for hiawatha from the red deers flesh nokomis made a banquet to his honor all the village came and feasted all the guests praised hiawatha called him strongheart soangetaha called him loonheart mahngotaysee iv hiawatha and mudjekeewis out of childhood into manhood now had grown my hiawatha skilled in all the craft of hunters learned in all the lore of old men in all youthful sports and pastimes in all manly arts and labors swift of foot was hiawatha he could shoot an arrow from him and run forward with such fleetness that the arrow fell behind him strong of arm was hiawatha he could shoot ten arrows upward shoot them with such strength and swiftness that the tenth had left the bowstring ere the first to earth had fallen he had mittens minjekahwun magic mittens made of deerskin when upon his hands he wore them he could smite the rocks asunder he could grind them into powder he had moccasins enchanted magic moccasins of deerskin when he bound them round his ankles when upon his feet he tied them at each stride a mile he measured much he questioned old nokomis of his father mudjekeewis learned from her the fatal secret of the beauty of his mother of the falsehood of his father and his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was then he said to old nokomis i will go to mudjekeewis see how fares it with my father at the doorways of the westwind at the portals of the sunset from his lodge went hiawatha dressed for travel armed for hunting dressed in deerskin shirt and leggings richly wrought with quills and wampum on his head his eaglefeathers round his waist his belt of wampum in his hand his bow of ashwood strung with sinews of the reindeer in his quiver oaken arrows tipped with jasper winged with feathers with his mittens minjekahwun with his moccasins enchanted warning said the old nokomis go not forth o hiawatha to the kingdom of the westwind to the realms of mudjekeewis lest he harm you with his magic lest he kill you with his cunning but the fearless hiawatha heeded not her womans warning forth he strode into the forest at each stride a mile he measured lurid seemed the sky above him lurid seemed the earth beneath him hot and close the air around him filled with smoke and fiery vapors as of burning woods and prairies for his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was so he journeyed westward westward left the fleetest deer behind him left the antelope and bison crossed the rushing esconaba crossed the mighty mississippi passed the mountains of the prairie passed the land of crows and foxes passed the dwellings of the blackfeet came unto the rocky mountains to the kingdom of the westwind where upon the gusty summits sat the ancient mudjekeewis ruler of the winds of heaven filled with awe was hiawatha at the aspect of his father on the air about him wildly tossed and streamed his cloudy tresses gleamed like drifting snow his tresses glared like ishkoodah the comet like the star with fiery tresses filled with joy was mudjekeewis when he looked on hiawatha saw his youth rise up before him in the face of hiawatha saw the beauty of wenonah from the grave rise up before him welcome said he hiawatha to the kingdom of the westwind long have i been waiting for you youth is lovely age is lonely youth is fiery age is frosty you bring back the days departed you bring back my youth of passion and the beautiful wenonah many days they talked together questioned listened waited answered much the mighty mudjekeewis boasted of his ancient prowess of his perilous adventures his indomitable courage his invulnerable body patiently sat hiawatha listening to his fathers boasting with a smile he sat and listened uttered neither threat nor menace neither word nor look betrayed him but his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was then he said o mudjekeewis is there nothing that can harm you nothing that you are afraid of and the mighty mudjekeewis grand and gracious in his boasting answered saying there is nothing nothing but the black rock yonder nothing but the fatal wawbeek and he looked at hiawatha with a wise look and benignant with a countenance paternal looked with pride upon the beauty of his tall and graceful figure saying o my hiawatha is there anything can harm you anything you are afraid of but the wary hiawatha paused awhile as if uncertain held his peace as if resolving and then answered there is nothing nothing but the bulrush yonder nothing but the great apukwa and as mudjekeewis rising stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush hiawatha cried in terror cried in welldissembled terror kago kago do not touch it ah kaween said mudjekeewis no indeed i will not touch it then they talked of other matters first of hiawathas brothers first of wabun of the eastwind of the southwind shawondasee of the north kabibonokka then of hiawathas mother of the beautiful wenonah of her birth upon the meadow of her death as old nokomis had remembered and related and he cried o mudjekeewis it was you who killed wenonah took her young life and her beauty broke the lily of the prairie trampled it beneath your footsteps you confess it you confess it and the mighty mudjekeewis tossed upon the wind his tresses bowed his hoary head in anguish with a silent nod assented then up started hiawatha and with threatening look and gesture laid his hand upon the black rock on the fatal wawbeek laid it with his mittens minjekahwun rent the jutting crag asunder smote and crushed it into fragments hurled them madly at his father the remorseful mudjekeewis for his heart was hot within him like a living coal his heart was but the ruler of the westwind blew the fragments backward from him with the breathing of his nostrils with the tempest of his anger blew them back at his assailant seized the bulrush the apukwa dragged it with its roots and fibres from the margin of the meadow from its ooze the giant bulrush long and loud laughed hiawatha then began the deadly conflict hand to hand among the mountains from his eyry screamed the eagle the keneu the great wareagle sat upon the crags around them wheeling flapped his wings above them like a tall tree in the tempest bent and lashed the giant bulrush and in masses huge and heavy crashing fell the fatal wawbeek till the earth shook with the tumult and confusion of the battle and the air was full of shoutings and the thunder of the mountains starting answered baimwawa back retreated mudjekeewis rushing westward oer the mountains stumbling westward down the mountains three whole days retreated fighting still pursued by hiawatha to the doorways of the westwind to the portals of the sunset to the earths remotest border where into the empty spaces sinks the sun as a flamingo drops into her nest at nightfall in the melancholy marshes hold at length cried mudjekeewis hold my son my hiawatha t is impossible to kill me for you cannot kill the immortal i have put you to this trial but to know and prove your courage now receive the prize of valor go back to your home and people live among them toil among them cleanse the earth from all that harms it clear the fishinggrounds and rivers slay all monsters and magicians all the wendigoes the giants all the serpents the kenabeeks as i slew the mishemokwa slew the great bear of the mountains and at last when death draws near you when the awful eyes of pauguk glare upon you in the darkness i will share my kingdom with you ruler shall you be thenceforward of the northwestwind keewaydin of the homewind the keewaydin thus was fought that famous battle in the dreadful days of shahshah in the days long since departed in the kingdom of the westwind still the hunter sees its traces scattered far oer hill and valley sees the giant bulrush growing by the ponds and watercourses sees the masses of the wawbeek lying still in every valley homeward now went hiawatha pleasant was the landscape round him pleasant was the air above him for the bitterness of anger had departed wholly from him from his brain the thought of vengeance from his heart the burning fever only once his pace he slackened only once he paused or halted paused to purchase heads of arrows of the ancient arrowmaker in the land of the dacotahs where the falls of minnehaha flash and gleam among the oaktrees laugh and leap into the valley there the ancient arrowmaker made his arrowheads of sandstone arrowheads of chalcedony arrowheads of flint and jasper smoothed and sharpened at the edges hard and polished keen and costly with him dwelt his darkeyed daughter wayward as the minnehaha with her moods of shade and sunshine eyes that smiled and frowned alternate feet as rapid as the river tresses flowing like the water and as musical a laughter and he named her from the river from the waterfall he named her minnehaha laughing water was it then for heads of arrows arrowheads of chalcedony arrowheads of flint and jasper that my hiawatha halted in the land of the dacotahs was it not to see the maiden see the face of laughing water peeping from behind the curtain hear the rustling of her garments from behind the waving curtain as one sees the minnehaha gleaming glancing through the branches as one hears the laughing water from behind its screen of branches who shall say what thoughts and visions fill the fiery brains of young men who shall say what dreams of beauty filled the heart of hiawatha all he told to old nokomis when he reached the lodge at sunset was the meeting with his father was his fight with mudjekeewis not a word he said of arrows not a word of laughing water v hiawathas fasting you shall hear how hiawatha prayed and fasted in the forest not for greater skill in hunting not for greater craft in fishing not for triumphs in the battle and renown among the warriors but for profit of the people for advantage of the nations first he built a lodge for fasting built a wigwam in the forest by the shining bigseawater in the blithe and pleasant springtime in the moon of leaves he built it and with dreams and visions many seven whole days and nights he fasted on the first day of his fasting through the leafy woods he wandered saw the deer start from the thicket saw the rabbit in his burrow heard the pheasant bena drumming heard the squirrel adjidaumo rattling in his hoard of acorns saw the pigeon the omeme building nests among the pinetrees and in flocks the wildgoose wawa flying to the fenlands northward whirring wailing far above him master of life he cried desponding must our lives depend on these things on the next day of his fasting by the rivers brink he wandered through the muskoday the meadow saw the wild rice mahnomonee saw the blueberry meenahga and the strawberry odahmin and the gooseberry shahbomin and the grapevine the bemahgut trailing oer the alderbranches filling all the air with fragrance master of life he cried desponding must our lives depend on these things on the third day of his fasting by the lake he sat and pondered by the still transparent water saw the sturgeon nahma leaping scattering drops like beads of wampum saw the yellow perch the sahwa like a sunbeam in the water saw the pike the maskenozha and the herring okahahwis and the shawgashee the crawfish master of life he cried desponding must our lives depend on these things on the fourth day of his fasting in his lodge he lay exhausted from his couch of leaves and branches gazing with halfopen eyelids full of shadowy dreams and visions on the dizzy swimming landscape on the gleaming of the water on the splendor of the sunset and he saw a youth approaching dressed in garments green and yellow coming through the purple twilight through the splendor of the sunset plumes of green bent oer his forehead and his hair was soft and golden standing at the open doorway long he looked at hiawatha looked with pity and compassion on his wasted form and features and in accents like the sighing of the southwind in the treetops said he o my hiawatha all your prayers are heard in heaven for you pray not like the others not for greater skill in hunting not for greater craft in fishing not for triumph in the battle nor renown among the warriors but for profit of the people for advantage of the nations from the master of life descending i the friend of man mondamin come to warn you and instruct you how by struggle and by labor you shall gain what you have prayed for rise up from your bed of branches rise o youth and wrestle with me faint with famine hiawatha started from his bed of branches from the twilight of his wigwam forth into the flush of sunset came and wrestled with mondamin at his touch he felt new courage throbbing in his brain and bosom felt new life and hope and vigor run through every nerve and fibre so they wrestled there together in the glory of the sunset and the more they strove and struggled stronger still grew hiawatha till the darkness fell around them and the heron the shuhshuhgah from her nest among the pinetrees gave a cry of lamentation gave a scream of pain and famine t is enough then said mondamin smiling upon hiawatha but tomorrow when the sun sets i will come again to try you and he vanished and was seen not whether sinking as the rain sinks whether rising as the mists rise hiawatha saw not knew not only saw that he had vanished leaving him alone and fainting with the misty lake below him and the reeling stars above him on the morrow and the next day when the sun through heaven descending like a red and burning cinder from the hearth of the great spirit fell into the western waters came mondamin for the trial for the strife with hiawatha came as silent as the dew comes from the empty air appearing into empty air returning taking shape when earth it touches but invisible to all men in its coming and its going thrice they wrestled there together in the glory of the sunset till the darkness fell around them till the heron the shuhshuhgah from her nest among the pinetrees uttered her loud cry of famine and mondamin paused to listen tall and beautiful he stood there in his garments green and yellow to and fro his plumes above him waved and nodded with his breathing and the sweat of the encounter stood like drops of dew upon him and he cried o hiawatha bravely have you wrestled with me thrice have wrestled stoutly with me and the master of life who sees us he will give to you the triumph then he smiled and said tomorrow is the last day of your conflict is the last day of your fasting you will conquer and oercome me make a bed for me to lie in where the rain may fall upon me where the sun may come and warm me strip these garments green and yellow strip this nodding plumage from me lay me in the earth and make it soft and loose and light above me let no hand disturb my slumber let no weed nor worm molest me let not kahgahgee the raven come to haunt me and molest me only come yourself to watch me till i wake and start and quicken till i leap into the sunshine and thus saying he departed peacefully slept hiawatha but he heard the wawonaissa heard the whippoorwill complaining perched upon his lonely wigwam heard the rushing sebowisha heard the rivulet rippling near him talking to the darksome forest heard the sighing of the branches as they lifted and subsided at the passing of the nightwind heard them as one hears in slumber faroff murmurs dreamy whispers peacefully slept hiawatha on the morrow came nokomis on the seventh day of his fasting came with food for hiawatha came imploring and bewailing lest his hunger should oercome him lest his fasting should be fatal but he tasted not and touched not only said to her nokomis wait until the sun is setting till the darkness falls around us till the heron the shuhshuhgah crying from the desolate marshes tells us that the day is ended homeward weeping went nokomis sorrowing for her hiawatha fearing lest his strength should fail him lest his fasting should be fatal he meanwhile sat weary waiting for the coming of mondamin till the shadows pointing eastward lengthened over field and forest till the sun dropped from the heaven floating on the waters westward as a red leaf in the autumn falls and floats upon the water falls and sinks into its bosom and behold the young mondamin with his soft and shining tresses with his garments green and yellow with his long and glossy plumage stood and beckoned at the doorway and as one in slumber walking pale and haggard but undaunted from the wigwam hiawatha came and wrestled with mondamin round about him spun the landscape sky and forest reeled together and his strong heart leaped within him as the sturgeon leaps and struggles in a net to break its meshes like a ring of fire around him blazed and flared the red horizon and a hundred suns seemed looking at the combat of the wrestlers suddenly upon the greensward all alone stood hiawatha panting with his wild exertion palpitating with the struggle and before him breathless lifeless lay the youth with hair dishevelled plumage torn and garments tattered dead he lay there in the sunset and victorious hiawatha made the grave as he commanded stripped the garments from mondamin stripped his tattered plumage from him laid him in the earth and made it soft and loose and light above him and the heron the shuhshuhgah from the melancholy moorlands gave a cry of lamentation gave a cry of pain and anguish homeward then went hiawatha to the lodge of old nokomis and the seven days of his fasting were accomplished and completed but the place was not forgotten where he wrestled with mondamin nor forgotten nor neglected was the grave where lay mondamin sleeping in the rain and sunshine where his scattered plumes and garments faded in the rain and sunshine day by day did hiawatha go to wait and watch beside it kept the dark mould soft above it kept it clean from weeds and insects drove away with scoffs and shoutings kahgahgee the king of ravens till at length a small green feather from the earth shot slowly upward then another and another and before the summer ended stood the maize in all its beauty with its shining robes about it and its long soft yellow tresses and in rapture hiawatha cried aloud it is mondamin yes the friend of man mondamin then he called to old nokomis and iagoo the great boaster showed them where the maize was growing told them of his wondrous vision of his wrestling and his triumph of this new gift to the nations which should be their food forever and still later when the autumn changed the long green leaves to yellow and the soft and juicy kernels grew like wampum hard and yellow then the ripened ears he gathered stripped the withered husks from off them as he once had stripped the wrestler gave the first feast of mondamin and made known unto the people this new gift of the great spirit vi hiawathas friends two good friends had hiawatha singled out from all the others bound to him in closest union and to whom he gave the right hand of his heart in joy and sorrow chibiabos the musician and the very strong man kwasind straight between them ran the pathway never grew the grass upon it singing birds that utter falsehoods storytellers mischiefmakers found no eager ear to listen could not breed illwill between them for they kept each others counsel spake with naked hearts together pondering much and much contriving how the tribes of men might prosper most beloved by hiawatha was the gentle chibiabos he the best of all musicians he the sweetest of all singers beautiful and childlike was he brave as man is soft as woman pliant as a wand of willow stately as a deer with antlers when he sang the village listened all the warriors gathered round him all the women came to hear him now he stirred their souls to passion now he melted them to pity from the hollow reeds he fashioned flutes so musical and mellow that the brook the sebowisha ceased to murmur in the woodland that the woodbirds ceased from singing and the squirrel adjidaumo ceased his chatter in the oaktree and the rabbit the wabasso sat upright to look and listen yes the brook the sebowisha pausing said o chibiabos teach my waves to flow in music softly as your words in singing yes the bluebird the owaissa envious said o chibiabos teach me tones as wild and wayward teach me songs as full of frenzy yes the robin the opechee joyous said o chibiabos teach me tones as sweet and tender teach me songs as full of gladness and the whippoorwill wawonaissa sobbing said o chibiabos teach me tones as melancholy teach me songs as full of sadness all the many sounds of nature borrowed sweetness from his singing all the hearts of men were softened by the pathos of his music for he sang of peace and freedom sang of beauty love and longing sang of death and life undying in the islands of the blessed in the kingdom of ponemah in the land of the hereafter very dear to hiawatha was the gentle chibiabos he the best of all musicians he the sweetest of all singers for his gentleness he loved him and the magic of his singing dear too unto hiawatha was the very strong man kwasind he the strongest of all mortals he the mightiest among many for his very strength he loved him for his strength allied to goodness idle in his youth was kwasind very listless dull and dreamy never played with other children never fished and never hunted not like other children was he but they saw that much he fasted much his manito entreated much besought his guardian spirit lazy kwasind said his mother in my work you never help me in the summer you are roaming idly in the fields and forests in the winter you are cowering oer the firebrands in the wigwam in the coldest days of winter i must break the ice for fishing with my nets you never help me at the door my nets are hanging dripping freezing with the water go and wring them yenadizze go and dry them in the sunshine slowly from the ashes kwasind rose but made no angry answer from the lodge went forth in silence took the nets that hung together dripping freezing at the doorway like a wisp of straw he wrung them like a wisp of straw he broke them could not wring them without breaking such the strength was in his fingers lazy kwasind said his father in the hunt you never help me every bow you touch is broken snapped asunder every arrow yet come with me to the forest you shall bring the hunting homeward down a narrow pass they wandered where a brooklet led them onward where the trail of deer and bison marked the soft mud on the margin till they found all further passage shut against them barred securely by the trunks of trees uprooted lying lengthwise lying crosswise and forbidding further passage we must go back said the old man oer these logs we cannot clamber not a woodchuck could get through them not a squirrel clamber oer them and straightway his pipe he lighted and sat down to smoke and ponder but before his pipe was finished lo the path was cleared before him all the trunks had kwasind lifted to the right hand to the left hand shot the pinetrees swift as arrows hurled the cedars light as lances lazy kwasind said the young men as they sported in the meadow why stand idly looking at us leaning on the rock behind you come and wrestle with the others let us pitch the quoit together lazy kwasind made no answer to their challenge made no answer only rose and slowly turning seized the huge rock in his fingers tore it from its deep foundation poised it in the air a moment pitched it sheer into the river sheer into the swift pauwating where it still is seen in summer once as down that foaming river down the rapids of pauwating kwasind sailed with his companions in the stream he saw a beaver saw ahmeek the king of beavers struggling with the rushing currents rising sinking in the water without speaking without pausing kwasind leaped into the river plunged beneath the bubbling surface through the whirlpools chased the beaver followed him among the islands stayed so long beneath the water that his terrified companions cried alas goodby to kwasind we shall never more see kwasind but he reappeared triumphant and upon his shining shoulders brought the beaver dead and dripping brought the king of all the beavers and these two as i have told you were the friends of hiawatha chibiabos the musician and the very strong man kwasind long they lived in peace together spake with naked hearts together pondering much and much contriving how the tribes of men might prosper vii hiawathas sailing give me of your bark o birchtree of your yellow bark o birchtree growing by the rushing river tall and stately in the valley i a light canoe will build me build a swift cheemaun for sailing that shall float on the river like a yellow leaf in autumn like a yellow waterlily lay aside your cloak o birchtree lay aside your whiteskin wrapper for the summertime is coming and the sun is warm in heaven and you need no whiteskin wrapper thus aloud cried hiawatha in the solitary forest by the rushing taquamenaw when the birds were singing gayly in the moon of leaves were singing and the sun from sleep awaking started up and said behold me gheezis the great sun behold me and the tree with all its branches rustled in the breeze of morning saying with a sigh of patience take my cloak o hiawatha with his knife the tree he girdled just beneath its lowest branches just above the roots he cut it till the sap came oozing outward down the trunk from top to bottom sheer he cleft the bark asunder with a wooden wedge he raised it stripped it from the trunk unbroken give me of your boughs o cedar of your strong and pliant branches my canoe to make more steady make more strong and firm beneath me through the summit of the cedar went a sound a cry of horror went a murmur of resistance but it whispered bending downward take my boughs o hiawatha down he hewed the boughs of cedar shaped them straightway to a framework like two bows he formed and shaped them like two bended bows together give me of your roots o tamarack of your fibrous roots o larchtree my canoe to bind together so to bind the ends together that the water may not enter that the river may not wet me and the larch with all its fibres shivered in the air of morning touched his forehead with its tassels slid with one long sigh of sorrow take them all o hiawatha from the earth he tore the fibres tore the tough roots of the larchtree closely sewed the hark together bound it closely to the framework give me of your balm o firtree of your balsam and your resin so to close the seams together that the water may not enter that the river may not wet me and the firtree tall and sombre sobbed through all its robes of darkness rattled like a shore with pebbles answered wailing answered weeping take my balm o hiawatha and he took the tears of balsam took the resin of the firtree smeared therewith each seam and fissure made each crevice safe from water give me of your quills o hedgehog all your quills o kagh the hedgehog i will make a necklace of them make a girdle for my beauty and two stars to deck her bosom from a hollow tree the hedgehog with his sleepy eyes looked at him shot his shining quills like arrows saying with a drowsy murmur through the tangle of his whiskers take my quills o hiawatha from the ground the quills he gathered all the little shining arrows stained them red and blue and yellow with the juice of roots and berries into his canoe he wrought them round its waist a shining girdle round its bows a gleaming necklace on its breast two stars resplendent thus the birch canoe was builded in the valley by the river in the bosom of the forest and the forests life was in it all its mystery and its magic all the lightness of the birchtree all the toughness of the cedar all the larchs supple sinews and it floated on the river like a yellow leaf in autumn like a yellow waterlily paddles none had hiawatha paddles none he had or needed for his thoughts as paddles served him and his wishes served to guide him swift or slow at will he glided veered to right or left at pleasure then he called aloud to kwasind to his friend the strong man kwasind saying help me clear this river of its sunken logs and sandbars straight into the river kwasind plunged as if he were an otter dived as if he were a beaver stood up to his waist in water to his armpits in the river swam and scouted in the river tugged at sunken logs and branches with his hands he scooped the sandbars with his feet the ooze and tangle and thus sailed my hiawatha down the rushing taquamenaw sailed through all its bends and windings sailed through all its deeps and shallows while his friend the strong man kwasind swam the deeps the shallows waded up and down the river went they in and out among its islands cleared its bed of root and sandbar dragged the dead trees from its channel made its passage safe and certain made a pathway for the people from its springs among the mountains to the waters of pauwating to the bay of taquamenaw viii hiawathas fishing forth upon the gitche gumee on the shining bigseawater with his fishingline of cedar of the twisted bark of cedar forth to catch the sturgeon nahma mishenahma king of fishes in his birch canoe exulting all alone went hiawatha through the clear transparent water he could see the fishes swimming far down in the depths below him see the yellow perch the sahwa like a sunbeam in the water see the shawgashee the crawfish like a spider on the bottom on the white and sandy bottom at the stern sat hiawatha with his fishingline of cedar in his plumes the breeze of morning played as in the hemlock branches on the bows with tail erected sat the squirrel adjidaumo in his fur the breeze of morning played as in the prairie grasses on the white sand of the bottom lay the monster mishenahma lay the sturgeon king of fishes through his gills he breathed the water with his fins he fanned and winnowed with his tail he swept the sandfloor there he lay in all his armor on each side a shield to guard him plates of bone upon his forehead down his sides and back and shoulders plates of bone with spines projecting painted was he with his warpaints stripes of yellow red and azure spots of brown and spots of sable and he lay there on the bottom fanning with his fins of purple as above him hiawatha in his birch canoe came sailing with his fishingline of cedar take my bait cried hiawatha dawn into the depths beneath him take my bait o sturgeon nahma come up from below the water let us see which is the stronger and he dropped his line of cedar through the clear transparent water waited vainly for an answer long sat waiting for an answer and repeating loud and louder take my bait o king of fishes quiet lay the sturgeon nahma fanning slowly in the water looking up at hiawatha listening to his call and clamor his unnecessary tumult till he wearied of the shouting and he said to the kenozha to the pike the maskenozha take the bait of this rude fellow break the line of hiawatha in his fingers hiawatha felt the loose line jerk and tighten as he drew it in it tugged so that the birch canoe stood endwise like a birch log in the water with the squirrel adjidaumo perched and frisking on the summit full of scorn was hiawatha when he saw the fish rise upward saw the pike the maskenozha coming nearer nearer to him and he shouted through the water esa esa shame upon you you are but the pike kenozha you are not the fish i wanted you are not the king of fishes reeling downward to the bottom sank the pike in great confusion and the mighty sturgeon nahma said to ugudwash the sunfish to the bream with scales of crimson take the bait of this great boaster break the line of hiawatha slowly upward wavering gleaming rose the ugudwash the sunfish seized the line of hiawatha swung with all his weight upon it made a whirlpool in the water whirled the birch canoe in circles round and round in gurgling eddies till the circles in the water reached the faroff sandy beaches till the waterflags and rushes nodded on the distant margins but when hiawatha saw him slowly rising through the water lifting up his disk refulgent loud he shouted in derision esa esa shame upon you you are ugudwash the sunfish you are not the fish i wanted you are not the king of fishes slowly downward wavering gleaming sank the ugudwash the sunfish and again the sturgeon nahma heard the shout of hiawatha heard his challenge of defiance the unnecessary tumult ringing far across the water from the white sand of the bottom up he rose with angry gesture quivering in each nerve and fibre clashing all his plates of armor gleaming bright with all his warpaint in his wrath he darted upward flashing leaped into the sunshine opened his great jaws and swallowed both canoe and hiawatha down into that darksome cavern plunged the headlong hiawatha as a log on some black river shoots and plunges down the rapids found himself in utter darkness groped about in helpless wonder till he felt a great heart beating throbbing in that utter darkness and he smote it in his anger with his fist the heart of nahma felt the mighty king of fishes shudder through each nerve and fibre heard the water gurgle round him as he leaped and staggered through it sick at heart and faint and weary crosswise then did hiawatha drag his birchcanoe for safety lest from out the jaws of nahma in the turmoil and confusion forth he might be hurled and perish and the squirrel adjidaumo frisked and chatted very gayly toiled and tugged with hiawatha till the labor was completed then said hiawatha to him o my little friend the squirrel bravely have you toiled to help me take the thanks of hiawatha and the name which now he gives you for hereafter and forever boys shall call you adjidaumo tailinair the boys shall call you and again the sturgeon nahma gasped and quivered in the water then was still and drifted landward till he grated on the pebbles till the listening hiawatha heard him grate upon the margin felt him strand upon the pebbles knew that nahma king of fishes lay there dead upon the margin then he heard a clang and flapping as of many wings assembling heard a screaming and confusion as of birds of prey contending saw a gleam of light above him shining through the ribs of nahma saw the glittering eyes of seagulls of kayoshk the seagulls peering gazing at him through the opening heard them saying to each other t is our brother hiawatha and he shouted from below them cried exulting from the caverns o ye seagulls o my brothers i have slain the sturgeon nahma make the rifts a little larger with your claws the openings widen set me free from this dark prison and henceforward and forever men shall speak of your achievements calling you kayoshk the seagulls yes kayoshk the noble scratchers and the wild and clamorous seagulls toiled with beak and claws together made the rifts and openings wider in the mighty ribs of nahma and from peril and from prison from the body of the sturgeon from the peril of the water they released my hiawatha he was standing near his wigwam on the margin of the water and he called to old nokomis called and beckoned to nokomis pointed to the sturgeon nahma lying lifeless on the pebbles with the seagulls feeding on him i have slain the mishenahma slain the king of fishes said he look the seagulls feed upon him yes my friends kayoshk the seagulls drive them not away nokomis they have saved me from great peril in the body of the sturgeon wait until their meal is ended till their craws are full with feasting till they homeward fly at sunset to their nests among the marshes then bring all your pots and kettles and make oil for us in winter and she waited till the sun set till the pallid moon the nightsun rose above the tranquil water till kayoshk the sated seagulls from their banquet rose with clamor and across the fiery sunset winged their way to faroff islands to their nests among the rushes to his sleep went hiawatha and nokomis to her labor toiling patient in the moonlight till the sun and moon changed places till the sky was red with sunrise and kayoshk the hungry seagulls came back from the reedy islands clamorous for their morning banquet three whole days and nights alternate old nokomis and the seagulls stripped the oily flesh of nahma till the waves washed through the ribbones till the seagulls came no longer and upon the sands lay nothing but the skeleton of nahma ix hiawatha and the pearlfeather on the shores of gitche gumee of the shining bigseawater stood nokomis the old woman pointing with her finger westward oer the water pointing westward to the purple clouds of sunset fiercely the red sun descending burned his way along the heavens set the sky on fire behind him as warparties when retreating burn the prairies on their wartrail and the moon the nightsun eastward suddenly starting from his ambush followed fast those bloody footprints followed in that fiery wartrail with its glare upon his features and nokomis the old woman pointing with her finger westward spake these words to hiawatha yonder dwells the great pearlfeather megissogwon the magician manito of wealth and wampum guarded by his fiery serpents guarded by the black pitchwater you can see his fiery serpents the kenabeek the great serpents coiling playing in the water you can see the black pitchwater stretching far away beyond them to the purple clouds of sunset he it was who slew my father by his wicked wiles and cunning when he from the moon descended when he came on earth to seek me he the mightiest of magicians sends the fever from the marshes sends the pestilential vapors sends the poisonous exhalations sends the white fog from the fenlands sends disease and death among us take your bow o hiawatha take your arrows jasperheaded take your warclub puggawaugun and your mittens minjekahwun and your birchcanoe for sailing and the oil of mishenahma so to smear its sides that swiftly you may pass the black pitchwater slay this merciless magician save the people from the fever that he breathes across the fenlands and avenge my fathers murder straightway then my hiawatha armed himself with all his wargear launched his birchcanoe for sailing with his palm its sides he patted said with glee cheemaun my darling o my birchcanoe leap forward where you see the fiery serpents where you see the black pitchwater forward leaped cheemaun exulting and the noble hiawatha sang his warsong wild and woful and above him the wareagle the keneu the great wareagle master of all fowls with feathers screamed and hurtled through the heavens soon he reached the fiery serpents the kenabeek the great serpents lying huge upon the water sparkling rippling in the water lying coiled across the passage with their blazing crests uplifted breathing fiery fogs and vapors so that none could pass beyond them but the fearless hiawatha cried aloud and spake in this wise let me pass my way kenabeek let me go upon my journey and they answered hissing fiercely with their fiery breath made answer back go back o shaugodaya back to old nokomis faintheart then the angry hiawatha raised his mighty bow of ashtree seized his arrows jasperheaded shot them fast among the serpents every twanging of the bowstring was a warcry and a deathcry every whizzing of an arrow was a deathsong of kenabeek weltering in the bloody water dead lay all the fiery serpents and among them hiawatha harmless sailed and cried exulting onward o cheemaun my darling onward to the black pitchwater then he took the oil of nahma and the bows and sides anointed smeared them well with oil that swiftly he might pass the black pitchwater all night long he sailed upon it sailed upon that sluggish water covered with its mould of ages black with rotting waterrushes rank with flags and leaves of lilies stagnant lifeless dreary dismal lighted by the shimmering moonlight and by willothewisps illumined fires by ghosts of dead men kindled in their weary nightencampments all the air was white with moonlight all the water black with shadow and around him the suggema the mosquito sang his warsong and the fireflies wahwahtaysee waved their torches to mislead him and the bullfrog the dahinda thrust his head into the moonlight fixed his yellow eyes upon him sobbed and sank beneath the surface and anon a thousand whistles answered over all the fenlands and the heron the shuhshuhgah far off on the reedy margin heralded the heros coming westward thus fared hiawatha toward the realm of megissogwon toward the land of the pearlfeather till the level moon stared at him in his face stared pale and haggard till the sun was hot behind him till it burned upon his shoulders and before him on the upland he could see the shining wigwam of the manito of wampum of the mightiest of magicians then once more cheemaun he patted to his birchcanoe said onward and it stirred in all its fibres and with one great bound of triumph leaped across the waterlilies leaped through tangled flags and rushes and upon the beach beyond them dryshod landed hiawatha straight he took his bow of ashtree on the sand one end he rested with his knee he pressed the middle stretched the faithful bowstring tighter took an arrow jasperheaded shot it at the shining wigwam sent it singing as a herald as a bearer of his message of his challenge loud and lofty come forth from your lodge pearlfeather hiawatha waits your coming straightway from the shining wigwam came the mighty megissogwon tall of stature broad of shoulder dark and terrible in aspect clad from head to foot in wampum armed with all his warlike weapons painted like the sky of morning streaked with crimson blue and yellow crested with great eaglefeathers streaming upward streaming outward well i know you hiawatha cried he in a voice of thunder in a tone of loud derision hasten back o shaugodaya hasten back among the women back to old nokomis faintheart i will slay you as you stand there as of old i slew her father but my hiawatha answered nothing daunted fearing nothing big words do not smite like warclubs boastful breath is not a bowstring taunts are not so sharp as arrows deeds are better things than words are actions mightier than boastings then began the greatest battle that the sun had ever looked on that the warbirds ever witnessed all a summers day it lasted from the sunrise to the sunset for the shafts of hiawatha harmless hit the shirt of wampum harmless fell the blows he dealt it with his mittens minjekahwun harmless fell the heavy warclub it could dash the rocks asunder but it could not break the meshes of that magic shirt of wampum till at sunset hiawatha leaning on his bow of ashtree wounded weary and desponding with his mighty warclub broken with his mittens torn and tattered and three useless arrows only paused to rest beneath a pinetree from whose branches trailed the mosses and whose trunk was coated over with the deadmans moccasinleather with the fungus white and yellow suddenly from the boughs above him sang the mama the woodpecker aim your arrows hiawatha at the head of megissogwon strike the tuft of hair upon it at their roots the long black tresses there alone can he be wounded winged with feathers tipped with jasper swift flew hiawathas arrow just as megissogwon stooping raised a heavy stone to throw it full upon the crown it struck him at the roots of his long tresses and he reeled and staggered forward plunging like a wounded bison yes like pezhekee the bison when the snow is on the prairie swifter flew the second arrow in the pathway of the other piercing deeper than the other wounding sorer than the other and the knees of megissogwon shook like windy reeds beneath him bent and trembled like the rushes but the third and latest arrow swiftest flew and wounded sorest and the mighty megissogwon saw the fiery eyes of pauguk saw the eyes of death glare at him heard his voice call in the darkness at the feet of hiawatha lifeless lay the great pearlfeather lay the mightiest of magicians then the grateful hiawatha called the mama the woodpecker from his perch among the branches of the melancholy pinetree and in honor of his service stained with blood the tuft of feathers on the little head of mama even to this day he wears it wears the tuft of crimson feathers as a symbol of his service then he stripped the shirt of wampum from the back of megissogwon as a trophy of the battle as a signal of his conquest on the shore he left the body half on land and half in water in the sand his feet were buried and his face was in the water and above him wheeled and clamored the keneu the great wareagle sailing round in narrower circles hovering nearer nearer nearer from the wigwam hiawatha bore the wealth of megissogwon all his wealth of skins and wampum furs of bison and of beaver furs of sable and of ermine wampum belts and strings and pouches quivers wrought with beads of wampum filled with arrows silverheaded homeward then he sailed exulting homeward through the black pitchwater homeward through the weltering serpents with the trophies of the battle with a shout and song of triumph on the shore stood old nokomis on the shore stood chibiabos and the very strong man kwasind waiting for the heros coming listening to his songs of triumph and the people of the village welcomed him with songs and dances made a joyous feast and shouted honor be to hiawatha he has slain the great pearlfeather slain the mightiest of magicians him who sent the fiery fever sent the white fog from the fenlands sent disease and death among us ever dear to hiawatha was the memory of mama and in token of his friendship as a mark of his remembrance he adorned and decked his pipestem with the crimson tuft of feathers with the bloodred crest of mama but the wealth of megissogwon all the trophies of the battle he divided with his people shared it equally among them x hiawathas wooing as unto the bow the cord is so unto the man is woman though she bends him she obeys him though she draws him yet she follows useless each without the other thus the youthful hiawatha said within himself and pondered much perplexed by various feelings listless longing hoping fearing dreaming still of minnehaha of the lovely laughing water in the land of the dacotahs wed a maiden of your people warning said the old nokomis go not eastward go not westward for a stranger whom we know not like a fire upon the hearthstone is a neighbors homely daughter like the starlight or the moonlight is the handsomest of strangers thus dissuading spake nokomis and my hiawatha answered only this dear old nokomis very pleasant is the firelight but i like the starlight better better do i like the moonlight gravely then said old nokomis bring not here an idle maiden bring not here a useless woman hands unskilful feet unwilling bring a wife with nimble fingers heart and hand that move together feet that run on willing errands smiling answered hiawatha in the land of the dacotahs lives the arrowmakers daughter minnehaha laughing water handsomest of all the women i will bring her to your wigwam she shall run upon your errands be your starlight moonlight firelight be the sunlight of my people still dissuading said nokomis bring not to my lodge a stranger from the land of the dacotahs very fierce are the dacotahs often is there war between us there are feuds yet unforgotten wounds that ache and still may open laughing answered hiawatha for that reason if no other would i wed the fair dacotah that our tribes might be united that old feuds might be forgotten and old wounds be healed forever thus departed hiawatha to the land of the dacotahs to the land of handsome women striding over moor and meadow through interminable forests through uninterrupted silence with his moccasins of magic at each stride a mile he measured yet the way seemed long before him and his heart outran his footsteps and he journeyed without resting till he heard the cataracts laughter heard the falls of minnehaha calling to him through the silence pleasant is the sound he murmured pleasant is the voice that calls me on the outskirts of the forests twixt the shadow and the sunshine herds of fallow deer were feeding but they saw not hiawatha to his bow he whispered fail not to his arrow whispered swerve not sent it singing on its errand to the red heart of the roebuck threw the deer across his shoulder and sped forward without pausing at the doorway of his wigwam sat the ancient arrowmaker in the land of the dacotahs making arrowheads of jasper arrowheads of chalcedony at his side in all her beauty sat the lovely minnehaha sat his daughter laughing water plaiting mats of flags and rushes of the past the old mans thoughts were and the maidens of the future he was thinking as he sat there of the days when with such arrows he had struck the deer and bison on the muskoday the meadow shot the wild goose flying southward on the wing the clamorous wawa thinking of the great warparties how they came to buy his arrows could not fight without his arrows ah no more such noble warriors could be found on earth as they were now the men were all like women only used their tongues for weapons she was thinking of a hunter from another tribe and country young and tall and very handsome who one morning in the springtime came to buy her fathers arrows sat and rested in the wigwam lingered long about the doorway looking back as he departed she had heard her father praise him praise his courage and his wisdom would he come again for arrows to the falls of minnehaha on the mat her hands lay idle and her eyes were very dreamy through their thoughts they heard a footstep heard a rustling in the branches and with glowing cheek and forehead with the deer upon his shoulders suddenly from out the woodlands hiawatha stood before them straight the ancient arrowmaker looked up gravely from his labor laid aside the unfinished arrow bade him enter at the doorway saying as he rose to meet him hiawatha you are welcome at the feet of laughing water hiawatha laid his burden threw the red deer from his shoulders and the maiden looked up at him looked up from her mat of rushes said with gentle look and accent you are welcome hiawatha very spacious was the wigwam made of deerskins dressed and whitened with the gods of the dacotahs drawn and painted on its curtains and so tall the doorway hardly hiawatha stooped to enter hardly touched his eaglefeathers as he entered at the doorway then uprose the laughing water from the ground fair minnehaha laid aside her mat unfinished brought forth food and set before them water brought them from the brooklet gave them food in earthen vessels gave them drink in bowls of basswood listened while the guest was speaking listened while her father answered but not once her lips she opened not a single word she uttered yes as in a dream she listened to the words of hiawatha as he talked of old nokomis who had nursed him in his childhood as he told of his companions chibiabos the musician and the very strong man kwasind and of happiness and plenty in the land of the ojibways in the pleasant land and peaceful after many years of warfare many years of strife and bloodshed there is peace between the ojibways and the tribe of the dacotahs thus continued hiawatha and then added speaking slowly that this peace may last forever and our hands be clasped more closely and our hearts be more united give me as my wife this maiden minnehaha laughing water loveliest of dacotah women and the ancient arrowmaker paused a moment ere he answered smoked a little while in silence looked at hiawatha proudly fondly looked at laughing water and made answer very gravely yes if minnehaha wishes let your heart speak minnehaha and the lovely laughing water seemed more lovely as she stood there neither willing nor reluctant as she went to hiawatha softly took the seat beside him while she said and blushed to say it i will follow you my husband this was hiawathas wooing thus it was he won the daughter of the ancient arrowmaker in the land of the dacotahs from the wigwam he departed leading with him laughing water hand in hand they went together through the woodland and the meadow left the old man standing lonely at the doorway of his wigwam heard the falls of minnehaha calling to them from the distance crying to them from afar off fare thee well o minnehaha and the ancient arrowmaker turned again unto his labor sat down by his sunny doorway murmuring to himself and saying thus it is our daughters leave us those we love and those who love us just when they have learned to help us when we are old and lean upon them comes a youth with flaunting feathers with his flute of reeds a stranger wanders piping through the village beckons to the fairest maiden and she follows where he leads her leaving all things for the stranger pleasant was the journey homeward through interminable forests over meadow over mountain over river hill and hollow short it seemed to hiawatha though they journeyed very slowly though his pace he checked and slackened to the steps of laughing water over wide and rushing rivers in his arms he bore the maiden light he thought her as a feather as the plume upon his headgear cleared the tangled pathway for her bent aside the swaying branches made at night a lodge of branches and a bed with boughs of hemlock and a fire before the doorway with the dry cones of the pinetree all the travelling winds went with them oer the meadows through the forest all the stars of night looked at them watched with sleepless eyes their slumber from his ambush in the oaktree peeped the squirrel adjidaumo watched with eager eyes the lovers and the rabbit the wabasso scampered from the path before them peering peeping from his burrow sat erect upon his haunches watched with curious eyes the lovers pleasant was the journey homeward all the birds sang loud and sweetly songs of happiness and heartsease sang the bluebird the owaissa happy are you hiawatha having such a wife to love you sang the robin the opechee happy are you laughing

the sound of drums and voices rose the handsome paupukkeewis and began his mystic dances first he danced a solemn measure very slow in step and gesture in and out among the pinetrees through the shadows and the sunshine treading softly like a panther then more swiftly and still swifter whirling spinning round in circles leaping oer the guests assembled eddying round and round the wigwam till the leaves went whirling with him till the dust and wind together swept in eddies round about him then along the sandy margin of the lake the bigseawater on he sped with frenzied gestures stamped upon the sand and tossed it wildly in the air around him till the wind became a whirlwind till the sand was blown and sifted like great snowdrifts oer the landscape heaping all the shores with sand dunes sand hills of the nagow wudjoo thus the merry paupukkeewis danced his beggars dance to please them and returning sat down laughing there among the guests assembled sat and fanned himself serenely with

in the moon when nights are brightest onaway my heart sings to thee sings with joy when thou art near me as the sighing singing branches in the pleasant moon of strawberries when thou art not pleased beloved then my heart is sad and darkened as the shining river darkens when the clouds drop shadows on it when thou smilest my beloved then my troubled heart is brightened as in sunshine gleam the ripples that the cold wind makes in rivers smiles the earth and smile the waters smile the cloudless skies above us but i lose the way of smiling when thou art no longer near me i myself myself behold me blood of my beating heart behold me oh awake awake beloved onaway awake beloved thus the gentle chibiabos sang his song of love and longing and iagoo the great boaster he the marvellous storyteller he the friend of old nokomis jealous of the sweet musician jealous of the applause they gave him saw in all the eyes around him saw in all their looks and gestures that the wedding guests assembled longed to hear his pleasant stories his immeasurable falsehoods very boastful was iagoo never heard he an adventure but himself had met a greater never any deed of daring but himself had done a bolder never any marvellous story but himself could tell a stranger would you listen to his boasting would you only give him credence no one ever shot an arrow half so far and high as he had ever caught so many fishes ever killed so many reindeer ever trapped so many beaver none could run so fast as he could none could dive so deep as he could none could swim so far as he could none had made so many journeys none had seen so many wonders as this wonderful iagoo as this marvellous storyteller thus his name became a byword and a jest among the people and wheneer a boastful hunter praised his own address too highly or a warrior home returning talked too much of his achievements all his hearers cried iagoo heres iagoo come among us he it was who carved the cradle of the little hiawatha carved its framework out of linden bound it strong with reindeer sinews he it was who taught him later how to make his bows and arrows how to make the bows of ashtree and the arrows of the oaktree so among the guests assembled at my hiawathas wedding sat iagoo old and ugly sat the marvellous storyteller and they said o good iagoo tell us now a tale of wonder tell us of some strange adventure that the feast may be more joyous that the time may pass more gayly and our guests be more contented and iagoo answered straightway you shall hear a tale of wonder you shall hear the strange adventures of osseo the magician from the evening star descending xii the son of the evening star can it be the sun descending oer the level plain of water or the red swan floating flying wounded by the magic arrow staining all the waves with crimson with the crimson of its lifeblood filling all the air with splendor with the splendor of its plumage yes it is the sun descending sinking down into the water all the sky is stained with purple all the water flushed with crimson no it is the red swan floating diving down beneath the water to the sky its wings are lifted with its blood the waves are reddened over it the star of evening melts and trembles through the purple hangs suspended in the twilight no it is a bead of wampum on the robes of the great spirit as he passes through the twilight walks in silence through the heavens this with joy beheld iagoo and he said in haste behold it see the sacred star of evening you shall hear a tale of wonder hear the story of osseo son of the evening star osseo once in days no more remembered ages nearer the beginning when the heavens were closer to us and the gods were more familiar in the northland lived a hunter with ten young and comely daughters tall and lithe as wands of willow only oweenee the youngest she the wilful and the wayward she the silent dreamy maiden was the fairest of the sisters all these women married warriors married brave and haughty husbands only oweenee the youngest laughed and flouted all her lovers all her young and handsome suitors and then married old osseo old osseo poor and ugly broken with age and weak with coughing always coughing like a squirrel ah but beautiful within him was the spirit of osseo from the evening star descended star of evening star of woman star of tenderness and passion all its fire was in his bosom all its beauty in his spirit all its mystery in his being all its splendor in his language and her lovers the rejected handsome men with belts of wampum handsome men with paint and feathers pointed at her in derision followed her with jest and laughter but she said i care not for you care not for your belts of wampum care not for your paint and feathers care not for your jests and laughter i am happy with osseo once to some great feast invited through the damp and dusk of evening walked together the ten sisters walked together with their husbands slowly followed old osseo with fair oweenee beside him all the others chatted gayly these two only walked in silence at the western sky osseo gazed intent as if imploring often stopped and gazed imploring at the trembling star of evening at the tender star of woman and they heard him murmur softly ah showain nemeshin nosa pity pity me my father listen said the eldest sister he is praying to his father what a pity that the old man does not stumble in the pathway does not break his neck by falling and they laughed till all the forest rang with their unseemly laughter on their pathway through the woodlands lay an oak by storms uprooted lay the great trunk of an oaktree buried half in leaves and mosses mouldering crumbling huge and hollow and osseo when he saw it gave a shout a cry of anguish leaped into its yawning cavern at one end went in an old man wasted wrinkled old and ugly from the other came a young man tall and straight and strong and handsome thus osseo was transfigured thus restored to youth and beauty but alas for good osseo and for oweenee the faithful strangely too was she transfigured changed into a weak old woman with a staff she tottered onward wasted wrinkled old and ugly and the sisters and their husbands laughed until the echoing forest rang with their unseemly laughter but osseo turned not from her walked with slower step beside her took her hand as brown and withered as an oakleaf is in winter called her sweetheart nenemoosha soothed her with soft words of kindness till they reached the lodge of feasting till they sat down in the wigwam sacred to the star of evening to the tender star of woman wrapt in visions lost in dreaming at the banquet sat osseo all were merry all were happy all were joyous but osseo neither food nor drink he tasted neither did he speak nor listen but as one bewildered sat he looking dreamily and sadly first at oweenee then upward at the gleaming sky above them then a voice was heard a whisper coming from the starry distance coming from the empty vastness low and musical and tender and the voice said o osseo o my son my best beloved broken are the spells that bound you all the charms of the magicians all the magic powers of evil come to me ascend osseo taste the food that stands before you it is blessed and enchanted it has magic virtues in it it will change you to a spirit all your bowls and all your kettles shall be wood and clay no longer but the bowls be changed to wampum and the kettles shall be silver they shall shine like shells of scarlet like the fire shall gleam and glimmer and the women shall no longer bear the dreary doom of labor but be changed to birds and glisten with the beauty of the starlight painted with the dusky splendors of the skies and clouds of evening what osseo heard as whispers what as words he comprehended was but music to the others music as of birds afar off of the whippoorwill afar off of the lonely wawonaissa singing in the darksome forest then the lodge began to tremble straight began to shake and tremble and they felt it rising rising slowly through the air ascending from the darkness of the treetops forth into the dewy starlight till it passed the topmost branches and behold the wooden dishes all were changed to shells of scarlet and behold the earthen kettles all were changed to bowls of silver and the roofpoles of the wigwam were as glittering rods of silver and the roof of bark upon them as the shining shards of beetles then osseo gazed around him and he saw the nine fair sisters all the sisters and their husbands changed to birds of various plumage some were jays and some were magpies others thrushes others blackbirds and they hopped and sang and twittered perked and fluttered all their feathers strutted in their shining plumage and their tails like fans unfolded only oweenee the youngest was not changed but sat in silence wasted wrinkled old and ugly looking sadly at the others till osseo gazing upward gave another cry of anguish such a cry as he had uttered by the oaktree in the forest then returned her youth and beauty and her soiled and tattered garments were transformed to robes of ermine and her staff became a feather yes a shining silver feather and again the wigwam trembled swayed and rushed through airy currents through transparent cloud and vapor and amid celestial splendors on the evening star alighted as a snowflake falls on snowflake as a leaf drops on a river as the thistledown on water forth with cheerful words of welcome came the father of osseo he with radiant locks of silver he with eyes serene and tender and he said my son osseo hang the cage of birds you bring there hang the cage with rods of silver and the birds with glistening feathers at the doorway of my wigwam at the door he hung the birdcage and they entered in and gladly listened to osseos father ruler of the star of evening as he said o my osseo i have had compassion on you given you back your youth and beauty into birds of various plumage changed your sisters and their husbands changed them thus because they mocked you in the figure of the old man in that aspect sad and wrinkled could not see your heart of passion could not see your youth immortal only oweenee the faithful saw your naked heart and loved you in the lodge that glimmers yonder in the little star that twinkles through the vapors on the left hand lives the envious evil spirit the wabeno the magician who transformed you to an old man take heed lest his beams fall on you for the rays he darts around him are the power of his enchantment are the arrows that he uses many years in peace and quiet on the peaceful star of evening dwelt osseo with his father many years in song and flutter at the doorway of the wigwam hung the cage with rods of silver and fair oweenee the faithful bore a son unto osseo with the beauty of his mother with the courage of his father and the boy grew up and prospered and osseo to delight him made him little bows and arrows opened the great cage of silver and let loose his aunts and uncles all those birds with glossy feathers for his little son to shoot at round and round they wheeled and darted filled the evening star with music with their songs of joy and freedom filled the evening star with splendor with the fluttering of their plumage till the boy the little hunter bent his bow and shot an arrow shot a swift and fatal arrow and a bird with shining feathers at his feet fell wounded sorely but o wondrous transformation t was no bird he saw before him t was a beautiful young woman with the arrow in her bosom when her blood fell on the planet on the sacred star of evening broken was the spell of magic powerless was the strange enchantment and the youth the fearless bowman suddenly felt himself descending held by unseen hands but sinking downward through the empty spaces downward through the clouds and vapors till he rested on an island on an island green and grassy yonder in the bigseawater after him he saw descending all the birds with shining feathers fluttering falling wafted downward like the painted leaves of autumn and the lodge with poles of silver with its roof like wings of beetles like the shining shards of beetles by the winds of heaven uplifted slowly sank upon the island bringing back the good osseo bringing oweenee the faithful then the birds again transfigured reassumed the shape of mortals took their shape but not their stature they remained as little people like the pygmies the pukwudjies and on pleasant nights of summer when the evening star was shining hand in hand they danced together on the islands craggy headlands on the sandbeach low and level still their glittering lodge is seen there on the tranquil summer evenings and upon the shore the fisher sometimes hears their happy voices sees them dancing in the starlight when the story was completed when the wondrous tale was ended looking round upon his listeners solemnly iagoo added there are great men i have known such whom their people understand not whom they even make a jest of scoff and jeer at in derision from the story of osseo let us learn the fate of jesters all the wedding guests delighted listened to the marvellous story listened laughing and applauding and they whispered to each other does he mean himself i wonder and are we the aunts and uncles then again sang chibiabos sang a song of love and longing in those accents sweet and tender in those tones of pensive sadness sang a maidens lamentation for her lover her algonquin when i think of my beloved ah me think of my beloved when my heart is thinking of him o my sweetheart my algonquin ah me when i parted from him round my neck he hung the wampum as a pledge the snowwhite wampum o my sweetheart my algonquin i will go with you he whispered ah me to your native country let me go with you he whispered o my sweetheart my algonquin far away away i answered very far away i answered ah me is my native country o my sweetheart my algonquin when i looked back to behold him where we parted to behold him after me he still was gazing o my sweetheart my algonquin by the tree he still was standing by the fallen tree was standing that had dropped into the water o my sweetheart my algonquin when i think of my beloved ah me think of my beloved when my heart is thinking of him o my sweetheart my algonquin such was hiawathas wedding such the dance of paupukkeewis such the story of iagoo such the songs of chibiabos thus the wedding banquet ended and the wedding guests departed leaving hiawatha happy with the night and minnehaha xiii blessing the cornfields sing o song of hiawatha of the happy days that followed in the land of the ojibways in the pleasant land and peaceful sing the mysteries of mondamin sing the

the garments from mondamin even as hiawatha taught them once when all the maize was planted hiawatha wise and thoughtful spake and said to minnehaha to his wife the laughing water you shall bless

your bed in silence lay aside your garments wholly walk around the fields you planted round the borders of the cornfields covered by your tresses only robed with darkness as a garment thus the fields

dragonfly kwoneshe nor the spider subbekashe nor the grasshopper pahpukkeena nor the mighty caterpillar waymukkwana with the bearskin king of all the caterpillars on the treetops near the cornfields sat the hungry crows and ravens kahgahgee the king of ravens with his band of black marauders and they laughed at hiawatha till the treetops shook with laughter with their melancholy laughter at the words of hiawatha hear him said they hear the wise man hear the plots of hiawatha when the noiseless night descended broad and dark oer field and forest when the mournful wawonaissa sorrowing sang among the hemlocks and the spirit of sleep nepahwin shut the doors of all the wigwams from her bed rose laughing water laid aside her garments wholly and with darkness clothed and guarded unashamed and unaffrighted walked securely round the cornfields drew the sacred magic circle of her footprints round the cornfields no one but the midnight only saw her beauty in the darkness no one but the wawonaissa heard the panting of her bosom guskewau the darkness wrapped her closely in his sacred mantle so that none might see her beauty so that none might boast i saw her on the morrow as the day dawned kahgahgee the king of ravens gathered all his black marauders crows and blackbirds jays and ravens clamorous on the dusky treetops and descended fast and fearless on the fields of hiawatha on the grave of the mondamin we will drag mondamin said they from the grave where he is buried spite of all the magic circles laughing water draws around it spite of all the sacred footprints minnehaha stamps upon it but the wary hiawatha ever thoughtful careful watchful had oerheard the scornful laughter when they mocked him from the treetops kaw he said my friends the ravens kahgahgee my king of ravens i will teach you all a lesson that shall not be soon forgotten he had risen before the daybreak he had spread oer all the cornfields snares to catch the black marauders and was lying now in ambush in the neighboring grove of pinetrees waiting for the crows and blackbirds waiting for the jays and ravens soon they came with caw and clamor rush of wings and cry of voices to their work of devastation settling down upon the cornfields delving deep with beak and talon for the body of mondamin and with all their craft and cunning all their skill in wiles of warfare they perceived no danger near them till their claws became entangled till they found themselves imprisoned in the snares of hiawatha from his place of ambush came he striding terrible among them and so awful was his aspect that the bravest quailed with terror without mercy he destroyed them right and left by tens and twenties and their wretched lifeless bodies hung aloft on poles for scarecrows round the consecrated cornfields as a signal of his vengeance as a warning to marauders only kahgahgee the leader kahgahgee the king of ravens he alone was spared among them as a hostage for his people with his prisonerstring he bound him led him captive to his wigwam tied him fast with cords of elmbark to the ridgepole of his wigwam kahgahgee my raven said he you the leader of the robbers you the plotter of this mischief the contriver of this outrage i will keep you i will hold you as a hostage for your people as a pledge of good behavior and he left him grim and sulky sitting in the morning sunshine on the summit of the wigwam croaking fiercely his displeasure flapping his great sable pinions vainly struggling for his freedom vainly calling on his people summer passed and shawondasee breathed his sighs oer all the landscape from the southland sent his ardor wafted kisses warm and tender and the maizefield grew and ripened till it stood in all the splendor of its garments green and yellow of its tassels and its plumage and the maizeears full and shining gleamed from bursting sheaths of verdure then nokomis the old woman spake and said to minnehaha t is the moon when leaves are falling all the wild rice has been gathered and the maize is ripe and ready let us gather in the harvest let us wrestle with mondamin strip him of his plumes and tassels of his garments green and yellow and the merry laughing water went rejoicing from the wigwam with nokomis old and wrinkled and they called the women round them called the young men and the maidens to the harvest of the cornfields to the husking of the maizeear on the border of the forest underneath the fragrant pinetrees sat the old men and the warriors smoking in the pleasant shadow in uninterrupted silence looked they at the gamesome labor of the young men and the women listened to their noisy talking to their laughter and their singing heard them chattering like the magpies heard them laughing like the bluejays heard them singing like the robins and wheneer some lucky maiden found a red ear in the husking found a maizeear red as blood is nushka cried they all together nushka you shall have a sweetheart you shall have a handsome husband ugh the old men all responded from their seats beneath the pinetrees and wheneer a youth or maiden found a crooked ear in husking found a maizeear in the husking blighted mildewed or misshapen then they laughed and sang together crept and limped about the cornfields mimicked in their gait and gestures some old man bent almost double singing singly or together wagemin the thief of cornfields paimosaid who steals the maizeear till the cornfields rang with laughter till from hiawathas wigwam kahgahgee the king of ravens screamed and quivered in his anger and from all the neighboring treetops cawed and croaked the black marauders ugh the old men all responded from their seats beneath the pinetrees xiv picturewriting in those days said hiawatha lo how all things fade and perish from the memory of the old men pass away the great traditions the achievements of the warriors the adventures of the hunters all the wisdom of the medas all the craft of the wabenos all the marvellous dreams and visions of the jossakeeds the prophets great men die and are forgotten wise men speak their words of wisdom perish in the ears that hear them do not reach the generations that as yet unborn are waiting in the great mysterious darkness of the speechless days that shall be on the graveposts of our fathers are no signs no figures painted who are in those graves we know not only know they are our fathers of what kith they are and kindred from what old ancestral totem be it eagle bear or beaver they descended this we know not only know they are our fathers face to face we speak together but we cannot speak when absent cannot send our voices from us to the friends that dwell afar off cannot send a secret message but the bearer learns our secret may pervert it may betray it may reveal it unto others thus said hiawatha walking in the solitary forest pondering musing in the forest on the welfare of his people from his pouch he took his colors took his paints of different colors on the smooth bark of a birchtree painted many shapes and figures wonderful and mystic figures and each figure had a meaning each some word or thought suggested gitche manito the mighty he the master of life was painted as an egg with points projecting to the four winds of the heavens everywhere is the great spirit was the meaning of this symbol gitche manito the mighty he the dreadful spirit of evil as a serpent was depicted as kenabeek the great serpent very crafty very cunning is the creeping spirit of evil was the meaning of this symbol life and death he drew as circles life was white but death was darkened sun and moon and stars he painted man and beast and fish and reptile forests mountains lakes and rivers for the earth he drew a straight line for the sky a bow above it white the space between for daytime filled with little stars for nighttime on the left a point for sunrise on the right a point for sunset on the top a point for noontide and for rain and cloudy weather waving lines descending from it footprints pointing towards a wigwam were a sign of invitation were a sign of guests assembling bloody hands with palms uplifted were a symbol of destruction were a hostile sign and symbol all these things did hiawatha show unto his wondering people and interpreted their meaning and he said behold your graveposts have no mark no sign nor symbol go and paint them all with figures each one with its household symbol with its own ancestral totem so that those who follow after may distinguish them and know them and they painted on the graveposts on the graves yet unforgotten each his own ancestral totem each the symbol of his household figures of the bear and reindeer of the turtle crane and beaver each inverted as a token that the owner was departed that the chief who bore the symbol lay beneath in dust and ashes and the jossakeeds the prophets the wabenos the magicians and the medicinemen the medas painted upon bark and deerskin figures for the songs they chanted for each song a separate symbol figures mystical and awful figures strange and brightly colored and each figure had its meaning each some magic song suggested the great spirit the creator flashing light through all the heaven the great serpent the kenabeek with his bloody crest erected creeping looking into heaven in the sky the sun that listens and the moon eclipsed and dying owl and eagle crane and henhawk and the cormorant bird of magic headless men that walk the heavens bodies lying pierced with arrows bloody hands of death uplifted flags on graves and great warcaptains grasping both the earth and heaven such as these the shapes they painted on the birchbark and the deerskin songs of war and songs of hunting songs of medicine and of magic all were written in these figures for each figure had its meaning each its separate song recorded nor forgotten was the lovesong the most subtle of all medicines the most potent spell of magic dangerous more than war or hunting thus the lovesong was recorded symbol and interpretation first a human figure standing painted in the brightest scarlet t is the lover the musician and the meaning is my painting makes me powerful over others then the figure seated singing playing on a drum of magic and the interpretation listen t is my voice you hear my singing then the same red figure seated in the shelter of a wigwam and the meaning of the symbol i will come and sit beside you in the mystery of my passion then two figures man and woman standing hand in hand together with their hands so clasped together that they seemed in one united and the words thus represented are i see your heart within you and your cheeks are red with blushes next the maiden on an island in the centre of an island and the song this shape suggested was though you were at a distance were upon some faroff island such the spell i cast upon you such the magic power of passion i could straightway draw you to me then the figure of the maiden sleeping and the lover near her whispering to her in her slumbers saying though you were far from me in the land of sleep and silence still the voice of love would reach you and the last of all the figures was a heart within a circle drawn within a magic circle and the image had this meaning naked lies your heart before me to your naked heart i whisper thus it was that hiawatha in his wisdom taught the people all the mysteries of painting all the art of picturewriting on the smooth bark of the birchtree on the white skin of the reindeer on the graveposts of the village xv hiawathas lamentation in those days the evil spirits all the manitos of mischief fearing hiawathas wisdom and his love for chibiabos jealous of their faithful friendship and their noble words and actions made at length a league against them to molest them and destroy them hiawatha wise and wary often said to chibiabos o my brother do not leave me lest the evil spirits harm you chibiabos young and heedless laughing shook his coalblack tresses answered ever sweet and childlike do not fear for me o brother harm and evil come not near me once when peboan the winter roofed with ice the bigseawater when the snowflakes whirling downward hissed among the withered oakleaves changed the pinetrees into wigwams covered all the earth with silence armed with arrows shod with snowshoes heeding not his brothers warning fearing not the evil spirits forth to hunt the deer with antlers all alone went chibiabos right across the bigseawater sprang with speed the deer before him with the wind and snow he followed oer the treacherous ice he followed wild with all the fierce commotion and the rapture of the hunting but beneath the evil spirits lay in ambush waiting for him broke the treacherous ice beneath him dragged him downward to the bottom buried in the sand his body unktahee the god of water he the god of the dacotahs drowned him in the deep abysses of the lake of gitche gumee from the headlands hiawatha sent forth such a wail of anguish such a fearful lamentation that the bison paused to listen and the wolves howled from the prairies and the thunder in the distance starting answered baimwawa then his face with black he painted with his robe his head he covered in his wigwam sat lamenting seven long weeks he sat lamenting uttering still this moan of sorrow he is dead the sweet musician he the sweetest of all singers he has gone from us forever he has moved a little nearer to the master of all music to the master of all singing o my brother chibiabos and the melancholy firtrees waved their dark green fans above him waved their purple cones above him sighing with him to console him mingling with his lamentation their complaining their lamenting came the spring and all the forest looked in vain for chibiabos sighed the rivulet sebowisha sighed the rushes in the meadow from the treetops sang the bluebird sang the bluebird the owaissa chibiabos chibiabos he is dead the sweet musician from the wigwam sang the robin sang the robin the opechee chibiabos chibiabos he is dead the sweetest singer and at night through all the forest went the whippoorwill complaining wailing went the wawonaissa chibiabos chibiabos he is dead the sweet musician he the sweetest of all singers then the medicinemen the medas the magicians the wabenos and the jossakeeds the prophets came to visit hiawatha built a sacred lodge beside him to appease him to console him walked in silent grave procession bearing each a pouch of healing skin of beaver lynx or otter filled with magic roots and simples filled with very potent medicines when he heard their steps approaching hiawatha ceased lamenting called no more on chibiabos naught he questioned naught he answered but his mournful head uncovered from his face the mourning colors washed he slowly and in silence slowly and in silence followed onward to the sacred wigwam there a magic drink they gave him made of nahmawusk the spearmint and wabenowusk the yarrow roots of power and herbs of healing beat their drums and shook their rattles chanted singly and in chorus mystic songs like these they chanted i myself myself behold me t is the great gray eagle talking come ye white crows come and hear him the loudspeaking thunder helps me all the unseen spirits help me i can hear their voices calling all around the sky i hear them i can blow you strong my brother i can heal you hiawatha hiauha replied the chorus wayhaway the mystic chorus friends of mine are all the serpents hear me shake my skin of henhawk mahng the white loon i can kill him i can shoot your heart and kill it i can blow you strong my brother i can heal you hiawatha hiauha replied the chorus wayhaway the mystic chorus i myself myself the prophet when i speak the wigwam trembles shakes the sacred lodge with terror hands unseen begin to shake it when i walk the sky i tread on bends and makes a noise beneath me i can blow you strong my brother rise and speak o hiawatha hiauha replied the chorus wayhaway the mystic chorus then they shook their medicinepouches oer the head of hiawatha danced their medicinedance around him and upstarting wild and haggard like a man from dreams awakened he was healed of all his madness as the clouds are swept from heaven straightway from his brain departed all his moody melancholy as the ice is swept from rivers straightway from his heart departed all his sorrow and affliction then they summoned chibiabos from his grave beneath the waters from the sands of gitche gumee summoned hiawathas brother and so mighty was the magic of that cry and invocation that he heard it as he lay there underneath the bigseawater from the sand he rose and listened heard the music and the singing came obedient to the summons to the doorway of the wigwam but to enter they forbade him through a chink a coal they gave him through the door a burning firebrand ruler in the land of spirits ruler oer the dead they made him telling him a fire to kindle for all those that died thereafter campfires for their night encampments on their solitary journey to the kingdom of ponemah to the land of the hereafter from the village of his childhood from the homes of those who knew him passing silent through the forest like a smokewreath wafted sideways slowly vanished chibiabos where he passed the branches moved not where he trod the grasses bent not and the fallen leaves of last year made no sound beneath his footstep four whole days he journeyed onward down the pathway of the dead men on the deadmans strawberry feasted crossed the melancholy river on the swinging log he crossed it came unto the lake of silver in the stone canoe was carried to the islands of the blessed to the land of ghosts and shadows on that journey moving slowly many weary spirits saw he panting under heavy burdens laden with warclubs bows and arrows robes of fur and pots and kettles and with food that friends had given for that solitary journey ay why do the living said they lay such heavy burdens on us better were it to go naked better were it to go fasting than to bear such heavy burdens on our long and weary journey forth then issued hiawatha wandered eastward wandered westward teaching men the use of simples and the antidotes for poisons and the cure of all diseases thus was first made known to mortals all the mystery of medamin all the sacred art of healing xvi paupukkeewis you shall hear how paupukkeewis he the handsome yenadizze whom the people called the stormfool vexed the village with disturbance you shall hear of all his mischief and his flight from hiawatha and his wondrous transmigrations and the end of his adventures on the shores of gitche gumee on the dunes of nagow wudjoo by the shining bigseawater stood the lodge of paupukkeewis it was he who in his frenzy whirled these drifting sands together on the dunes of nagow wudjoo when among the guests assembled he so merrily and madly danced at hiawathas wedding danced the beggars dance to please them now in search of new adventures from his lodge went paupukkeewis came with speed into the village found the young men all assembled in the lodge of old iagoo listening to his monstrous stories to his wonderful adventures he was telling them the story of ojeeg the summermaker how he made a hole in heaven how he climbed up into heaven and let out the summerweather the perpetual pleasant summer how the otter first essayed it how the beaver lynx and badger tried in turn the great achievement from the summit of the mountain smote their fists against the heavens smote against the sky their foreheads cracked the sky but could not break it how the wolverine uprising made him ready for the encounter bent his knees down like a squirrel drew his arms back like a cricket once he leaped said old iagoo once he leaped and lo above him bent the sky as ice in rivers when the waters rise beneath it twice he leaped and lo above him cracked the sky as ice in rivers when the freshet is at highest thrice he leaped and lo above him broke the shattered sky asunder and he disappeared within it and ojeeg the fisher weasel with a bound went in behind him hark you shouted paupukkeewis as he entered at the doorway i am tired of all this talking tired of old iagoos stories tired of hiawathas wisdom here is something to amuse you better than this endless talking then from out his pouch of wolfskin forth he drew with solemn manner all the game of bowl and counters pugasaing with thirteen pieces white on one side were they painted and vermilion on the other two kenabeeks or great serpents two ininewug or wedgemen one great warclub pugamaugun and one slender fish the keego four round pieces ozawabeeks and three sheshebwug or ducklings all were made of bone and painted all except the ozawabeeks these were brass on one side burnished and were black upon the other in a wooden bowl he placed them shook and jostled them together threw them on the ground before him thus exclaiming and explaining red side up are all the pieces and one great kenabeek standing on the bright side of a brass piece on a burnished ozawabeek thirteen tens and eight are counted then again he shook the pieces shook and jostled them together threw them on the ground before him still exclaiming and explaining white are both the great kenabeeks white the ininewug the wedgemen red are all the other pieces five tens and an eight are counted thus he taught the game of hazard thus displayed it and explained it running through its various chances various changes various meanings twenty curious eyes stared at him full of eagerness stared at him many games said old iagoo many games of skill and hazard have i seen in different nations have i played in different countries he who plays with old iagoo must have very nimble fingers though you think yourself so skilful i can beat you paupukkeewis i can even give you lessons in your game of bowl and counters so they sat and played together all the old men and the young men played for dresses weapons wampum played till midnight played till morning played until the yenadizze till the cunning paupukkeewis of their treasures had despoiled them of the best of all their dresses shirts of deerskin robes of ermine belts of wampum crests of feathers warlike weapons pipes and pouches twenty eyes glared wildly at him like the eyes of wolves glared at him said the lucky paupukkeewis in my wigwam i am lonely in my wanderings and adventures i have need of a companion fain would have a meshinauwa an attendant and pipebearer i will venture all these winnings all these garments heaped about me all this wampum all these feathers on a single throw will venture all against the young man yonder t was a youth of sixteen summers t was a nephew of iagoo faceinamist the people called him as the fire burns in a pipehead dusky red beneath the ashes so beneath his shaggy eyebrows glowed the eyes of old iagoo ugh he answered very fiercely ugh they answered all and each one seized the wooden bowl the old man closely in his bony fingers clutched the fatal bowl onagon shook it fiercely and with fury made the pieces ring together as he threw them down before him red were both the great kenabeeks red the ininewug the wedgemen red the sheshebwug the ducklings black the four brass ozawabeeks white alone the fish the keego only five the pieces counted then the smiling paupukkeewis shook the bowl and threw the pieces lightly in the air he tossed them and they fell about him scattered dark and bright the ozawabeeks red and white the other pieces and upright among the others one ininewug was standing even as crafty paupukkeewis stood alone among the players saying five tens mine the game is twenty eyes glared at him fiercely like the eyes of wolves glared at him as he turned and left the wigwam followed by his meshinauwa by the nephew of iagoo by the tall and graceful stripling bearing in his arms the winnings shirts of deerskin robes of ermine belts of wampum pipes and weapons carry them said paupukkeewis pointing with his fan of feathers to my wigwam far to eastward on the dunes of nagow wudjoo hot and red with smoke and gambling were the eyes of paupukkeewis as he came forth to the freshness of the pleasant summer morning all the birds were singing gayly all the streamlets flowing swiftly and the heart of paupukkeewis sang with pleasure as the birds sing beat with triumph like the streamlets as he wandered through the village in the early gray of morning with his fan of turkeyfeathers with his plumes and tufts of swans down till he reached the farthest wigwam reached the lodge of hiawatha silent was it and deserted no one met him at the doorway no one came to bid him welcome but the birds were singing round it in and out and round the doorway hopping singing fluttering feeding and aloft upon the ridgepole kahgahgee the king of ravens sat with fiery eyes and screaming flapped his wings at paupukkeewis all are gone the lodge is empty thus it was spake paupukkeewis in his heart resolving mischief gone is wary hiawatha gone the silly laughing water gone nokomis the old woman and the lodge is left unguarded by the neck he seized the raven whirled it round him like a rattle like a medicinepouch he shook it strangled kahgahgee the raven from the ridgepole of the wigwam left its lifeless body hanging as an insult to its master as a taunt to hiawatha with a stealthy step he entered round the lodge in wild disorder threw the household things about him piled together in confusion bowls of wood and earthen kettles robes of buffalo and beaver skins of otter lynx and ermine as an insult to nokomis as a taunt to minnehaha then departed paupukkeewis whistling singing through the forest whistling gayly to the squirrels who from hollow boughs above him dropped their acornshells upon him singing gayly to the wood birds who from out the leafy darkness answered with a song as merry then he climbed the rocky headlands looking oer the gitche gumee perched himself upon their summit waiting full of mirth and mischief the return of hiawatha stretched upon his back he lay there far below him splashed the waters plashed and washed the dreamy waters far above him swam the heavens swam the dizzy dreamy heavens round him hovered fluttered rustled hiawathas mountain chickens flockwise swept and wheeled about him almost brushed him with their pinions and he killed them as he lay there slaughtered them by tens and twenties threw their bodies down the headland threw them on the beach below him till at length kayoshk the seagull perched upon a crag above them shouted it is paupukkeewis he is slaying us by hundreds send a message to our brother tidings send to hiawatha xvii the hunting of paupukkeewis full of wrath was hiawatha when he came into the village found the people in confusion heard of all the misdemeanors all the malice and the mischief of the cunning paupukkeewis hard his breath came through his nostrils through his teeth he buzzed and muttered words of anger and resentment hot and humming like a hornet i will slay this paupukkeewis slay this mischiefmaker said he not so long and wide the world is not so rude and rough the way is that my wrath shall not attain him that my vengeance shall not reach him then in swift pursuit departed hiawatha and the hunters on the trail of paupukkeewis through the forest where he passed it to the headlands where he rested but they found not paupukkeewis only in the trampled grasses in the whortleberrybushes found the couch where he had rested found the impress of his body from the lowlands far beneath them from the muskoday the meadow paupukkeewis turning backward made a gesture of defiance made a gesture of derision and aloud cried hiawatha from the summit of the mountains not so long and wide the world is not so rude and rough the way is but my wrath shall overtake you and my vengeance shall attain you over rock and over river through bush and brake and forest ran the cunning paupukkeewis like an antelope he bounded till he came unto a streamlet in the middle of the forest to a streamlet still and tranquil that had overflowed its margin to a dam made by the beavers to a pond of quiet water where kneedeep the trees were standing where the water lilies floated where the rushes waved and whispered on the dam stood paupukkeewis on the dam of trunks and branches through whose chinks the water spouted oer whose summit flowed the streamlet from the bottom rose the beaver looked with two great eyes of wonder eyes that seemed to ask a question at the stranger paupukkeewis on the dam stood paupukkeewis oer his ankles flowed the streamlet flowed the bright and silvery water and he spake unto the beaver with a smile he spake in this wise o my friend ahmeek the beaver cool and pleasant is the water let me dive into the water let me rest there in your lodges change me too into a beaver cautiously replied the beaver with reserve he thus made answer let me first consult the others let me ask the other beavers down he sank into the water heavily sank he as a stone sinks down among the leaves and branches brown and matted at the bottom on the dam stood paupukkeewis oer his ankles flowed the streamlet spouted through the chinks below him dashed upon the stones beneath him spread serene and calm before him and the sunshine and the shadows fell in flecks and gleams upon him fell in little shining patches through the waving rustling branches from the bottom rose the beavers silently above the surface rose one head and then another till the pond seemed full of beavers full of black and shining faces to the beavers paupukkeewis spake entreating said in this wise very pleasant is your dwelling o my friends and safe from danger can you not with all your cunning all your wisdom and contrivance change me too into a beaver yes replied ahmeek the beaver he the king of all the beavers let yourself slide down among us down into the tranquil water down into the pond among them silently sank paupukkeewis black became his shirt of deerskin black his moccasins and leggings in a broad black tail behind him spread his foxtails and his fringes he was changed into a beaver make me large said paupukkeewis make me large and make me larger larger than the other beavers yes the beaver chief responded when our lodge below you enter in our wigwam we will make you ten times larger than the others thus into the clear brown water silently sank paupukkeewis found the bottom covered over with the trunks of trees and branches hoards of food against the winter piles and heaps against the famine found the lodge with arching doorway leading into spacious chambers here they made him large and larger made him largest of the beavers ten times larger than the others you shall be our ruler said they chief and king of all the beavers but not long had paupukkeewis sat in state among the beavers when there came a voice of warning from the watchman at his station in the waterflags and lilies saying here is hiawatha hiawatha with his hunters then they heard a cry above them heard a shouting and a tramping heard a crashing and a rushing and the water round and oer them sank and sucked away in eddies and they knew their dam was broken on the lodges roof the hunters leaped and broke it all asunder streamed the sunshine through the crevice sprang the beavers through the doorway hid themselves in deeper water in the channel of the streamlet but the mighty paupukkeewis could not pass beneath the doorway he was puffed with pride and feeding he was swollen like a bladder through the roof looked hiawatha cried aloud o paupukkeewis vain are all your craft and cunning vain your manifold disguises well i know you paupukkeewis with their clubs they beat and bruised him beat to death poor paupukkeewis pounded him as maize is pounded till his skull was crushed to pieces six tall hunters lithe and limber bore him home on poles and branches bore the body of the beaver but the ghost the jeebi in him thought and felt as paupukkeewis still lived on as paupukkeewis and it fluttered strove and struggled waving hither waving thither as the curtains of a wigwam struggle with their thongs of deerskin when the wintry wind is blowing till it drew itself together till it rose up from the body till it took the form and features of the cunning paupukkeewis vanishing into the forest but the wary hiawatha saw the figure ere it vanished saw the form of paupukkeewis glide into the soft blue shadow of the pinetrees of the forest toward the squares of white beyond it toward an opening in the forest like a wind it rushed and panted bending all the boughs before it and behind it as the rain comes came the steps of hiawatha to a lake with many islands came the breathless paupukkeewis where among the waterlilies pishnekuh the brant were sailing through the tufts of rushes floating steering through the reedy islands now their broad black beaks they lifted now they plunged beneath the water now they darkened in the shadow now they brightened in the sunshine pishnekuh cried paupukkeewis pishnekuh my brothers said he change me to a brant with plumage with a shining neck and feathers make me large and make me larger ten times larger than the others straightway to a brant they changed him with two huge and dusky pinions with a bosom smooth and rounded with a bill like two great paddles made him larger than the others ten times larger than the largest just as shouting from the forest on the shore stood hiawatha up they rose with cry and clamor with a whir and beat of pinions rose up from the reedy islands from the waterflags and lilies and they said to paupukkeewis in your flying look not downward take good heed and look not downward lest some strange mischance should happen lest some great mishap befall you fast and far they fled to northward fast and far through mist and sunshine fed among the moors and fenlands slept among the reeds and rushes on the morrow as they journeyed buoyed and lifted by the southwind wafted onward by the southwind blowing fresh and strong behind them rose a sound of human voices rose a clamor from beneath them from the lodges of a village from the people miles beneath them for the people of the village saw the flock of brant with wonder saw the wings of paupukkeewis flapping far up in the ether broader than two doorway curtains paupukkeewis heard the shouting knew the voice of hiawatha knew the outcry of iagoo and forgetful of the warning drew his neck in and looked downward and the wind that blew behind him caught his mighty fan of feathers sent him wheeling whirling downward all in vain did paupukkeewis struggle to regain his balance whirling round and round and downward he beheld in turn the village and in turn the flock above him saw the village coming nearer and the flock receding farther heard the voices growing louder heard the shouting and the laughter saw no more the flocks above him only saw the earth beneath him dead out of the empty heaven dead among the shouting people with a heavy sound and sullen fell the brant with broken pinions but his soul his ghost his shadow still survived as paupukkeewis took again the form and features of the handsome yenadizze and again went rushing onward followed fast by hiawatha crying not so wide the world is not so long and rough the way is but my wrath shall overtake you but my vengeance shall attain you and so near he came so near him that his hand was stretched to seize him his right hand to seize and hold him when the cunning paupukkeewis whirled and spun about in circles fanned the air into a whirlwind danced the dust and leaves about him and amid the whirling eddies sprang into a hollow oaktree changed himself into a serpent gliding out through root and rubbish with his right hand hiawatha smote amain the hollow oaktree rent it into shreds and splinters left it lying there in fragments but in vain for paupukkeewis once again in human figure full in sight ran on before him sped away in gust and whirlwind on the shores of gitche gumee westward by the bigseawater came unto the rocky headlands to the pictured rocks of sandstone looking over lake and landscape and the old man of the mountain he the manito of mountains opened wide his rocky doorways opened wide his deep abysses giving paupukkeewis shelter in his caverns dark and dreary bidding paupukkeewis welcome to his gloomy lodge of sandstone there without stood hiawatha found the doorways closed against him with his mittens minjekahwun smote great caverns in the sandstone cried aloud in tones of thunder open i am hiawatha but the old man of the mountain opened not and made no answer from the silent crags of sandstone from the gloomy rock abysses then he raised his hands to heaven called imploring on the tempest called waywassimo the lightning and the thunder annemeekee and they came with night and darkness sweeping down the bigseawater from the distant thunder mountains and the trembling paupukkeewis heard the footsteps of the thunder saw the red eyes of the lightning was afraid and crouched and trembled then waywassimo the lightning smote the doorways of the caverns with his warclub smote the doorways smote the jutting crags of sandstone and the thunder annemeekee shouted down into the caverns saying where is paupukkeewis and the crags fell and beneath them dead among the rocky ruins lay the cunning paupukkeewis lay the handsome yenadizze slain in his own human figure ended were his wild adventures ended were his tricks and gambols ended all his craft and cunning ended all his mischiefmaking all his gambling and his dancing all his wooing of the maidens then the noble hiawatha took his soul his ghost his shadow spake and said o paupukkeewis never more in human figure shall you search for new adventures never more with jest and laughter dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds but above there in the heavens you shall soar and sail in circles i will change you to an eagle to keneu the great wareagle chief of all the fowls with feathers chief of hiawathas chickens and the name of paupukkeewis lingers still among the people lingers still among the singers and among the storytellers and in winter when the snowflakes whirl in eddies round the lodges when the wind in gusty tumult oer the smokeflue pipes and whistles there they cry comes paupukkeewis he is dancing through the village he is gathering in his harvest xviii the death of kwasind far and wide among the nations spread the name and fame of kwasind no man dared to strive with kwasind no man could compete with kwasind but the mischievous pukwudjies they the envious little people they the fairies and the pygmies plotted and conspired against him if this hateful kwasind said they if this great outrageous fellow goes on thus a little longer tearing everything he touches rending everything to pieces filling all the world with wonder what becomes of the pukwudjies who will care for the pukwudjies he will tread us down like mushrooms drive us all into the water give our bodies to be eaten by the wicked neebanawbaigs by the spirits of the water so the angry little people all conspired against the strong man all conspired to murder kwasind yes to rid the world of kwasind the audacious overbearing heartless haughty dangerous kwasind now this wondrous strength of kwasind in his crown alone was seated in his crown too was his weakness there alone could he be wounded nowhere else could weapon pierce him nowhere else could weapon harm him even there the only weapon that could wound him that could slay him was the seedcone of the pinetree was the blue cone of the firtree this was kwasinds fatal secret known to no man among mortals but the cunning little people the pukwudjies knew the secret knew the only way to kill him so they gathered cones together gathered seedcones of the pinetree gathered blue cones of the firtree in the woods by taquamenaw brought them to the rivers margin heaped them in great piles together where the red rocks from the margin jutting overhang the river there they lay in wait for kwasind the malicious little people t was an afternoon in summer very hot and still the air was very smooth the gliding river motionless the sleeping shadows insects glistened in the sunshine insects skated on the water filled the drowsy air with buzzing with a far resounding warcry down the river came the strong man in his birch canoe came kwasind floating slowly down the current of the sluggish taquamenaw very languid with the weather very sleepy with the silence from the overhanging branches from the tassels of the birchtrees soft the spirit of sleep descended by his airy hosts surrounded his invisible attendants came the spirit of sleep nepahwin like a burnished dushkwoneshe like a dragonfly he hovered oer the drowsy head of kwasind to his ear there came a murmur as of waves upon a seashore as of faroff tumbling waters as of winds among the pinetrees and he felt upon his forehead blows of little airy warclubs wielded by the slumbrous legions of the spirit of sleep nepahwin as of some one breathing on him at the first blow of their warclubs fell a drowsiness on kwasind at the second blow they smote him motionless his paddle rested at the third before his vision reeled the landscape into darkness very sound asleep was kwasind so he floated down the river like a blind man seated upright floated down the taquamenaw underneath the trembling birchtrees underneath the wooded headlands underneath the war encampment of the pygmies the pukwudjies there they stood all armed and waiting hurled the pinecones down upon him struck him on his brawny shoulders on his crown defenceless struck him death to kwasind was the sudden warcry of the little people and he sideways swayed and tumbled sideways fell into the river plunged beneath the sluggish water headlong as an otter plunges and the birch canoe abandoned drifted empty down the river bottom upward swerved and drifted nothing more was seen of kwasind but the memory of the strong man lingered long among the people and whenever through the forest raged and roared the wintry tempest and the branches tossed and troubled creaked and groaned and split asunder kwasind cried they that is kwasind he is gathering in his firewood xix the ghosts never stoops the soaring vulture on his quarry in the desert on the sick or wounded bison but another vulture watching from his high aerial lookout sees the downward plunge and follows and a third pursues the second coming from the invisible ether first a speck and then a vulture till the air is dark with pinions so disasters come not singly but as if they watched and waited scanning one anothers motions when the first descends the others follow follow gathering flockwise round their victim sick and wounded first a shadow then a sorrow till the air is dark with anguish now oer all the dreary northland mighty peboan the winter breathing on the lakes and rivers into stone had changed their waters from his hair he shook the snowflakes till the plains were strewn with whiteness one uninterrupted level as if stooping the creator with his hand had smoothed them over through the forest wide and wailing roamed the hunter on his snowshoes in the village worked the women pounded maize or dressed the deerskin and the young men played together on the ice the noisy ballplay on the plain the dance of snowshoes one dark evening after sundown in her wigwam laughing water sat with old nokomis waiting for the steps of hiawatha homeward from the hunt returning on their faces gleamed the firelight painting them with streaks of crimson in the eyes of old nokomis glimmered like the watery moonlight in the eyes of laughing water glistened like the sun in water and behind them crouched their shadows in the corners of the wigwam and the smoke in wreaths above them climbed and crowded through the smokeflue then the curtain of the doorway from without was slowly lifted brighter glowed the fire a moment and a moment swerved the smokewreath as two women entered softly passed the doorway uninvited without word of salutation without sign of recognition sat down in the farthest corner crouching low among the shadows from their aspect and their garments strangers seemed they in the village very pale and haggard were they as they sat there sad and silent trembling cowering with the shadows was it the wind above the smokeflue muttering down into the wigwam was it the owl the kokokoho hooting from the dismal forest sure a voice said in the silence these are corpses clad in garments these are ghosts that come to haunt you from the kingdom of ponemah from the land of the hereafter homeward now came hiawatha from his hunting in the forest with the snow upon his tresses and the red deer on his shoulders at the feet of laughing water down he threw his lifeless burden nobler handsomer she thought him than when first he came to woo her first threw down the deer before her as a token of his wishes as a promise of the future then he turned and saw the strangers cowering crouching with the shadows said within himself who are they what strange guests has minnehaha but he questioned not the strangers only spake to bid them welcome to his lodge his food his fireside when the evening meal was ready and the deer had been divided both the pallid guests the strangers springing from among the shadows seized upon the choicest portions seized the white fat of the roebuck set apart for laughing water for the wife of hiawatha without asking without thanking eagerly devoured the morsels flitted back among the shadows in the corner of the wigwam not a word spake hiawatha not a motion made nokomis not a gesture laughing water not a change came oer their features only minnehaha softly whispered saying they are famished let them do what best delights them let them eat for they are famished many a daylight dawned and darkened many a night shook off the daylight as the pine shakes off the snowflakes from the midnight of its branches day by day the guests unmoving sat there silent in the wigwam but by night in storm or starlight forth they went into the forest bringing firewood to the wigwam bringing pinecones for the burning always sad and always silent and whenever hiawatha came from fishing or from hunting when the evening meal was ready and the food had been divided gliding from their darksome corner came the pallid guests the strangers seized upon the choicest portions set aside for laughing water and without rebuke or question flitted back among the shadows never once had hiawatha by a word or look reproved them never once had old nokomis made a gesture of impatience never once had laughing water shown resentment at the outrage all had they endured in silence that the rights of guest and stranger that the virtue of freegiving by a look might not be lessened by a word might not be broken once at midnight hiawatha ever wakeful ever watchful in the wigwam dimly lighted by the brands that still were burning by the glimmering flickering firelight heard a sighing oft repeated from his couch rose hiawatha from his shaggy hides of bison pushed aside the deerskin curtain saw the pallid guests the shadows sitting upright on their couches weeping in the silent midnight and he said o guests why is it that your hearts are so afflicted that you sob so in the midnight has perchance the old nokomis has my wife my minnehaha wronged or grieved you by unkindness failed in hospitable duties then the shadows ceased from weeping ceased from sobbing and lamenting and they said with gentle voices we are ghosts of the departed souls of those who once were with you from the realms of chibiabos hither have we come to try you hither have we come to warn you cries of grief and lamentation reach us in the blessed islands cries of anguish from the living calling back their friends departed sadden us with useless sorrow therefore have we come to try you no one knows us no one heeds us we are but a burden to you and we see that the departed have no place among the living think of this o hiawatha speak of it to all the people that henceforward and forever they no more with lamentations sadden the souls of the departed in the islands of the blessed do not lay such heavy burdens in the graves of those you bury not such weight of furs and wampum not such weight of pots and kettles for the spirits faint beneath them only give them food to carry only give them fire to light them four days is the spirits journey to the land of ghosts and shadows four its lonely night encampments four times must their fires be lighted therefore when the dead are buried let a fire as night approaches four times on the grave be kindled that the soul upon its journey may not lack the cheerful firelight may not grope about in darkness farewell noble hiawatha we have put you to the trial to the proof have put your patience by the insult of our presence by the outrage of our actions we have found you great and noble fail not in the greater trial faint not in the harder struggle when they ceased a sudden darkness fell and filled the silent wigwam hiawatha heard a rustle as of garments trailing by him heard the curtain of the doorway lifted by a hand he saw not felt the cold breath of the night air for a moment saw the starlight but he saw the ghosts no longer saw no more the wandering spirits from the kingdom of ponemah from the land of the hereafter xx the famine oh the long and dreary winter oh the cold and cruel winter ever thicker thicker thicker froze the ice on lake and river ever deeper deeper deeper fell the snow oer all the landscape fell the covering snow and drifted through the forest round the village hardly from his buried wigwam could the hunter force a passage with his mittens and his snowshoes vainly walked he through the forest sought for bird or beast and found none saw no track of deer or rabbit in the snow beheld no footprints in the ghastly gleaming forest fell and could not rise from weakness perished there from cold and hunger oh the famine and the fever oh the wasting of the famine oh the blasting of the fever oh the wailing of the children oh the anguish of the women all the earth was sick and famished hungry was the air around them hungry was the sky above them and the hungry stars in heaven like the eyes of wolves glared at them into hiawathas wigwam came two other guests as silent as the ghosts were and as gloomy waited not to be invited did not parley at the doorway sat there without word of welcome in the seat of laughing water looked with haggard eyes and hollow at the face of laughing water and the foremost said behold me i am famine bukadawin and the other said behold me i am fever ahkosewin and the lovely minnehaha shuddered as they looked upon her shuddered at the words they uttered lay down on her bed in silence hid her face but made no answer lay there trembling freezing burning at the looks they cast upon her at the fearful words they uttered forth into the empty forest rushed the maddened hiawatha in his heart was deadly sorrow in his face a stony firmness on his brow the sweat of anguish started but it froze and fell not wrapped in furs and armed for hunting with his mighty bow of ashtree with his quiver full of arrows with his mittens minjekahwun into the vast and vacant forest on his snowshoes strode he forward gitche manito the mighty cried he with his face uplifted in that bitter hour of anguish give your children food o father give us food or we must perish give me food for minnehaha for my dying minnehaha through the farresounding forest through the forest vast and vacant rang that cry of desolation but there came no other answer than the echo of his crying than the echo of the woodlands minnehaha minnehaha all day long roved hiawatha in that melancholy forest through the shadow of whose thickets in the pleasant days of summer of that neer forgotten summer he had brought his young wife homeward from the land of the dacotahs when the birds sang in the thickets and the streamlets laughed and glistened and the air was full of fragrance and the lovely laughing water said with voice that did not tremble i will follow you my husband in the wigwam with nokomis with those gloomy guests that watched her with the famine and the fever she was lying the beloved she the dying minnehaha hark she said i hear a rushing hear a roaring and a rushing hear the falls of minnehaha calling to me from a distance no my child said old nokomis t is the nightwind in the pinetrees look she said i see my father standing lonely at his doorway beckoning to me from his wigwam in the land of the dacotahs no my child said old nokomis t is the smoke that waves and beckons ah said she the eyes of pauguk glare upon me in the darkness i can feel his icy fingers clasping mine amid the darkness hiawatha hiawatha and the desolate hiawatha far away amid the forest miles away among the mountains heard that sudden cry of anguish heard the voice of minnehaha calling to him in the darkness hiawatha hiawatha over snowfields waste and pathless under snowencumbered branches homeward hurried hiawatha emptyhanded heavyhearted heard nokomis moaning wailing wahonowin wahonowin would that i had perished for you would that i were dead as you are wahonowin wahonowin and he rushed into the wigwam saw the old nokomis slowly rocking to and fro and moaning saw his lovely minnehaha lying dead and cold before him and his bursting heart within him uttered such a cry of anguish that the forest moaned and shuddered that the very stars in heaven shook and trembled with his anguish then he sat down still and speechless on the bed of minnehaha at the feet of laughing water at those willing feet that never more would lightly run to meet him never more would lightly follow with both hands his face he covered seven long days and nights he sat there as if in a swoon he sat there speechless motionless unconscious of the daylight or the darkness then they buried minnehaha in the snow a grave they made her in the forest deep and darksome underneath the moaning hemlocks clothed her in her richest garments wrapped her in her robes of ermine covered her with snow like ermine thus they buried minnehaha and at night a fire was lighted on her grave four times was kindled for her soul upon its journey to the islands of the blessed from his doorway hiawatha saw it burning in the forest lighting up the gloomy hemlocks from his sleepless bed uprising from the bed of minnehaha stood and watched it at the doorway that it might not be extinguished might not leave her in the darkness farewell said he minnehaha farewell o my laughing water all my heart is buried with you all my thoughts go onward with you come not back again to labor come not back again to suffer where the famine and the fever wear the heart and waste the body soon my task will be completed soon your footsteps i shall follow to the islands of the blessed to the kingdom of ponemah to the land of the hereafter xxi the white mans foot in his lodge beside a river close beside a frozen river sat an old man sad and lonely white his hair was as a snowdrift dull and low his fire was burning and the old man shook and trembled folded in his waubewyon in his tattered whiteskinwrapper hearing nothing but the tempest as it roared along the forest seeing nothing but the snowstorm as it whirled and hissed and drifted all the coals were white with ashes and the fire was slowly dying as a young man walking lightly at the open doorway entered red with blood of youth his cheeks were soft his eyes as stars in springtime bound his forehead was with grasses bound and plumed with scented grasses on his lips a smile of beauty filling all the lodge with sunshine in his hand a bunch of blossoms filling all the lodge with sweetness ah my son exclaimed the old man happy are my eyes to see you sit here on the mat beside me sit here by the dying embers let us pass the night together tell me of your strange adventures of the lands where you have travelled i will tell you of my prowess of my many deeds of wonder from his pouch he drew his peacepipe very old and strangely fashioned made of red stone was the pipehead and the stem a reed with feathers filled the pipe with bark of willow placed a burning coal upon it gave it to his guest the stranger and began to speak in this wise when i blow my breath about me when i breathe upon the landscape motionless are all the rivers hard as stone becomes the water and the young man answered smiling when i blow my breath about me when i breathe upon the landscape flowers spring up oer all the meadows singing onward rush the rivers when i shake my hoary tresses said the old man darkly frowning all the land with snow is covered all the leaves from all the branches fall and fade and die and wither for i breathe and lo they are not from the waters and the marshes rise the wild goose and the heron fly away to distant regions for i speak and lo they are not and whereer my footsteps wander all the wild beasts of the forest hide themselves in holes and caverns and the earth becomes as flintstone when i shake my flowing ringlets said the young man softly laughing showers of rain fall warm and welcome plants lift up their heads rejoicing back into their lakes and marshes come the wild goose and the heron homeward shoots the arrowy swallow sing the bluebird and the robin and whereer my footsteps wander all the meadows wave with blossoms all the woodlands ring with music all the trees are dark with foliage while they spake the night departed from the distant realms of wabun from his shining lodge of silver like a warrior robed and painted came the sun and said behold me gheezis the great sun behold me then the old mans tongue was speechless and the air grew warm and pleasant and upon the wigwam sweetly sang the bluebird and the robin and the stream began to murmur and a scent of growing grasses through the lodge was gently wafted and segwun the youthful stranger more distinctly in the daylight saw the icy face before him it was peboan the winter from his eyes the tears were flowing as from melting lakes the streamlets and his body shrunk and dwindled as the shouting sun ascended till into the air it faded till into the ground it vanished and the young man saw before him on the hearthstone of the wigwam where the fire had smoked and smouldered saw the earliest flower of springtime saw the beauty of the springtime saw the miskodeed in blossom thus it was that in the northland after that unheardof coldness that intolerable winter came the spring with all its splendor all its birds and all its blossoms all its flowers and leaves and grasses sailing on the wind to northward flying in great flocks like arrows like huge arrows shot through heaven passed the swan the mahnahbezee speaking almost as a man speaks and in long lines waving bending like a bowstring snapped asunder came the white goose wawbewawa and in pairs or singly flying mahng the loon with clangorous pinions the blue heron the shuhshuhgah and the grouse the mushkodasa in the thickets and the meadows piped the bluebird the owaissa on the summit of the lodges sang the robin the opechee in the covert of the pinetrees cooed the pigeon the omemee and the sorrowing hiawatha speechless in his infinite sorrow heard their voices calling to him went forth from his gloomy doorway stood and gazed into the heaven gazed upon the earth and waters from his wanderings far to eastward from the regions of the morning from the shining land of wabun homeward now returned iagoo the great traveller the great boaster full of new and strange adventures marvels many and many wonders and the people of the village listened to him as he told them of his marvellous adventures laughing answered him in this wise ugh it is indeed iagoo no one else beholds such wonders he had seen he said a water bigger than the bigseawater broader than the gitche gumee bitter so that none could drink it at each other looked the warriors looked the women at each other smiled and said it cannot be so kaw they said it cannot be so oer it said he oer this water came a great canoe with pinions a canoe with wings came flying bigger than a grove of pinetrees taller than the tallest treetops and the old men and the women looked and tittered at each other kaw they said we dont believe it from its mouth he said to greet him came waywassimo the lightning came the thunder annemeekee and the warriors and the women laughed aloud at poor iagoo kaw they said what tales you tell us in it said he came a people in the great canoe with pinions came he said a hundred warriors painted white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered and the warriors and the women laughed and shouted in derision like the ravens on the treetops like the crows upon the hemlocks kaw they said what lies you tell us do not think that we believe them only hiawatha laughed not but he gravely spake and answered to their jeering and their jesting true is all iagoo tells us i have seen it in a vision seen the great canoe with pinions seen the people with white faces seen the coming of this bearded people of the wooden vessel from the regions of the morning from the shining land of wabun gitche manito the mighty the great spirit the creator sends them hither on his errand sends them to us with his message wheresoeer they move before them swarms the stinging fly the ahmo swarms the bee the honeymaker wheresoeer they tread beneath them springs a flower unknown among us springs the whitemans foot in blossom let us welcome then the strangers hail them as our friends and brothers and the hearts right hand of friendship give them when they come to see us gitche manito the mighty said this to me in my vision i beheld too in that vision all the secrets of the future of the distant days that shall be i beheld the westward marches of the unknown crowded nations all the land was full of people restless struggling toiling striving speaking many tongues yet feeling but one heartbeat in their bosoms in the woodlands rang their axes smoked their towns in all the valleys over all the lakes and rivers rushed their great canoes of thunder then a darker drearier vision passed before me vague and cloudlike i beheld our nation scattered all forgetful of my counsels weakened warring with each other saw the remnants of our people sweeping westward wild and woful like the cloudrack of a tempest like the withered leaves of autumn xxii hiawathas departure by the shore of gitche gumee by the shining bigseawater at the doorway of his wigwam in the pleasant summer morning hiawatha stood and waited all the air was full of freshness all the earth was bright and joyous and before him through the sunshine westward toward the neighboring forest passed in golden swarms the ahmo passed the bees the honeymakers burning singing in the sunshine bright above him shone the heavens level spread the lake before him from its bosom leaped the sturgeon sparkling flashing in the sunshine on its margin the great forest stood reflected in the water every treetop had its shadow motionless beneath the water from the brow of hiawatha gone was every trace of sorrow as the fog from off the water as the mist from off the meadow with a smile of joy and triumph with a look of exultation as of one who in a vision sees what is to be but is not stood and waited hiawatha toward the sun his hands were lifted both the palms spread out against it and between the parted fingers fell the sunshine on his features flecked with light his naked shoulders as it falls and flecks an oaktree through the rifted leaves and branches oer the water floating flying something in the hazy distance something in the mists of morning loomed and lifted from the water now seemed floating now seemed flying coming nearer nearer nearer was it shingebis the diver or the pelican the shada or the heron the shuhshuhgah or the white goose wawbewawa with the water dripping flashing from its glossy neck and feathers it was neither goose nor diver neither pelican nor heron oer the water floating flying through the shining mist of morning but a birch canoe with paddles rising sinking on the water dripping flashing in the sunshine and within it came a people from the distant land of wabun from the farthest realms of morning came the blackrobe chief the prophet he the priest of prayer the paleface with his guides and his companions and the noble hiawatha with his hands aloft extended held aloft in sign of welcome waited full of exultation till the birch canoe with paddles grated on the shining pebbles stranded on the sandy margin till the blackrobe chief the paleface with the cross upon his bosom landed on the sandy margin then the joyous hiawatha cried aloud and spake in this wise beautiful is the sun o strangers when you come so far to see us all our town in peace awaits you all our doors stand open for you you shall enter all our wigwams for the hearts right hand we give you never bloomed the earth so gayly never shone the sun so brightly as today they shine and blossom when you come so far to see us never was our lake so tranquil nor so free from rocks and sandbars for your birch canoe in passing has removed both rock and sandbar never before had our tobacco such a sweet and pleasant flavor never the broad leaves of our cornfields were so beautiful to look on as they seem to us this morning when you come so far to see us and the blackrobe chief made answer stammered in his speech a little speaking words yet unfamiliar peace be with you hiawatha peace be with you and your people peace of prayer and peace of pardon peace of christ and joy of mary then the generous hiawatha led the strangers to his wigwam seated them on skins of bison seated them on skins of ermine and the careful old nokomis brought them food in bowls of basswood water brought in birchen dippers and the calumet the peacepipe filled and lighted for their smoking all the old men of the village all the warriors of the nation all the jossakeeds the prophets the magicians the wabenos and the medicinemen the medas came to bid the strangers welcome it is well they said o brothers that you come so far to see us in a circle round the doorway with their pipes they sat in silence waiting to behold the strangers waiting to receive their message till the blackrobe chief the paleface from the wigwam came to greet them stammering in his speech a little speaking words yet unfamiliar it is well they said o brother that you come so far to see us then the blackrobe chief the prophet told his message to the people told the purport of his mission told them of the virgin mary and her blessed son the saviour how in distant lands and ages he had lived on earth as we do how he fasted prayed and labored how the jews the tribe accursed mocked him scourged him crucified him how he rose from where they laid him walked again with his disciples and ascended into heaven and the chiefs made answer saying we have listened to your message we have heard your words of wisdom we will think on what you tell us it is well for us o brothers that you come so far to see us then they rose up and departed each one homeward to his wigwam to the young men and the women told the story of the strangers whom the master of life had sent them from the shining land of wabun heavy with the heat and silence grew the afternoon of summer with a drowsy sound the forest whispered round the sultry wigwam with a sound of sleep the water rippled on the beach below it from the cornfields shrill and ceaseless sang the grasshopper pahpukkeena and the guests of hiawatha weary with the heat of summer slumbered in the sultry wigwam slowly oer the simmering landscape fell the evenings dusk and coolness and the long and level sunbeams shot their spears into the forest breaking through its shields of shadow rushed into each secret ambush searched each thicket dingle hollow still the guests of hiawatha slumbered in the silent wigwam from his place rose hiawatha bade farewell to old nokomis spake in whispers spake in this wise did not wake the guests that slumbered i am going o nokomis on a long and distant journey to the portals of the sunset to the regions of the homewind of the northwestwind keewaydin but these guests i leave behind me in your watch and ward i leave them see that never harm comes near them see that never fear molests them never danger nor suspicion never want of food or shelter in the lodge of hiawatha forth into the village went he bade farewell to all the warriors bade farewell to all the young men spake persuading spake in this wise i am going o my people on a long and distant journey many moons and many winters will have come and will have vanished ere i come again to see you but my guests i leave behind me listen to their words of wisdom listen to the truth they tell you for the master of life has sent them from the land of light and morning on the shore stood hiawatha turned and waved his hand at parting on the clear and luminous water launched his birch canoe for sailing from the pebbles of the margin shoved it forth into the water whispered to it westward westward and with speed it darted forward and the evening sun descending set the clouds on fire with redness burned the broad sky like a prairie left upon the level water one long track and trail of splendor down whose stream as down a river westward westward hiawatha sailed into the fiery sunset sailed into the purple vapors sailed into the dusk of evening and the people from the margin watched him floating rising sinking till the birch canoe seemed lifted high into that sea of splendor till it sank into the vapors like the new moon slowly slowly sinking in the purple distance and they said farewell forever said farewell o hiawatha and the forests dark and lonely moved through all their depths of darkness sighed farewell o hiawatha and the waves upon the margin rising rippling on the pebbles sobbed farewell o hiawatha and the heron the shuhshuhgah from her haunts among the fenlands screamed farewell o hiawatha thus departed hiawatha hiawatha the beloved in the glory of the sunset in the purple mists of evening to the
