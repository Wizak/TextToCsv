 chapter one luke and jake luke harrison sat at his desk and looked through the door into the next room his secretary was preparing the room for the directors meeting luke smiled on the table the crystal glasses and golden cigarette box were shining in the light from the lamps there were red roses to go with the red velvet chairs yes the directors would certainly have a comfortable meeting the smile left his face he wasnt so sure of the discussions at the meeting his partner jake fulbright was talking to him from the other side of the room there was anger in his voice luke wake up the office looks good doesnt it our company is going well isnt it together weve done a good job and how by always doing whats best for the company its no good jake you are not going to change my mind our business is property land houses and buildings we became a great company because we gave the people what they wanted and they paid us well now our city wants us and for a good cause we have to give them what they want a childrens home there is more to success than money jake there is pride and respect stop that our city needs an office block and big companies will pay us good money think of your family luke dont you want to do the best for your wife jake took out a cigarette and lit it if youre so keen on doing the best for yourself why dont you stop that harmful habit luke hated smoking and jake hated being told what to do by anyone even if it was his old friend and partner the two men had grown up together and built their futures together and together they had found riches and success but in the past year something had gone wrong between them what was it luke wished he knew for goodness sake luke listen to me im going to fight you on this one im going into that meeting and im going to persuade those directors to agree to the new office building im sorry jake you cant do that we are the partners they are our directors they cant agree to anything if we dont agree those are the rules jake rules are for losers im a winner and i take chances jake banged his fist on the table then he looked directly into lukes eyes he who dares wins luke remember and i dare it was an old saying that the two men had used in the early days of their business they had used the saying to give each other courage now jake was using it to give him the strength to fight his own partner just then the phone on lukes desk rang he heard his wifes gentle loving voice is that you luke yes darling hows it going at home fine but whats the matter you dont sound too happy dear megan she always knew if something was wrong but she must not know that anything was wrong between luke and jake luke tried to sound happier i im fine love just a bit busy you know usual friday rush to get things done before the weekend how are things at home pretty busy here too nathan has brought a friend home from school cant you hear them they are playing upstairs and ive got your favourite dinner beef curry its nearly ready so what time are you coming home listen megan love im sorry but im going to be late theres a meeting this evening oh luke not again oh darling youve been working too hard lately try to get home and relax we miss you i know love and ill be home as soon as i can luke put the phone down he wished jake hadnt been in the room listening to the conversation you leave that gorgeous wife of yours alone far too much if she was my wife i would never leave her side there was something about jake when he spoke of megan a look in his eye and a strange tone in his voice luke couldnt explain why but it made him very uncomfortable but jake was keeping a secret from his partner jake the man with money and power but without a woman in his life was in love with lukes wife megan knew nothing of this she loved her husband her son and her home jake knew this but jake still wanted megan and he who dares wins he told himself the awkward moment in the office passed just then the intercom buzzed jake pressed a button and listened it was one of the secretaries all four directors have arrived shall i take them into the conference room yes please well be with them in two minutes well luke this is it they are all in there and im going to persuade each one of them what is best for this company big luxury offices that will bring us heaps of money jake looked at luke he was daring him to answer then he picked up his cigarettes and walked out of the room chapter two the accident jake was the first to leave the meeting his face was red with anger the directors had not agreed to the idea of constructing a new office building but worse they had refused to listen to any plan which both jake and luke did not agree to he walked past the secretaries and out to his car he didnt say anything to luke because he didnt want to fight him not yet he was going to try once more to change his mind back at lukes house nathan heard his fathers car coming he ran to the front door daddy youre late come and see my model aeroplane ive nearly finished it daddy its beef curry for dinner your favourite im starving are you can we go out on our bikes together tomorrow hey slow down a bit hello darling at last hello my love ah its good to be home they all went into the living room to enjoy the evening together the next morning as they were having breakfast the telephone rang it was jake hello good morning luke listen ive got an idea why dont we go out hunting its been a long time since we went hunting together maybe we can bring a rabbit home for megan to cook luke was pleased that jake was in a good mood and although it was saturday luke decided to go out with jake it was a chance for them to do something together as friends just as they used to do in the past good idea lets do it well go in my car ill come and pick you up in an hour i need to clean my gun first i havent used it for ages it was a glorious day a perfect day for hunting the sun was shining through the trees the birds were singing as they walked through the woods jake started talking about work and the office building oh come on jake lets forget about the office building for today and just enjoy ourselves life isnt that simple luke we have to pay for everything even days out in the woods thats why we cant afford to build childrens homes luke jake i told you the city needs the home and we have almost promised we are going to do it its the right thing to do the right thing to do is whats good for us not the others come on jake lets just hunt rabbits now whats that i see over there looks like a nice tasty dinner to me luke picked up his gun so did jake but jake wasnt looking at the trees or the rabbits the bullet from jakes gun flew past lukes face for goodness sake what are you thinking of you almost killed me im sorry it was an accident i touched the trigger by mistake im very sorry look i think its time we went home we are obviously not going to do any serious hunting today well i didnt mean to do it and ive said im sorry but if you want to go then lets go the two men sat in the car and stared at the road in front neither of them spoke luke changed gear as they came into a narrow road jake looked down at the view across the hills and of the city below luke turned the steering wheel as they came to abend there approaching them was an enormous lorry on their side of the road luke shouted get onto your own side of the road but the lorry driver didnt notice them he wasnt looking at lukes car he was looking at the pleasant view below move over you idiot watch the road the tyres screeched as luke tried to move out of the way but the lorry just came towards them luke turned the steering wheel again fast the car left the road and disappeared over the side of the hill for a moment there was silence as the car flew through the air then came the crash neither of the men heard the noise or felt the flames as the car exploded their burnt bodies were thrown out of the car and onto the grass chapter three life exchange the lorry driver was still shaking when the ambulance arrived the ambulance men ran towards the burning car on the black burnt ground nearby lay the two men they were lifted into the ambulance and taken to the city hospital the ambulance men pushed them on trolleys into the casualty department a nurse stood with them as they waited for the doctors to come as they lay on their trolleys inside the hospital one of the men made a noise the nurse spoke to him hello can you hear me can you tell me your name the burned man turned towards his burned friend on the other trolley he put his hand onto his friends hand j a k e but that was his last word he died with his hand in the hand of his friend can you hear me jake did you say the nurse lifted the dead mans hand away from his friends and laid it across his chest megan looked at the clock and told herself not to worry luke was probably having a drink with jake he would be home soon the telephone rang hello hello id like to speak to mrs megan harrison er luke harrisons wife please yes thats me whos speaking please im police constable smithers from the city police station mrs harrison theres been an accident a car accident rather serious megan caught her breath oh no he isnt he now keep calm your husband is alive but he is very badly hurt now can you come straight to the casualty department at the city hospital please would you like me to send one of my men to come and get you no thank you im coming now right away megan drove praying all the way oh please god let him live hes such a good man a good husband a good father she fought her tears as she drove to the hospital she quickly found the policeman at the casualty department hello er mrs harrison now try to relax i know its difficult your husbands car crashed and went off the road it was quite bad the car caught fire and the two men were badly burned we found the number plate of the car so we were able to find its owner one of the men died we were able to identify your husband because he was holding his wedding ring in his hand a nurse will take you in to see him shortly afterwards a doctor came into the room he sat down on a seat next to megan mrs harrison im doctor ramsay ive been looking after your husband the doctor looked kindly at megan and held her hand we are doing everything we can to save him but hes in a coma so he wont know youre here is he is he going to die doctor we hope not but we must prepare ourselves megan could no longer see the doctors kind face her eyes were filled with tears oh doctor what about his friend jake there was nothing we could do for him he died when he arrived here at the hospital now come with me your husband is covered in bandages so you wont see much of him but we all believe it helps the patient to have a loved one nearby even when they are in a coma megan followed the doctor to a small side room at the end of a ward the man under the bandages knew nothing and nobody oh luke well i suppose its better right now that he doesnt know anything i mean he would be in terrible pain if he were awake wouldnt he doctor yes you know mrs harrison even if he recovers he might not remember much he might have amnesia but it would pass wouldnt it hopefully yes in time now lets leave the nurses to take care of him go home and get some rest we will call you if we need you and come back tomorrow morning the next three days were terrible for megan she sat at the side of the bed waiting for signs of recovery then on the third evening the head under the bandages moved megan saw the eyes and the lips move slowly oh luke my love luke darling can you hear me can you see me the voice was slow and weak megan oh luke does it hurt dont worry everything will be all right you are going to live and come home were all going to be together soon oh luke i love you so much the face under the bandages moved the eyes filled with tears then they closed and luke slept chapter four new life old habits the nurse touched the bandages around lukes head and smiled at him well this is it now will you take it off luke or should i it was the last bandage after the last operation for six months doctors had cut skin and repaired the terrible damage from the accident luke had been very patient and had been waiting for this moment you do it nurse its the last time for you ill just watch the good work he looked into the mirror and he couldnt believe his eyes it was like magic there were a few tiny lines but apart from that it was the same goodlooking face of the photographs of luke harrison before the accident the same photographs that the doctors had used to recreate the face and they had got it right lukes eyes filled with tears oh i dont know what to say well i look exactly like i did before its just perfect im very happy for you luke but you had better go home to your wife before we all fall in love with you and here she is megan walked into the room carrying a suitcase to take his things home she put down the case and threw her arms around him oh luke ive got my old luke back again come on lets get you home where you belong they drove away from the hospital it was so nice for megan to sit in the car with her husband at the wheel again but she noticed that luke suddenly seemed sad what is it love arent you happy yes but im so sorry that jake didnt have the same luck do you mind if we stop at the cemetery id just like to see his grave megan wondered why he didnt want to go home first but it was true luke had not yet actually seen the grave of his old friend and partner he had been very sick at the time of the funeral of course love well stop off first and buy some flowers at the graveyard megan put the flowers onto the grave then she stepped back to let luke have a moment alone luke went down on his knees and cried oh jake my true friend why was it you and not me how can i live without you ill never forget you never megan waited for a little while then she went and took him away from the grave they walked back to the car in silence luke drove them home as they walked to the door nathan ran out he threw his arms around luke daddy oh daddy im so happy youre back nathan pulled luke by the hand and took him into the living room i want to see you here by the fire just like the old days oh daddy ive missed you so much im going to make sure that nothing bad ever happens to you again the family had dinner together megan poured them all some wine heres to our family together again and forever nathan couldnt stop looking at luke and megans eyes were shining with happiness after the meal luke put his hand into his pocket he took out a packet of cigarettes and lit one megan and nathan both spoke at once daddy luke you are smoking but youve never smoked before youve always hated it yes i know dont do it daddy its bad for you hey you two im sorry darling we didnt mean to complain megan got up to get an ashtray nathan picked up the packet jake used to smoke those megan took the packet from nathan and handed the ashtray to luke thank you i expect its a reaction the shock from the accident is making me want to smoke well lets hope it will pass anyway its wonderful to have you back now shall we go and sit by the fire and watch a film together chapter five strange caller welcome back the secretaries the directors the cleaners all the office staff stood in the office waiting for luke as he walked through the door they cheered and clapped lukes personal secretary mary came up and kissed him its wonderful to see you weve all been waiting for this day luke went into his office with mary she explained some of the things that were happening in the company and showed him the files with all the information he needed then the directors came in for a short meeting the company had managed very well without the two partners but everyone was glad to have one of the heads of the company back in control after he had spoken to all of them luke sat in his office it was strange he was alone now there was no partner sitting across from him nobody to help him make a decision and nobody to stop him doing whatever he wanted to do yes the company was all his he looked at the photograph of megan on his desk suddenly he wanted to be with her he went out and bought some flowers and champagne then he went home hello darling youre early what a nice surprise oh what lovely flowers megan put the flowers into a vase she carried the vase into the hall and put it on the table under her favourite photograph it was a photograph of luke handsome happy with kind smiling eyes later that evening they drank the champagne together to a wonderful new start cheers darling cheers and to my next business deal whats that darling the new building for the childrens home no to the new office building i am going to build right in the middle of the city centre office building but i thought you didnt want the office building well i do want the office building now i am going to name it after jake the fulbright centre luxury offices but you wanted the childrens home so much and the city is expecting you to build it luke looked at megan his eyes were wet with tears i must do this megan it was jakes last wish before he died well i can understand those feelings in your private life but luke do you think you should listen to your feelings and emotions in your business life he was my partner megan he died and i lived i owe him this just then the telephone rang luke went out into the hall to answer it he picked up the phone and heard a strange noise it was a voice well like a voice but strange it seemed very far away but at the same time as if the speaker was standing right next to him he looked at the flowers on the hall table and he tried hard to recognise the voice why tell me why luke didnt say anything he waited to hear more why are you doing this why are you doing this the voice got stronger as it repeated the question why are you doing this luke was frightened very frightened he put the telephone down at the same moment he looked at the photograph above the table megans favourite photograph of her happy smiling luke the photograph moved it clearly moved from side to side then it moved forward away from the wall luke stared in horror as it crashed down to the floor tiny pieces of glass and tom pieces of photograph flew across the hall megan rushed out into the hall whats that what happened oh my photograph luke was white and frightened but he answered megan i im sorry love i lifted my arm up i knocked it off by mistake i ill clear it up megan looked at him she was a bit worried dont worry ill do it you look tired dear go and sit down remember it was your first day back at work for a very long time ill make us a drink and well go to bed early chapter six suspicions cheers darling and a happy birthday megan lifted her wine glass and looked into lukes eyes and many more of them together she kissed him and they drank their wine nathan looked at the barbecue not too many more glasses of wine daddy look youre burning the steak luke turned to the barbecue and moved the steaks to one side hey you used to be really good at cooking barbecues whats happened too much wine quiet nathan luke you dont look too well are you sure youre all right here i have some beef curry for you over there that should make you feel better but luke didnt eat the beef curry or any of the barbecue food megan was worried darling really whats the matter its ok megan im just not very hungry the telephone rang luke went to answer it a familiar voice spoke to him happy birthday partner an echo from the past lukes face became white with fear he put the phone down and walked back into the garden megan saw the colour of his face luke love what is it you look terrible who was on the telephone nobody it was a wrong number well come over here and cut your cake ok everyone here he is happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear luke happy birthday to you all the guests cheered and clapped luke cut his cake and handed everyone a piece soon he was laughing and joking with them all later in the evening megan told nathan to go and have his bath oh mum all right ill go if daddy will come up afterwards and say goodnight of course i will and tell me a story yes now you go and have your bath nathan came out of the bathroom clean tired and happy luke was sitting on his bed waiting for him hey daddy arent you glad you had that birthday i certainly am daddy will you tell me that story you know the one about the fisherman and his wife the way you used to tell it with the funny voices what story is that nathan oh you know daddy our story ill be the fish and youll be the fisherman i dont

cant have forgotten it its like forgetting your own name or who you are or mummy or me well it looks as if i have forgotten it shall we have a different story shall i read you something from a book well yes if you say so daddy nathan listened to the story and then luke said goodnight nathan heard him going downstairs then he lay in bed worrying about his father something was wrong why didnt he know how to do the barbecue mummy was worried too she hadnt said anything but nathan knew he was watching and listening and who was phoning him why was he upset after the calls and what about the story he must know it he listened to his parents talking his mother wanted to go somewhere to lucys house you know lucy my friend from aerobics shes having a tea party on thursday afternoon a chance for us all to have a good chat do you think you could stay here and look after nathan ill be back by nine oclock yes my dear of course i know how you women love to gossip oh really luke anyway lucys

the grass hello dear did you have a good day mmm fine you see i told you i would remember nathan and i are going to have fun while you ladies chat isnt that right megan laughed and went to get ready to leave she drove in her own car to her friends house the front door was open and she walked into the hall lucy saw her megan come in and join us im so glad you came mmm so am i oh look at that table lucy you shouldnt have done all that the table was laid with all kinds of sandwiches pies cakes and biscuits there were pots of different kinds of tea from all over the world come over and say hello first you know most of the people here but i want you to meet someone megan followed lucy across the room rose is a very special person she can see into the future she can see beyond our world shes amazing you mean shes a psychic yes isnt it exciting megan looked at rose she was a pretty woman with bright eyes she looked up as megan walked towards her rose this is megan hello megan rose held megans hands and looked into her face suddenly rose became very still she seemed to be frozen or hypnotised she stared deeply into megans eyes and when she spoke she sounded shocked oh my god your husband is dead no he cant be hes at home looking after our son megan took away her hands and roses face turned white her eyes closed and she fell to the floor lucy ran to her shes fainted she has seen a death it cant be true i left him half an hour ago megan ran from the room into the hall she picked up the telephone and dialled her own number luke answered hello luke is that you well yes who did you think it would be oh nobody nothing i just wanted to check that everything was all right megan i am able to look after a sevenyearold boy you know megan walked back into lucys living room rose was sitting on the settee drinking tea nobody said any more about it megan tried to forget about it she had something to eat and chatted with different people when she was back at home that evening she told luke what had happened luke became strangely angry why do you listen to these stupid old women i knew you shouldnt have gone there come on luke theres no need to get angry she isnt a stupid old woman and she didnt mean to hurt anyone hurt the woman is dangerous filling your head with lies and you silly enough to believe her luke please dont shout nathan will hear you but nathan had already heard them both and he was frightened mummy come up and say goodnight im coming love upstairs in his room nathan was almost in tears he put out his arms and held megan tightly why is daddy so angry mummy whats the matter with him hes not the same he couldnt do the barbecue he doesnt even remember our fisherman story dont worry its because of the accident hes lost a bit of his memory the doctors told me that might happen but why is he angry about the lady at the tea party i dont know darling i expect its all because of the accident he was very ill for a long time but hell get completely better soon dont worry what about the people on the telephone what people there is nobody on the telephone darling you are imagining things now its very late time for boys to be asleep and youve got the football match tomorrow havent you youll need lots of energy for that if you want to win we will win mummy youll see im sure you will so go to sleep now megan kissed nathan and turned off the light chapter eight the past strikes back luke left for work early the next morning he was still annoyed about the psychic at the tea party he was also embarrassed about the quarrel he had had with megan and ashamed that nathan had heard them when he got into his office he sat at his desk and looked out of the window he telephoned megan and asked her to come to the office later he would clear up things between them then he would feel better then he sat quietly and watched the world go by he wanted to be alone for a while but a few minutes later someone arrived to see him a young man walked into his office he looked about twentyfive years old and he spoke to luke as if he knew him hello mr harrison its nice to meet you again and good to see you looking so well after that terrible accident are you all right now luke was a bit puzzled he put out his hand to shake hands with the young man well im very well thank you but i dont think weve met have we of course we have you remember about the new childrens home i think everything is settled now we should be able to start on it any time now look im very sorry i think there has been a mistake first of all this company is not going to build a childrens home secondly you and i have never spoken about building a childrens home or anything in fact i have never seen you before the young man was starting to get annoyed now look here dont try those tricks on me these are no tricks young man the young man went straight up to luke he put his face right in front of lukes do you know what i think there is a big trick here because if you were really luke harrison youd certainly know me for a moment luke was shocked if he was really luke harrison then he spoke now just what exactly are you trying to say i advise you to think carefully before you say any more dont think you can threaten me its you who is in the dangerous position not me thats enough just get out of my office now luke walked towards the young man and the young man walked towards the door but as he opened the door the young man had the last word remember he who dares wins then he walked out and slammed the door behind him luke was shaking how did the young man know about the expression it was something that luke and jake had used between them who was this man luke sat down and lit a cigarette the telephone in front of him rang he picked it up hello is that luke harrison yes it is who is speaking well it doesnt really matter who is speaking its what i have to say that is important oh yes it does matter who are you be quiet and listen ive got news for you bad news its about that new office block youre building the voice was slow teasing him luke spoke sharply into the telephone who are you and what about my office block well you see theres been an accident fire a nasty fire and its burned your office block theres not much left of it now sad really just when it was nearly finished luke was really frightened he shouted into the phone what are you talking about who are you and what has happened to my office block oh dear dont you understand english i said a fire there was a click at the other end the line was dead luke threw the phone down and covered his face with his hands oh no no it cant be no he stood up pulled his jacket off his chair and ran out of the room mary looked up from her typewriter in surprise are you going out mr harrison dont forget the meeting this afternoon will you but luke wasnt listening the door slammed and he was gone chapter nine great grandfathers clock megan sat at the other side of the desk and talked to lukes secretary megan liked mary she was glad that luke had someone like her to look after him i was at home cooking and luke telephoned me he told me to come here because he had something to tell me thats funny because he isnt here he went out in a hurry but why dont you go and wait for him in his office its more comfortable in there yes i think i will she went and sat down in lukes office then she noticed something oh thats strange his clock has stopped it has never stopped in all the time hes had it she walked over and looked at it luke had always loved the clock it had belonged to his great grandfather it was a beautiful wall clock with a pretty brass face and old numbers it had a long pendulum which gave a gentle tick tock and now for the first time it had stopped well this will not do you have to tick my old friend she opened the clock there was a little key inside the door fancy luke forgetting to wind you he must have a lot on his mind if he forgets that she reached down to the bottom of the clock to get the key and she found a pile of papers she laughed well really luke you are getting worse you have an excellent secretary to look after your papers and you leave them in an old clock whatever will you do next megan took the papers out they were contracts for agreements and business arrangements for the last two years now megan was puzzled why on earth would he do this these are important contracts they shouldnt be in a clock she looked down at the papers they had the signatures of the people luke had made the agreements with signatures stamps dates then megan noticed something else but what on earth this isnt lukes signature this is jakes and so it was js fulbright no sign of lukes name megan had seen the signature many times before on papers both luke and jake had signed but these papers must have been signed in the last two years after jake died why is he using jakes signature why isnt he signing in his own name then megan realised something else only jake could write that signature it was a very personal one luke had often joked with jake about it eccentric luke had called it well it certainly was a strange signature and certainly only one person could write it and that was jake fulbright but why and how jake is dead jake has been dead for two years now hasnt he then megan felt a sick feeling in her stomach she looked at the ashtray and cigarettes on the desk jakes brand of cigarettes she heard a voice in her head the voice of the policeman in the hospital we identified your husband because he was holding his wedding ring not wearing holding megan remembered the many strange things that her husband had done since he came home building the office block not the childrens home forgetting nathans story not liking beef curry smoking your husband is dead is what rose at the tea party had said why had luke been so angry about it and what had rose seen something was wrong horribly wrong megan took the contracts with jakes signature and put them in her handbag she was going to show them to luke tonight she was going to demand an explanation the man she had brought home from the hospital was not her husband of that megan was sure but she wasnt sure what to do about it and what did it all mean where was the real luke megan remembered the strange telephone calls luke had been very frightened who had telephoned him suddenly megan was very frightened too she picked up her keys and went out of the office she walked past mary are you leaving mrs harrison yes i cant wait any longer tell luke when he comes in that ill see him at home all right mrs harrison see you soon yes mary goodbye chapter ten the chase megan came home tired with worry and sick with fear she went to the drinks cupboard and poured herself a large brandy she needed to calm her nerves and to be able to think nathan came home from school tired from a long day megan put him to bed early she didnt want him to hear anything of the conversation she was going to have when luke came home he was dirty black from the scene of the fire he was tired and shocked it had been a terrible fire and megan knew nothing of it yet she asked him why he was so dirty its from a fire megan my new office building has gone it has been completely burnt but megan did not run to his side to comfort him the brandy gave her extra confidence she asked a question who did it i wonder have you found out luke looked at her in surprise no not yet megan went and poured herself another brandy she did not pour one for luke instead she moved around the room she felt the brandy inside her making her warm and making her head very light as she walked she knocked something from a small table it crashed to the floor and broke oh no my lovely statue of the flower girl oh now what am i going to do luke spoke to her sharply oh come on megan its only a little statue ill buy you another one another one there could never be another one you dont remember buying it for me do you go on tell me where did you buy this present for me oh megan i dont know whats the matter with you its really not important well thats where you are wrong its very important and so is this megan picked up the contracts with jakes signatures and threw them onto the table lukes face went white wh where where did you get those never mind where you tell me where luke is because you are not luke you are jake you but megan didnt finish her sentence she stepped back away from him because his hand came up ready to hit her across the mouth megan cried out no dont you dare for megan this was the last and final proof that the man in her house was not her real husband and now that she knew his secret he was dangerous megan ran from the room and out of the house she got into her car and drove into the road she needed to be away from him and to think but what now what can i do about it it started to rain megan slowed the car down and looked into her driving mirror his car was right behind her following her chasing her get away from me cant you ah i know ill take that tiny road that goes to the cliff top he doesnt know it very well it was a little road she had walked along with luke when they were first married she waited until she was at the corner before she turned the steering wheel but a minute later she saw him in the mirror now he was driving angrily and getting nearer and nearer he was chasing her as a fox chases a rabbit the animal and his prize and megan was his prize and he wasnt going to lose her not now not after all this she was driving faster and taking the comers well the tyres on her car screeched as she turned he followed her round another bend then the road became straighter it ran along the top of a cliff he changed gear and looked hard at the back of her car now was his chance he could see the back of her head he could see her eyes as she looked into her mirror he looked again those were not megans eyes those were lukes now he couldnt see the car a figure stood in his way a tall light figure shining against the dark sky the figure of luke harrison he screamed at the figure get out of the way you idiot but the figure stayed there staring at him without fear and it stood between him and megan blocking the road he turned the steering wheel and put on the brakes get out of the way he was losing control of the car the wheels were skidding the car was sliding across the wet road away from the figure and away from megan he screamed and stared at the figure lukes eyes stared back at him one wheel of the car was sliding over the edge of the road and then another as the car plunged over the cliff he shouted his last word luke then everything went black the end
