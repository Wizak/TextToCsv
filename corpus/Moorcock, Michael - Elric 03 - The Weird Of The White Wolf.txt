prologueprologue the dream of earl aubec in which we learn something of how the age of the young kingdoms emerged and of the part played by the dark lady myshella whose fate would later be in tertwined with that of elric of melnibone from the glassless window of the stone tower it was possible to see the wide river winding off between loose brown banks through the heaped terrain of solid green copses which blended very gradually into the mass of the forest proper and out of the forest the cliff rose grey and lightgreen up and up the rock darkening lichencovered to merge with the lower and even more massive stones of the castle it was the castle which dominated the countryside in three directions drawing the eye from river rock or forest its walls were high and of thick granite with towers a dense field of towers grouped so as to shadow one another aubec of malador marveled and wondered how human builders could ever have constructed it save by sorcery brooding and mysterious the castle seemed to have a defiant air for it stood on the very edge of the world at this moment the lowering sky cast a strange deepyellow light against the western sides of the towers intensifying the blackness untouched by it huge billows of blue sky rent the general racing greyness above and mounds of red cloud crept through to blend and produce more and subtler colourings yet though the sky was impressive it could not take the gaze away from the ponderous series of manmade crags that were castle kaneloon earl aubec of malador did not turn from the win dow until it was completely dark outside forest cliff and castle but shadowy tones against the overall blackness he passed a heavy knotted hand over his almost bald scalp and thoughtfully went towards the heap of straw which was his intended bed the straw was piled in a niche created by a buttress and the outer wall and the room was well lighted by maladors lantern but the air was cold as he lay down on the straw with his hand dose to the twohanded broadsword of prodigious size this was his only weapon it looked as if it had been forged for a giantmalador was virtually that himselfwith its wide crosspiece and heavy stoneencrusted hilt and fivefoot blade smooth and broad beside it was maladors old heavy armour the casque balanced on top with its somewhat tattered black plumes waving slightly in a current of air from the window malador slept his dreams as usual were turbulent of mighty armies surging across the blazing landscapes curling banners bearing the blazons of a hundred nations forests of shining lancetips seas of tossing helmets the brave wild blasts of the warhorns the clatter of hooves and the songs and cries and shouts of sol diers these were dreams of earlier times of his youth when for queen eloarde of klant he had conquered all the southern nationsalmost to the edge of the world only kaneloon on the very edge had he not conquered and this because no army would follow him there for one of so martial an appearance these dreams were surprisingly unwelcome and malador woke several times that night shaking his head in an at tempt to rid himself of them he would rather have dreamed of eloarde though she was the cause of his restlessness but he saw nothing of her in his sleep nothing of her soft black hair that billowed around her pale face noth ing of her green eyes and red lips and her proud disdainful posture eloarde had assigned him to this quest and he had not gone willingly though he had no choice for as well as his mistress she was also his queen the champion was traditionally her lover and it was unthinkable to earl aubec that any other condition should exist it was his place as champion of klant to obey and go forth from her palace to seek castle kaneloon alone and conquer it and de clare it part of her empire so that it could be said queen eloardes domain stretched from the dragon sea to worlds edge nothing lay beyond worlds edgenothing save the swirling stuff of unformed chaos which stretched away from the cliffs of kaneloon for eternity roiling and broiling multicoloured full of monstrous half shapesfor earth alone was lawful and constituted of ordered matter drifting in the sea of chaosstuff as it had done for aeons in the morning earl aubec of malador extin guished the lantern which he had allowed to remain alight drew greaves and hauberk on to him placed his black plumed helm upon his head put his broad sword over his shoulder and sallied out of the stone tower which was all that remained whole of some an cient edifice his leathernshod feet stumbled over stones that seemed partially dissolved as if chaos had once lapped here instead of against the towering cliffs of kaneloon that of course was quite impossible since earths boundaries were known to be constant castle kaneloon had seemed closer the night be fore and that he now realised was because it was so huge he followed the river his feet sinking in the loamy soil the great branches of the trees shading him from the increasingly hot sun as he made his way towards the cliffs kaneloon was now out of sight high above him every so often he used his sword as an axe to clear his way through the places where the foliage was particularly thick he rested several times drinking the cold water of the river and mopping his face and head he was unhurried he had no wish to visit kaneloon he resented the interruption to his life with eloarde which he thought he had earned also he too had a superstitious dread of the mysterious castle which was said to be inhabited only by one human occu pantthe dark lady a sorceress without mercy who commanded a legion of demons and other chaos crea tures he regarded the cliffs at midday and regarded the path leading upward with a mixture of wariness and relief he had expected to have to scale the cliffs he was not one however to take a difficult route where an easy one presented itself so he looped a cord around his sword and slung it over his back since it was too long and cumbersome to carry at his side then still in bad humour he began to climb the twisting path the lichencovered rocks were evidently ancient contrary to the speculations of certain philosophers who asked why kaneloon had only been heard of a few generations since malador believed in the gen eral answer to this questionthat explorers had never ventured this far until fairly recently he glanced back down the path and saw the tops of the trees below him their foliage moving slightly in the breeze the tower in which hed spent the night was just visible in the distance and beyond that he knew there was no civilisation no outpost of man for many days journey north east or westcan chaos lay to the south he had never been so close to the edge of the world before and wondered how the sight of unformed matter would affect his brain at length he clambered to the top of the cliff and stood arms akimbo staring up at castle kaneloon which soared a mile away its highest towers hidden in the clouds its immense walls rooted on the rock and stretching away limited on both sides only by the edge of the cliff and on the other side of the cliff malador watched the churning leaping chaos substance predominantly grey blue brown and yellow at this moment though its colours changed constantly spew like the seaspray a few feet from the castle he became filled with a feeling of such indescrib able profundity that he could only remain in this position for a long while completely overwhelmed by a sense of his own insignificance it came to him eventually that if anyone did dwell in the castle kaneloon then they must have a robust mind or else must be insane and then he sighed and strode on towards his goal noting that the ground was per fectly flat without blemish green obsidian and re flecting imperfectly the dancing chaosstuff from which he averted his eyes as much as he could kaneloon had many entrances all dark and unwel coming and had they all not been of regular size and shape they might have been so many cave mouths malador paused before choosing which to take and then walked with outward purposefulness towards one he went into blackness which appeared to stretch away forever it was cold it was empty and he was alone he was soon lost his footsteps made no echo which was unexpected then the blackness began to give way to a series of angular outlines like the walls of a twisting corridorwalls which did not reach the unsensed roof but ended several yards above his head it was a labyrinth a maze he paused and looked back and saw with horror that the maze wound off in many directions though he was sure he had followed a straight path from the outside for an instant his mind became diffused and madness threatened to engulf him but he battened it down unslung his sword shivering which way he pressed on unable to tell now whether he went forward or backward the madness lurking in the depths of his brain filtered out and became fear and immediately fol lowing the sensation of fear came the shapes swift moving shapes darting from several different direc tions gibbering fiendish utterly horrible one of these creatures kept at him and he struck at it with his blade it fled but seemed unwounded another came and another and he forgot his panic as he smote around him driving them back until all had fled he paused and leaned panting on his sword then as he stared around him the fear be gan to flood back into him and more creatures ap pearedcreatures with wide blazing eyes and clutching talons creatures with malevolent faces mocking him creatures with halffamiliar faces some recognisable as those of old friends and rela tives yet twisted into horrific parodies he screamed and ran at them whirling his huge sword slashing hacking at them rushing past one group to turn a bend in the labyrinth and encounter another malicious laughter coursed through the twisting corridors following him and preceding him as he ran he stumbled and fell against a wall at first the wall seemed of solid stone then slowly it became soft and he sank through it his body lying half in one corridor half in another he hauled himself through still on hands and knees looked up and saw eloarde but an eloarde whose face grew old as he watched i am mad he thought is this reality or fantasy or both he reached out a hand eloarde she vanished but was replaced by a crowding horde of demons he raised himself to his feet and flailed around him with his blade but they skipped outside his range and he roared at them as he ad vanced momentarily while he thus exerted himself the fear left him again and with the disappearance of the fear so the visions vanished until he realised that the fear preceded the manifestations and he tried to control it he almost succeeded forcing himself to relax but it welled up again and the creatures bubbled out of the walls their shrill voices full of malicious mirth this time he did not attack them with his sword but stood his ground as calmly as he could and concentrated upon his own mental condition as he did so the creatures began to fade away and then the walls of the labyrinth dissolved and it seemed to him that he stood in a peaceful valley calm and idyl lic yet hovering close to his consciousness he seemed to see the walls of the labyrinth faintly out lined and disgusting shapes moving here and there along the many passages he realised that the vision of the valley was as much an illusion as the labyrinth and with this con clusion both valley and labyrinth faded and he stood in the enormous hall of a castle which could only be kaneloon the hall was unoccupied though wellfurnished and he could not see the source of the light which was bright and even he strode towards a table on which were heaped scrolls and his feet made a satis fying echo several great metalstudded doors led off from the hall but for the moment he did not investi gate them intent on studying the scrolls and seeing if they could help him unravel kaneloons mystery he propped his sword against the table and took up the first scroll it was a beautiful thing of red vellum but the black letters upon it meant nothing to him and he was astounded for though dialects varied from place to place there was only one language in all the lands of the earth another scroll bore different symbols still and a third he unrolled carried a series of highly stylised pictures which were repeated here and there so that he guessed they formed some kind of alphabet disgusted he flung the scroll down picked up his sword drew an immense breath and shouted who dwells here let them know that aubec earl of malador champion of klant and conqueror of the south claims this castle in the name of queen eloarde empress of all the southlands in shouting these familiar words he felt somewhat more comfortable but he received no reply he lifted his casque a trifle and scratched his neck then he picked up his sword balanced it over his shoulder and made for the largest door before he reached it it sprang open and a huge manlike thing with hands like grappling irons grinned at him he took a pace backward and then another until seeing that the thing did not advance stood his ground observing it it was a foot or so taller than he with oval multi faceted eyes that by their nature seemed blank its face was angular and had a grey metallic sheen most of its body was comprised of burnished metal jointed in the manner of armour upon its head was a tightfitting hood studded with brass it had about it an air of tremendous and insensate power though it did not move a golem malador exclaimed for it seemed to him that he remembered such manmade creatures from legends what sorcery created you the golem did not reply but its handswhich were in reality comprised of four spikes of metal apiecebegan slowly to flex themselves and still the golem grinned this thing malador knew did not have the same amorphous quality of his earlier visions this was solid this was real and strong and even maladors manly strength however much he exerted it could not defeat such a creature yet neither could he turn away with a scream of metal joints the golem entered the hall and stretched its burnished hands towards the earl malador could attack or flee and fleeing would be senseless he attacked his great sword clasped in both hands he swung it sideways at the golems torso which seemed to be its weakest point the golem lowered an arm and the sword shuddered against metal with a mighty clang that set the whole of maladors body quaking he stumbled backward remorselessly the golem followed him malador looked back and searched the hall in the hope of finding a weapon more powerful than his sword but saw only shields of an ornamental kind upon the wall to his right he turned and ran to the wall wrenching one of the shields from its place and slipping it on to his arm it was an oblong thing very light and comprising several layers of cross grained wood it was inadequate but it made him feel a trifle better as he whirled again to face the go lem the golem advanced and malador thought he noticed something familiar about it just as the demons of the labyrinth had seemed familiar but the impression was only vague kaneloons weird sor cery was affecting his mind he decided the creature raised the spikes on its right arm and aimed a swift blow at maladors head he avoided it putting up his sword as protection the spikes clashed against the sword and then the left arm pistoned forward driving at maladors stomach the shield stopped his blow though the spikes pierced it deeply he yanked the buckler off the spikes slashing at the golems legjoints as he did so still staring into the middledistance with ap parently no real interest in malador the golem ad vanced like a blind man as the earl turned and leapt on to the table scattering the scrolls now he brought his huge sword down upon the golems skull and the brass studs sparked and the hood and head beneath it was dented the golem staggered and then grasped the table heaving it off the floor so that malador was forced to leap to the ground this time he made for the door and tugged at its latch ring but the door would not open his sword was chipped and blunted he put his back to the door as the golem reached him and brought its metal hand down on the top edge of the shield the shield shattered and a dreadful pain shot up maladors arm he lunged at the golem but he was unused to handling the big sword in this manner and the stroke was clumsy malador knew that he was doomed force and fighting skill were not enough against the golems in sensate strength at the golems next blow he swung aside but was caught by one of its spikefingers which ripped through his armour and drew blood though at that moment he felt no pain he scrambled up shaking away the grip and frag ments of wood which remained of the shield grasp ing his sword firmly the soulless demon has no weak spot he thought and since it has no true intelligence it can not be appealed to what would a golem fear the answer was simple the golem would only fear something as strong or stronger than itself he must use cunning he ran for the upturned table with the golem after him leaped over the table and wheeled as the golem stumbled but did not as hed hoped fall how ever the golem was slowed by its encounter and au bec took advantage of this to rush for the door through which the golem had entered it opened he was in a twisting corridor darkly shadowed not unlike the labyrinth he had first found in kaneloon the door closed but he could find nothing to bar it with he ran up the corridor as the golem tore the door open and came lumbering swiftly after him the corridor writhed about in all directions and though he could not always see the golem he could hear it and had the sickening fear that he would turn a corner at some stage and run straight into it he did notbut he came to a door and upon open ing it and passing through it found himself again in the hall of castle kaneloon he almost welcomed this familiar sight as he heard the golem its metal parts screeching continue to come after him he needed another shield but the part of the hall in which he now found himself had no wallshieldsonly a large round mirror of bright clearpolished metal it would be too heavy to be much use but he seized it tugging it from its hook it fell with a clang and he hauled it up drag ging it with him as he stumbled away from the go lem which had emerged into the room once more using the chains by which the mirror had hung he gripped it before him and as the golems speed increased and the monster rushed upon him he raised this makeshift shield the golem shrieked malador was astounded the monster stopped dead and cowered away from the mirror malador pushed it towards the golem and the thing turned its back and fled with a metallic howl through the door it had entered by relieved and puzzled malador sat down on the floor and studied the mirror there was certainly nothing magical about it though its quality was good he grinned and said aloud the creatures afraid of something it is afraid of itself he threw back his head and laughed loudly in his relief then he frowned now to find the sorcerers who created him and take vengeance on them he pushed himself to his feet twisted the chains of the mirror more securely about his arm and went to an other door concerned lest the golem complete its cir cuit of the maze and return through the door this door would not budge so he lifted his sword and hacked at the latch for a few moments until it gave he strode into a welllit passage with what appeared to be another room at its far endthe door open a musky scent came to his nostrils as he progressed along the passagethe scent that reminded him of eloarde and the comforts of klant when he reached the circular chamber he saw that it was a bedroom a womans bedroom full of the perfume he had smelled in the passage he con trolled the direction his mind took thought of loy alty and klant and went to another door which led off from the room he lugged it open and discovered a stone staircase winding upward this he mounted passing windows that seemed glazed with emerald or ruby beyond which shadowshapes flickered so that he knew he was on the side of the castle overlooking chaos the staircase seemed to lead up into a tower and when he finally reached the small door at its top he was feeling out of breath and paused before enter ing then he pushed the door open and went in a huge window was set in one wall a window of clear glass through which he could see the ominous stuff of chaos leaping a woman stood by this win dow as if awaiting him you are indeed a champion earl aubec said she with a smile that might have been ironic how do you know my name no sorcery gave it me earl of malador you shouted it loudly enough when you first saw the hall in its true shape was not that then sorcery he said ungraciously the labyrinth the demonseven the valley was not the golem made by sorcery is not this whole cursed castle of a sorcerous nature she shrugged gall it so if youd rather not have the truth sorcery in your mind at least is a crude thing which only hints at the true powers existing in the universe he did not reply being somewhat impatient of such statements he had learned by observing the philosophers of klant that mysterious words often disguised commonplace things and ideas instead he looked at her sulkily and overfrankly she was fair with greenblue eyes and a light com plexion her long robe was of a similar colour to her eyes she was in a secret sort of way very beautiful as the heroes who had earlier won over the dangers of kaneloon and then she thought she knew what to say think earl aubec she whispered thinknew lands for your queens empire he frowned why not extend the empires boundaries farther she continued why not make new territories she watched him anxiously as he took off his helm and scratched his heavy bald head you have made a point at last he said dubiously think of the honours you would receive in klant if you succeeded in winning not merely kaneloon but that which lies beyond now he rubbed is chin aye he said aye his great brows frowned deeply new plains new mountains new seasnew popu lations evenwhole cities full of people freshsprung and yet with the memory of generations of ancestors behind them all this can be done by you earl of maladorfor queen eloarde and lormyr he smiled faintly his imagination fired at last aye if i can defeat such dangers herethen i can do the same out there it will be the greatest adven ture in history my name will become a legend malador master of chaos she gave him a tender look though she had half cheated him he swung his sword up on to his shoulder ill try this lady she and he stood together at the window watching the chaosstuff whispering and rolling for eternity before them to her it had never been wholly famil lar for it changed all the time now its tossing col ours were predominantly red and black tendrils of mauve and orange spiralled out of this and writhed away weird shapes flitted about in it their outlines never clear never quite recognisable he said to her the lords of chaos rule this ter ritory what will they have to say they can say nothing do little even they have to obey the law of the cosmic balance which ordains that if man can stand against chaos then it shall be his to order and make lawful thus the earth grows slowly how do i enter it she took the opportunity to grasp his heavily muscled arm and point through the window see therea causeway leads down from this tower to the cliff she glanced at him sharply do you see it ahyesi had not but now i do yes a cause way standing behind him she smiled a little to herself i will remove the barrier she said he straightened his helm on his head for klant and eloarde and only those do i embark upon this adventure she moved towards the wall and raised the win dow he did not look at her as he strode down the causeway into the multicoloured mist as she watched him disappear she smiled to her self how easy it was to beguile the strongest man by pretending to go his way he might add lands to his empire but he might find their populations un willing to accept eloarde as their empress in fact if aubec did his work well then he would be creating more of a threat to klant than ever kaneloon had been yet she admired him she was attracted to him perhaps because he was not so accessible a little more than she had been to that earlier hero who had claimed aubecs own land from chaos barely two hundred years before oh he had been a man but he like most before him had needed no other per suasion than the promise of her body earl aubecs weakness had lain in his strength she thought by now he had vanished into the heaving mists she felt a trifle sad that this time the execution of the task given her by the lords of law had not brought her the usual pleasure yes perhaps she thought she felt a more subtle pleasure in his steadfastness and the means she had used to convince him for centuries had the lords of law entrusted her with kaneloon and its secrets but the progress was slow for there were few heroes who could survive kaneloons dangersfew who could defeat self created perils yet she decided with a slight smile on her lips the task had its various rewards she moved into an other chamber to prepare for the transition of the castle to the new edge of the world thus were the seeds sewn of the age of the young kingdoms the age of men which was to produce the downfall of melnibone book one the dreaming city which tells how elric came back to imrryr what he did there and how at last his weird fell upon him one whats the hour the blackbearded man wrenched off his gilded helmet and flung it from him careless of where it fell he drew off his leathern gauntlets and moved closer to the roaring fire letting the heat soak into his frozen bones midnight is long past growled one of the other armoured men who gathered around the blaze are you still sure hell come its said that hes a man of his word if that com forts you it was a tall palefaced youth who spoke his thin lips formed the words and spat them out mali ciously he grinned a wolfgrin and stared the new arrival in the eyes mocking him the newcomer turned away with a shrug thats sofor all your irony yaris hell come he spoke as a man does when he wishes to reassure himself there were six men now around the fire the sixth was smiorgancount smiorgan baldhead of the purple towns he was a short stocky man of fifty years with a scarred face partially covered with a thick black growth of hair his eyes smouldered morosely and his lumpy fingers plucked nervously at hisrichhilted longsword his pate was hairless giv ing him his name and over his ornate gilded ar mour hung a loose woollen cloak dyed purple smiorgan said thickly he has no love for his cousin he has become bitter yyrkoon sits on the ruby throne in his place and has proclaimed him an outlaw and a traitor elric needs us if he would take his throne and his bride back we can trust him youre full of trust tonight count yaris smiled thinly a rare thing to find in these troubled times i say this he paused and took a long breath stating at his comrades summing them up his gaze flicked from leanfaced dharmit of jharkor to fadan of lor myr who pursed his podgy lips and looked into the fire speak up yaris petulantly urged the patrician featured vilmirian naclon lets hear what you have to say lad if its worth hearing yaris looked towards jiku the dandy who yawned impolitely and scratched his long nose well smiorgan was impatient what dyou say yaris i say that we should start now and waste no more time waiting on elrics pleasure hes laughing at us in some tavern a hundred miles from hereor else plotting with the dragon princes to trap us for years we have planned this raid we have little time in which to strikeour fleet is too big too notice able even if elric has not betrayed us then spies will soon be running eastwards to warn the dragons that there is a fleet massed against them we stand to win a fantastic fortuneto vanquish the greatest merchant city in the worldto reap immeasurable richesor horrible death at the hands of the dragon princes if we wait overlong lets bide our time no more and set sail before our prize hears of our plan and brings up reinforcements you always were too ready to mistrust a man yaris king naclon of vilmir spoke slowly care fullydistastefully eyeing the tautfeatured youth we could not reach imrryr without elrics knowledge of the mazechannels which lead to its secret ports if elric will not join usthen our en deavour will be fruitlesshopeless we need him we must wait for himor else give up our plans and return to our homelands at least im willing to take a risk yelled yaris anger lancing from his slanting eyes youre getting oldall of you treasures are not won by care and forethought but by swift slaying and reckless attack fool dharmits voice rumbled around the fire flooded hall he laughed wearily i spoke thus in my youthand lost a fine fleet soon after cunning and elrics knowledge will win us imrryrthat and the mightiest fleet to sail the sighing sea since melnibones banners fluttered over all the nations of the earth here we arethe most powerful sea lords in the world masters every one of us of more than a hundred swift vessels our names are feared and famousour fleets ravage the coasts of a score of lesser nations we hold power he clenched his great fist and shook it in yaris face his tone became more level and he smiled viciously glaring at the youth and choosing his words with precision but all this is worthlessmeaninglesswithout the power which elric has that is the power of knowledgeof sorcery if i must use the cursed word his fathers knew of the maze which guards imrryr from seaattack and his fathers passed that secret on to him imrryr the dreaming city dreams in peaceand will continue to do so unless we have a guide to help us steer a course through the treacher ous waterways which lead to her harbours we need elricwe know it and he knows it thats the truth such confidence gentlemen is warming to the heart there was irony in the heavy voice which came from the entrance to the hall the heads of the six sea lords jerked towards the doorway yaris confidence fled from him as he met the eyes of elric of melnibon they were old eyes in a fine featured youthful face crimson eyes which stared into eternity yaris shuddered turned his back on elric preferring to look into the bright glare of the fire elric smiled warmly as count smiorgan gripped his shoulder there was a certain friendship be tween the two he nodded condescendingly to the other four and walked with lithe grace towards the fire yaris stood aside and let him pass elric was tall broadshouldered and slimhipped he wore his long hair bunched and pinned at the nape of his neck and for an obscure reason affected the dress of a southern barbarian he had long kneelength boots of soft doeleather a breastplate of strangely wrought silver a jerkin of chequered blue and white linen britches of scarlet wool and a cloak of rustling green velvet at his hip rested his runesword of black iron the feared stormbringer forged by ancient and alien sorcery his bizarre dress was tasteless and gaudy and did not match his sensitive face and longfingered almost delicate hands yet he flaunted it since it emphasised the fact that he did not belong in any companythat he was an outsider and an outcast but in reality he had little need to wear such outlandish gearfor his eyes and skin were enough to mark him elric last lord of melniborne was a pure albino who drew his power from a secret and terrible source smiorgan sighed well elric when do we raid imrryr elric shrugged as soon as you like i care not give me a little time in which to do certain things tomorrow shall we sail tomorrow yaris said hesitantly conscious of the strange power dormant in the man he had earlier accused of treachery elric smiled dismissing the youths statement three days time he said threeor more three days but imrryr will be warned of our presence by then fat cautious fadan spoke ill see that your fleets not found elric promised i have to go to imrryr firstand return you wont do the journey in three daysthe fast est ship could not make it smiorgan gaped ill be in the dreaming city in less than a day elric said softly with finality smiorgan shrugged if you say so ill believe it but why this necessity to visit the city ahead of the raid i have my own compunctions count smiorgan but worry not i shant betray you ill lead the raid myself be sure of that his deadwhite face was lighted eerily by the fire and his red eyes smoul dered one lean hand firmly gripped the hilt of his runesword and he appeared to breathe more heavily imrryr fell in spirit five hundred years agoshe will fall completely soonfor ever i have a little debt to settle this is my only reason for aiding you as you know i have made only a few conditions that you raze the city to the ground and a certain man and woman are not harmed i refer to my cousin yyrkoon and his sister cymoril yaris thin lips felt uncomfortably dry much of his blustering manner resulted from the early death of his father the old seaking had diedleaving young yaris as the new ruler of his lands and his fleets yaris was not at all certain that he was capable of commanding such a vast kingdomand tried to appear more confident than he actually felt now he said how shall we hide the fleet lord elric the melnibonean acknowledged the question ill hide it for you he promised i go now to do this but make sure all your men are off the ships first will you see to it smiorgan aye rumbled the stocky count he and elric departed from the hall together leaving five men behind five men who sensed an air of icy doom hanging about the overheated hall how could he hide such a mighty fleet when we who know this fjord better than any could find nowhere dharmit of jharkor said bewilderedly none answered him they waited tensed and nervous while the fire flickered and died untended eventually smiorgan returned stamping noisily on the boarded floor there was a haunted haze of fear surrounding him an almost tangible aura and he was shivering terri bly tremendous racking undulations swept up his body and his breath came short well did elrlc hide the fleetall at once what did he do dharmit spoke impatiently choosing not to heed smiorgans ominous condition he has hidden it that was all smiorgan said and his voice was thin like that of a sick man weak from fever yaris went to the entrance and tried to stare be yond the fjord slopes where many campfires burned tried to make out the outlines of ships masts and rigging but he could see nothing the night mists too thick he murmured i cant tell whether our ships are anchored in the fiord or not then he gasped involuntarily as a white face loomed out of the clinging fog greetings lord e ric he stuttered noting the sweat on the melni boneans strained features elric staggered past him into the hall wine he mumbled ive done whats needed and its cost me hard dharmit fetched a jug of strong cadsandrian wine and with a shaking hand poured some into a carved wooden goblet wordlessly he passed the cup to elric who quickly drained it now i will sleep he said stretching himself into a chair and wrapping his green cloak around him he dosed his disconcerting crimson eyes and fell into a slumber born of utter weariness fadan scurried to the door closed it and pulled the heavy iron bar down none of the six slept much that night and in the morning the door was unbarred and elric was miss ing from the chair when they went outside the mist was so heavy that they soon lost sight of one an other though scarcely two feet separated any of them elric stood with his legs astraddle on the shingle of the narrow beach he looked back at the entrance to the fjord and saw with satisfaction that the mist was still thickening though it lay only over the fjord itself hiding the mighty fleet elsewhere the weather was clear and overhead a pale winter sun shone sharply on the black rocks of the rugged cliffs which dominated the coastline ahead of him the sea rose and fell monotonously like the chest of a sleep ing watergiant grey and pure glinting in the cold sunlight elric fingered the raised runes on the hilt of his black broadsword and a steady north wind blew into the voluminous folds of his dark green cloak swirling it around his tall lean frame the albino felt fitter than he had done on the pre vions night when he had expended all his strength in conjuring the mist he was wellversed in the art of naturewizardry but he did not have the reserves of power which the sorcerer emperors of melnibone had possessed when they had ruled the world his ancestors had passed their knowledge down to him but not their mystic vitality and many of the spells and secrets that he had were unusable since he did not have the reservoir of strength either of soul or of body to work them but for all that elric knew of only one other man who matched his knowledgehis cousin yyrkoon his hand gripped the hilt tighter as he thought of the cousin who had twice betrayed his trust and he forced himself to concentrate on his present taskthe speaking of spells to aid him on his voyage to the isle of the dragon masters whose only city imrryr the beauti ful was the object of the sea lords massing drawn up on the beach a tiny sailingboat layel rics own small ship sturdy and far stronger far olderthan it appeared the brooding sea flung surf around its timbers as the tide withdrew and elric re alised that he had little time in which to work his helpful sorcery his body tensed and he blanked his conscious mind summoning secrets from the dark depths of his soul swaying his eyes staring unseeingly his arms jerking out ahead of him and making unholy signs in the air he began to speak in a sibilant mon otone slowly the pitch of his voice rose resembling the scarcely heard shriek of a distant gale as it comes closerthen quite suddenly the voice rose higher until it was howling wildly to the skies and the air began to tremble and quiver shadowshapes began slowly to form and they were never still but darted around elrics body as stifflegged he started for ward towards his boat his voice was inhuman as it howled insistently summoning the wind elementalsthe sylphs of the breeze the sharnahs makers of gales the hhaar shanns builders of whirlwindshazy and formless they eddied around him as he summoned their aid with the mien words of his forefathers who had ages before made unthinkable pacts with the elemental in order to procure their services still stifflimbed elric entered the boat and like an automaton his fingers ran up the sail and set it then a great wave erupted out of the placid sea rising higher and higher until it towered over the vessel with a surging crash the water smashed down on the boat lifted it and bore it out to sea sitting blankeyed in the stem elric still crooned his hideous song of sorcery as the spirits of the air plucked at the sail and sent the boat flying over the water faster than any mortal ship could speed and all the while the deafening unholy shriek of the released elementals filled the air about the boat as the shore vanished and open sea was all that was visible two so it was with winddemons for shipmates that elric last prince of the royal line of melnibone re turned to the last city still ruled by his own racethe last city and the final remnant of melnibonean ar chitecture the cloudy pink and subtle yellow tints of her nearer towers came into sight within a few hours of elrics leaving the fjord and just offshore of the isle of the dragon masters the elementals left the boat and fled back to their secret haunts among the peaks of the highest mountains in the world el ric awoke then from his trance and regarded with fresh wonder the beauty of his own citys delicate towers which were visible even so far away guarded still by the formidable seawall with its great gate the fivedoored maze and the twisting highwalled channels of which only one led to the inner harbour of imrryr elric knew that he dare not risk entering the hat bour by the maze though he knew the route per fectly he decided instead to land the boat further up the coast in a small inlet of which he had knowledge with sure capable hands he guided the little craft towards the hidden inlet which was ob scured by a growthof shrubs loaded with ghastly blue berries of a type decidedly poisonous to men since their juice first turned one blind and then slowly mad this berry the nodoil grew only on imrryr as did other rare and deadly plants light lowhanging cloud wisps streamed slowly across the sunpainted sky like fine cobwebs caught by a sudden breeze all the world seemed blue and gold and green and white and elric pulling his boat up on the beach breathed the clean sharp air of winter and savoured the scent of decaying leaves and rotting undergrowth somewhere a bitchfox barked her pleasure to her mate and elric regretted the fact that his depleted race no longer appreciated natural beauty preferring to stay close to their city and spend many of their days in drugged slumber it was not the city which dreamed but its overcivilised in habitants elric smelling the rich clean winter scents was wholly glad that he had his birthright and did not rule the city as he had been born to do instead yyrkoon his cousin sprawled on the ruby throne of imrryr the beautiful and hated el tic because he knew that the albino for all his dis gust with crowns and rulership was still the rightful king of the dragon isle and that he yyrkoon was an usurper not elected by elric to the throne as melnibonean tradition demanded but elric had better reasons for hating his cousin for those reasons the ancient capital would fall in all its magnificent splendour and the last fragment of a glorious empire would be obliterated as the pink the yellow the purple and white towers crumbled if elric had his way and the sea lords were success ful on foot elric strode inland towards imrryr and as he covered the miles of soft turf the sun cast an ochre pall over the land and sank giving way to a dark and moonless night brooding and full of evil portent at last he came to the city it stood out in stark black silhouette a city of fantastic magnificence in conception and in execution it was the oldest city in the world built by artists and conceived as a work of art rather than a functional dwelling place but elric knew that squalor lurked in many narrow streets and that the lords of imrryr left many of the towers empty and uninhabited rather than let the bastard population of the city dwell therein there were few dragon masters left few who would claim melni bonean blood built to follow the shape of the ground the city had an organic appearance with winding lanes spiralling to the crest of the hill where stood the castle tall and proud and manyspired the final crowning masterpiece of the ancient forgotten artist who had built it but there was no lifesound ema nating from imrryr the beautiful only a sense of sop orific desolation the city sleptand the dragon masters and their ladies and their special slaves dreamed druginduced dreams of grandeur and in credible horror while the rest of the population or dered by curfew tossed on tawdry mattresses and tried not to dream at all elric his hand ever near his swordhilt slipped through an unguarded gate in the city wall and be gan to walk cautiously through the unlighted streets moving upwards through the winding lanes towards yyrkoons great palace wind sighed through the empty rooms of the dragon towers and sometimes elric would have to withdraw into places where the shadows were deeper when he heard the tramp of feet and a group of guards would pass their duty being to see that the curfew was rigidly obeyed often he would hear wild laughter echoing from one of the towers still ablaze with bright torchlight which flung strange disturbing shadows on the walls often too he would hear a chilling scream and a frenzied idiots yell as some wretch of a slave died in obscene agony to please his master elric was not appalled by the sounds and the dim sights he appreciated them he was still a melni bonean their rightful leader if he chose to regain his powers of kinshipand though he had an ob scure urge to wander and sample the less sophisticated pleasures of the outside world ten thousand years of a cruel brilliant and malicious culture was behind him and the pulse of his ancestry beat strongly in his deficient veins elric knocked impatiently upon the heavy black wood door he had reached the palace and now stood by a small back entrance glancing cautiously around him for he knew that yyrkoon had given the guards orders to slay him if he entered lmrryr a bolt squealed on the other side of the door and it moved silently inwards a thin seamed face con fronted elric is it the king whispered the man peering out into the night he was a tall extremely thin individ ual with long gnarled limbs which shifted awk wardly as he moved nearer straining his beady eyes to get a glimpse of elric its prince elric the albino said but you forget tanglebones my friend that a new king sits on the ruby throne tanglebones shook his head and his sparse hair fell over his face with a jerking movement he brushed it back and stood aside for elric to enter the dragon isle has but one kingand his name is elric whatever usurper would have it otherwise elric ignored this statement but he smiled thinly and waited for the man to push the bolt back into place she still sleeps sire tanglebones murmured as he climbed unlit stairs elric behind him i guessed that elric said i do not underestimate my good cousins powers of sorcery upwards now in silence the two men climbed until at last they reached a corridor which was aflare with dancing torchlight the marble walls reflected the flames and showed elric crouching with tangle bones behind a pillar that the room in which he was interested was guarded by a massive archera eu nuch by the look of himwho was alert and wakeful the man was hairless and fat his blueblack gleam ing armour tight on his flesh but his fingers were curled around the string of his short bone bow and there was a slim arrow resting on the string elric guessed that this man was one of the crack eunuch archers a member of the silent guard imrryrs fin est company of warriors tanglebones who had taught the young elric the arts of fencing and archery had known of the guards presence and had prepared for it earlier he had placed a bow behind the pillar silently he picked it up and bending it against his knee strung it he fitted an arrow to the string aimed it at the right eye of the guard and let flyjust at the eunuch turned to face him the shaft missed it clattered against the mans gorget and fell harmlessly to the reedstrewn stones of the floor so elric acted swiftly leaping forward his rune sword drawn and its alien power surging through him it howled in a searing arc of black steel and cut through the bone bow which the eunuch had hoped would deflect it the guard was panting and his thick lips were wet as he drew breath to yell as he opened his mouth elric saw what he had expected the man was tongueless and was a mute his own shortsword came out and he just managed to parry elrics next thrust sparks flew from the iron and stormbringer bit into the eunuchs finely edged blade he staggered and fell back before the nigro mantic sword which appeared to be endowed with a life of its own the clatter of metal echoed loudly up and down the short corridor and elric cursed the fate which had made the man turn at the crucial mo ment grimly swiftly he broke down the eunuchs clumsy guard the eunuch saw only a dim glimpse of his op ponent behind the black whirling blade which ap peared to be so light and which was twice the length of his own stabbing sword he wondered frenziedly who his attacker could be and he thought he recog nised the face then a scarlet eruption obscured his vision he felt searing agony clutch at his face and then philosophically for eunuchs are necessarily given to a certain fatalism he realised that he was to die elric stood over the eunuchs bloated body and tugged his sword from the corpses skull wiping the mixture of blood and brains on his late opponents cloak tanglebones had wisely vanished elric could hear the clatter of sandalled feet rushing up the stairs he pushed the door open and entered the room which was lit by two small candles placed at ei ther end of a wide richly tapestried bed he went to the bed and looked down at the ravenhaired girl who lay there elrics mouth twitched and bright tears leapt into his strange red eyes he was trembling as he turned back to the door sheathed his sword and pulled the bolts into place he returned to the bedside and knelt down beside the sleeping girl her features were as delicate and of a similar mould as elrics own but she had an added exquisite beauty she was breathing shallowly in a sleep induced not by natural weariness but by her own brothers evil sor cery elric reached out and tenderly took one finefin gered hand in his he put it to his lips and kissed it cymoril he murmured and an agony of longing throbbed in that name cymorilwake up the girl did not stir her breathing remained shal low and her eyes remained shut elrics white fea tures twisted and his red eyes blazed as he shook in terrible and passionate rage he gripped the hand so limp and nerveless like the hand of a corpse gripped it until he had to stop himself for fear that he would crush the delicate fingers a shouting soldier began to beat at the door elric replaced the hand on the girls firm breast and stood up he glanced uncomprehendingly at the door a sharper colder voice interrupted the soldiers yelling what is happeninghas someone tried to see my poor sleeping sister yyrkoon the black hellspawn said elric to him self confused babblings from the soldier and yyr koons voice raised as he shouted through the door whoever is in thereyou will be destroyed a thou sand times when you are caught you cannot escape if my good sister is harmed in any waythen you will never die i promise you that but you will pray to your gods that you could yyrkoon you paltry rabbleyou cannot threaten one who is your equal in the dark arts it is i e ricyour rightful master return to your rabbit hole before i call down every evil power upon above and under the earth to blast you yyrkoon laughed hesitantly so you have returned again to try to waken my sister any such attempt will not only slay herit will send her soul into the deepest hellwhere you may join it willingly by arnaras six breastsyou it will be who samples the thousand deaths before long enough of this yyrkoon raised his voice sol diersi command you to break this door downand take that traitor alive elricthere are two things you will never again havemy sisters love and the ruby throne make what you can of the little time available to you for soon you will be grovelling to me and praying for release from your souls agony elric ignored yyrkoons threats and looked at the narrow window to the room it was just large enough for a mans body to pass through he bent down and kissed cymoril upon the lips then he went to the door and silently withdrew the bolts there came a crash as a soldier flung his weight against the door it swung open pitching the man forward to stumble and fall on his face elric drew his sword lifted it high and chopped at the warriors neck the head sprang from its shoulders and elric yelled loudly in a deep rolling voice arioch arioch i give you blood and soulsonly aid me now this man i give you mighty king of hellaid your servant elric of melnibone three soldiers entered the room in a bunch elric struck at one and sheared off half his face the man screamed horribly arioch lord of the darksi give you blood and souls aid me evil one in the far comer of the gloomy room a blacker mist began slowly to form but the soldiers pressed closer and elric was hard put to hold them back he was screaming the name of arioch lord of the higher hell incessantly almost unconsciously as he was pressed back further by the weight of the war riors numbers behind them yyrkoon mouthed in rage and frustration urging his men still to take el tic alive this necessity gave elric some small ad vantagethat and the runesword stormbringer which was glowing with a strange black luminousness and the shrill howling it gave out was grating into the ears of those who heard it two more corpses now littered the carpeted floor of the chamber their blood soaking into the fine fabric blood and souls or my lord arioch the dark mist heaved and began to take shape elric spared a look towards the corner and shud dered despite his inurement to hellborn horror the warriors now had their backs to the thing in the corner and elric was by the window the amor phous mass that was a less than pleasant manifesta tion of elrics fickle patron god heaved again and elric made out its intolerably alien shape bile flooded into his mouth and as he drove the soldiers towards the thing which was sinuously flooding for ward he fought against madness suddenly the soldiers seemed to sense that there was something behind them they turned four of them and each screamed insanely as the black hor ror made one final rush to engulf them arioch crouched over them sucking out their souls then slowly their bones began to give and snap and still shrieking bestially the men flopped like obnoxious invertebrates upon the floor their spines broken they still lived elric turned away thankful for once that cymoril slept and leapt to the window ledge he looked down and realised with despair that he was not going to escape by that route after all several hundred feet lay between him and the ground he rushed to the door where yyrkoon his eyes wide with fear was trying to drive arioch back arioch was already fading elric pushed past his cousin spared a final glance for cymoril then ran the way he had come his feet flipping on blood tanglebones met him at the head of the dark stairway what has happened king elricwhats in there elric seized tanglebones by his lean shoulder and made him descend the stairs no time he panted but we must hurry while yyrkoon is still engaged with his current problem in five days time imrryr will experience a new phase in her historyperhaps the last i want you to make sure that cymoril is safe is that dear aye lord but they reached the door and tanglebones shot the bolts and opened it there is no time for me to say anything else i must escape while i can i will return in five days with companions you will realise what i mean when that time comes take cymoril to the tower of darputnaand await me there then elric was gone softfooted running into the night with the shrieks of the dying still ringing through the blackness after him three elric stood unspeaking in the prow of count smior gans flagship since his return to the fjord and the fleets subsequent sailing for open sea he had spoken only orders and those in the tersest of terms the sea lords muttered that a great hate lay in him that it festered his soul and made him a dangerous man to have as comrade or enemy and even count smior gan avoided the moody albino the reaver prows struck eastward and the sea was black with light ships dancing on the bright water in all directions they looked like the shadow of some enormous seabird flung on the water nearly half a thousand fighting ships stained the oceanall of them of similar form long and slim and built for speed rather than battle since they were for coast raiding and trading sails were caught by the pale sun bright colours of fresh canvasorange blue black purple red yellow light green or white and every ship had sixteen or more rowerseach rower a fighting man the crews of the ships were also the warriors who would attack imrryrthere was no wastage of good manpower since the seanations were underpopulated losing hundreds of men each year in their regular raids in the centre of the great fleet certain larger vessels sailed these carried great catapults on their decks and were to be used for storming the sea wall of imrryr count smiorgan and the other lords looked at their ships with pride but elric only stared ahead of him never sleeping rarely moving his white face lashed by salt spray and wind his white hand tight upon his swordhilt the reaver ships ploughed steadily eastwards forging towards the dragon isle and fantastic wealthor hellish horror relentlessly doomdriven they beat onwards their oars splashing in unison their sails bellying taut with a good wind onwards they sailed towards imrryr the beauti ful to rape and plunder the worlds oldest city two days after the fleet had set sail the coastline of the dragon isle was sighted and the rattle of arms replaced the sound of oars as the mighty fleet hove to and prepared to accomplish what sane men thought impossible orders were bellowed from ship to ship and the fleet began to mass into battle formation then the oars creaked in their grooves and ponderously with sails now furled the fleet moved forward again it was a clear day cold and fresh and there was a tense excitement about all the men from sea lord to galley hand as they considered the immediate fu ture and what it might bring serpent prows bent towards the great stone wall which blocked off the first entrance to the harbour it was nearly a hundred feet high and towers were built upon it more functional than the lacelike spires of the city which shimmered in the distance behind them the ships of imrryr were the only vessels allowed to pass through the great gate in the centre of the wall and the route through the mazethe exact entrance evenwas a wellkept secret from outsiders on the sea wall which now loomed tall above the fleet amazed guards scrambled frantically to their posts to them threat of attack was wellnigh un thinkable yet here it wasa great fleet the greatest they had ever seencome against imrryr the beauti full they took to their posts their yellow cloaks and kilts rustling their bronze armour rattling but they moved with bewildered reluctance as if refusing to accept what they saw and they went to their posts with desperate fatalism knowing that even if the ships never entered the maze itself they would not be alive to witness the reavers failure dyvim tarkan commander of the wall was a sensitive man who loved life and its pleasures he was highbrowed and handsome with a thin wisp of beard and a tiny moustache he looked well in the bronze armour and highplumed helmet he did not want to die he issued terse orders to his men and with wellordered precision they obeyed him he lis tened with concern to the distant shouts from the ships and he wondered what the first move of the reavers would be he did not wait long for his an swer a catapult on one of the leading vessels twanged throatily and its throwing arm rushed up releasing a great rock which sailed with every appearance of leisurely grace towards the wall it fell short and splashed into the sea which frothed against the stones of the wall swallowing hard and trying to control the shake in his voice dyvim tarkan ordered his own catapult to discharge with a thudding crash the release rope was cut and a retaliatory iron ball went hurtling towards the enemy fleet so tightpacked were the ships that the ball could not missit struck flail on the deck of the flagship of dharmit of jharkor and crushed the timbers in within seconds accompanied by the cries of maimed and drowning men the ship had sunk and dharmit with it some of the crew were taken aboard other vessels but the wounded were left to drown another catapult sounded and this time a tower full of archers was squarely hit masonry erupted outwards and those who still lived fell sickeningly to die in the foamtipped sea lashing the wall this time angered by the deaths of their comrades imrryrian archers sent back a stream of slim arrow into the enemys midst reavers howled as red fletched shafts buried themselves thirstily in flesh but reavers returned the arrows liberally and soot only a handful of men were left on the wall as fur ther catapult rocks smashed into towers and men destroying their only warmachine and part of the wall besides dyvim tarkan still lived though red blood stained his yellow tunic and an arrow shaft pro truded from his left shoulder he still lived when the first ramship moved intractably towards the great wooden gate and smashed against it weakening it a second ship sailed in beside it and between them they stove in the gate and glided through the entrance the first nonimrryrian ships ever to do such a thing perhaps it was outraged horror that tradition had been broken which caused poor dyvim tarkan to lose his footing at the edge of the wall and fall screaming down to break his neck on the deck of count smiorgans flagship as it sailed tri umphantly through the gate now the ramships made way for count smior gans craft for elric had to lead the way through the maze ahead of them loomed five tall entrances black gaping maws all alike in shape and size elric pointed to the third from the left and with short strokes the oarsmen began to paddle the ship into the dark mouth of the entrance for some minutes they sailed in darkness flares shouted elric light the flares torches had already been prepared and these were now lighted the men saw that they were in a vast tunnel hewn out of natural rock which twisted tortuously in all directions keep close elric ordered and his voice was mag nified a score of times in the echoing cavern torch light blazed and elrics face was a mask of shadow and frisking light as the torches threw up long tongues of flame to the bleak roof behind him men could be heard muttering in awe and as more craft entered the maze and lit their own torches elric could see some torches waver as their bearers trembled in superstitious fear elric felt some dis comfort as he glanced through the flickering shadows and his eyes caught by torchflare gleamed fever bright with dreadful monotony the oars splashed on wards as the tunnel widened and several more cave mouths came into sight the middle entrance elric ordered the steersman in the stern nodded and guided the ship towards the entrance elric had indi cated apart from the muted murmur of some men and the splash of oars there was a grim and ominous silence in the towering cavern elric stared down at the cold dark water and shuddered eventually they moved once again into bright sun light and the men looked upwards marvelling at the height of the great walls above them upon those walls squatted more yellowclad bronzearmoured archers and as count smiorgans vessel led the way out of the black caverns the torches still burning in the cool winter air arrows began to hurtle down into the narrow canyon biting into throats and limbs faster howled elric row fasterspeed is our only weapon now with frantic energy the oarsmen bent to their sweeps and the ships began to pick up speed even though imrryrian arrows took heavy toll of the reaver crewmen now the highwalled channel ran straight and elric saw the quays of imrryr ahead of him faster faster our prize is in sight then suddenly the ship broke past the wails and was in the calm waters of the harbour facing the warriors drawn up on the quay the ship halted waiting for reinforcements to plunge out of the channel and join them when twenty ships were through elric gave the command to attack the quay and now stormbringer howled from its scabbard the flagships port side thudded against the quay as arrows rained down upon it shafts whistled all around elric but miraculously he was unscathed as he led a bunch of yelling rearers on to land imrryrian axemen bunched forward and confronted the reavers but it was plain that they had little spirit for the fightthey were too disconcerted by the course which events had taken elrics black blade struck with frenzied force at the throat of the leading axeman and sheared off his head howling demoniacally now that it had again tasted blood the sword began to writhe in elrics grasp seeking fresh flesh in which to bite there was a hard grim smile on the albinos colourless lips and his eyes were narrowed as he smack without discrim ination at the warriors he planned to leave the fighting to those he had led to imrryr for he had other things to doand quickly behind the yellowgarbed soldiers the tall towers of imrryr rose beautiful in their soft and scintillating colours of coral pink and powdery blue of gold and pale yellow white and subtle green one such tower was elrics objectivethe tower of darputna where he had ordered tanglebones to take cymoril knowing that in the confusion this would be possible elric hacked a blooddrenched path through those who attempted to halt him and men fell back screaming horribly as the runesword drank their souls now elric was past them leaving them to the bright blades of the reavers who poured on to the quayside and was running up through the twisting streets his sword slaying anyone who attempted to stop him like a whitefaced ghoul he was his cloth ing tattered and bloody his armour chipped and scratched but he ran speedily over the cobblestones of the twisting streets and came at last to the slender tower of hazy blue and soft goldthe tower of darputna its door was open showing that someone was inside and elric rushed through it and entered the large groundfloor chamber no one greeted him tanglebones he yelled his voice roaring loudly even in his own ears tanglebonesare you here he leapt up the stairs in great bounds calling his servants name on the third floor he stopped sud denly hearing a low groan from one of the rooms tanglebonesis that you elric strode towards the room hearing a strangled gasping he pushed open the door and his stomach seemed to twist within him as he saw the old man lying upon the bare floor of the chamber striving vainly to stop the flow of blood which gouted from a great wound in his side whats happened manwheres cymoril tanglebones old face twisted in pain and grief sheii brought her here master as you ordered but he coughed and blood dribbled down his wizened chin butprince yyrkoonhehe appre hended memust have followed us here hestruck me down and took cymoril back with himsaid shed besafe in the tower of baalnezbett mas terim sorry so you should be elric retorted savagely then his tone softened do not worry old friendill avenge you and myself i can still reach cymoril now i know where yyrkoon has taken her thank you for trying tanglebonesmay your long journey down the last river be uneventful he turned abruptly on his heel and left the cham ber running down the stairs and out into the street again the tower of baalnezbett was the highest tower in the royal palace elric knew it well for it was there that his ancestors had studied their dark sor ceries and conducted frightful experiments he shuddered as he thought what yyrkoon might be do ing to his own sister the streets of the city seemed hushed and strangely deserted but elric had no time to ponder why this should be so instead he dashed towards the palace found the main gate unguarded and the main entrance to the building deserted this too was unique but it constituted luck for elric as he made his way upwards climbing familiar ways towards the topmost tower finally he reached a door of shimmering black crystal which had no bolt or handle to it frenziedly elric struck at the crystal with his sorcerous blade but the crystal appeared only to flow and reform his blows had no effect elric racked his mind seeking to remember the single alien word which would make the door open he dared not put himself in the trance which would have in time brought the word to his lips instead he had to dredge his subconscious and bring the word forth it was dangerous but there was little else he could do his whole frame trembled as his face twisted and his brain began to shake the word was coming as his vocal chords jerked in his throat and his chest heaved he coughed the word out and his whole mind and body ached with the strain then he cried i command theeopen he knew that once the door opened his cousin would be aware of his presence but he had to risk it the crystal expanded pulsating and seething and then began to flow out it flowed into nothingness into something beyond the physical universe beyond time elric breathed thankfully and passed into the tower of baalnezbett but now an eerie fire chill ing and mindshattering was licking around elric as he struggled up the steps towards the central cham ber there was a strange music surrounding him uncanny music which throbbed and sobbed and pounded in his head above him he saw a leering yyrkoon a black runesword also in his hand the mate of the one in elrics own grasp hellspawn elric said thickly weakly i see you have recovered mournbladewell test its powers against its brother if you dare i have come to destroy you cousin stormbringer was giving forth a peculiar moaning sound which sighed over the shrieking unearthly music accompanying the licking chilling fire the runesword writhed in elrics fist and he had diffi culty in controlling it summoning all his strength he plunged up the last few steps and aimed a wild blow at yyrkoon beyond the eerie fire bubbled yel lowgreen lava on all sides above and beneath the two menwere surrounded only by the misty fire and the lava which lurked beyond itthey were outside the earth and facing one another for a final battle the lava seethed and began to ooze inwards dis persing the fire the two blades met and a terrible shrieking roar went up elric felt his whole arm go numb and it tingled sickeningly elric felt like a puppet he was no longer his own masterthe blade was deciding his actions for him the blade with elric behind it roared past its brother sword and cut a deep wound in yyrkoons left arm he howled and his eyes widened in agony mournblade struck back at stormbringer catching elric in the very place he had wounded his cousin he sobbed in pain but continued to move upwards now wounding yyrkoon in the right side with a blow strong enough to have killed any other man yyrkoon laughed then laughed like a gibbering demon from the foulest depths of hell his sanity had broken at last and el tic now had the advantage but the great sorcery which his cousin had conjured was still in evidence and elric felt as if a giant had grasped himwas crushing him as he pressed his advantage yyrkoons blood spouting from the wound and covering elric also the lava was slowly withdrawing and now elric saw the entrance to the central chamber behind his cousin another form moved elric gasped cymoril had awakened and with horror on her face was shrieking at him the sword still swung in a black arc cutting down yyrkoons brother blade and breaking the usurpers guard elric cried cymoril desperately save mesave me now else we are doomed for eternity elric was puzzled by the girls words he could not understand the sense of them savagely he drove yyrkoon upwards towards the chamber elricput stormbringer away sheath your sword or we shall part again but even if he could have controlled the whistling blade elric would not have sheathed it hate domi nated his being and he would sheathe it in his cousins evil heart before he put it aside cymoril was weeping now pleading with him but elric could do nothing the drooling idiot thing which had been yyrkoon of imrryr turned at its sisters cries and stared leeringly at her it cackled and reached out one shaking hand to seize the girl by her shoulder she struggled to escape but yyrkoon still had his evil strength taking ad vantage of his opponents distraction elric cut deep through his body almost severing the trunk from the waist and yet incredibly yyrkoon remained alive drawing his vitality from the blade which still clashed against elrics own runecarved sword with a final push he flung cymoril forward and she died screaming on the point of stormbringer then yyrkoon laughed one final caching shriek and his black soul went howling down to hell the tower resumed its former proportions all fire and lava gone elric was dazedunable to marshal his thoughts he looked down at the dead bodies of the brother and the sister he saw them at first only as corpsesa mans and a womans then dark truth dawned on his clearing brain and he moaned in grief like an animal he had slain the girl he loved the runesword fell from his grasp stained by cymorils lifeblood and clattered un heeded down the stairs sobbing now elric dropped beside the dead girl and lifted her in his arms cymoril he moaned his whole body throbbing cymorili have slain you four elric looked back at the roaring crumbling tum bling flamespewing ruins of imrryr and drove his sweating oarsmen faster the ship sail still un furled bucked as a contrary current of wind caught it and elric was forced to cling to the ships side lest he be tossed overboard he looked back at imrryr and felt a tightness in his throat as he realised that he was truly rootless now a renegade and a woman slayer though involuntarily the latter he had lost the only woman he had loved in his blind lust for re venge now it was finishedeverything was finished he could envisage no future for his future had been bound up with his past and now effectively that past was flaming in ruins behind him dry sobs eddied in his chest and he gripped the ships rail yet more firmly his mind reluctantly brooded on cymoril he had laid her corpse upon a couch and had set fire to the tower then he had gone back to find the reavers successful straggling back to their ships loaded with loot and girlslaves jubilantly firing the tall and beautiful buildings as they went he had caused to be destroyed the last tangible sign that the grandiose magnificent bright empire had ever existed he felt that most of himself was gone with it elric looked back at imrryr and suddenly a greater sadness overwhelmed him as a tower as deli cate and as beautiful as fine lace cracked and toppled with flames leaping about it he had shattered the last great monument to the earlier racehis own race men might have learned again one day to build strong slender towers like those of imrryr but now the knowledge was dying with the thundering chaos of the fall of the dream ing city and the fastdiminishing race of melnibone but what of the dragon masters neither they nor their golden ships had met the attacking reavers only their footsoldiers had been there to defend the city had they hiddentheir ships in some secret waterway and fled inland when the reavers overran the city they had put up too short a fight to be truly beaten it had been far too easy now that the ships were retreating were they planning some sud den retaliation elric felt that they might have such a planperhaps a plan concerning dragons he shud dered he had told the others nothing of the beasts which melniboneans had controlled for centuries even now someone might be unlocking the gates of the underground dragon caves he turned his mind away from the unnerving prospect as the fleet headed towards open sea elrics eyes were still looking sadly towards imrryr as he paid silent homage to the city of his forefathers and the dead cymoril he felt hot bitterness sweep over him again as the memory of her death upon his own swordpoint came sharply to him he recalled her warning when he had left her to go adventuring in the young kingdoms that by putting yyrkoon on the ruby throne as regent by relinquishing his power for a year he doubled them both he cursed himself then a muttering like a rollof distant thunder spread through the fleet and he wheeled sharply intent on discovering the cause of the con sternation thirty goldensailed melnibonean battle barges had appeared on both sides of the harbour issuing from two mouths of the maze elric realised that they must have hidden in the other channels wait ing to attack the fleet when they returned satiated and depleted great wargalleys they were the last ships of melnibone and the secret of their building was unknown they had a sense of age and slumber ing might about them as they rowed swiftly each with four or five banks of great sweeping oars to en circle the raven ships elrics fleet seemed to shrink before his eyes until it seemed as though it were a bobbing collection of woodshavings against the towering splendour of the shimmering battle barges they were wellequipped and flesh for a fight whereas the weary reapers were intensely battletired there was only one way to save a small part of the fleet elric knew he would have to conjure a witchwind for sailpower mostof the flagships were around him and he now occupied that of yaris for the youth had got himself wildly drunk and had died by the knife of an melnibonean slave wench next to elrics ship was count smiorgans and the stocky sea lord was frowning knowing full well that he and his ships for all their superior num bers would not stand up to a seafight but the conjuring of winds great enough to move many vessels was a dangerous thing for it released colossal power and the elementals who controlled the winds were apt to turn upon the sorcerer himself if he was not more than careful but it was the only chance otherwise the rams which sent ripples from the golden prows would smash the reaver ships to driftwood steeling himself elric began to speak the ancient and terrible manyvowelled names of the beings who existed in the air again he could not risk the trancestate for he had to watch for signs of the ele mentals turning upon him he called to them in a speech that was sometimes high like the cry of a gan net sometimes rolling like the roar of shorebound surf and the dim shapes of the powers of the wind began to flit before his blurred gaze his heart throbbed horribly in his ribs and his legs felt weal he summoned all hisstrength and conjured a wind which shrieked wildly and chaotically about him rocking even the huge melnibonean ships back and forth then he directed the wind and sent it into the sails of some forty of the reaver ships many he could not save for they lay even outside his wide range but forty of the craft escaped the smashing rams and amidst the sound of howling wind and sun dered timbers leapt on the waves their masts creak ing as the wind cracked into their sails oars were torn from the hands of the rowers leaving a wake of broken wood on the white salt trail which boiled be hind each of the reaver ships quite suddenly they were beyond the slowly dos ing circle of melnibonean ships and careering madly across the open sea while all the crews sensed a dif ference in the air and caught glimpses of strange softshaped forms around them there was a discom forting sense of evil about the beings which aided them an awesome alienness smiorgan waved to elric and grinned thankfully were safe thanks to you elric he yelled across the water i knew youd bring us luck elric ignored him now the dragon lords vengeancebent gave chase almost as fast as the magicaided reaver fleet were the golden barges of imrryr and some reaver galleys whose masts cracked and split beneath the force of the wind driving them were caught elric saw mighty grappling hooks of dully gleam ing metal swing out from the decks of the imrryrian galleys and thud with a moan of wrenched timber into those of the fleet which lay broken and power less behind him fire leapt from catapults upon the dragon lords ships and careered towards many a fleeing reaver craft seating foulstinking flame hissed like lava across the decks and ate into planks like vitriol into paper men shrieked beating vainly at brightly burning clothes some leaping into water which would not extinguish the fire some sank beneath the sea and it was possible to trace their descent as flaming even below the surface men and ships fluttered to the bottom like blazing tired moths reaver decks untouched by fire ran red with reaver blood as the enraged imrryrian warriors swung down the grappling ropes and dropped among the raiders wielding great swords and battle axes and wreaking terrible havoc amongst the sea ravens imrryrian arrows and imrryrian javelins swooped from the towering decks of imrryrian gal leys and tore into the panicky men on the smaller ships all this elric saw as he and his vessels began slowly to overhaul the leading imrryrian ship flag galley of admiral magum colim commander of the melnibonean fleet now elric spared a word for count smiorgan weve outrun them he shouted above the howling wind to the next ship where smiorgan stood star ing wideeyed at the sky but keep your ships heading westwards or were finished but smiorgan did not reply he still looked sky ward and there was horror in his eyes in the eyes of a man who before this had never known the quiver ing bite of fear uneasily elric let his own eyes fol low the gaze of smiorgan then he saw them they were dragons without doubt the great reptiles were some miles away but elric knew the stamp of the huge flying beasts theaverage wing span of these nearextinct monsters was some thirty feet across their snakelike bodies beginning in a narrowsnouted head and terminating in a dreadful whip of a tail were forty feet long and although they did not breathe the legendary fire and smoke elric knew that their venom was combustible and could set fire to wood or fabric on contact imrryrian warriors rode the dragon backs armed with long spearlike goads they blew strangely shaped horns which sang out curious notes over the turbulent sea and calm blue sky nearing the golden fleet now halfaleague away the leading dragon sailed down and circled towards the huge golden flaggalley its wings making a sound like the crack of lightning as they beat through the air the greygreen scaled monster hovered over the golden ship as it heaved in the whitefoamed turbu lent sea framed against the cloudless sky the dragon was in sharp perspective and it was possible for elric to get a clear view of it the goad which the dragon master waved to admiral magum colim was a long slim spear upon which the strange pen nant of black and yellow zigzag lines was even at this distance noticeable elric recognised the insig nia on the pennant dyvim tvar friend of elrics youth lord of the dragon caves was leading his charges to claim ven geance for imrryr the beautiful elric howled across the water to smiorgan these are your main danger now do what you can to stave them off there was a rattle of iron as the men prepared nearhopelessly to repel the new menace witchwind would give little advantage over the fastflying dragons now dyvim tvar had evidently conferred with magum colim and his goad lashed out at the dragon throat the huge reptile jerked upwards and began to gain altitude eleven other dragons were behind it joining it now with seeming slowness the dragons began to beat relentlessly towards the reaver fleet as the crewmen prayed to their own gods for a miracle they were doomed there was no escaping the fact every reaver ship was doomed and the raid had been fruitless elric could see the despair in the faces of the men as the masts of the reaver ships continued to bend under the strain of the shrieking witchwind they could do nothing now but die elric fought to rid his mind of the swirling uncer tainty which filled it he drew his sword and felt the pulsating evil power which lurked in runecarved stormbringer but he hated that power nowfor it had caused him to kill the only human he had cher ished he realised how much of his strength he owed to the blackiron sword of his fathers and how weak he might be without it he was an albino and that meant that he lacked the vitality of a normal human being savagely futilely as the mist in his mind was replaced by red fear he cursed the pretensions of re venge he had held cursed the day when he had agreed to lead the raid on imrryr and most of all he bitterly vilified dead yyrkoon and his twisted envy which had been the cause of the whole doomridden course of events but it was too late now for curses of any kind the loud slapping of beating dragon wings filled the air and the monsters loomed over the fleeing reaver craft he had to make some kind of decisionthough he had no love for life he refused to die by the hands of his own people when he died he promised himself it would be by his own hand he made his decision hating himself he called off the witchwind as the dragon venom seared down and struck the last ship in line he put all his powers into sending a stronger wind into the sails of his own boat while his bewil deled comrades in the suddenly becalmed ships called over the water inquiring desperately the rea son for his act elrics ship was moving fast now and might just escape the dragons he hoped so he deserted the man who had trusted him count smiorgan and watched as venom poured from the sky and engulfed him in blazing green and scarlet flame elric fled keeping his mind from thoughts of the future and sobbed aloud that proud prince of ruins and he cursed the malevolent gods for the black day when idly for their amusement they had spawned men behind him the last reaver ships flared into sud den appalling brightness and although halfthankful that they had escaped the fate of their comrades the crew looked at elric accusingly he sobbed on not heeding them great griefs racking his soul a night later off the coast of an island called pan tang when the ship was safe from the dreadful re criminations of the dragon masters and their beasts elric stood brooding in the stern while the men eyed him with fear and hatred muttering of betrayal and heartless cowardice they appeared to have forgot ten their own fear and subsequent safety elric brooded and he held the black runesword in his two hands stormbringer was more than an ordi nary battleblade this he had known for years but now he realised that it was possessed of more sen tience than he had imagined the frightful thing had used its wielder and had made elric destroy cymoril yet he was horribly dependent upon it he realised this withsoulrending certainty but he feared and resented the swords powerhated it bit terly for the chaos it had wrought in his brain and spirit in an agony of uncertainty he held the blade in his hands and forced himself to weigh the factors involved without the sinister sword he would lose prideperhaps even lifebut he might know the soothing tranquillity of pure rest with it he would have power and strengthbut the sword would guide him into a doomracked future he would sa vour powerbut never peace he drew a great sobbing breath and blind mis giving influencing him threw the sword into the moondrenched sea incredibly it did not sink it did not even float on the water it fell point forwards into the sea and stuck there quivering as if it were embedded in tim ber it remained throbbing in the water six inches of its blade immersed and began to give off a weird devilscreama howl of horrible malevolence with a choking curse elric stretched out his slim whitely gleaming hand trying to recover the sen tient hellblade he stretched further leaning far out over the rail he could not grasp itit lay some feet from him still gasping a sickening sense of defeat overwhelming him he dropped over the side and plunged into the bonechilling water striking out with strained grotesque strokes towards the hovering sword he was beatenthe sword had won he reached it and put his fingers around the hilt at once it settled in his hand and elric felt strength seep slowly back into his aching body then he real ised that he and the sword were interdependent for though he needed the blade stormbringer parasitic required a userwithout a man to wield it the blade was also powerless we must be bound to one another then elric murmured despairingly bound by hellforged chains and fatehaunted circumstance well then let it be thus soand men will have cause to tremble and flee when they hear the names of elric of melni bone and stormbringer his sword we are two of a kindproduced by an age which has deserted us let us give this age cause to hate us strong again elric sheathed stormbringer and the sword settled against his side then with powerful strokes he began to swim towards the island while the men he left on the ship breathed with relief and speculated whether he would live or perish in the bleak waters of that strange and nameless sea book two while the gods laugh i while the gods laugh the worlds vortex am maelstrom of passions in that hidden sea whose waves of alltime lap the coasts of me and in small compass the dark waters cram mervyn peake shapes and sounds one one night as elric sat moodily drinking alone in a tavern a wingless woman of myyrrhn came gliding out of the storm and rested her lithe body against him her face was thin and frailboned almost as white as elrics own albino skin and she wore flimsy pale green robes which contrasted well with her dark red hair the tavern was ablaze with candleflame and alive with droning argument and gusty laughter but the words of the woman of myyrrhn came clear and liq uid carrying over the zesty din i have sought you twenty days she said to elric who regarded her insolently through hooded crim son eyes and lazed in a highbacked chair a silver winecup in his longfingered right hand and his left on the pommel of his sorcerous runesword storm bringer twenty days murmured the melnibonean softly speaking as if to himself deliberately rude a long time for a beautiful and lonely woman to be wander ing the world he opened his eyes a trifle wider and spoke to her directly i am elric of melnibone as you evidently know i grant no favours and ask none bearing this in mind tell me why you have sought me for twenty days equably the woman replied undaunted by the al binos supercilious tone you are a bitter man elric i know this alsoand you are griefhaunted for rea sons which are already legend i ask you no fa voursbut bring you myself and a proposition what do you desire most in the world peace elric told her simply then he smiled ironically and said i am an evil man lady and my destiny is helldoomed but i am not unwise nor un fair let me remind you a little of the truth call this legend if you preferi do not care a woman died a year ago on the blade of my trusty sword he patted the blade sharply and his eyes were suddenly hard and selfmocking since then i have courted no woman and desired none why should i break such secure habits if asked i grant you that i could speak poetry to you and that you have a grace and beauty which moves me to in teresting speculation but i would not ad any part of my dark burden upon one as exquisite as you any relationship between us other than formal would necessitate my unwilling shifting of part of that burden he paused for an instant and then said slowly i should admit that i scream in my sleep sometimes and am often tortured by incommunicable selfloathing go while you can lady and forget elric for he can bring only grief to your soul with a quick movement he turned his gaze from her and lifted the silver winecup draining it and re plenishing it from a jug at his side no said the wingless woman of myyrrhn calmly i will not come with me she rose and gently took elrics hand without knowing why elric allowed himself to be led from the tavern and out into the wild rainless storm which howled around the filkharian city of raschil a protective and cynical smile hovered about his mouth as she drew him towards the sealashed quay side where she told him her name shaarilla of the dancing mist wingless daughter of a dead necro mancera cripple in her own strange land and an outcast elric felt uncomfortably drawn to this calmeyed woman who wasted few words he felt a great surge of emotion well within him emotion he had never thought to experience again and he wanted to take her finely moulded shoulders and press her slim body to his but he quelled the urge and studied her marble delicacy and her wild hair which flowed in the wind about her head silence rested comfortably between them while the chaotic wind howled mournfully over the sea here elric could ignore the warm stink of the city and he felt almost relaxed at last looking away from him towards the swirling sea hergreen robe curling in the wind she said you have heard of course of the dead gods book elric nodded he was interested despite the need he felt to disassociate himself as much as possible from his fellows the mythical book was believed to contain knowledge which could solve many problems that had plagued men for centuriesit held a holy and mighty wisdom which every sorcerer desired to sample but it was believed destroyed hurled into the sun when the old gods were dying in the cosmic wastes which lay beyond the outer reaches of the so lar system another legend apparently of later origin spoke vaguely of the dark ones who had in terrupted the books sunward coursing and had stolen it before it could be destroyed most scholars discounted this legend arguing that by this time the book would have come to light if it did still ex ist elric made himself speak flatly so that he ap peared to be disinterested when he answered shaa rilla why do you mention the book i know that it exists shaarilla replied intensely and i know where it is my father acquired the knowledge just before he died myselfand the bookyou may have if you will help me get it could the secret of peace be contained in the book elric wondered would he if he found it be able to dispense with stormbringer if you want it so badly that you seek my help he said eventually why do you not wish to keep it because i would be afraid to have such a thing perpetually in my custodyit is not a book for a woman to own but you are possibly the last mighty nigromancer left in the world and it is fitting that you should have it besides you might kill me to ob tain iti would never be safe with such a volume in my hands i need only one small part of its wisdom what is that elric inquired studying her patti clan beauty with a new pulse stirring within him her mouth set and the lids fell over her eyes when we have the book in our handsthen you will have your answer not before this answer is good enough elric remarked quickly seeing that he would gain no more informa tion at that stage and the answer appeals to me then half before he realised it he seized her shoul ders in his slim pale hands and pressed his colour less lips to her scarlet mouth elric and shaarilla rode westwards towards the silent land across the lush plains of shazaar where their ship had berthed two days earlier the border country between shazaar and the silent land was a lonely stretch of territory unoccupied even by peasant dwellings a nomans land though fertile and rich in natural wealth the inhabitants of sha zaar had deliberately refrained from extending their borders further for though the dwellers in the silent land rarely ventured beyond the marshes of the mist the natural borderline between the two lands the inhabitants of shazaar held their unknown neighbours in almost superstitious fear the journey had been clean and swift though ominous with several persons who should have known nothing of their purpose warning the tray tilers of nearing danger elric brooded recognising the signs of doom but choosing to ignore them and communicate nothing to shaarilla who for her part seemed content with elrics silence they spoke little in the day and so saved their breath for the wild loveplay of the night the thud of the two horses hooves on the soft turf the muted creak and darer of elrics harness and sword were the only sounds to break the stillness of the clear winter day as the pair rode steadily nearing the quaking treacherous trails of the marshes of the mist one gloomy night they reached the borders of the silentland marked by the marsh and they halted and made camp pitching their silk tent on a hill overlooking the mistshrouded wastes banked like black pillows against the horizon the clouds were ominous the moon lurked behind them sometimes piercing them sufficiently to send a pale tentative beam down on to the glistening marsh or its ragged grassy frontiers once a moonbeam glanced off silver illuminating the dark silhouette of elric but as if repelled by the sight of a living crea ture on that bleak hill the moon once again slunk behind its cloudshield leaving elric thinking deeply leaving elric in the darkness he desired thunder rumbled over distant mountains sound ing like the laughter of faroff gods elric shivered pulled his blue cloak more tightly about him and continued to stare over the misted lowlands shaarilla came to him soon and she stood beside him swathed in a thick woollen cloak which could not keep out all the damp chill in the air the silent land she murmured are all the sto ries true elric did they teach you of it in old melnibone elric frowned annoyed that she had disturbed his thoughts he turned abruptly to look at her staring blankly through his crimsonirised eyes for a mo ment and then saying flatly the inhabitants are unhuman and feared this i know few men ventured into their territory ever none have returned to my knowledge even in the days when melnibone was a powerful empire this was one nation my ancestors never rulednor did they desire to do so the denizens of the silent land are said to be a dying race far more evil than my an cestors ever were who enjoyed dominion over the earth long before men gained any sort of power they rarely venture beyond the confines of their ter ritory nowadays encompassed as it is by marshland and mountains shaarilla laughed then with little humour so they are unhuman are they elric then what of my people who are related to them what of me elric youre human enough for me replied elric in souciantly looking her in the eyes she smiled no compliment she said but ill take it for oneuntil your glib tongue finds a better that night they slept restlessly and as he had predicted elric screamed agonisingly in his turbu lent terrorfilled sleep and he called a name which made shaarillas eyes fill with pain and jealousy that name was cymoril wideeyed in his grim sleep elric seemed lto be staring at the one he named speaking other words in a sibilant language which made shaarilla block her ears and shudder the next morning as they broke camp folding the rustling fabric of the yellow silk tent between them shaarilla avoided looking at elric directly but later since he made no move to speak she asked him a question in a voice which shook somewhat it was a question which she needed to ask but one which came hard to her lips why do you desire the dead gods book elric what do you believe you will find in it elric shrugged dismissing the question but she repeated her words less slowly with more insistence very well then he said eventually but it is not easy to answer you in a few sentences i desire if you like to know one of two things and what is that elric the tall albino dropped the folded tent to the grass and sighed his fingers played nervously with the pommel of his runesword can an ultimate god existor not that is what i need to know shaarilla if my life is to have any direction at all the lords of law and chaos now govern our lives but is there some being greater than them shaarilla put a hand on elrics arm why must you know she said despairingly sometimes i seek the comfort of a benign god shaarilla my mind goes out lying awake at night searching through black barrenness for somethinganythingwhich will take me to it warm me protect me tell me that there is order in the chaotic tumble of the universe that it is consist ent this precision of the planets not simply a brief bright spark of sanity in an eternity of malevolent anarchy elric sighed and his quiet tones were tinged with hopelessness without some confirmation of the order of things my only comfort is to accept the anarchy this way i can revel in chaos and know without fear that we are all doomed from the startthat our brief existence is both meaningless and damned i can accept then that we are more than forsaken because there was never anything there to forsake us i have weighed the proof shaarilla and must be lieve that anarchy prevails in spite of all the laws which seemingly govern our actions our sorcery our logic i see only chaos in the world if the book we seek tells me otherwise then i shall gladly believe it until then i will put my trust only in my sword and myself shaarilla stared at elric strangely could not this philosophy of yours have been influenced by recent events in your past do you fear the consequences of your murder and treachery is it not more comfort ing for you to believe in deserts which are rarely just elric turned on her crimson eyes blazing in anger but even as he made to speak the anger fled him and he dropped his eyes towards the ground hood ing them from her gaze perhaps he said lamely i do not know that is the only real truth shaarilla i do not know shaarilla nodded her face lit by an enigmatic sym pathy but elric did not see the look she gave him for his own eyes were full of crystal tears which flowed down his lean white face and took his strength and will momentarily from him i am a man possessed he groaned and without this devilblade i carry i would not be a man at all two they mounted their swift black horses and spurred them with abandoned savagery down the hillside towards the marsh their cloaks whipping be hind them as the wind caught them lashing them high into the air both rode with set hard faces re fusing to acknowledge the aching uncertainty which lurked within them and the horses hooves had splashed into quaking bogland before they could halt cursing elric tugged hard on his reins pulling his horse back on to firm ground shaarilla too fought her own panicky stallion andguided the beast to the safety of the turf how do we cross elric asked her impatiently there was a map shaarilla began hesitantly where is it itit was lost i lost it but i tried hard to memo rise it i think ill be able to get us safely across how did you lose itand why didnt you tell me of this before elric stormed im sorry elricbut for a whole day just before i found you in that tavern my memory was gone somehow i lived through a day without knowing itand when i awoke the map was missing elric frowned there is some force working against us i am sure he muttered but what it is i do not know he raised his voice and said to her let us hope that your memory is not too faulty now these marshes are infamous the world over but by all accounts only natural hazards wait for us he grimaced and put his fingers around the hilt of his runesword best go first shaarilla but stay dose lead the way she nodded dumbly and turned her horses head towards the north galloping along the bank until she came to a place where a great tapering rock loomed here a grassy path four feet or so across led out into the misty marsh they could only see a little distance ahead because of the dinging mist but it seemed that the trail remained firm for some way shaarilla walked her horse on to the path and jolted forward at a slow trot elric following imme diately behind her through the swirling heavy mist which shone whitely the horses moved hesitantly and their riders had to keep them on short tight rein the mist padded the marsh with silence and the gleaming watery fens around them stank with foul putres cence no animal scurried no bird shrieked above them everywhere was a haunting fearladen silence which made both horses and riders uneasy with panic in their throats elric and shaarilla rode on deeper and deeper into the unnatural marshes of the mist their eyes wary and even their nostrils quivering for scent of danger in the stinking morass hours later when the sun was long past its zenith shaarillas horse reared screaming and whinnying she shouted for elric her exquisite features twisted in fear as she stared into the mist he spurred his own bucking horse forwards and joined her something moved slowly menacingly in the ding ing whiteness elrics right hand whipped over to his left side and grasped the hilt of stormbringer the blade shrieked out of its scabbard a black fire gleaming along its length and alien power flow ing from it into elrics arm and through his body a weird unholy light leapt into elrics crimson eyes and his mouth was wrenched into a hideous grin as he forced the frightened horse further into the skulking mist arioch lord of the seven darks be with me now elric yelled as he made out the shifting shape ahead of him it was white like the mist yet some how darker it stretched high above elrics head it was nearly eight feet tall and almost as broad but it t was still only an outline seeming to have no face or limbsonly movement darting malevolent move ment but arioch his patron god chose not to hear elric could feel his horses great heart beating be tween his legs as the beast plunged forward under its riders iron control shaarilla was screaming some thing behind him but he could not hear the words elric hacked at the white shape but his sword met only mist and it howled angrily the fearcrazed horse would go no further and elric was forced to dismount keep hold of the steed he shouted behind him to shaarilla and moved on light feet towards the dart ing shape which hovered ahead of him blocking his path now he could make out some of its saliencies two eyes the colour of thin yellow wine were set high in the things body though it had no separate head a mouthing obscene slit filled with fangs lay just beneath the eyes it had no nose or ears that el tic could see four appendages sprang from its upper parts and its lower body slithered along the ground unsupported by any limbs elrics eyes ached as he looked at it it was incredibly disgusting to behold and its amorphous body gave off a stench of death and decay fighting down his fear the albino inched forward warily his sword held high to parry any thrust the thing might make with its arms elric recognised it from a description in one of his gri moires it was a mist giantpossibly the only mist giant bellbane even the wisest wizards were uncer tain how many existedone or many it was a ghoul of the swamplands which fed off the souls and the blood of men and beasts but the marshes of this mist were par to the east of bellbanes reputed haunts elric ceased to wonder why so few animals in habited that stretch of the swamp overhead the sky was beginning to darken stormbringer throbbed in elrics grasp as he called the names of the ancient demongods of his people the nauseous ghoul obviously recognised the names for an instant it wavered backwards el tic made his legs move towards the thing now he saw that the ghoul was not white at all but it had no colour to it that elric could recognise there was a suggestion of orangeness dashed with sickening greenish yellow but he did not see the colours with his eyeshe only sensed the alien unholy tinctures then elric rushed towards the thing shouting the names which now had no meaning to his surface con sciousness balaanmarthim aesma alastor sae bos verdelet nizilfkm haborym haborym of the fires which destroy his whole mind was torn in two part of him wanted to run to hide but hehad no control over the power which now gripped him and pushed him to meet the horror his sword blade hacked and slashed at the shape it was like trying to cut through watersentient pul sating water but stormbringer had effect the whole shape of the ghoul quivered as if in dreadful pain elric felt himself plucked into the air and his vision went he could see nothingdo nothing but hack and cut at the thing which now held him sweat poured from him as blindly he fought on pain which was hardly physicala deeper horrify ing pain filled his being as he howled now in agony and struck continually at the yielding bulk which embraced him and was pulling him slowly towards its gaping maw he struggled and writhed in the ob scene grasp of the thing with powerful arms it was holding him almost lasciviously drawing him closer as a rough lover would draw a girl even the mighty power intrinsic in the runesword did not seem enough to kill the monster though its efforts were somewhat weaker than earlier it still drew elric nearer to the gnashing slavering mouthslit elric cried the names again while stormbringer danced and sang an evil song in his right hand in agony elric writhed praying begging and promis ing but still he was drawn inch by inch towards the grinning maw savagely grimly he fought and again he screamed for arioch a mind touched hissardonic powerful eviland he knew arioch responded at last almost imperceptibly the mist giant weakened elric pressed his advantage and the knowledge that the ghoul was losing its strength gave him more power blindly agony piercing every nerve of his body he struck and struck then quite suddenly he was falling he seemed to fall for hours slowly weightlessly until he landed upon a surface which yielded beneath him he began to sink far off beyond time and space he heard a distant voice calling to him he did not want to hear it he was content to lie where he was as the cold comfort ing stuff in which he lay dragged him slowly into it self then some sixth sense made him realise that it was shaarillas voice calling him and he forced him self to make sense out of her words elricthe marshy youre in the marsh dont move he smiled to himself why should he move down he was sinking slowly calmlydown into the welcoming marsh had there been another time like this another marsh with a mental jolt full awareness of the situation came back to him and he jerked his eyes open above him was mist to one side a pool of unnam able colouring was slowly evaporating giving off a foul odour on the other side he could lust make out a human form gesticulating wildly beyond the human form were the barely discernible shapes of two horses shaarilla was there beneath him beneath him was the marsh thick stinking slime was sucking him downwards as he lay spreadeagled upon it halfsubmerged al ready stormbringer was still in his right hand he could just see it if he turned his head carefully he tried to lift the top half of his body from the sucking morass he succeeded only to feel his legs sink deeper sitting upright he shouted to the girl shaarilla quicklya rope there is no rope elric she was ripping off her top garment frantically tearing it into strips still elric sank his feet finding no purchase beneath them shaarilla hastily knotted the strips of cloth she flung the makeshift rope inexpertly towards the sink ing albino it fell short fumbling in her haste she threw it again this time his groping left hand found it the girl began to haul on the fabric elric felt himself rise a little and then stop its no good elrici havent the strength cursing her elric shouted the horsetie it to the horse she ran towards one of the horses and looped the cloth around the pommel of the saddle then she tugged at the beasts reins and began to walk it away swiftly elric was dragged from the sucking bog and still gripping stormbringer was pulled to the inadequate safety of the strip of turf gasping he tried to stand but found his legs in credibly weak beneath him he rose staggered and fell shaarilla knelt down beside him are you hurt elric smiled in spite of his weakness i dont think so it was dreadful i couldnt see properly what was happening you seemed to disappear and thenthen you screamed thatthat name she was trembling her face pale and taut what name elric was genuinely puzzled what name did i scream she shook her head it doesnt matterbut what ever it wasit saved you you reappeared soon after wards and fell into the marsh stormbringers power was still flowing into the al bino he already felt stronger with an effort he got up and stumbled unsteadily towards his horse im sure that the mist giant does not usually haunt this marshit was sent here by whator whomi dont know but we must get to firmer ground while we can shaarilla said which wayback or forward elric frowned why forward of course why do you ask she swallowed and shook her head lets hurry then she said they mounted their horses and rode with little caution until the marsh and its cloak of mist was be hind them now the journey took on a new urgency as elric realised that some force was attempting to put obsta cles in their way they rested little and savagely rode their powerful horses to a virtual standstill on the fifth day they were riding through barren rocky country and a light rain was falling the hard ground was slippery so that they were forced to ride more slowly huddled over the sodden necks of their horses muffled it cloaks which only inadequately kept out the drizzling rain they had ridden in silence for some time before they heard a ghastly cackling baying ahead of them and the rattle of hooves elric motioned towards a large rock looming to their right shelter there he said something comes towards uspossibly more enemies with luck theyll pass us shaarilla mutely obeyed him and to gether they waited as the hideous baying grew nearer one riderseveral other beasts elric said listen ing intently the beasts either follow or pursue the rider then they were in sightracing through the rain a man frantically spurring an equally frightened horseand behind him the distance decreasing a pack of what at first appeared to be dogs but these were not dogsthey were halfdog and halfbird with the lean shaggy bodies and legs of dogs but possessing birdlike talons in place of paws and sav agely curved beaks which snapped where muzzles should have been the hunting dogs of the dharzi gasped shaa rilla i thought that they like their masters were long extinct i also elric said what are they doing in these parts there was never contact between the dharzi and the dwellers of this land brought hereby something shaarilla whispered those devildogs will scent us to be sure elric reached for his runesword then we can lose nothing by aiding their quarry he said urging his mount forward wait here shaarilla by this time the devilpack and the man they pur sued were rushing past the sheltering rock speeding down a narrow defile elric spurred his horse down the slope ho there he shouted to the frantic rider turn and stand my friendim here to aid you his moaning runesword lifted high elric thun dered towards the snapping howling devildogs and his horses hooves struck one with an impact which broke the unnatural beasts spine there were some five or six of the weird dogs left the rider turned his horse and drew a long sabre from a scabbard at his waist he was a small man with a broad ugly mouth he grinned in relief a lucky chance this meeting good master this was all he had time to remark before two of the dogs were leaping at him and he was forced to give his whole attention to defending himself from their slashing talons and snapping beaks the other three dogs concentrated their vicious at tention upon elric one leapt high its beak aimed at elrics throat he felt foul breath on his face and hastily brought stormbringer round in an arc which chopped the dog in two filthy blood spattered elric and his horse and the scent of it seemed to increase the fury of the other dogs attack but the blood made the dancing black runesword sing an almost ec static tune and elric felt it writhe in his grasp and stab at another of the hideous dogs the point elric said coldly the lady shaarillamaster moonglum of of elwher moonglum supplied the mercantile capital of the eastthe finest city in the world elric recognised the name so you are from el wher master moonglum i have heard of the place a new city is it not some few centuries old you have ridden far indeed i have sir without knowledge of the lan guage used in these parts the journey would have been harder but luckily the slave who inspired me with tales of his homeland taught me the speech thoroughly but why do you travel these partshave you not heard the legends shaarilla spoke incredulously those very legends were what brought me henceand id begun to discount them until those unpleasant pups set upon me for what reason they decided to give chase i will not know for i gave them no cause to take a dislike to me this is indeed a barbarous land elric was uncomfortable light talk of the kind which moonglum seemed to enjoy was contrary to his own brooding nature but in spite of this he found that he was liking the man more and more it was moonglum who suggested that they travel together for a while shaarilla objected giving elric a warning glance but he ignored it very well then friend moonglum since three are stronger than two wed appreciate your company we ride towards the mountains elric himself was feeling in a more cheerful mood and what do you seek there moonglum in quired a secret elric said and his newfound compan ion was discreet enough to drop the question three so they rode while the rainfall increased and splashed and sang among the rocks with the sky like dull steel above them and the wind crooning a dirge about their ears three small figures riding swiftly towards the black mountain barrier which rose over the world like a brooding god and perhaps it was a god that laughed sometimes as they neared the foothills of the range or perhaps it was the wind whistling through the dark mystery of canyons and precipices and the tumble of basalt and granite which climbed towards lonely peaks thunder clouds formed around those peaks and lightning smashed downwards like a monster finger searching the earth for grubs thunder rattled over the range and shaarilla spoke her thoughts at last to elric spoke them as the mountains came in sight elriclet us go back i beg you forget the bookthere are too many forces working against us take heed of the signs elric or we are doomed but elric was grimly silent for he had long been aware that the girl was losing her enthusiasm for the quest she had started elricplease we will never reach the book el ric turn back she rode beside him pulling at his garments until impatiently he shrugged himself clear of her grasp and said i am intrigued too much to stop now either con tinue to lead the wayor tell me what you know and stay here you desired to sample the books wisdom oncebut now a few minor pitfalls on our journey have frightened you what was it you needed to learn shaarilla she did not answer him but said instead and what was it you desired elric peace you told me well i warn you youll find no peace in those grim mountainsif we reach them at all you have not been frank with me shaarilla elric said coldly still looking ahead of him at the black peaks you know something of the forces seeking to stop us she shrugged it matters noti know little my fa ther spoke a few vague warnings before he died that is all what did he say he said that he who guards the book would use all his power to stop mankind from using its wis dom what else nothing else but it is enough now that i see that my fathers warning was truly spoken it was this guardian who killed him elricor one of the guardians minions i do not wish to suffer that fate in spite of what the book might do for me i had thought you powerful enough to aid mebut now i doubt it i have protected you so far elrie said simply now tell me what you seek from the book i am too ashamed elric did not press the question but eventually she spoke softly almost whispering i sought my wings she said your wingsyu mean the book might give you a spell so that you could grow wings elric smiled ironically and that is why you seek the vessel of the worlds mightiest wisdom if you were thought deformed in your own landit would seem important enough to you she shouted defiantly elric turned his face towards her his crimson irised eyes burning with a strange emotion he put a hand to his dead white skin and a crooked smile twisted his lips i too have felt as you do lie said quietly that was all he said and shaarilla dropped behind him again shamed they rode on in silence until moonglum who had been riding discreetly ahead cocked his overlarge skull on one side and suddenly drew rein elric joined him what is it moonglum i hear horses coming this way the little man said and voices which are disturbingly familiar more of those devildogs elricand this time accompanied by riders elric too heard the sounds now and shouted a warning to shaarilla perhaps you were right he called more trouble comes towards us what now moonglum said frowning ride for the mountains elric replied and we may yet outdistance them they spurred their steeds into a fast gallop and sped towards the hills but their flight was hopeless soon a black pack was visible on the horizon and the sharp birdlike baying of the devildogsdrew nearer elric stared backward at their pursuers night was beginning to fall and visibility was decreasing with every passing moment but he had a vague impression of the riders who raced behind the pack they were swathed in dark cloaks and carried long spears their faces were invisible lost in the shadow of the hoods which cov ered their heads now elric and his companions were forcing their horses up a steep incline seeking the shelter of the rocks which lay above well halt here elric ordered and try to hold them off in the open they could easily surround us moonglum nodded affirmatively agreeing with the good sense contained in elrics words they pulled their sweating steeds to a standstill and prepared to join battle with the howling pack and their darkcloaked masters soon the first of the devildogs were rushing up the incline their beakjaws slavering and their talons rattling on stone standing between two rocks block ing the way between with their bodies elric and moonglum met the first attack and quickly dis patched three of the animals several more took the place of the dead and the first of the riders was visible behind them as night crept closer arioch swore elric suddenly recognising the riders these are the lords of dharzi dead these ten centuries were fighting dead men moonglum and the tootangible ghosts of their dogs unless i can think of a sorcerous means to defeat them were doomed the zombiemen appeared to have no intention of taking part in the attack for the moment they waited their dead eyes eerily luminous as the devil dogs attempted to break through the swinging net work of steel with which elric and his companion defended themselves elric was racking his brains trying to dredge a spoken spell from his memory which would dismiss these living dead then it came to him and hoping that the forces he had to invoke would decide to aid him he began to chant let the laws which govern all things not so lightly be dismissed let the ones who flaunt the earth kings with a fresher death be kissed nothing happened ive failed elric muttered hopelessly as he met the attack of a mapping devil dog and spitted the thing on his sword but thenthe ground rocked and seemed to seethe beneath the feet of the horses upon whose backs the dead men sat the tremor lasted a few seconds and then subsided the spell was not powerful enough elric sighed the earth trembled again and small craters formed in the ground of the hillside upon which the dead lords of dharzi impassively waited stones crumbled and the horses stamped nervously then the earth rumbled back yelled elric warningly backor well go with them they retreatedbacking towards shaa rilla and their waiting horses as the ground gagged beneath their feet the dharzi mounts were rearing and snorting and the remaining dogs turned ner vously to regard their masters with puzzled uncer tain eyes a low moan was coming from the lips of the living dead suddenly a whole area of the sur rounding hillside split into cracks and yawning crannies appeared in the surface elric and his com panies swung themselves on to their horse as with a frightful multivoiced scream the dead lords were swallowed by the earth returning to the depths from which they had been summoned a deep unholy chuckle arose from the shattered pit it was the mocking laughter of the earth kings taking their rightful prey back into their keeping whining the devildogs slunk towards the edge of the pit sniffing around it then with one accord the black pack hurled itself down into the chasm following its masters to whatever cold doom awaited them moonglum shuddered you are on familiar terms with the strangest people friend elric he said shak ily and turned his horse towards the mountains again they reached the black mountains on the follow ing day and nervously shaarilla led them along the rocky route she had memorised she no longer pleaded with elric to returnshe was resigned to whatever fate awaited them elrics obsession was burning within him and he was filled with impa tiencecertain that he would find at last the ulti mate truth of existence in the dead gods book moonglum was cheerfully skeptical while shaarilla was consumed with foreboding rain still fell and the storm growled and crackled above them and as the driving rainfall increased with fresh insistence they came at last to the black gaping mouth of a huge cave i can lead you no further shaarilla said wearily the book lies somewhere beyond the entrance to this cave elric and moonglum looked uncertainly at one an other neither of them sure what move to make next to have reached their goal seemed somehow anticli macticfor nothing blocked the cave entranceand nothing appeared to guard it it is inconceivable said elric that the dangers which beset us were not engineered by something yet here we areand no one seeks to stop us enter ing are you sure that this is the right cave shaarilla the girl pointed upwards to the rock above the entrance engraved in it was a curious symbol which elric instantly recognised the sigh of chaos elric exclaimed perhaps i should have guessed what does it mean elric moonglum asked that is the symbol of everlasting disruption and anarchy elric told him we are standing in terri tory presided over by the lords of entropy or one of their minions so that is who our enemy is this can only mean one thingthe book is of extreme impor tance to the order of things on this planepossibly all the myriad planes of the universe it was why arioch was reluctant to aid mehe too is a lord of chaos moonglum stared at him in puzzlement what do you mean elric know you not that two forces govern the world fighting an eternal battle elric replied law and chaos the upholders of chaos state that in such a world as they rule all things are possible opponents of chaosthose who ally themselves with the forces of lawsay that without law nothing material is possible some stand apart believing that a balance be tween the two is the proper state of things but we cannot we have become embroiled in a dispute be tween the two forces the book is valuable to either faction obviously and i could guess that the min ions of entropy are worried what power we might release if we obtain this book law and chaos rarely interfere directly in mens livesthat is why we have not been fully aware of their presence now perhaps i will discover at last the answer to the one question which concerns medoes an ultimate force rule over the opposing factions of law and chaos elric stepped through the cave entrance peering into the gloom while the others hesitantly followed him the cave stretches back a long way all we can do is press on until we find its far wall elric said lets hope that its far wall lies not downwards moonglum said ironically as he motioned elric to lead on they stumbled forward as the cave grew darker and darker their voices were magnified and hollow to their own ears as the floor of the cave slanted sharply down this is no cave elric whispered its a tunnel but i cannot guess where it leads for several hours they pressed onwards in pitch darkness dinging to one another as they reeled for ward uncertain of their footing and still aware that they were moving down a gradual incline they lost all sense of time and elric began to feel as if he were living through a dream events seemed to have be come so unpredictable and beyond his control that he could no longer cope with thinking about them in ordinary terms the tunnel was long and dark and wide and cold it offered no comfort and the floor eventually became the only thing which had any reality it was firmly beneath his feet he began to feel that possibly he was not movingthat the floor after all was moving and he was remaining station ary his companions clung to him but he was not aware of them he was lost and his brain was numb sometimes he swayed and felt that he was on the edge of a precipice sometimes he fell and his groan ing body met hard stone disproving the proximity of the gulf down which he halfexpected to fall all the while he made his legs perform walking motions even though he was not at all sure whether he was actually moving forward and time meant nothingbecame a meaningless concept with relation to nothing until at last he was aware of a faint blue glow ahead of him and he knew that he had been moving forward he began to run down the incline but found that he was going too fast and had to check his speed there was a scent of alien strangeness in the cool air of the cave tunnel and fear was a fluid force which surged over him something separate from himself the others obviously felt it too for though they said nothing elric could sense it slowly they moved downward drawn like automatons towards the pale blue glow below them and then they were out of the tunnel staring awestruck at the unearthly vision which confronted them above them the very air seemed of the strange blue colour which had originally attracted them they were standing on a jutting slab of rock and although it was still somehow dark the eerie blue glow illuminated a stretch of glinting silver beach beneath them and the beach was lapped by a surging dark sea which moved restlessly like a liquid giant in disturbed slumber scattered along the sil ver beach were the dim shapes of wrecksthe bones of peculiarly designed boats each of a different pat tern from the rest the sea surged away into darkness and there was no horizononly blackness behind them they could see a sheer cliff which was also lost in darkness beyond a certain point and it was coldbitterly cold with an unbelievable sharp ness for though the sea threshed beneath them there was no dampness in the airno smell of salt it was a bleak and awesome sight and apart from the sea they were the only things that movedthe only things to make sound for the sea was horribly silent in its restless movement what now elric whispered moonglum shiver ing elric shook his head and they continued to stand there for a long time until the albinohis white face and hands ghastly in the alien light said since it is impracticable to returnwe shall venture over the sea his voice was hollow and he spoke as one who was unaware of his words steps cut into the living rock led down towards the beach and now elric began to descend them the others allowed him to lead them staring around them their eyes lit by a terrible fascination four their feet profaned the silence as they reached the silver beach of crystalline stones and crunched across it elrics crimson eyes fixed upon one of the objects littering the beach and he smiled he shook his head savagely from side to side as if to clear it trembling he pointed to one of the boats and the pair saw that it was intact unlike the others it was yellow and redvulgarly gay in this environment and nearing it they observed that it was made of wood yet unlike any wood they had seen moon glum ran his stubby fingers along its length hard as iron he breathed no wonder it has not rotted as the others have he peered inside and shuddered well the owner wont argue if we take it he said wryly elric and shaarilla understood him when they saw the unnaturally twisted skeleton which lay at the bottom of the boat elric reached inside and pulled the thing out hurling it on to the stones it rattled and rolled over the gleaming shingle disintegrating as it did so scattering bones over a wide area the skull came to rest by the edge of the beach seeming to stare sightlessly out over the disturbing ocean as elric and moonglum strove to push and pull the boat down the beach towards the sea shaarilla moved ahead of them and squatted down putting her hand into the wetness she stood up sharply shaking the stuff from her hand this is not water as i know it she said they heard her but said nothing well need a sail elric murmured the cold breeze was moving out over the ocean a cloak should serve he stripped off his cloak and knotted it to the mast of the vessel two of us will have to hold this at either edge he said that way well have some slight control over the direction the boat takes its makeshiftbut the best we can manage they shoved off taking care not to get their feet in the sea the wind caught the sail and pushed the boat out over the ocean moving at a faster pace than elric had at first reckoned the boat began to hurtle for ward as if possessed of its own volition and elrics and moonglums muscles ached as they clung to the bottom ends of the sail soon the silver beach was out of sight and they could seelittlethe pale blue light above them scarcely penetrating the blackness it was then that they heard the dry flap of wings over their heads and looked up silently descending were three massive apelike creatures borne on great leathery wings shaarilla recognised them and gasped clakars moonglum shrugged as he hurriedly drew his sworda name onlywhat are they but he re ceived no answer for the leading winged ape de seemed with a rush mouthing and gibbering showing long fangs in a slavering snout moonglum dropped his portion of the sail and slashed at the beast but it veered away its huge wings beating and sailed upwards again elric unsheathed stormbringerand was astound ed the blade remained silent its familiar howl of glee muted the blade shuddered in his hand and instead of the rush of power which usually flowed up his arm he felt only a slight tingling he was panic stricken for a momentwithout the sword he would soon lose all vitality grimly fighting down his fear he used the sword to protect himself from the rush ing attack of one of the winged apes the ape gripped the blade bowling elric over but it yelled in pain as the blade cut through one knotted hand severing fingers which lay twitching and bloody on the narrow deck elric gripped the side of the boat and hauled himself upright once more shrilling its agony the winged ape attacked again but this time with more caution elric sum moned all his strength and swung the heavy sword in a twohanded grip ripping off one of the leathery wings so that the mutilated beast flopped about the deck judging the place where its heart should be elric drove the blade in under the breastbone the apes movements subsided moonglum was lashing wildly at two of the winged apes which were attacking him from both sides he wasdown on one knee vainly hacking at random he had opened up the whole side of a beasts head but though in pain it still came at him elric hurled stormbringer through the darkness and it struck the wounded beast in the throat point first the ape clutched with clawing fingers at the steel and fell overboard its corpse floated on the liquid but slowly began to sink elric grabbed with frantic fingers at the hilt of his sword reaching far over the side of the boat incredibly the blade was sinking with the beast knowing stormbringers properties as he did elric was amazedonce when he had hurled the runesword into the ocean it had refused to sink now it was being dragged beneath the surface as any ordinary blade would bedraggled he gripped the hilt and hauled the sword out of the winged apes carcass his strength was seeping swiftly from him it was incredible what alien laws governed this cavern world he could not guessand all he was concerned with was regaining his waning strength without the runeswords power this was impossible moonglums curved blade had disemboweled the remaining beast and the little man was busily tossing the dead thing over the side he turned grinning triumphantly to elric a good fight he said elric shook his head we must cross this sea speedily he replied else were lostfinished my power is gone how why i know notunless the forces of entropy rule more strongly here make hastethere is no time for speculation moonglums eyes were disturbed he could do nothing but act as elric said elric was trembling in his weakness holding the billowing sail with draining strength shaarilla moved to help him her thin hands close to his her deepset eyes bright with sympathy what were those things moonglum gasped his teeth naked and white beneath his backdrawn lips his breath coming short clakars shaarilla replied they are the primeval ancestors of my people older in origin than recorded time my people are thought the oldest inhabitants of this planet whoever seeks to stop us in this quest of yours had best find someoriginal means moonglum grinned the old methods dont work but the other two did not smile for elric was halffainting and the woman was concerned only with his plight moonglum shrugged staring ahead when he spokeagain sometime later his voice was excited were nearing land land it was and they were traveling fast towards it too fast elric heaved himself uptight and spoke heavily and with difficulty drop the sail moon glum obeyed him the boat sped on struck another stretch of silver beach and ground up it the prow ploughing a dark scar through the glinting shingle it stopped suddenly tilting violently to one side so that the three were tumbled against the boats rail shaarilla and moonglum pulled themselves up right and dragged the limp and nerveless albino on to the beach carrying him between them they struggled up the beach until the crystalline shingle gave way to thick fluffy moss padding their foot falls they laid the albino down and stared at him worriedly uncertain of their next actions elric strained to rise but was unable to do so give me time he gasped i wont diebut already my eyesight is fading i can only hope that the blades power will return on dry land with a mighty effort he pulled stormbringer from its scabbard and he smiled in relief as the evil runesword moaned faintly and then slowly its song increased in power as black flame flickered along its length already the power was flowing into elrics body giving him renewed vitality but even as strength returned elrics crimson eyes flared with terrible misery without this black blade he groaned i am noth ing as you see but what is it making of me am i to be bound to it for ever the others did not answer him and they were both moved by an emotion they could not definean emotion blended of fear hate and pitylinked with something else eventually elric rose trembling and silently led them up the mossy hillside towards a more natural light which filtered from above they could see that it came from a wide chimney leading apparently to the upper air by means of the light they could soon make out a dark irregular shape which towered in the shadow of the gap as they neared the shape they saw that it was a castle of black stonea sprawling pile covered with dark green crawling lichen which curled over its an cient bulk with an almost sentient protectiveness towers appeared to spring at random from it and it covered a vast area there seemed to be no windows in any part of it and the only orifice was a rearing doorway blocked by thick bars of a metal which glowed with dull redness but without heat above this gate in flaring amber was the sign of the lords of entropy representing eight arrows radiating from a central hub in all directions it appeared to hang in the air without touching the black lichencovered stone i think our quest ends here elric said grimly here or nowhere before i go further elric id like to know what it is you seek moonglum murmured i think ive earned the right a book elric said carelessly the dead gods book it lies within those castle wallsof that im certain we have reached the end of our journey moonglum shrugged i might not have asked he smiled for all your words mean to me i hope that i will be allowed some small share of whatever treasure it represents elric ginned in spite of the coldness which gripped his bowels but he did not answer moon glum we need to enter the castle first he said instead as if the gates had heard him the metal bars flared to a pale green and then their glow faded back to red and finally dulled into nonexistence the en trance was unbarred and their way apparently clear i like not that growled moonglum too easy a trap awaits usare we to spring it at the pleasure of whoever dwells within the castle confines what else can we do elric spoke quietly go backor forward avoid the castledo not tempt he who guards the book shaarilla was grip ping the albinos right arm her whole face moving with fear her eyes pleading forget the book elric now elric laughed humourlessly nowafter this journey no shaarilla not when the truth is so close better to die than never to have tried to secure the wisdom in the book when it lies so near shaarillas clutching fingers relaxed their grip and her shoulders slumped in hopelessness we cannot do battle with the minions of entropy perhaps we will not have to elric did not believe his own words but his mouth was twisted with some dark emotion intense and terrible moonglum glanced at shaarilla shaarilla is right he said with conviction youll find nothing but bitterness possibly death inside those castle walls let us instead climb yonder steps and attempt to reach the surface he pointed to some twisting steps which led towards the yawning rent in the cavern roof elric shook his head no you go if you like moonglum grimaced in perplexity youre a stub born one friend elric well if its all or nothing then im with you but personally i have always pre ferred compromise elric began to walk slowly forward towards the dark entrance of the bleak and towering castle in a wide shadowy courtyard a tall figure wreathed in scarlet fire stood awaiting them elric marched on passing the gateway moonglum and shaarilla nervously followed gusty laughter roared from the mouth of the giant and the scarlet fire fluttered about him he was naked and unarmed but the power which flowed from him almost forced the three back his skin was scaly and of smoky purple colouring his massive body was alive with rippling muscle as he rested lightly on the balls of his feet his skull was long slanting sharply backwards at the forehead and his eyes were like slivers of blue steel showing no pupil his whole body shook with mighty malicious joy greetings to you lord elric of melnibonei con gratulate you for your remarkable tenacity who are you elric growled his hand on his sword my name is orunlu the keeper and this is a stronghold of the lords of entropy the giant smiled cynically you need not finger your puny blade so nervously or you should know that can not harm you now i gained power to remain in your realm only by making that vow elrics voice betrayed his mounting excitement you cannot stop us i do not dare tosince my oblique efforts have failed but your foolish endeavours perplex me somewhat ill admit the book is of importance to usbut what can it mean to you i have guarded it for three hundred centuries and have never been curious enough to seek to discover why my masters place so much importance upon itwhy they both ered to rescue it on its sunward course and incarcer ate it on this boring ball of earth populated by the capering brieflylived clowns called men i seek in it the truth elric said guardedly there is no truth but that of eternal struggle the scarletflamed giant said with conviction what rules above the forces of law and chaos elric asked what controls your destinies as it con trols mine the giant frowned that question i cannot answer i do not know there is only the balance then perhaps the book will tell us who holds it elric said purposefully let me passtell me where it lies the giant moved back smiling ironically it lies in a small chamber in the central tower i have sworn never to venture there otherwise i might even lead the way go if you likemy duty is over elric moonglum and shaarilla stepped towards the entrance of the castle but before they entered the giant spoke warningly from behind them i have been told that the knowledge contained in the book could swing the balance on the side of the forces of law this disturbs mebut it appears there is another possibility which disturbs me even more what is that elric said it could create such a tremendous impact on the multiverse that complete entropy would result my masters do not desire that for it could mean the destruction of all matter in the end we exist only to fightnot to win but to preserve the eternal struggle i care not elric told him i have little to lose orunlu the keeper then go the giant strode across the courtyard into blackness inside the tower light of a pale quality illumi nated winding steps leading upwards elric began to climb them in silence moved by his own doomfilled purpose hesitantly moonglum and shaarilla fob lowed in his path their faces set in hopeless accept ante on and upward the steps mounted twisting tortu ously towards their goal until at last they came to the chamber full of blinding light manycoloured and scintillating which did not penetrate outwards at allbut remained confined to the room which housed it blinking shielding his red eyes with his arm elric pressed forward and through slitted pupils saw the source of the light lying on a small stone dais in the centre of the room equally troubled by the bright light shaarilla and moonglum followed him into the room and stood in awe at what they saw it was a huge bookthe dead gods book its cov ers encrusted with alien gems from which the light sprang it gleamed it throbbed with light and bril liant colour at last elric breathed at lastthe truth he stumbled forward like a man made stupid with drink his pale hands reaching for the thing he had sought with such savage bitterness his hands touched the pulsating cover of the book and trem bling turned it back now i shall learn he said halfgloatingly with a crash the cover fell to the floor sending the brightgems skipping and dancing over the pav ing stones beneath elrics twitching hands lay nothing but a pile of yellowish dust no his scream was anguished unbelieving no tears flowed down his contorted face as he ran his hands through the fine dust with a groan which racked his whole being he fell forward his face hitting the disintegrated parchment time had destroyed the bookuntouched possibly forgotten for three hundred centuries even the wise and pow erful gods who had created it had perishedand now its knowledge followed them into oblivion they stood on the slopes of the high mountain staring down into the green valleys below them the sun shone and the sky was clear and blue behind them lay the gaping hole which led into the strong hold of the lords of entropy elric looked with sad eyes across the world and his head was lowered beneath a weight of weariness and dark despair he had not spoken since his compan ions had dragged him sobbing from the chamber of the book now he raised his pale face and spoke in a voice tinged with selfmockery sharp with bitter nessa lonely voice the calling of hungry seabirds circling cold skies above bleak shores now he said i will live my life without ever knowing why i live itwhether it has purpose or not perhaps the book could have told me but would i have believed it even then i am the eter nal sceptic never sure that my actions are my own never certain thatan ultimate entity is not guiding me i envy those who know all i can do now is to con tinue my quest and hope without hope that before my span is ended the truth will be presented to me shaarilla took his limp hands in hers and her eyes were wet elriclet me comfort you the albino sneered bitterly would that wed never met shaarilla of the dancing mist for a while you gave me hopei had thought to be at last at peace with myself but because of you i am left more hopeless than before there is no salvation in this worldonly malevolent doom goodbye he took his hands away from her grasp and set off down the mountainside moonglum darted a glance at shaarilla and then at elric he took something from his purse and put it in the girls hand good luck he said and then he was running af ter elric until he caught him up still striding elric turned at moonglums ap proach and despite his brooding misery said what is it friend moonglum why do you follow me ive followed you thus far master elric and i see no reason to stop grinned the little man besides unlike yourself im a materialist well need to eat you know elric frowned feeling a warmth growing within him what do you mean moonglum moonglum chuckled i take advantage of situa tions of any kind where i may he answered he reached into his purse and displayed something on his outstretched hand which shone with a dazzling brilliancy it was one of the jewels from the cover of the book there are more in my purse he said and each one worth a fortune he took elrics arm come elricwhat new lands shall we visit so that we may change these baubles into wine and pleasant company behind them standing stock still on the hillside shaarilla stared miserably after them until they were no longer visible the jewel moonglum had given her dropped from her fingers and fell bouncing and bright until it was lost amongst the heather then she turnedand the dark mouth of the cavern yawned before her book three the singing citadel in which elric has his first dealings with pan tang yishana of jharkor the sorcerer the leb kaarna and learns something more of the higher worlds one the turquoise sea was peaceful in the golden light of early evening and the two men at the rail of the ship stood in silence looking north to the misty hori zon one was tall and slim wrapped in a heavy black cloak its cowl flung back to reveal his long milk white hair the other was short and redheaded she was a fine woman and she loved you said the short man at length why did you leave her so abruptly she was a fine woman the tall one replied but she would have loved me to her cost let her seek her own land and stay there i have already slain one woman whom i loved moonglum i would not slay another moonglum shrugged i sometimes wonder elric if this grim destiny of yours is the figment of your own guiltridden mood perhaps elric replied carelessly but i do not care to test the theory lets speak no more of this the sea foamed and rushed by as the oars disrupt ed the surface driving the ship swiftly towards the port of dhakos capital of jharkor one of the most powerful of the young kingdoms less than two years previously jharkors king darmit had died in the illfated raid on imrryr and elric had heard that the men of jharkor blamed him for the young kings death though this was not the case he cared little whether they blamed him or not for he was still dis dainful of the greater part of mankind another hour will see nightfall and its unlikely well sail at night moonglum said im to bed i think elric was about to reply when he was interrupted by a highpitched shout from the crows nest sail on larboard stern the lookout must have been half asleep for the ship bearing down on them could easily be made out from the deck elric stepped aside as the captain a darkfaced tarkeshite came running along the deck whats the ship captain called moonglum a pan tang triremea warship theyre on ram ming course the captain ran on yelling orders to the helm to turn the ship aside elric and moonglum crossed the deck to see the trireme better she was a blacksailed ship painted black and heavily gilded with three rowers to an oar as against their two she was big and yet elegant with a high curving stern and a low prow now they could see the waters broken by her big brass sheathed ram she had two lateenrigged sails and the wind was in her favour the rowers were in a panic as they sweated to turn the ship according to the helmsmans orders oars rose and fell in confusion and moonglum turned to elric with a halfsmile theyll never do it best ready your blade friend pan tang was an isle of sorcerers fully human who sought to emulate the old power of melnibone their fleets were among the best in the young king doms and raided with little discrimination the theocrat of pan tang chief of the priestaristoc racy was jagreen lern who was reputed to have a pact with the powers of chaos and a plan to rule the world elric regarded the men of pan tang as upstarts who could never hope to mirror the glory of his an cestors but even he had to admit that this ship was impressive and would easily win a fight with the tarkeshite galley soon the great trireme was bearing down on them and captain and helmsman fell silent as they realised they could not evade the ram with a harsh sound of crushed timbers the ram connected with the stern holing the galley beneath the waterline elric stood immobile watching as the triremes grappling irons hurtled towards their galleys deck somewhat halfheartedly knowing they were no match for the welltrained and wellarmoured pan tang crew the tarkeshites ran towards the stern preparing to resist the boarders moonglum cried urgently elricwe must help reluctantly elric nodded he was loathe to draw the runesword from its scabbard at his side of late its power seemed to have increased now the scarletarmoured warriors were swinging towards where the tarkeshites waited the first wave armed with broadswords and battleaxes hit the sailors driving them back now elrics hand fell to the hilt of stormbringer as he gripped it and drew it the blade gave an odd disturbing moan as if of anticipation and a weird black radiance flickered along its length now it throbbed in elrics hand like something alive as the albino ran forward to aid the tarkeshite sailors already half the defenders had been hewed down and as the rest retreated elric with moonglum at his heels moved forward the scarletarmoured war riors expressions changed from grim triumph to startlement as elrics great blackblade shrieked up and down and clove through a mans armour from shoulder to lower ribs evidently they recognized him and the sword for both were legendary though moonglum was a skilled swordsman they all but ignored him as they realised that they must concentrate all their strength on bringing elric down if they were to survive the old wild killinglust of his ancestors now dominated elric as the blade reaped souls he and the sword became one and it was the sword not el ric that was in control men fell on all sides scream ing more in horror than in pain as they realised what the sword had drawn from them four came at him with axes whistling he sliced off ones head cut a deep gash in anothers midriff lopped off an arm and drove the blade point first into the heart of the last now the tarkeshites were cheering following after elric and moonglum as they cleared the sink hag galleys decks of attackers howling like a wolf elric grabbed a ropepart of the black and gold triremes riggingand swung to wards the enemys decks follow him moonglum yelled this is our only chancethis ships doomed the trireme had raised decks fore and aft on the foredeck stood the captain splendid in scarlet and blue his face aghast at this turn of events he had expected to get his prize effortlessly now it seemed he was to be the prize stormbringer sang a wailing song as elric pressed towards the foredeck a song that was at once tri umphant and ecstatic the remaining warriors no longer rushed at him and concentrated on moon glum who was leading the tarkeshite crew leaving elrics path to the captain clear the captain a member of the theocracy would be harder to vanquish than his men as elric moved towards him he noted that the mans armour had a peculiar glow to itit had been sorcerously treated the captain was typical of his kindstocky heav ilybearded with malicious black eyes over a strong hooked nose his lips were thick and red and he was smiling a little as with axe in one hand and sword in the other he prepared to meet elric who was running up the steps elric gripped stormbringer in both hands and lunged for the captains stomach but the man stepped sideways and parried with his sword swing ing the axe lefthanded at elrics unprotected head the albino had to sway to one side staggered and fell to the deck rolling as the broadsword thudded into the deck just missing his shoulder stormbringer seemed torise of its own accord to block a further axe blow and then chopped upwards to sheer off the head near the handle the captain cursed and discarded the handle gripped his broadsword in both hands and raised it again stormbringer acted a fraction sooner than erics own reactions he drove the blade up towards the mans heart the magic treated armour stopped it for a second but then storm bringer shrilled a chilling wailing song shuddered as if summoning more strength slipped on the armour again and then the magic armour split like a nutshell leaving elrics opponent barechested his arms still raised for the strike his eyes widened he backed away his sword forgotten his gaze fixed on the evil runeblade as it struck him under the breast bone and drove in he grimaced whimpered and dropped his sword clutching instead at the blade which was sucking out his soul by chardrosnotnotaahhh he died knowing that even his soul was not safe from the hellblade borne by the wolffaced albino elric wrenched stormbringer from the corpse feeling his own vitality increase as the sword passed on its stolen energy refusing to consider the knowledge that he needed the sword the more he used it on the deck of the trireme only the galleyslaves were left alive but the deck was tilting badly for the triremes ram and grapples still tied it to the sinking tarkeshite ship cut the grappling ropes and back waterquickly elric yelled sailors realising what was happening leapt forward to do as he ordered the slaves backed water and the ram came out with a groan of split wood the grapples were cut and the doomed galley set adrift elric counted the survivors less than half the crew were alive and their captainhad died in the first onslaught he addressed the slaves if youd have your freedom row well towards dhakos he called the sun was setting but now that he was in command he decided to sail through the night by the stars moonglum shouted incredulously why offer them their freedom we could sell them in dhakos and thus be paid for todays exertion elric shrugged i offer them freedom because i choose to moonglum the redhead sighed and turned to supervise the throwing of the dead and wounded overboard he would never understand the albino he decided it was probably for the best and that was how elric came to enter dhakos in some style when he had originally intended to slip into the city without being recognised leaving moonglum to negotiate the sale of the trireme and divide the money between the crew and himself elric drew his hood over his head and pushed through the crowd which had collected mak ing for an inn he knew of by the west gate of the city two later that night when moonglum had gone to bed elric sat in the tavern room drinking even the most enthusiastic of the nights roisterers had left when they had noticed with whom they shared the room and now elric sat alone the only light coming from a guttering reed torch over the outside door now the door opened and a richlydressed youth stood there staring in i seek the white wolf he said his head at a questioning angle he could not see elric clearly im sometimes called that name in these parts el tic said calmly do you seek elric of melnibone aye i have a message the youth came in keep ing his cloak wrapped about him for the room was cold though elric did not notice it i am count yolan deputycommander of the city guard the youth said arrogantly coming up to the table at which elric sat and studying the albino rudely you are brave to come here so openly do you think the folk of jharkor have such short memories they can forget that you led their king into a trap scarce two years since elric sipped his wine then said from behind the rim of his cup this is rhetoric count yolan what is your message yolans assured manner left him he made a rather weak gesture rhetoric to you perhapsbut i for one feel strongly on the matter would not king darmit be here today if you had not fled from the battle that broke the power of the sea lords and your own folk did you not use your sorcery to aid you in your flight instead of using it to aid the men who thought they were your comrades elric sighed i know your purpose here was not to bait me in this manner darmit died on board his flagship during the first attack on imrryrs seamaze not in the subsequent battle you sneer at my questions and then proffer lame lies to cover your own cowardly deed yolan said bitterly if i had my way youd be fed to your hell blade thereive heard what happened earlier elric rose slowly your taunts tire me when you feel ready to deliver your message give it to the innkeeper he walked around the table moving towards the stairs but stopped as yolan turned and plucked at his sleeve elrics corpsewhite face stared down at the young noble his crimson eyes flickered with a dangerous emotion i am not used to such familiarity young man yolans hand fell away forgive me i was selfin dulgent and should not have let my emotions over ride diplomacy i came on a matter of discretiona message from queen yishana she seeks your help im as disinclined to help others as i am to ex plain my actions elric spoke impatiently in the past my help has not always been to the advantage of those whove sought it darmit your queens half brother discovered that yolan said sullenly you echo my own warnings to the queen sir for all that she desires to see you in privatetonight he scowled and looked away i would point out that i could have you arrested should you refuse perhaps elric moved again towards the steps tell yishana that i stay the night here and move on at dawn she may visit me if her request is so ur gent he climbed the stairs leaving a gapemouthed yolan sitting alone in the quiet of the tavern theleb kaarna scowled for all his skill in the black arts he was a fool in love and yishana sprawled on her furrich bed knew it it pleased her to have power over a man who could destroy her with a simple incantation if it were not for his love weakness though theleb kaarna stood high in the hierarchy of pan tang it was clear to her that she was in no danger from the sorcerer indeed her in tuition informed her that this man who loved to dominate others also needed to be dominated she filled this need for himwith relish theleb kaarna continued to scowl at her how can that decadent spellsinger help you where i can not he muttered sitting down on the bed and stroking her bejewelled foot yishana was pot a young woman neither was she pretty yet there was an hypnotic quality about her tall full body her lush black hair and her wholly sensuous face few of the men she had singled out for her pleasure had been able to resist her neither was she sweetnatured just wise nor selfsacrificing the historians would append no noble soubriquet to her name still there was some thing so selfsufficient about her something denying the usual standards by which a person was judged that all who knew her admired her and she was wellloved by those she ruledloved rather as a wil ful child is loved yet loved with firm loyalty now she laughed quietly mockingly at her sorcerer lover youre probably right theleb kaarna but elric is a legendthe most spokenof leastknown man in the world this is my opportunity to discover what others have only speculated onhis true character theleb kaarna made a pettish gesture he stroked his long black beard and got up walking to a table bearing fruit and wine he poured wine for them both if you seek to make me jealous again you are succeeding of course i hold little hope for your ambition elrics ancestors were halfdemons his race is not human and cannot be judged by our yardsticks to us sorcery is learned after years of study and sacrificeto elrics kind sorcery is intui tivenatural you may not live to learn his secrets cymoril his beloved cousin died on his bladeand she was his betrothed your concern is touching she lazily accepted the goblet he handed to her but ill continue with my plan none the less after all you can hardly claim to have had much success in discovering the nature of this citadel there are subtleties i have not properly plumbed as yet then perhaps elrics intuition will provide an swers where you fail she smiled then he got up and looked through the window at the sky where the full moon hung in a clear sky over the spires of dhakos yolan is late ifall went properly he should have brought elric here by now yolan was a mistake you should not have sent such a close friend of darmits for all we know hes challenged elric and killed him again she couldnt resist laughter oh you wish too hardit clouds your reason i sent yolan because i knew he would be rude to the albino and perhaps weaken his usual insouciancearouse his curiosity yolan was a kind of bait to bring elric to us then possibly elric sensed this i am not overly intelligent my lovebut i think my instincts rarely betray me we shall see soon a little later there was a discreet scratch at the door and a handmaiden entered your highness count yolan has returned only count yolan there was a smile on theleb kaarnas face it was to disappear in a short while as yishana left the room garbed for the street you are a fool he snarled as the door slammed he flung down his goblet already he had been un successful in the matter of the citadel and if elric displaced him he could lose everything he began to think very deeply very carefully three though he claimed lack of conscience elrics tor mented eyes belied the claim as he sat at his win dow drinking strong wine and thinking on the past since the sack of imrryr he had quested the world seeking some purpose to his existence some meaning to his life he had failed to find the answer in the dead gods book he had failed to love shaarilla the wingless woman of myyrrhn failed to forget cymoril who still inhabited his nightmares and there were memories of other dreamsof a fate he dare not think upon peace he thought was all he sought yet even peace in death was denied him it was in this mood that he continued to brood until his reverie was bro ken by a soft scratching at the door immediately his expression hardened his crimson eyes took on a guarded look his shoulders lifted so that when he stood up he was all cool arrogance he placed the cup on the table and said lightly enter a woman entered swathed in a dark red cloak unrecognizable in the gloom of the room she closed the door behind her and stood there motionless and unspeaking when at length she spoke her voice was almost hesitant though there was some irony in it too you sit in darkness lord elric i had thought to find you asleep sleep madam is the occupation that bores me most but i will light a torch if you find the darkness unattractive he went to the table and removed the cover from the small bowl of charcoal which lay there he reached for a thin wooden spill and placed one end in the bowl blowing gently soon the char coal glowed and the taper caught and he touched it to a reed torch that hung in a bracket on the wall above the table the torch flared and sent shadows skipping around the small chamber the woman drew back her cowl and the light caught her dark heavy fea tures and the masses of black hair which framed them she contrasted strongly with the slender aes thetic albino who stood a head taller looking at her impassively she was unused to impassive looks and the novelty pleased her you sent for me lord elricand you see i am here she made a mock curtsey queen yishana he acknowledged the curtsey with a slight bow now that she confronted him she sensed his powera power that perhaps attracted even more strongly than her own and yet he gave no hint that he responded to her she reflected that a situation she had expected to be interesting might ironically become frustrating even this amused her elric in turn was intrigued by this woman in spite of himself his jaded emotions hinted that yishana might restore their edge this excited him and perturbed him at once he relaxed a little and shrugged i have heard of you queen yishana in other lands than jharkor sit down if you wish he indicated a bench and seated himself on the edge of the bed you are more courteous than your summons sug gested she smiled as she sat down crossed her legs and folded her arms in front of her does this mean that you will listen to a proposition i have he smiled back it was a rare smile for him a little grim but without the usual bitterness i think so you are an unusual woman queen yishana indeed i would suspect that you had melnibonean blood if i did not know better not all your young kingdom upstarts are quite as unsophisticated as you believe my lord perhaps now that i see you at last face to face i find your dark legend a little hard to credit in partsand yet on the other hand she put her head on one side and regarded him frankly it would seem that the legends speak of a less subtle man than the one i see before me that is the way with legends ah she halfwhispered what a force we could be together you and i speculation of that sort irritates me queen yishana what is your purpose in coming here very well i did not expect you to listen even ill listenbut expect nothing more then listen i think the story will be appreciated even by you elric listened and as yishana had suspected the tale she told began to catch his interest several months ago yishana told elric peasants in the gharavian province of jharkor began to talk of some mysterious riders who were carrying off young men and women from the villages suspecting bandits yishana had sent a detachment of her white leopards jharkors finest fighting men to the province to put down the brigands none of the white leopards had returned a sec ond expedition had found no trace of them but in a valley close to the town of thokora they had come upon a strange citadel descriptions of the citadel were confused suspecting that the white leopards had attacked and been defeated the officer in charge had used discretion left a few men to watch the cita del and report anything they saw and returned at once to dhakos one thing was certainthe citadel had not been in the valley a few months before yishana and theleb kaarna had led a large force to the valley the men left behind had disappeared but as soon as he saw the citadel theleb kaarna had warned yishana not to attack it was a marvellous sight lord elric yishana continued the citadel scintillated with shining rainbow colourscolours that were constantly alter hag changing the whole building looked unreal sometimes it stood out sharply sometimes it seemed misty as if about to vanish theleb kaarna said its nature was sorcerous and we did not doubt him something from the realm of chaos he said and that seemed likely she got up she spread her hands we are not used to large scale manifestations of sorcery in these parts theleb kaarna was familiar enough with sorceryhe comes from the city of screaming statues on pan tang and such things are seen frequentlybut even he was taken aback so you withdrew elric promoted impatiently we were about toin fact theleb kaarna and myself were already riding back at the head of the army when the music came it was sweet beauti ful unearthly painfultheleb kaarna shouted to me to ride as swiftly as i could away from it i dab lied attracted by the music but he slapped the rump of my horse and we rode fast as dragons in flight away from there those nearest us also es capedbut we saw the rest turn and move back towards the citadel drawn by the music nearly two hundred men went backand vanished what did you do then elric asked as yishana crossed the floor and sat downbeside him he moved to give her more room theleb kaarna has been trying to investigate the nature of the citadelits purpose and its controller so far his divinations have told him little more than he guessed that the realm of chaos has sent the cit adel to the realm of earth and is slowly extending its range more and more of our young men and women are being abducted by the minions of chaos and these minions yishana had moved a little closer and this time elric did not move away none who has sought to stop them has succeeded few have lived and what do you seek of me help she looked closely into his face and reached out a hand to touch him you have knowledge of both chaos and lawold knowledge instinctive knowledge if theleb kaarna is right why your very gods are lords of chaos that is exactly true yishanaand because our pa tron gods are of chaos it is not in my interest to fight against any one of them now he moved towards her and he was smiling looking into her eyes suddenly he took her in his am perhaps you will be strong enough he said enigmatically just before their lips met and as for the other matterwe can discuss that later in the deep greenness of a dark mirror theleb kaarna saw something of the scene in elrics room and he glowered impotently he tugged at his beard as the scene faded for the tenth time in a minute none of his mutterings could restore it he sat back in his chair of serpent skulls and planned vengeance that vengeance could take time maturing he de tided for if elric could be useful in the matter of the citadel there was no point in destroying him yet four next afternoon three riders set off for the town of thokora elric and yishana rode close together but the third rider theleb kaarna kept a frowning dis tance if elric was at all embarrassed by this display on the part of the man he had ousted in yishanas af fections he did not show it elric finding yishana more than attractive in spite of himself had agreed at least to inspect the citadel and suggest what it might be and how it might be fought he had exchanged a few words with moon glum before setting off they rode across the beautiful grasslands of jharkor golden beneath a hot sun it was two days ride to thokora and elric intended to enjoy it feeling less than miserable he galloped along with yishana laughing with her in her enjoyment yet buried deeper than it would normally have been there was a deep foreboding in his heart as they neared the mysterious citadel and he noted that theleb kaarna occasionally looked satisfied when he should have looked disgruntled sometimes elric would shout to the sorcerer ho old spellmaker do you feel no joyful release from the cares of the court out here amidst the beauties of nature your face is long theleb kaarnabreathe in the untainted air and laugh with us then the leb kaarna would scowl and mutter and yishana would laugh at him and glance brightly at elric so they came to thokora and found it a smoulder ing pit that stank like a midden of hell elric sniffed this is chaos work you were right enough there theleb kaarna whatever fire de stroyed such a large town it was not natural fire whoever is responsible for this is evidently increas ing his power as you know sorcerer the lords of law and chaos are usually in perfect balance nei ther tampering directly with our earth evidently the balance has tipped a little way to one side as it sometimes does favouring the lords of disorderal lowing them access to our realm normally it is pos sible for an earthly sorcerer to summon aid from chaos or law for a short time but it is rare for either side to establish itself so firmly as our friend in the citadel evidently has what is more disturbingfor you of the young kingdoms at leastis that once such power is gained it is possible to increase it and the lords of chaos could in time conquer the realm of earth by gradual increase of their strength here a terrible possibility muttered the sorcerer gen uinely afraid even though he could sometimes sum mon help from chaos it was in no human beings interest to have chaos ruling over him elric climbed back into his saddle wed best make speed to the valley he said are you sure it is wise after witnessing this theleb kaarna was nervous elric laughed what and you a sorcerer from pan tangthat isle that claims to know as much of sorcery as my ancestors the bright emperors no nobesides im not in a cautious mood today nor am i cried yishana clapping her steeds sides come gentlemento the citadel of chaos by late afternoon they had topped the range of hills surrounding the valley and looked down at the mysterious citadel yishana had described it wellbut not perfectly elrics eyes ached as he looked at it for it seemed to extend beyond the realm of earth into a different plane perhaps several it shimmered and glittered and all earthly colours were there as well as many which elric recognised as belonging to other planes even the basic outline of the citadel was uncertain in contrast the sur rounding valley was a sea of dark ash which some times seemed to eddy to undulate and send up spurting geysers of dust as if the basic elements of nature had been disturbed and warped by the presence of the supernatural citadel well theleb kaarna tried to calm his nervous horse as it backed away from the citadel have you seen the like in the world before elric shook his head not in this world certainly but ive seen it before during my final initiation into the arts of melnibone my father took me with him in astral form to the realm of chaos there to receive the audience of my patron the lord arioch of the seven darks theleb kaarna shuddered you have been to chaos it is ariochs citadel then elric laughed in disdain that no it is a hovel compared to the palaces of the lords of chaos impatiently yishana said then who dwells there as i remember the one who dwelt in the citadel when i passed through the chaos realm in my youthhe was no lord of chaos but a kind of ser vant to the lords yet he frowned not exactly a servant ach you speak in riddles theleb kaarna turned his horse to ride down the hills away from the citadel i know you melniboneans starving youd rather have a paradox than food elric and yishana followed him some distance then elric stopped elric pointed behind him the one who dwells yonder is a paradoxical sort of fellow hes a kind of jester to the court of chaos the lords of chaos respect himperhaps fear him slightlyeven though he entertains them he delights them with cosmic riddles with farcical satires purporting to explain the nature of the cos mic hand that holds both chaos and law in bal ance he juggles enigmas like baubles laughs at what chaos holds dear takes seriously that which they mock at he paused and shrugged so i have heard at least why should he be here why should he be anywhere i could guess at the motives of chaos or law and probably be right but not even the lords of the higher worlds can under stand the motives of balo the jester it is said that he is the only one allowed to move between the realms of chaos and law at will though i have never heard of him coming to the realm of earth before neither for that matter have i ever heard him credited with such acts of destruction as that which weve witnessed it is a puzzle to meone which would no doubt please him if he knew there would be one way of discovering the pur pose of his visit theleb kaarna said with a faint smile if someone entered the citadel come now sorcerer elric mocked ive little love for life to be sure but there are some things of value to memy soul for one theleb kaarna began to ride on down the hill but elric remained thoughtfully where he was yishana beside him you seem more troubled by this than you should be elric she said it is disturbing there is a hint here that if we investigate the citadel further we should become embroiled in some dispute between balo and his mastersperhaps even the lords of law too to be come so involved could easily mean our destruction since the forces at work are more dangerous and powerful than anything we are familiar with on earth but we cannot simply watch this balo laying our cities waste carrying off our fairest threatening to rule jharkor himself within a short time elric sighed but did not reply have you no sorcery elric to send balo back to chaos where he belongs to seal the breach he has made in our realm even melniboneans cannot match the power of the lords of the higher worldsand my forefathers knew much more of sorcery than do i my best allies serve neither chain nor law they are elementals lords of fire earth air and water entities with affin ities with beasts and plants good allies in an earthly battlebut of no great use when matched against one such as balo i must think at least if i opposed balo it would not necessarily incur the wrath of my patron lords something i suppose the hills rolled green and lush to the grasslands at their feet the sun beat down from a clear sky on the infinity of grass stretching to the horizon above them a large predatory bird wheeled and theleb kaarna was a tiny figure turning in the saddle to call to them in a thin voice but his words could not be heard yishana seemed dispirited her shoulders slightly slumped and she did not look at elric as she began to guide her horse slowly down towards the sorcerer of pan tang elric followed conscious of his own in decision yet halfcareless of it what did it matter to him if the music began faintly at first but beginning to swell with an attractive poignant sweetness evoking nostalgic memories offering peace and giving life a sharp meaning all at once if the music came from instruments then they were not earthly it produced in him a yearning to turn about and discover its source but he resisted it yishana on the other hand was evidently not finding the music so easily resisted she had wheeled completely round her face radiant her lips trembling and tears shining in her eyes elric in his wanderings in unearthly realms had heard music like it beforeit echoed many of the bi zarre symphonies of old melniboneand it did not draw him as it drew yishana he recognised swiftly that she was in danger and as she came past him spurring her horse he reached out to grab her bridle her whip slashed at his hand and cursing with unexpected pain he dropped the bridle she went past him galloping up to the crest of the hill and vanishing over it in an instant yishana he shouted at her desperately but his voice would not carry over the pulsing music he looked back hoping that theleb kaarna would lend help but the sorcerer was riding rapidly away evidently on hearing the music he had come to a swift decision elric raced after yishana screaming for her to turn back his own horse reached the top of the hill and he saw her bent over her steeds neck as she goaded it towards the shining citadel yishana you go to your doom now she had reached the outer limits of the citadel and her horses feet seemed to strike off shimmering waves of colour as they touched the chaosdisturbed ground surrounding the place al though he knew it was too late to stop her elric continued to speed after her hoping to reach her before she entered the citadel itself but even as he entered the rainbow swirl he saw what appeared to be a dozen yishanas going through a dozen gateways into the citadel oddly refracted light created the illusion and made it impossible m tell which was the real yishana with yishanas disappearance the music stopped and elric thought he heard a faint whisper of laugh ter following it his horse was by this time becoming increasingly difficult to control and he did not trust himself to it he dismounted his legs wreathed in ra diant mist and let the horse go it galloped off snorting its terror elrics left hand moved to the hilt of his rune sword but he hesitated to draw it once pulled from its scabbard the blade would demand souls before it allowed itself to be resheathed yet it was his only weapon he withdrew his hand and the blade seemed to quiver angrily at his side not yet stormbringer there may be forces within who are stronger even than you hebegan to wade through the faintlyresisting light swirls he was haltblinded by the scintillating colours around him which sometimes shone dark blue silver and red sometimes gold light green amber he also felt the sickening lack of any sort of orientationdistance depth breadth were mean ingless he recognised what he had only experienced in an astral formthe odd timeless spaceless quality that marked a realm of the higher worlds he drifted pushing his body in the direction in which he yishana had for now guessed gone by he had lost sight of the gateway or any of its mirage images he realised that unless he was doomed to drift here until he starved he must draw stormbringer for the runeblade could resist the influence of chaos this time when he gripped the swords hilt he felt a shock run up his arm and infuse his body with vitality the sword came free from the scabbard from the huge blade carved with strange old runes a black radiance poured meeting the shifting colours of chaos and dispersing them now elric shrieked the ageold battleululation of his folk and pressed on into the citadel slashing at the intangible images that swirled on all sides the gateway was ahead and elric knew it now for his sword had shown him which were the mirages it was open as elric reached the portal he paused for a moment his lips moving as he remembered an invo cation that he might need later arioch lord of chaos patron goddemon of his ancestors was a negligent power and whimfulhe could not rely on arioch to aid him here unless in slow graceful strides a golden beast with eyes of rubyfire was loping down the passage that led from the portal bright though the eyes were they seemed blind and its huge doglike muzzle was closed yet its path could only lead it to elric and as it neared him the mouth suddenly gaped showing coral fangs in silence it came to a halt the blind eyes never once settling on the albino and then sprang elric staggered back raising the sword in defense he was flung to the ground by the beasts weight and felt its body cover him it was cold cold and it made no attempt to savage himjust lay on top of him and let the cold permeate his body elric began to shiver as he pushed at the chilling body of the beast stormbringer moaned and tour mured in his hand and then it pierced some part of the beasts body and a horrible cold strength began to fill the albino reinforced by the beasts own life force he heaved upwards the beast continued to smother him though now a thin barely audible sound was coming from it elric guessed that stormbringers small wound was hurting the crea ture desperately for he was shaking and aching with cold he moved the sword and stabbed again again the thin sound from the beast again cold energy flooded through him and again he heaved this time the beast was flung off and crawled back towards the portal elric sprang up raised storm bringer high and brought the sword down on the golden creatures skull the skull shattered as ice might shatter elric rang forward into the passage and once within the place became filled with roars and shrieks that echoed and were magnified it was as if the voice that the cold beast had lacked outside was shouting its deathagonies here now the floor rose until he was running up a spi ral ramp looking down he shuddered for he looked into an infinite pit of subtle dangerous colours that swam about in such a way that he could hardly take his eyes from them he even felt his body begin to leave the ramp and go towards the pit but he strengthened his grip on the sword and dis ciplined himself to climb on upwards as he looked was the same as down wards only the ramp had any kind of constancy and this began to take on the appearance of a thinly cut jewel through which he could see the pit and in which it was reflected greens and blues and yellows predominated but there were also traces of dark red black and orange and many other colours not in an ordinary human spectrum elric knew he was in some province of the higher worlds and guessed that it would not be long before the ramp led him to new danger danger did not seem to await him when at last he came to the end of the ramp and stepped on to a bridge of similar stuff which led over the scintillat ing pit to an archway that shone with a steady blue light he crossed the bridge cautiously and as cautiously entered the arch everything was bluetinged here even himself and he trod on the blue becoming deeper and deeper as he progressed then stormbringer began to murmur and either warned by the sword or by some sixth sense of his own elric wheeled to his right another archway had appeared there and from this there began to shine a light as deep red as the other was blue where the two met was a purple of fantastic richness and elric stared at this experiencing a similar hyp notic pull as he had had when climbing the ramp again his mind was stronger and he forced himself to enter the red arch at once another arch appeared to his left sending a beam of green light to merge with the red and another to his left brought yellow light one ahead brought mauve until he seemed trapped within the crisscross of beams he slashed at them with stormbringer and the black radiance reducedthe beams for a moment to streamers of light which reformed again elric continued to move forward now looming through the confusion of colour a shape appeared and elric thought it was that of a man man it was in shapebut not in size it seemed yet when it drew closer it was no giantless than elrics heightstill it gave the impression of vast pro portions rather as if it were a giant and elric had grown to its size it blundered towards elric and went through him it was not that the man was intangibleit was elric who felt the ghost the creatures mass seemed of in credible density the creature was turning its huge hands reaching out its face a mocking grimace elric struck at it with stormbringer and was astonished as the runesword was halted making no impression on the creatures bulk yet when it grasped elric its hands went through him elric backed away grinning now in relief then he saw with some terror that the light was gleaming through him he had been righthe was the ghost the creature reached out for him again grabbed him again failed to hold him elric conscious that he was in no physical dan ger from the monster yet also highly conscious that his sanity was about to be permanently impaired turned and fled quite suddenly he was in a hall the walls of which were of the same unstable shifting colours as the rest of the place but sitting on a stool in the centre of the hall holding in his hands some tiny creatures that seemed to be running about on his palm was a small figure who looked up at elric and grinned merrily welcome king of melnibone and how fares the last ruler of my favourite earthly race the figure was dressed in shimmering motley on his head was a tall spiked crowna travesty of and a comment upon the crowns of the mighty his face was angular and his mouth wide greetings lord balo elric made a mock bow strange hospitality you offer in your welcome ahahait did not amuse you eh men are so much harder to please than godsyou would not think it would you mens pleasures are rarely so elaborate where is queen yishana allow me my pleasures also mortal here she is i think balo plucked at one of the tiny creatures on his palm elric stepped forward and saw that yishana was indeed there as were many of the lost soldiers balo looked up at him and winked they are so much easier to handle in this size i do not doubt it though i wonder if it is not we who are larger rather than they who are smaller you are astute mortal but can you guess how this came to be your creature back thereyour pits and colours and archwayssomehow they warpwhat mass king elric but you would not understand such concepts even the lords of melnibone most godlike and intelligent of mortals only learned how to manipulate the elements in ritual invocation and spell but never understood what they manipu latedthat is where the lords of the higher worlds score whatever their differences but i survived without need for spells i survived by disciplining my mind that helped for certainbut you forget your greatest assetthat disturbing blade there you use it in your petty problems to aid you and you never realise that it is like making use of a mighty war gal ley to catch a sprat that sword represents power in any realm king elric aye so it might this does not interest me why are you here lord balo balo chuckled his laughter rich and musical oho i am in disgrace i quarrelled with my mas ters who took exception to a joke of mine about their insignificance and egotism about their destiny and their pride bad taste to them king is any hint of their own oblivion i made a joke in bad taste i fled from the higher worlds to earth where unless invoked the lords of law or chaos can rarely inter fere you will like my intention elric as would any melniboneani intend to establish my own realm on earththe realm of paradox a little from law a little from chaosa realm of opposites of curiosi ties and jokes im thinking we already have such a world as you describe lord balo with no need for you to create it earnest irony king elric for an insouciant man of melnibone ah that it may be i am a boor on occasions such as these will you release yishana and myself but you and i are giantsi have given you the status and appearance of a god you and i could be partners in this enterprise of miner unfortunately lord balo i do not possess your range of humour and am unfitted for such an exalt ed role besides elric grinned suddenly it is in my mind that the lords of the higher worlds will not easily let drop the matter of your ambition since it appears to conflict so strongly with theirs balo laughed but said nothing elric also smiled but it was an attempt to hide his racing thoughts what do you intend to do if i re fuse why elric you would not refuse i can think of many subtle pranks that i could play on you indeed and the black swords ah yes balo in your mirth and obsessions you have not considered everything thoroughly you should have exerted more effort tovanquish me before i came here now elrics eyes gleamed hot and he lifted the sword crying arioch master i invoke thee lord of chaos balo started cease that king elric ariochhere is a soul for you to claim quiet i say arioch hear me elrics voice was loud and des perate balo let his tiny playthings fall and rose hurriedly skipping towards elric your invocation is unheeded he laughed reach ing out for elric but stormbringer moaned and shuddered in elrics hand and balo withdrew his hand his face became serious and frowning arioch of the seven darksyour servant calls you the walls of flame trembled and began to fade balos eyes widened and jerked this way and that oh lord ariochcome reclaim your straying balo you cannot balo scampered across the room where one section of the flame had faded entirely revealing darkness beyond sadly for you little jester he can the voice was sardonic and yet beautiful from the darkness stepped a tall figure no longer the shapeless gibber ing thing that had until now been ariochs fa voured manifestation when visiting the realm of earth yet the great beauty of the newcomer filled as it was with a kind of compassion mingled with pride cruelty and sadness showed at once that he could not be human he was clad in doublet of puls ing scarlet hose of everchanging hue a long golden sword at his hips his eyes were large but slanted high his hair was long and as golden as the sword his lips were full and his chin pointed like his ears arioch balo stumbled backwards as the lord of chaos advanced it was your mistake balo elric said from behind the jester did you not realise only the kings of melnibone may invoke arioch and bring him to the realm of earth it has been their ageold privilege and much have they abused it said arioch smiling faintly as balo groveled however this service you have done us elric will make up for past misuses i was not amused by the matter of the mist giant even elric was awed by the incredibly powerful presence of the chaos lord he also felt much re lieved for he had not been sure that arioch could be summoned in this way now arioch stretched an arm down towards balo and lifted the jester by his collar so that he jerked and struggled in the air his face writhing in fear and consternation arioch took hold of balos head and squeezed it elric looked on in amazement as the head began to shrink arioch took balos legs and bent them in folding balo up and kneading him in his slender in human hands until he was a small solid ball arioch then popped the ball into his mouth and swallowed it i have not eaten him elric he said with another faint smile it is merely the easiest way of transport ing him back to the realms from which he came he has transgressed and will be punished all this he waved an arm to indicate the citadelis unfortu nate and contradicts the plans we of chaos have for earthplans which will involve you our servant and make you mighty elric bowed to his master i am honoured lord arioch though i seek no favours ariochs silvery voice lost some of its beauty and his face seemed to cloud for a second you are pledged to serve chaos elric as were your an cestors you will serve chaos the time draws near when both law and chaos will battle for the realm of earthand chaos shall win earth will be incor porated into our realm and you will join the hierar chy of chaos become immortal as we are immortality offers little to me my lord ah elric have the men of melnibone become as the halfapes who now dominate earth with their puny civilisations are you no better than these young kingdom upstarts think what we offer i shall my lord when the time you mention comes elrics head was still lowered you shall indeed arioch raised his arms now to transport this toy of balos to its proper realm and redress the trouble he has caused lest some hint reaches our opponents before the proper time ariochs voice swelled like the singing of a million brazen bells and elric sheathed his sword and clapped his hands over his ears to stop the pain then elric felt his body seem to shred apart swell and stretch until it became like smoke drifting on air then faster the smoke began to be drawn to gether becoming denser and denser and he seemed to be shrinking now all around him were rolling banks of colour flashes and indescribable noises then came a vast blackness and he closed his eyes against the images that seemed reflected in the blackness when he opened them he stood in the valley and the singing citadel was gone only yishana and a few surprisedlooking soldiers stood there yishana ran towards him elricwas it you who saved us i must claim only part of the credit he said not all my soldiers are here she said inspecting the men where are the restand the villagers ab ducted earlier if balos tastes are like his masters then i fear they now have the honour of being part of a demi god the lords of chaos are not flesheaters of course being of the higher worlds but there is something they savour in men which satisfies them yishana hugged her body as if in cold he was hugei cannot believe that his citadel could contain his bulk the citadel was more than a dwellingplace that was obvious somehow it changed size shapeand other things i cannot describe arioch of chaos transported it and balo back to where they belong arioch but he is one of the greatest six how did he come to earth an old pact with my remote ancestors by calling him they allow him to spend a short time in our realm and he repays them with some favour this was done come elric she took his arm lets away from the valley elric was weak and enfeebled by the efforts of summoning arioch and the experiences he had had before and since the episode he could hardly walk and soon it was yishana who supported him as they made slow progress the dazed warriors following in their wake towards the nearest village where they could obtain rest and horses to take them back to dhakos five as they staggered past the blasted ruins of tho kara yishana pointed suddenly at the sky what is that a great shape was winging its way towards them it had the appearance of a butterfly but a butterfly with wings so huge they blotted out the sun can it be some creature of balos left behind she speculated hardly likely he replied this has the appear ance of a monster conjured by a human sorcerer theleb kaarna he has surpassed himself elric said wryly i did not think him capable it is his vengeance on us elric that seems reasonable but i am weak yishana and stormbringer needs souls if it is to replenish my strength he turned a calculating eye on the warriors behind him who were gaping up at the creature as it came nearer now they could see it had a mans body covered with hairs or feathers hued like a peacocks the air whistled as it descended its fiftyfoot wings dwarfing the seven feet of head and body from its head grew two curling horns and its arms terminated in long talons we are doomed elric cried yishana she saw that the warriors were fleeing and she cried after them to come back elric stood there passively knowing that alone he could not defeat the butter flycreature best go with them yishana he murmured i think it will be satisfied with me no he ignored her and stepped towards the creature as it landed and began to glide over the ground in his direction he drew a quiescent stormbringer which felt heavy in his hand a little strength flowed into him but not enough his only hope was to strike a good blow at the creatures vitals and draw some of its own lifeforce into himself the creatures voice shrilled at him and the strange insane face twisted as he approached elric realised that this was no true supernatural denizen of the nether worlds but a oncehuman creature warped by theleb kaarnas sorcery at least it was mortal and he had only physical strength to contend with in better condition it would have been easy for himbut now the wings beat at the air as the taloned hands grasped at him he took stormbringer in both hands and swung the runeblade at the things neck swiftly the wings folded in to protect its neck and storm bringer became entangled in the strange sticky flesh a talon caught elrics arm ripping it to the bone he yelled in pain and yanked the sword from the en folding wing he tried to steady himself for another blow but the monster grabbed his wounded arm and began drawing him towards its now lowered headand the horns that curled from it he struggled hacking at the things arms with the extra strength that came with the threat of death then he heard a cry from behind him and saw a figure from the corner of his eye a figure that leapt forward with two blades gleaming in either hand the swords slashed at the talons and with a shriek the creature turned on elrics wuldbe rescuer it was moonglum elric fell backwards breathing hard as he watched his little redheaded friend en gage the monster but moonglum would not survive for long unless aided elric racked his brain for some spell that would help but he was too weak even if he could think of one to raise the energy necessary to summon super natural help and then it came to him yishana she was not as exhausted as he but could she do it he turned as the air moaned to the beating of the creatures wings moonglum was only just managing to hold it off his two swords flashing rapidly as he parried every effort to grasp him yishana croaked the albino she came up to him and placed a hand on his we could leave elricperhaps hide from that thing no i must help moonglum listenyou realise how desperate our position is do you not then keep that in mind while you recite this rune with me perhaps together we may succeed there are many kinds of lizards in these parts are there not ayemany then this is what you must sayand remember that we shall all perish by theleb kaarnas servant if you are not successful in the half worlds where dwelt the mastertypes of all creatures other than man an entity stirred hearing its name the entity was called haaashaas taak and it was scaly and cold with no true intellect such as men and gods possessed but an awareness which served it as well if not better it was brother on this plane to such entities as meerclar lord of the cats roofdrak lord of the dogs nuruah lord of the cattle and many many others this was haaashaastaak lord of the lizards it did not really hear words in the exact sense but it heard rhythms which meant much to it even though it did not know why the rhythms were being repeated over and over again but seemed too faint to be worth much atten tion it stirred and yawned but did nothing haaashaastaak lord of lizards your children were fathers of men haaashaastaak prince of reptiles come aid a grandchild now haaashaastaak father of scales coldblooded bringer of life it was a bizarre scene with elric and yishana des perately chanting the rune over and over again as moonglum fought on slowly losing strength haaashaastaak quivered and became more curi ous the rhythms were no stronger yet they seemed more insistent he would travel he decided to that place where those he watched over dwelt he knew that if he answered the rhythms he would have to obey whatever source they had he was not of course aware that such decisions had been implant ed into him in a far distant agethe time before the creation of earth when the lords of law and chaos then inhabitants of a single realm and known by an other name had watched over the forming of things and laid down the manner and logic in which things should behave following their great edict from the voice of the cosmic balancethe voice which had never spoken since haaashaastaak betook himself a little slothfully to earth elric and yishana were still chanting hoarsely as haaashaastaak made his sudden appearance he had the look of a huge iguana and his eyes were many coloured many faceted jewels his scales seeming of gold silver and other rich metals a slightly hazy outline surrounded him as if he had brought part of his own environment with him yishana gasped and elric breathed a deep sigh as a child he had learned the languages of all animal masters and now he must recall the simple language of the lizardmaster haaashaastaak his need fired his brain and the words came sud denly haaashaastaak he cried pointing at the butterfly creature mokik ankkuh the lizard lord turned its jewelled eyes on the creature and its great tongue suddenly shot out towards it curling around the monster it shrilled in terror as it was drawn towards the lizard lords great maw legs and arms kicked as the mouth closed on it several gulps and haaashaastaak had swallowed theleb kaarnas prize creation then it turned its head uncertainly about for a few moments and van ished pain began to throb now through elrics torn arm as moonglum staggered towards him grinning in re lief i followed behind you at a distance as you re quested he said since you suspected treachery from theleb kaarna but than i spied the sorcerer coming this way and followed him to a cave in yonder hills he pointed but when the deceased he laughed shakily emerged from the cave i decided that it would be best to chase that for i had the feeling it was going in your direction i am glad you were so astute elric said it was your doing really moonglum replied for if you hadnt anticipated treachery from the leb kaarna i might not have been here at the right moment moonglum suddenly sank to the grass leaned back grinned and fainted elric felt very dazed himself i do not think we need fear anything more from your sorcerer just yet yishana he said let us rest here and refresh ourselves perhaps then your cowardly soldiers will have returned and we can send them to a village to get us some horses they stretched out on the grass and lying in each others arms went to sleep elric was astonished to wake in a bed a soft bed he opened his eves and saw yishana and moonglum smiling down at him how long have i been here more than two days you did not wake when the horses came so we had the warriors construct a stretcher to bear you to dhakos you are in my palace elric cautiously moved his stiff bandaged arm it was still painful are my belongings still at the inn perhaps if they have not been stolen why i have a pouch of herbs there which will heal this arm quickly and also supply me with a little strength which i need badly i will go and see if they are still there moon glum said and walked from the chamber yishana stroked elrics milkwhite hair i have much to thank you for wolf said she you have saved my kingdomperhaps all the young king doms in my eyes you are redeemed for my brothers death oh i thank you madam said elric with a mock hag tone she laughed you are still a melnibonean still that aye a strange mixture however sensitive and cruel sardonic and loyal to your little friend moonglum i look forward to knowing you better my lord as to that i am not sure if you will have the op portunity she gave him a hard look why your resume of my character was incomplete queen yishanayou should have added careless of the worldand yet vengeful i wish to be revenged on your pet wizard but he is spent surely you said so yourself i am as you remarked still a melnibonean my arrogant blood calls vengeance on an upstart forget theleb kaarna i will have him hunted by my white leopards even his sorcery will not win against such savages as they are forget him oh no elric elrici will give yon my kingdom declare you ruler of jharkor if you will let me be your con sort he reached out and stroked her bare arm with his good hand you are unrealistic queen to take such an ac tion would bring wholesale rebellion in your land to your folk i am still the traitor of imrryr not nownow you are the hero of jharkor how so they did not know of their peril and thus will feel no gratitude it were best that i settled my debt with your wizard and went on my way the streets must already be full of rumours that you have taken your brothers murderer to your bed your popularity with your subjects must be at its lowest madam i do not care you will if your nobles lead the people in insurrec tion and crucify yon naked in the city square you are familiar with our customs we melniboneans are a learned folk queen well versed in all the arts all of them again he felt his blood race as she rose and barred the door at that moment he felt no need for the herbs which moonglum had gone to find when he tiptoed from the room that night he found moonglum waiting patiently in the antecham ber moonglum proffered the pouch with a wink but elrics mood was not light he took bunches of herbs from the pouch and selected what he needed moonglum grimaced as he watched elric chew and swallow the stuff then together they stole from the palace armed with stormbringer and mounted elric rode slightly behind his friend as moonglum led the way towards the hills beyond dhakos if i know the sorcerers of pan tang murmured the albino then theleb kaarna will be more ex hausted than was i with luck we will come upon him sleeping i shall wait outside the cave in that case said moonglum for he now had some experience of elrics vengeancetaking and did not relish watching theleb kaarnas slow death they galloped speedily unto the hills were reached and moonglum showed elric the cave mouth leaving his horse the albino went softfooted into the cave his runesword ready moonglum waited nervously for theleb kaarnas first shrieks but none came he waited until dawn began to bring the first faint light and then elric face frozen with anger emerged from the cave savagely he grasped his horses reins and swung himself into the saddle are you satisfied moonglum asked tentatively satisfied no the dog has vanished gonebut he was more cunning than i thought there are several caves and i sought him in all of them in the farthest i discovered traces of sorcerous runes on the walls and floor he has transported himself some where and i could not discover where in spite of de ciphering most of the runes perhaps he went to pan tang ah then our quest has been futile let us return to dhakos and enjoy a little more of yishanas hospi tality nowe go to pan tang but elric theleb kaarnas brother sorcerers dwell there in strength and jagreen lern the theocrat for bids visitors no matter i wish to finish my business with the leb kaarna you have no proof that he is there no matter and then elric was spurring his horse away riding like a man possessed or fleeing from dreadful peril and perhaps he was both possessed and fleeing moonglum did not follow at once but thoughtfully watched his friend gallop off not normally intro spective he wondered if yisbana had perhaps af fected the albino more strongly than he would have wished he did not think that vengeance on theleb kaarna was elrics prime desire in refusing to re turn to dhakos then he shrugged and clapped his heels to his steeds flank racing to catch up with elric as the cold dawn rose wondering if they would continue towards pan tang once dhakos was far enough be hind but elrics head contained no thoughts only emo tion flooded himemotion he did not wish to ana lyse his white hair streaming behind him his dead white handsome face set his slender hands tightly clutching the stallions reins he rode and only his strange crimson eyes reflected the misery and con flict within him in dhakos that morning other eyes held misery but not for too long yishana was a pragmatic queen
