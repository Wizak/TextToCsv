here a white arm shot out from a canopy of mosquitonetting and first a bootjack then a slipper then a heavy topboot came whizzing past the darkys dodging head and finding expostulation vain that faithful servitor bolted out in search of some ally more potent and found one though not the one he sought or desired just entering the adjoining room a big fellow too too big in fact to be seen wearing as was the fashion in the sixties the shell jacket of the light artillery he had a full round body and a full round ruddy face and a little round visorless cap cocked on one side of a round bullet head not very full of brains perhaps yet reputed to be fairly stocked with what is termed horse sense his bulky legs were thrust deep in long boots and ornamented so far as the skintight breeches of skyblue were concerned with a scarlet welt along the seam a welt that his comrades were wont to say would make a white mark on his nose so red and bulbous was that organ he came noisily in from the broad veranda overlooking the paradeground glanced about on the disarray of the bachelor sittingroom then whirled on ananias mr waring dressed noo suh jus woke up suh aint out o bed yit the lazy vagabond just let me get at him a minute said the big man tramping over to the doorway as though bent on invading the chamber beyond but ananias had halted short at sight of the intruder and stood there resolutely barring the way beg pahdon lieutenant but mr waring aint had his bath yit can i mix de lieutenant a cocktail suh can you you black imp of satan why isnt it ready now sir sure you could have seen i was as dhry as a limekiln from the time i came through the gate hwares the demijohn you villain bein refilled suh down to de sto but dars a little on de sideboad suh answered

cocktails yet the lieutenant doesnt care fo any dis mawnin suh ill fetch him his coffee in a minute did you see de cunnles oadely suh he was lookin fo you a moment ago the big red man was gulping down a big drink of the fiery liquor at the instant he set the glass back on the sideboard with unsteady hand and glared at ananias suspiciously is it troot youre tellin nigger hwat did he say was wanted didnt say suh but de cunnles in his office yawnduh comes de oadely too suh guess he must have hyuhd you was over hyuh the result of this announcement was not unexpected the big man made a leap for the

all on account of your bringing me in at that hour last night tell him ive gone ananias let me in waring theres a good fellow go to blazes doyle is the unfeeling answer from the other side im bathing

this time without fail and i know it for gods sake waring cant ye let a fellow in and say that im not here hyuh dis way lieutenant whispered ananias mysteriously slip out on de poch and into mr pierces room ill tell you when hes gone and in a moment the huge bulk of the senior lieutenant of light battery x was being boosted through a window opening from the gallery into the bachelor den of the junior second lieutenant no sooner was this done than the negro servant darted back closed and bolted the long green venetian blinds behind him tiptoed to the bedroom door and softly tapping called mr waring mr waring get dressed quick as you can suh ill lay out your uniform in hyuh i tell you ananias im going to town sir not to any ridiculous review go and get what i ordered you see that im properly dressed sir or ill discharge you confound you sir there isnt a drop of florida water in this bath and none on my bureau go and rob mr pierce or anybody but ananias was already gone darting out on the gallery he took a header through the window of the adjoining quarters through which mr doyle had escaped snatched a long flask from the dressingtable and was back in the twinkling of an eye what became of mr doyle asked waring as he thrust a bare arm through a narrow aperture to receive the spoil dont let him get drunk hes got to go to review sir if he doesnt colonel braxton may be so inconsiderate as to inquire why both the lieutenants of x battery are missing take good care of him till the review sir then let him go to grass and dont you dare leave me without florida water again if you have to burglarize the whole post whats mr doyle doing sir peekin froo de blins in mr pierces room suh lookin fo de oadely i done told him de cunnle was ahter him but he aint suh chuckled

go and carry out my orders dont forget captain crams wagon tell jeffers to be here with it on time and the lieutenant returned to his bath without waiting for reply yeas suh was the subordinate answer as ananias promptly turned and whistling cheerily went banging out upon the gallery and clattering down the open stairway to the brickpaved court below here he as promptly turned and noiseless as a cat shot up the stairway tiptoed back into the sittingroom kicked off his lowheeled slippers and rapidly but with hardly an audible sound resumed the work on which he had been engaged the arrangement of his masters kit already faultlessly brushed folded and hanging over the back of a chair close by the chamber door were the bright blue scarletwelted battery trousers then in vogue very snug at the knee very springy over the foot underneath them spread over the square back of the chair a darkblue singlebreasted frockcoat hanging nearly to the floor its shoulders decked with huge epaulettes to the right one of which were attached the braid and loops of a heavy gilt aiguillette whose glistening pendants were hung temporarily on the upper button on the seat of the chair was folded a broad soft sash of red silk net its tassels carefully spread beside it lay a pair of long buff gauntlets new and spotless at the door brilliantly polished stood a pair of buttoned gaiter boots the heels decorated with small glistening brass spurs in the corner close at hand leaned a long curved sabre its gold swordknot its tripleguarded hilt its steel scabbard and plated bands and rings as well as the swivels and buckle of the black swordbelt showing the perfection of finish in manufacture and care in keeping from a round leather box ananias now extracted a new goldwire fouragиre which he softly wiped with a silk handkerchief dandled lovingly an instant the glistening tassels coiled it carefully upon the sash then producing from the same box a long scarlet horsehair plume he first brushed it into shimmering freedom from the faintest knot or kink then set it firmly through its socket into the front of a goldbraided shako whose black front was decked with the embroidered cross cannon of the regiment surmounted by the arms of the united states this he noiselessly placed upon the edge of the mantel stepped back to complacently view his work flicked off a possible speck of dust on the sleeve of the coat touched with a chamoisskin the gold crescent of the nearest epaulette then softly noiselessly as before vanished through the doorway tiptoed to the adjoining window and peeked in mr doyle had thrown himself into pierces armchair and was trying to read the morning paper wunner what marser pierce will say when he gits back from breakfast was ananiass comment as he sped softly down the stairs a broad grin on his black face a grin that almost instantly gave place to preternatural solemnity and respect as turning sharply on the sidewalk at the foot of the stairs he came face to face with the battery commander ananias would have passed with a low obeisance but the captain halted him short wheres mr waring sir dressin fo inspection captain he is i just heard in the messroom that he didnt propose attending that he had an engagement to breakfast and was going in town yeas suh yeas suh general roosseau suh expected de lieutenant in to breakfast but de moment he hyuhd twas review he ohdered me to git everything ready suh is goin for de bay colt now beg pahdon captain de lieutenant says is de captain goin to wear gauntlets or gloves dis mawnin he wants to do just as de captain does suh what a merciful interposition of divine providence it is that the african cannot blush captain cram looked suspiciously at the earnest unwinking black face before him some memory of old college days flitted through his mind at the moment o kunopes thou dogfaced one he caught himself muttering but negro diplomacy was too much for him and the innocence in the face of ananias would have baffled a man far more suspicious cram was a fellow who loved his battery and his profession as few men loved before he was full of big ideas in one way and little oddities in another undoubted ability had been at the bottom of his selection over the head of many a senior to command one of the light batteries when the general dismounting took place in unusual attractions of person had won him a wife with a fortune only a little later the fortune had warranted a short leave abroad this very year he would not have taken a day over sixty for fear of losing his light battery he had been a stickler for gauntlets on all mounted duty when he went away and he came home converted to white washleather gloves because the british horseartillery wore no other and they sir are the nattiest in the world he could not tolerate an officer whose soul was not aflame with enthusiasm for battery duty and so was perpetually at war with waring who dared to have other aspirations he delighted in a man who took pride in his dress and equipment and so rejoiced in waring who more than any subaltern ever attached to x was the very glass of soldier fashion and mould of soldier form he had dropped in at the bachelor mess just in time to hear some gabbling youngster blurt out a bet that sam waring would cut review and keep his tryst in town and he had known him many a time to overpersuade his superiors into excusing him from duty on pretext of social claims and more than once into pardoning deliberate absence but he and the post commander had deemed it high time to block all that nonsense in future and had so informed him and were nonplussed at warings cheery acceptance of the implied rebuke and most airy graceful and immediate change of the subject the whole garrison was chuckling over it by night why certainly colonel said he i have been most derelict of late during the visit of all these charming people from the north and that reminds me some of them are going to drive out here to hear the band this afternoon and take a bite at my quarters i was just on my way to beg mrs braxton and mrs cram to receive for me when your orderly came and colonel i want your advice about the champagne of course i neednt say i hope you both will honor me with your presence old brax loved champagne and salad better than anything his profession afforded and was disarmed at once as for cram what could he say when the post commander dropped the matter with all his daring disregard of orders and established customs with all his consummate sangfroid and what some called impudence and others cheek every superior under whom he had ever served had sooner or later become actually fond of sam waring even stern old rounds old double rounds the boys called him one of the martinets of the service whose first experience with the fellow was as memorable as it was unexpected and who wound up after a vehement scoring of some two minutes duration during which waring had stood patiently at attention with an expression of the liveliest sympathy and interest on his handsome face by asking impressively now sir what have you to say for yourself to which with inimitable mixture of suavity and concern sam replied nothing whatever sir i doubt if anything more could be said i had no adequate idea of the extent of my misdoing have i your permission to sit down sir and think it over rounds actually didnt know what to think and still less what to say had he believed for an instant that the young gentleman was insincere he would have had him in close arrest in the twinkling of an eye but warings tone and words and manner were those of contrition itself it was not possible that one of the boys should dare to be guying him the implacable rounds old grand rounds of the sixth corps old double rounds of the horseartillery of the peninsula days mrs rounds had her suspicions when told of the affair but was silent for of all the officers stationed in and around the old southern city sam waring was by long odds the most graceful and accomplished dancer and german leader the best informed on all manner of interesting matters social musical dramatic fashionable the prime mover in garrison hops and parties the connecting link between the families of the general and staff officers in town and the linesmen at the surrounding posts the man whose dictum as to a dinner or luncheon and whose judgment as to a womans toilet were most quoted and least questioned the man whose word could almost make or mar an army girls success and good old lady rounds had two such encumbrances the first winter of their sojourn in the south and two army girls among so many are subjects of not a little thought and care if mr waring had not led the second german with margaret rounds the mothers heart would have been wellnigh crushed it was fear of some such catastrophe that kept her silent on the score of warings reply to her irate lord for if sam did mean to be impertinent as he unquestionably could be the colonel she knew would be merciless in his discipline and social amenities would be at instant end waring had covered her with maternal triumph and margaret with bliss unutterable by leading the antelenten german with the elder daughter and making her brief stay a month of infinite joy the rounds were ordered on to texas and margarets brief romance was speedily and properly forgotten in the devotions of a more solid if less fascinating fellow to do waring justice he had paid the girl no more marked attention than he showed to any one else he would have led the next german with genevieve had there been another to lead just as he had led previous affairs with other dames and damsels it was one of the ninetynine articles of his social faith that a girl should have a good time her first season just as it was another that a bride should have a lovely wedding a belle at least one offer a month a married woman as much attention at an army ball as could be lavished on a bud he prided himself on the fact that no woman at the army parties given that winter had remained a wallflower among such a host of officers as was there assembled during the year that followed on the heels of the war it was no difficult matter to be sure to find partners for the thirty or forty ladies who honored those occasions with their presence of local belles there were none it was far too soon after the bitter strife to hope for bliss so great as that there were hardly any but army women to provide for and even the bulkiest and least attractive of the lot was led out for the dance waring would go to any length to see them on the floor but that of being himself the partner there the line was drawn irrevocably the best dancer among the men he simply would not dance except with the best dancers among the women as to personal appearance and traits it may be said first that waring was a man of slender graceful physique with singularly well shaped hands and feet and a head and face that were almost too goodlooking to be manly dark hazel eyes dark brown hair eyebrows lashes and a very heavy drooping moustache a straight nose a soft sensitive mouth with even white teeth that were however rarely visible a clearcut chin and with it all a soft almost languid southern intonation musical even ultrarefined and he shrank like a woman from a coarse word or the utterance of an impure thought he was a man whom many women admired of whom some were afraid whom many liked and trusted for he could not be bribed to say a mean thing about one of their number though he would sometimes be satirical to her very face it was among the men that sam waring was hated or loved loved laughed over indulged even spoiled perhaps to any and every extent by the chosen few who were his chums and intimates and absolutely hated by a very considerable element that was prominent in the army in those queer old days the array of officers who by reason of birth antecedents lack of education or of social opportunities were wanting in those graces of manner and language to which waring had been accustomed from earliest boyhood his people were southerners yet not being slaveowners had stood firm for the union and were exiled from the old home as a natural consequence in a war in which the south held all against who were not for her appointed a cadet and sent to the military academy in recognition of the loyalty of his immediate relatives he was not graduated until the war was practically over and then gazetted to an infantry regiment he was stationed for a time among the scenes of his boyhood ostracized by his former friends and unable to associate with most of the warworn officers among whom his lot was cast it was a year of misery that ended in long and dangerous illness his final shipment to washington on sickleave and then a winter of keen delight a social campaign in which he won fame honors friends at court and a transfer to the artillery and then joining his new regiment he plunged with eagerness into the gayeties of city life the blues were left behind with the cold facings of his former corps and hope life duty were all blended in hues as roseate as his new straps were red it wasnt a month before all the best fellows in the batteries swore by sam waring and all the others at him so that where there were five who liked there were at least twenty who didnt and these made up in quantity what they lacked in quality to sum up the situation lieutenant doyles expression was perhaps the most comprehensive as giving the views of the great majority if i were his k o and this crowd the coort hed a been kicked out of the service months ago and yet entertaining or expressing so hostile an opinion of the laughing lieutenant mr doyle did not hesitate to seek his society on many an occasion when he wasnt wanted and to solace himself at warings sideboard at any hour of the day or night for waring kept what was known as open house to all comers and the very men who wondered how he could afford it and who predicted his speedy swamping in a mire of debt and disgrace were the very ones who were most frequently to be found loafing about his gallery smoking his tobacco and swigging his whiskey a pretty sure sign that the occupant of the quarters however was absent with none of their number had he ever had open quarrel remarks made at his expense and reported to him in moments of bibulous confidence he treated with gay disdain often to the manifest disappointment of his informant in his presence even the most reckless of their number were conscious of a certain restraint waring as has been said detested foul language and had a very quiet but effective way of suppressing it often without so much as uttering a word these were the rough days of the army the very roughest it ever knew the days that intervened between the incessant strain and tension of the four years battling and the slow gradual resumption of good order and military discipline the rude speech and manners of the camp still permeated every garrison the bulk of the commissioned force was made up of hard fighters brave soldiers and loyal servants of the nation to be sure but as a class they had known no other life or language since the day of their musterin of the line officers stationed in and around this southern city in the lovely springtide of of a force aggregating twenty companies of infantry and cavalry there were fifty captains and lieutenants appointed from the volunteers the ranks or civil life to one graduated from west point the predominance was in favor of exsergeants corporals or company clerks good men and true when they wore the chevrons but who with a few marked and most admirable exceptions proved to be utterly out of their element when promoted to a higher sphere the entrance into their midst of captain cram with his swell light battery with officers and men in scarlet plumes and fulldress uniforms was a revelation to the sombre battalions whose officers had not yet even purchased their epaulettes and had seen no occasion to wear them but when cram and his lieutenants came swaggering about the garrison croquetground in natty shell jackets russian shoulderknots ridingbreeches boots and spurs there were not lacking those among the sturdy foot who looked upon the whole proceeding with great disfavor cram had two rankers with him when he came but one had transferred out in favor of waring and now his battery was supplied with the full complement of subalterns doyle very much out of place commanding the right section as a platoon was called in those days waring commanding the left ferry serving as chief of caissons and pierce as battery adjutant and general utility man two of the officers were graduates of west point and not yet three years out of the cadet uniform under these circumstances it was injudicious in cram to sport in person the aiguillettes and thereby set an example to his subalterns which they were not slow to follow with their gold hatbraids cords tassels and epaulettes with scarlet plumes and facings he and his officers were already much more gorgeously bedecked than were their infantry friends the post commander old rounds had said nothing because he had had his start in the light artillery and might have lived and died a captain had he not pushed for a volunteer regiment and fought his way up to a division command and a lieutenantcolonelcy of regulars at the close of the war while his seniors who stuck to their own corps never rose beyond the possibilities of their arm of the service and probably never will but braxton who succeeded as post commander knew that in european armies and in the old mexican war days the aiguillette was ordinarily the distinctive badge of general officers or those empowered to give orders in their name it wasnt the proper thing for a linesman battery cavalry or foot to wear said brax and he thought cram was wrong in wearing it even though some other battery officers did so but cram was just back from britain why sir look at the life guards look at the horse guards in london every officer and man wears the aiguillette and braxton was a briton by birth and breeding and that ended it at least so nearly ended it that crams diplomatic invitation to come up and try some veuve clicquot extra dry upon the merits of which he desired the colonels opinion had settled it for good and all braxtons officers who ventured to suggest that he trim the plumage of these popinjays only got snubbed therefore for the time being and ordered to buy the infantry full dress forthwith and cram and his quartette continued to blaze forth in gilded panoply until long after sam waring led his last german within those echoing walls and his name lived only as a dim and mistwreathed memory in the annals of old jackson barracks but on this exquisite april morning no fellow in all the garrison was more prominent if not more popular despite the slight jealousy existing between the rival arms of the service there were good fellows and gallant men among the infantry officers at the post who were as cordially disposed towards the gay lieutenant as were the comrades of his own colored cloth this is the more remarkable because he was never known to make the faintest effort to conciliate anybody and was utterly indifferent to public opinion it would have been fortune far better than his deserts but for the fact that by nature he was most generous courteous and considerate the soldiers of the battery were devoted to him the servants black or white would run at any time to do his capricious will the garrison children adored him there was simply no subject under discussion at the barracks in those days on which such utter variety of opinion existed as the real character of lieutenant sam waring as to his habits there was none whatever he was a bon vivant a swell a lover of all that was sweet and fair and good and gracious in life selfindulgent said everybody selfish said some lazy said many who watched him daydreaming through the haze of cigarsmoke until a drive a hop a ride or an operaparty would call him into action slow said the men until they saw him catch mrs winslows runaway horse just at that ugly turn in the levee below the south tower coldhearted said many of the women until baby brainards fatal illness when he watched by the little sufferers side and brought her flowers and luscious fruit from town and would sit at her mothers piano and play soft sweet melodies and sing in low tremulous tone until the wearied eyelids closed and the sleep no potion could bring to that feverracked brain would come at last for him to whom childlove was incense and music at once a passion and a prayer men who little knew and less liked him thought his enmity would be but light and few men knew him so well as to realize that his friendship could be firm and true as steel and so the garrison was mixed in its mind as to mr waring and among those who heard it said at the mess that he meant at all hazards to keep his engagement to breakfast in town there were some who really wished he might cut the suddenlyordered review and thereby bring down upon his shapely nonchalant head the wrath of colonel braxton boots and saddles had sounded at the artillery barracks mr pierce as battery officer of the day had clattered off through the north gateway the battery had marched with dancing plumes and clanking sabres out to the stables and gunshed the horses of lieutenants doyle and ferry were waiting for their riders underneath the gallery of their quarters captain cram in much state followed by his orderly bugler and guidonbearer all in full uniform was riding slowly down the sunny side of the garrison and at sight of him doyle and ferry who were leisurely pulling on their gauntlets in front of their respective doors hooked up their sabres and came clattering down their stairway but no waring had appeared there across the parade on the southern side the bay colt caparisoned in warings unimpeachable horseequipments was being led up and down in the shade of the quarters mr pierces boy jim officiating as groom while his confrиre ananias out of sight was at the moment on his knees fastening the strap of his masters ridingtrousers underneath the dainty gaiter boot mr waring the while surveying the proceeding over the rim of his coffeecup dar suh now into de coat quick yawnduh goes captain cram ananias how often have i told you that howsoever necessary it might be for you to hurry i never do its unbecoming an officer and a gentleman to hurry sir but yous got to inspect yo section suh befo you can repote to captain cram please hurry wid de sash suh and holding the belt extended with both hands ananias stood eager to clasp it around warings slender waist but the lieutenant waved him away get thee behind me imp of satan would you have me neglect one of the foremost articles of an artillerymans faith never sir if there were a wrinkle in that sash it would cut a chasm in my reputation sir and so saying he stepped to the open doorway threw the heavy tassel over and around the knob kissed his hand jauntily to his battery commander now riding down the opposite side of the parade backed deliberately away the full length of the sash across the room then humming a favorite snatch from faust deliberately wound himself into the bright crimson web and making a broad flat loop near the farther end and without stopping his song nodded coolly to ananias to come on with the belt in the same calm and deliberate fashion he finished his military toilet set his shako well forward on his forehead the chinstrap hanging just below the under lip pulled on the buff gauntlets surveyed himself critically and leisurely in the glass and then began slowly to descend the stairs wait jus one moment please suh implored ananias hastening after him jus happened to think of it suh captain crams wearin gloves dis mawnin ah so much the more chance to come back here in ten minutes whoa coltikins how are you this morning sir think you could run away if i begged you to pretty hard youll try wont you old boy said waring stroking the glossy neck of the impatient bay now jim let go never allow anybody to hold a horse for you when you mount thats highly unprofessional sir thatll do and so saying he swung himself into saddle and checking the bounds of his excited colt rode calmly away to join the battery already the bandsmen were marching through the north gate on the way to the broad open field in which the manoeuvres were held the adjutant sergeantmajor and markers were following just outside the gate the post commander was seated on horseback and cram had reined in to speak with him now in his blithest cheeriest tones waring accosted them raising his hand in salute as he did so goodmorning colonel goodmorning captain cram were in luck today couldnt possibly have lovelier weather im only sorry this came off so suddenly and i hadnt time to invite our friends out from town they would have been so pleased to see the battalion the ceremonies hm there was plenty of time if youd returned to the post at retreat yesterday sir growled old braxton everybody was notified who was here then what time did you get back sir upon my word colonel i dont know i never thought to look or inquire but it was long after taps pardon me though i see im late inspecting and in a moment he was riding quietly around among his teams and guns narrowly scrutinizing each toggle trace and strap before taking station midway between his lead drivers and then as cram approached reporting left section ready sir meantime the infantry companies were marching out through the gate and then ordering arms and resting until adjutants call should sound drivers and cannoneers were dismounted to await the formation of the battalion line waring rode forward and in the most jovial offhand way began telling cram of the incidents of the previous day and his sightseeing with the party of visitors from the north by the way i promised mr allerton that they should see that team of yours before they left so if youve no objection the first morning youre on duty and cant go up ill take advantage of your invitation and drive miss allerton myself doesnt that court adjourn this week im afraid not said cram grimly it looks as though wed have to sit today and tomorrow both well thats too bad they all want to meet you again couldnt you come up this evening after stables hello this wont do our infantry friends will be criticising us i see youre wearing gloves and im in gauntlets so is doyle we cant fit him out im afraid but ive just got some from new york exactly like yours ill trot back while were waiting if you dont object and change them cram didnt want to say yes yet didnt like to say no he hesitated and was lost in another moment as though never imagining refusal were possible waring had quickly ridden away through the gate and disappeared behind the high brick wall when the bugle sounded mount three minutes later and the battery broke into column of pieces to march away to the manoeuvring grounds mr ferry left the line of caissons and took command of the rear section all that the battery saw of waring or his mount the rest of the morning was just after reaching the line when the fiery colt came tearing riderless around the field joyously dodging every attempt of the spectators to catch him and revelling in the delight of kicking up his heels and showing off in the presence and sight of his envious friends in harness plunge though they might the horses could not join dodge though they might the bipeds could not catch him review inspection and the long ceremonials of the morning went off without the junior first lieutenant of battery x who for his part went off without ceremony of any kind crams stylish team and wagon with him that afternoon he reappeared driving about the barrack square a pretty girl at his side both engrossed in the music of the band and apparently oblivious of the bottledup wrath of either battery or post commander be gorra said doyle id like to be in his place now provided i didnt have to be in it tomorrow but when the morrow came there came no waring with it chapter ii for twentyfour hours old brax had been mad as a hornet he was not much of a drillmaster or tactician but he thought he was and it delighted him to put his battalion through the form of review the commands for which he had memorized thoroughly and delivered with resonant voice and with all proper emphasis what he did not fancy and indeed could not do was the drudgework of teaching the minutiж of the school of the battalion explaining each movement before undertaking its execution this was a matter he delegated to one of his senior captains for a week therefore in preparation for a possible visit on the part of the new brigadiergeneral or his inspector the six companies of the regiment stationed at the post had been fairly well schooled in the ceremonies of review and parade and so long as nothing more was required of them than a march past in quick time and a ten minutes stand in line all might go well the general had unexpectedly appeared one evening with only a single aidedecamp simply as he explained to return the calls of the officers of the garrison six or eight of whom had known enough to present themselves and pay their respects in person when he arrived in town braxton swelled with gratified pride at the generals praise of the spickspan condition of the parade the walks roads and visible quarters but it was the very first oldtime garrison the new chief had ever seen a splendid fighting record with the volunteers during the war and the advantage of taking sides for the union from a doubtful state having conspired to win him a star in the regular service only a year or two before we would have had out the battery and given you a salute sir said brax had we known you were coming but its after retreat now next time general if youll ride down some day ill be proud to give you a review of the whole command we have a great big field back here and the general had promised to come this necessitated combined preparation hence the order for fulldress rehearsal with battery and all and then came confusion fresh from the command of his beautiful horsebattery and the dashing service with a cavalry division cram hated the idea of limping along as he expressed it behind a battalion of foot and said so and somebody told brax he had said so more than one somebody probably for brax had many an adviser to help keep him in trouble the order that cram should appear for instruction in review of infantry and artillery combined gave umbrage to the battery commander and his reported remarks thereupon renewed cause for displeasure to his garrison chief so far as were concerned said cram who wanted to utilize the good weather for battery drill we need no instruction as we have done the trick time and again before and if we hadnt who in the bloody fiftyfirst is there to teach us certainly not old brax all the same the order was obeyed and cram started out that loveliest of lovely spring mornings not entirely innocent of the conviction that he and his fellows were going to have some fun out of the thing before they got through with it not that he purposed putting any hitch or impediment in the way he meant to do just exactly as he was bid and so when adjutants call had sounded and the blue lines of the infantry were well out on the field he followed in glittering column of pieces his satincoated horses dancing in sheer exuberance of spirits and his redcrested cannoneers sitting with folded arms erect and statuesque upon the ammunitionchests mrs cram in her pretty basket phaeton with mrs lawrence of the infantry and several of the ladies of the garrison in ambulances or afoot had taken station well to the front of the forming line then it became apparent that old brax purposed to figure as the reviewing officer and had delegated major minor to command the troops now minor had been on mustering and disbursing duty most of the war had never figured in a review with artillery before and knew no more about battery tactics than cram did of diplomacy mounted on a sedate old sorrel borrowed from the quartermaster for the occasion with an antiquated brassbound jenifer saddle minus breaststrap and housings of any kind but equipped with his better halfs brown leather bridle minor knew perfectly well he was only a guy and felt indignant at brax for putting him in so false a plight he took his station however in front of the regimental colors without stopping to think where the centre of the line might be after the battery came and there awaited further developments cram kept nobody waiting however his leading team was close at the nimble heels of captain lawrences company as it marched gayly forth to the music of the band he formed sections at the trot the instant the ground was clear then wheeled into line passed well to the rear of the prolongation of the infantry rank and by a beautiful countermarch came up to the front and halted exactly at the instant that lawrence with the left flank company reached his post each caisson accurately in trace of its piece each team and carriage exactly at its proper interval and with his crimson silk guidon on the right flank and little pierce signalling up or back from a point outside where he could verify the alignment of the gunwheels on the rank of the infantry cram was able to command front before little drake the adjutant should have piped out his shrill guides posts but drake didnt pipe there stood all the companies at support each captain at the inner flank and the guides with their inverted muskets still stolidly gazing along the line it was time for him to pipe but instead of so doing there he stuck at the extreme right glaring down towards the now immovable battery and its serene commander and the little adjutants face was getting redder and puffier every minute go ahead what are you waiting for hoarsely whispered the senior captain waiting for the battery to dress was the stanch reply then aloud the shrill voice swept down the line dress that battery to the right cram looked over a glittering shoulder to the right of the line where stood the diminutive infantryman the battery had still its war allowance of horses three teams to each carriage lead swing and wheel and that brought its captain far out to the front of the sombre blue rank of foot so far out in fact that he was about on line with major minor though facing in opposite direction perfectly confident that he was exactly where he should be yet equally determined to abide by any order he might receive even though he fully understood the cause of drakes delay cram promptly rode over to the guidon and ordered right dress at which every drivers head and eyes were promptly turned but not an inch of a wheel for the alignment simply could not be improved then after commanding front the captain as deliberately trotted back to his post without so much as a glance at the irate staff officer it was just at this juncture that the bay colt came tearing down the field his mane and tail streaming in the breeze his reins and stirrups dangling in the course of his gyrations about the battery and the sympathetic plunging of the teams some slight disarrangement occurred but when he presently decided on a rush for the stables the captain reestablished the alignment as coolly as before and only noticed as he resumed his post that the basket phaeton and mrs cram had gone alarmed possibly by the nonappearance of her warm friend mr waring and the excited gambolings of his vagrant steed she had promptly driven back to the main garrison to see if any accident had occurred the colt meantime amusing himself in a game of fastandloose with the stable guard then it was that old brax came down and took a hand riding to where minor still sat on his patient sorrel the senior bluntly inquired what the devils the matter i dont know said minor who does know well drake possibly or else he doesnt know anything hes been trying to get cram to dress his battery back why yes confound it hes a mile ahead of the line said the colonel and off he trotted to expostulate with the batteryman captain cram isnt there room for your battery back of the line instead of in front of it inquired the chief in tone both aggrieved and aggressive lots sir answered cram cheerfully just countermarched there then i wish youd oblige me by moving back at once sir youre delaying the whole ceremony here im told mr drake has twice ordered you to dress to the right ive heard it sir only once but have dressed twice so its all right responded cram as affably as though he had no other aim in life than to gratify the whims of his post commander why confound it sir it isnt all right by a da good deal here you are way out on line with major minor and your batterys why it isnt dressed on our rank at all sir just look at it cram resumed the carry with the sabre he had lowered in salute calmly reversed so as to face his battery and with preternatural gravity of mien looked along his front there midway between his lead drivers sat mr doyle his face wellnigh as red as his plume his bleary eyes nearly popping out of his skull in his effort to repress the emotions excited by this colloquy there midway between the lead drivers in the left section sat mr ferry gazing straight to the front over the erected ears of his handsome bay and doing his very best to keep a solemn face though the unshaded corners of his boyish mouth were twitching with mischief and merriment there silent disciplined and rigid sat the sergeants drivers and cannoneers of famous old light battery x all agog with interest in the proceedings and all looking as though they never heard a word i declare sir said cram with exasperating civility i can see nothing out of the way will you kindly indicate what is amiss this was too much for ferry in his effort to restrain his merriment and gulp down a rising flood of laughter there was heard an explosion that sounded something like the sudden collapse of an inflated paper bag and old brax glaring angrily at the boy now red in the face with mingled mirth and consternation caught sudden idea from the sight was the battery laughing at was the battery commander guying him was it possible that they were profiting by his ignorance of their regulations it put him on his guard and suggested a tentative do you mean that you are right in being so far ahead of our line instead of dressed upon it asked he of the big blond soldier in the glittering uniform where do you find authority for it oh perfectly right colonel in fact for six years past ive never seen it done any other way youll find the authority on page field artillery tactics of for a moment brax was dumb he had long heard of cram as an expert in his own branch of the service but presently he burst forth well in our tactics theres reason for every blessed thing we do but ill be dinged if i can see rhyme or reason in such a formation as that why sir your one company takes up more room than my six makes twice as much of a show of course if a combined review is to show off the artillery its all very well however go ahead if you think youre right sir go ahead ill inquire into this later i know were right colonel and as for the reason youll see it when you open ranks for review and we come to action front then our line will be exactly that of the infantry meantime sir it isnt for us to go ahead weve gone as far as we can until your adjutant makes the next move but braxton had ridden away disgusted before cram wound up his remarks go on major minor just run this thing without reference to the battery damned if i understand their methods let cram look after his own affairs if he goes wrong why its none of our concern and so minor had nodded go ahead to mr drake and presently the whole command made its bow so to speak to minor as its immediate chief and then he drew sword and his untried voice became faintly audible the orders prepare for review and to the rear open order were instantly followed by a stentorian action front down at the left the instant leap and rush of some thirty nimble cannoneers shouts of drive on the cracking of whips the thunder and rumble of wheels the thud of plunging hoofs fortyeight mettlesome horses in teams of two abreast went dancing briskly away to the rear at sight of which minor dropped his jaw and the point of his sword and sat gazing blankly after them over the bowed head of his placid sorrel wondering what on earth it meant that they should all be running away at the very instant when he expected them to brace up for review but before he could give utterance to his thoughts eight glossy teams in almost simultaneous sweep to the left about came sharply around again the black muzzles of the guns were pointed to the front every axle exactly in the prolongation of his front rank every little group of redtopped redtrimmed cannoneers standing erect and square the chiefs of section and of pieces sitting like statues on their handsome horses the line of limbers accurately covering the guns and still farther back mr pierce could be heard shouting his orders for the alignment of the caissons in the twinkling of an eye the rush and thunder were stilled the battery without the twitch of a muscle stood ready for review and old brax sitting in saddle at the reviewing point watching the stirring sight with gloomy and cynical eye was chafed still more to hear in a silvery voice from the group of ladies the unwelcome words oh wasnt that pretty he meant with all his heart to pull in some of the plumage of those confounded woodpeckers as he called them before the day was over in grim silence therefore he rode along the front of the battalion taking little comfort in the neatness of their quaint oldfashioned garb the singlebreasted longskirted frockcoats the bulging black felt hats looped up on one side and decked with skimpy black feather the glistening shoulderscales and circular breastplates the polish of their black leather belts cartridgeand capboxes and bayonetscabbards it was all trim and soldierly but he was bottling up his sense of annoyance for the benefit of cram and his people yet what could he say neither he nor minor had ever before been brought into such relations with the light artillery and he simply didnt know where to hit lots of things looked queer but after this initial experience he felt it best to say nothing until he could light on a point that no one could gainsay and he found it in front of the left section where is mr waring sir he sternly asked i wish i knew colonel his horse came back without him as you doubtless saw and as he hasnt appeared im afraid of accident how did he come to leave his post sir i have no recollection of authorizing anything of the kind certainly not colonel he rode back to his quarters with my consent before adjutants call had sounded and he should have been with us again in abundant time that young gentleman needs more discipline than he is apt to receive at this rate captain cram and i desire that you pay closer attention to his movements than you have done in the past mr drake he said to his adjutant who was tripping around after his chief afoot call on mr waring to explain his absence in writing and without delay this indifference to duty is something to which i am utterly unaccustomed continued braxton again addressing cram who preserved a most uncompromising serenity of countenance and with this parting shot the colonel turned gruffly away and soon retook his station at the reviewing point then came the second hitch minor had had no experience whatever as has been said and he first tried to wheel into column of companies without closing ranks whereupon every captain promptly cautioned stand fast and thereby banished the last remnant of minors senses seeing that something was wrong he tried again this time prefacing with pass in review and still the captains were implacable the nearest one in a stage whisper tried to make the major hear close order first but all the time brax was losing more of his temper and minor what was left of his head and brax came down like the wolf on the fold gave the command to close order himself and was instantly echoed by crams powerful shout limber to the rear followed by pieces left about caissons forward then in the rumble and clank of the responding battery minors next command was heard by only the right wing of the battalion and the company wheels were ragged so was the next part of the performance when he started to march in review never waiting of course for the battery to wheel into column of sections this omission however in no wise disconcerted cram who following at rapid walk soon gained on the rear of column passing his post commander in beautiful order and with most accurate salute on the part of himself and officers and observing this minor took heart and recovering his senses to a certain extent gave the command guide left in abundant time to see that the new guides were accurately in trace thereby insuring what he expected to find a beautiful wheel into line to the left the commands for which movement he gave in louder and more confident tone but was instantly nonplussed by seeing the battery wheel into line to the right and move off in exactly the opposite direction from what he had expected this was altogether too much for his equanimity digging his spurs into the flanks of the astonished sorrel he darted off after cram waving his sword and shouting left into line wheel captain left into line wheel in vain mr pierce undertook to explain matters minor presumed that the artilleryman had made an actual blunder and was only enabled to correct it by a countermarch and so rode back to his position in front of the centre of the reforming line convinced that at last he had caught the battery commander when braxton therefore came down to make his criticisms and comments upon the conduct of the review minor was simply amazed to find that instead of being in error cram had gone exactly right and as prescribed by his drill regulations in wheeling to the right and gaining ground to the rear before coming up on the line he almost peevishly declared that he wished the colonel if he proposed having a combined review would assume command himself as he didnt care to be bothered with combination tactics of which he had never had previous knowledge being of the same opinion braxton himself took hold and the next performance though somewhat erroneous in many respects was a slight improvement on the first though braxton did not give time for the battery to complete one movement before he would rush it into another when the officers assembled to compare notes during the rest after the second repetition minor growled that this was a little better yet not good which led to some one suggesting in low tone that the major got his positives and comparatives worse mixed than his tactics and inquiring further whether it might not be well to dub him minor major the laughter that followed this sally naturally reached the ears of the seniors and so brax never let up on the command until the review went off without an error of any appreciable weight without in fact a hitch in the fut or an unhitch in the harse as doyle expressed it it was high noon when the battalion got back to barracks and the officers hung out their moist clothing to dry in the sun it was near one when the battery men officers and all came steaming up from the stables and there was the colonels orderly with the colonels compliments and desires to see captain cram before the big battery man had time to change his dress braxtons first performance on getting into cool habiliments was to go over to his office and hunt through the bookshelves for a volume in which he never before had felt the faintest interest the light artillery tactics of there on his desk lay a stack of mail unopened and mr drake was already silently inditing the summary note to the culprit waring brax wanted first to see with his own eyes the instructions for light artillery when reviewed with other troops vaguely hoping that there might still he some point on which to catch his foeman on the hip but if there were he did not find it he was tactician enough to see that even if cram had formed with his leading drivers on line with the infantry as braxton thought he should have done neither of the two methods of forming into battery would then have got his guns where they belonged crams interpretation of the text was backed by the custom of service and there was no use criticising it further and so after discontentedly hunting through the dustcovered pages awhile in hopes of stumbling on some codicil or rebuttal the colonel shut it with a disgusted snap and tossed the offending tome on the farthest table at that moment brax could have wished the board of officers who prepared the light artillery tactics in the nethermost depths of the neighboring swamp then he turned on his silent staff officer a not unusual expedient why on earth mr drake didnt you look up that point instead of making such a break before the whole command i couldnt find anything about it in casey sir anywhere replied the perturbed young man i didnt know where else to look well you might have asked mr ferry or mr pierce the lord knows you waste enough time with em you might have asked captain cram was what drake wanted to say but wisely did not he bit the end of his penholder instead and bridled his tongue and temper the next time i have a review with a mounted battery by george said the post commander finally bringing his fist down on the table with a crash i just wont have it he had brought down the pile of letters as well as his fist and drake sprang to gather them replacing them on the desk and dexterously slipping a papercutter under the flap of each envelope as he did so at the very first note he opened brax threw himself back in his chair with a long whistle of mingled amazement and concern then turned suddenly on his adjutant what became of mr waring he wasnt hurt not a bit sir that i know of he drove to town with captain crams team at least i was told so and left that note for you there sir he did left the post and left a note for me why but here braxton broke off short tore open the note and read my dear colonel i trust you will overlook the informality of my going to town without previously consulting you i had purposed of course asking your permission but the mishap that befell me in the runaway of my horse prevented my appearance at the review and had i waited your return from the field it would have compelled me to break my engagement with our friends the allertons under the circumstances i felt sure of your complaisance as i hope to drive miss allerton down after the matinйe might it not be a good idea to have dressparade and the band out they have seen the battery drills but are much more desirous of seeing the infantry most sincerely yours s g waring well for consummate impudence this beats the jews exclaimed brax orderly my compliments to captain cram and say i wish to see him at once if hes back from stables now as has been said cram had had no time to change to undress uniform but mrs cram had received the orderlys message had informed that martial mercury that the captain was not yet back from stables and that she would tell him at once on his return well she knew that mischief was brewing and her womans wit was already enlisted in behalf of her friend hurriedly pencilling a note she sent a messenger to her liege still busy with his horses to bid him come to her if only for a moment on his way to the office and when he came heated tired but bubbling over with eagerness to tell her of the fun they had been having with brax she met him with a cool tankard of shandygaff which he had learned to like in england among the horseartillery fellows and declared the very prince of drinks after active exercise in hot weather he quaffed it eagerly flung off his shako and kissed her gratefully and burst all at once into laughing narration of the mornings work but she checked him ned dear dont stop for that yet i know youre too full of tact to let colonel braxton see it was any fun for you and hes waiting at the office something tells me its about mr waring now put yourself in mr warings place of course he ought never to have made that engagement until he had consulted you but he never dreamed that there would be a review today and so he invited the allertons to breakfast with him at moreaus and go to the matinйe why that rascal ananias said it was to breakfast at the generals interrupted the battery commander well perhaps he was invited there too i believe i did hear something of that but he had made this arrangement with the allertons now of course if review were over at ten he could just about have time to dress and catch the elevenoclock car but that would make it very late and when bay billy broke away from ananias nobody could catch him for over half an hour mr ferry had taken the section mr waring wasnt needed and why ned when i drove in fearing to find him injured and saw him standing there the picture of consternation and despair and he told me about his engagement i said myself why dont you go now i told him it was what you surely would say if you were here neither of us thought the colonel would object so long as you approved and he wrote such a nice note why ned he only just had time to change his dress and drive up with jeffers with jeffers with my er our team and wagon well i like of course you like it you old darling shes such a dear girl though just a little bit gushing you know why i said certainly the team should go but ned heres what im afraid of mrs braxton saw it drive in at ninethirty just after billy ran away and she asked jeffers who was going and he told her mr waring and she has told the colonel ill wager now what you have got to do is to explain that to him so that he wont blame mr waring the dickens i have the most barefaced piece of impudence even sam waring was ever guilty of to me at least though ive no doubt hes done worse a dozen times why bless your heart nell how can i explain you might but but would you have me suppose my big soldier couldnt handle that matter as well as i no sir go and do it sir and mind you im going to invite them all up here to the gallery to hear the band play and have a cup of tea and a nibble when they come down this evening hes going to drive the allertons here worse and more of it why you conspiracy in petticoats youll be the ruin of me old brax is boiling over now if he dreams that waring has been taking liberties with him hell fetch him up so short exactly you mustnt let him you must tell him i sent him up with your team yours mind you to keep his engagement since it was impossible for him to come back to review ground of course he wouldnt expect him to appear afoot dont know about that nell i reckon thats the way hell order out the whole gang of us next time hes had his fill of mounted work today well if he should you be sure to acquiesce gracefully now whatsoever you do dont let him put mr waring in arrest while gwen allerton is here it would spoil everything oh matchmaking is it then ill try and so vexed but laughing half indignant yet wholly subordinate to the whim of his beloved better half the captain hastened over and found colonel braxton sitting with gloomy brow at his littered desk his annoyance of the morning evidently forgotten in matters more serious oh er cram come in come in man said he distractedly heres a matter i want to see you about its well just take that letter and read sit down sit down read and tell me what we ought to do about it and as crams blue eyes wandered over the written page they began to dilate he read from start to finish and then dropped his head into his hand his elbow on his knee his face full of perplexity and concern what do you think of it is there any truth and the colonel hesitated as to their being seen together perhaps as to the other the challenge i dont believe it well cram this is the second or third letter that has come to me in the same hand now you must see to it that he returns and doesnt quit the post until this matter is arranged ill attend to it sir was the answer and so that evening while waring was slowly driving his friends about the shaded roads under the glistening white pillars of the rows of officers quarters chatting joyously with them and describing the objects so strange to their eyes mrs crams little footpage came to beg that they should alight a few minutes and take a cup of tea they could not the allertons were engaged and it was necessary to drive back at once to town but they stopped for a moment to chat with their pretty hostess under the gallery and then a moment later as they rolled out of the resounding sallyport an orderly ran up saluted and slipped a note in warings hand it is immediate sir was his explanation ah miss allerton will you pardon me one moment said waring as he shifted whip and reins into the left hand and turned coolly up the levee road then with the right he forced open and held up the missive it only said whatsoever you do be here before taps tonight come direct to me and i will explain your friend cram all right said waring aloud my compliments to the captain and say ill be with him but even with this injunction he failed to appear midnight came without a word from waring and the morning dawned and found him absent still chapter iii it was one of sam warings oddities that like the hero of happy thoughts other peoples belongings seemed to suit him so much better than his own the most immaculately dressed man in the regiment he was never satisfied with the result of the efforts of the new york artists whom he favored with his custom and his criticism he would wear three or four times a new coat just received from that metropolis and spend not a little time when not on duty or in uniform in studying critically its cut and fit in the various mirrors that hung about his bachelor den gayly humming some operatic air as he conducted the survey and generally winding up with a wholesale denunciation of the cutter and an order to ananias to go over and get some other fellows coat that he might try the effect of that these were liberties he took only with his chums and intimates to be sure but they were liberties all the same and it was delicious to hear the laugh with which he would tell how pierce had to dress in uniform when he went up to the opera thursday night or how after he had worn ferrys stylish morning suit to make a round of calls in town and that young gentleman later on went up to see a pretty girl in whom he felt a growing interest her hateful little sister had come in and commented on his borrowing mr warings clothes no man in the battery would ever think of refusing sam the use of anything he possessed and there were half a dozen young fellows in the infantry who were just as ready to pay tribute to his whims nor was it among the men alone that he found such indulgence mrs cram had not known him a fortnight when with twinkling eyes and a betraying twitch about the corners of his mouth he appeared one morning to say he had invited some friends down to luncheon at the officers mess and the mess had no suitable china therefore he would thank her to send over hers also some tablecloths and napkins and forks and spoons when the fortysixth infantry were on their way to texas and the officers families were entertained overnight at the barracks and his rooms were to be occupied by the wife sister and daughters of captain craney waring sent the battery team and spring wagon to town with a note to mrs converse of the staff telling her the ladies had said so much about the lovely way her spare rooms were furnished that he had decided to draw on her for washbowls pitchers mosquitoframes nets and coverlets blankets pillows slips shams and anything else she might think of and mrs converse loaded up the wagon accordingly this was the more remarkable in her case because she was one of the women with whom he had never yet danced which was tantamount to saying that in the opinion of this social bashaw mrs converse was not considered a good partner and as the lady entertained very different views on that subject and was passionately fond of dancing she had resented not a little the line thus drawn to her detriment she not only loaned however all he asked for but begged to be informed if there were not something more she could do to help entertain his visitors waring sent her some lovely flowers the next week but failed to take her out even once at the staff german mrs cram was alternately aghast and delighted at what she perhaps justly called his incomparable impudence they were coming out of church together one lovely morning during the winter there was a crowd in the vestibule street dresses were then worn looped yet there was a sudden sound of rip rent and tear and a portly woman gathered up the trailing skirt of a costly silken gown and whirled with annihilation in her eyes upon the owner of the offending foot that is far too elegant a skirt to be worn unlooped madame said mrs crams imperturbable escort in his most suave and dulcet tones lifting a glossy silk hat and bowing profoundly and mrs cram laughed all the way back to barracks at the recollection of the utter discomfiture in the womans face these are mere specimen bricks from the fabric which waring had builded in his few months of artillery service the limits of the story are all too contracted to admit of extended detail so without further expansion it may be said that when he drove up to town on this eventful april day in crams wagon and larkins hat and ferrys hatfield clothes with pierces precious london umbrella by his side and mertons watch in his pocket he was as stylish and presentable a fellow as ever issued from a battery barrack and jeffers crams english groom mutely approved the general appearance of his prime favorite among the officers at the post at most of whom he opened his eyes in cockney amaze and critically noted the skill with which mr waring tooled the spirited bays along the levee road nearly a mile above the barracks midway between the long embankment to their left and the tall white picket fence surmounted by the olivegreen foliage of magnolias and orangetrees on the other hand they had come upon a series of deep mudholes in the way where the seepagewater from the rapidlyrising flood was turning the roadway into a pond stuck helplessly in the mud an oldfashioned cabriolet was halted its driver was out and up to his knees thrashing vainly at his straining staggering horse the tortuous roadway was blocked but waring had been up and down the riverbank too many times both day and night to be daunted by a matter so trivial he simply cautioned jeffers to lean well over the inner wheel guided his team obliquely up the slope of the levee and drove quietly along its level top until abreast the scene of the wreck one glance into the interior of the cab caused him suddenly to stop to pass the reins back to jeffers to spring down the slope until he stood at the edge of the sea of mud here he raised his hat and cried madame lascelles madame this is indeed lucky for me let me get you out at his call a slender graceful woman who was gazing in anxiety and dismay from the opposite side of the cab and pleading with the driver not to beat his horse turned suddenly and a pair of lovely dark eyes lighted up at sight of his face her pallor too gave instant place to a warm flush a pretty child at her side clapped her little hands and screamed with delight maman maman cest msieu vayreeng cest saam oh monsieur wareeng im so glad youve come do speak to that man it is horrible the way he beat that poor horse mais non nin nin she cried reproving the child now stretching forth her little arms to her friend and striving to rise and leap to him id like to know how in hell im to get this cab out of such a hole as this if i dont beat him exclaimed the driver roughly then once more dash blank dash your infernal hide ill learn you to balk with me again then down came more furious lashes on the quivering hide and the poor tortured brute began to back thereby placing the frail fourwheeler in imminent danger of being upset steady there hold your hand sir dont strike that horse again just stand at his head a moment and keep quiet till i get these ladies out called waring in tone quiet yet commanding ill get em out myself in my own way if theyll only stop their infernal yellin was the coarse reply oh monsieur wareeng exclaimed the lady in undertone the man has been drinking i am sure he has been so rude in his language waring waited for no more words looking quickly about him he saw a plank lying on the levee slope this he seized thrust one end across the muddy hole until it rested in the cab stepped lightly across took the child in his arms bore her to the embankment and set her down then sprang back for her young mother who trembling slightly rose and took his outstretched hand just as another lash fell on the horses back and another lurch followed waring caught at the cabrail with one hand threw the other arm about her slender waist and fairly lifting little madame over the wheel sprang with her to the shore and in an instant more had carried her speechless and somewhat agitated to the top of the levee now said he let me drive you and nin nin wherever you were going is it to market or church mais non to bonne mamans of whom it is the fкte cried the eager little one despite her mothers stern orders of silence look she exclaimed showing her dainty little legs and feet in creamy silken hose and kid it was bonne maman explained madame who had ordered the cab from town for them never dreaming of the condition of the river road or suspecting that of the driver so much the happier for me laughed waring take the front seat jeffers now nin nin ma fleurette up with you and the delighted child was lifted to her perch in the stylish trap she had so often admired now madame he continued extending his hand but madame hung back hesitant and blushing oh monsieur wareeng i cannot i must not is it not that some one shall extricate the cab no one from this party at least laughed waring mischievously making the most of her idiomatic query your driver is more cochon than cocher and if he drowns in that mud twill only serve him right like your famous compatriot hell have a chance to say i will drown and no one shall help me for all i care the brute allons i will drive you to bonne mamans of whom it is the fкte bless that baby daughter and madame dhervilly shall bless nin nins tout dйvouй sam and madame lascelles found further remonstrance useless she was lifted into the seat by which time the driver drunken and truculent had waded after them whos to pay for this was his surly question you i fancy as soon as your employer learns of your driving into that hole was warings cool reply well by god i want five dollars for my fare and trouble and i want it right off and whip in hand the burly mudcovered fellow came lurching up the bank across the boggy street beyond the white picket fence the green blinds of a chamber window in an oldfashioned southern house were thrown open and two feminine faces peered forth interested spectators of the scene here my man said waring in low tone you have earned no five dollars and you know it get your cab out come to madame dhervillys where you were called and whatever is your due will be paid you but no more of this swearing or threatening not another word of it i want my money i say and i mean to have it im not talking to you im talking to the lady that hired me but i have not the money it is for my mother madame dhervilly to pay you will come there i want it now i say ive got to hire teams to get my cab out i got stalled here carrying you and your child and i mean to have my pay right now or ill know the reason why your swell friends got the money its none of my business how you pay him but that ended the colloquy warings fist landed with resounding whack under the cabmans jaw and sent him rolling down into the mud below he was up floundering and furious in less than a minute cursing horribly and groping in the pocket of his overcoat its a pistol lieutenant look out cried jeffers there was a flash a sharp report a stifled cry from the cab a scream of terror from the child but waring had leaped lightly aside and before the halfdrunken brute could cock his weapon for a second shot he was felled like a log and the pistol wrested from his hand and hurled across the levee another blow crashed full in his face as he strove to find his feet and this time his muddled senses warned him it were best to lie still two minutes more when he lifted his battered head and strove to stanch the blood streaming from his nostrils he saw the team driving briskly away up the crest of the levee and overcome by maudlin contemplation of his foemans triumph and his own wretched plight the cabman sat him down and wept aloud and to his succor presently there came ministering angels from across the muddy way one with a brogue the other in a bandanna and between the two he was escorted across a dry path to the magnoliafringed enclosure comforted with soothing applications without and within and encouraged to tell his tale of woe that he should wind it up with vehement expression of his ability to thrash a thousand swells like the one who had abused him and a piratical prophecy that hed drink his hearts blood within the week was due not so much to confidence in his own powers perhaps as to the strength of the whiskey with which he had been liberally supplied then the lady of the house addressed her ethiop maidofallwork go you over to anatoles now louette tell him if any of the byes are there i wahnt um if dawson is there from the adjutants office i wahnt him quick tell him its mrs doyle and never mind if hes been dhrinkin he shall have another dhrop here and at her beck there presently appeared three or four besottedlooking specimens in the coarse undress uniform of the day poor devils absent without leave from their post below and hoping only to be able to beg or steal whiskey enough to stupefy them before the patrol should come and drag them away to the guardhouse promise of liberal reward in shape of liquor was sufficient to induce three of their number to go out with the fuming cabman and help rescue his wretched brute and trap the moment they were outside the gate she turned on the fourth a pallid sickly man whose features were delicate whose hands were white and slender and whose whole appearance despite glassy eyes and tremulous mouth and limbs told the pathetic story of better days youre off agin are you sure i heerd so and youre mad for a dhrink now can ye write dawson or must i brace you up furrst an imploring look an unsteady gesture alone answered here thin wait its absinthe ye need my buck go you into that room now and wash yourself and ill bring it and whin the others come back for their whiskey ill tell um youve gone youre to do what i say now and doyle will see you trough if not its back to that hell in the guardhouse youll go my word on it oh for gods sake mrs doyle began the poor wretch imploringly but the woman shut him off in there wid you the others are coming and unbarring the front door she presently admitted the trio returning to claim the fruits of their honest labor is he gone did he tell you what happened hes gone yes answered one hes gone to get square with the lieutenant and his cockney dogrobber he says they both jumped on him and kicked his face in when he was down and unarmed and helpless was he lyin oh they bate him cruel but did he tell you of the lady who it was they took from him why sure the wife of that old frenchman lascelles that lives below her the lieutenants been sparkin this three months the very wan mind ye replied the lady of the house with significant emphasis and glance from her bleary eyes the very wan she finished with slow nodding accompaniment of the frowzy head and thats the kind of gintlemen that undertakes to hold up their heads over soldiers like doyle here byes dhrink now but be off aginst his coming hell be here any minute take this to comfort ye but kape still about this till ye see me agin or doyle now run and with scant ceremony the dreary party was hustled out through a paved courtyard to a gateway opening on a side street houses were few and scattering so far below the heart of the city the narrow strip of land between the great river and the swamp was cut up into walled enclosures as a rule abandoned warehouses and cottonpresses mossgrown onestoried frame structures standing in the midst of desolate fields and decrepit fences only among the peaceful shades of the ursuline convent and the warlike flanking towers at the barracks was there aught that spoke of anything but demoralization and decay back from the levee a block or two the double lines of strapiron stretched over a wooden causeway between parallel wet ditches gave evidence of some kind of a railway on which at rare intervals jogged a sleepy mule with a sleepier driver and a musty old rattletrap of a car a car butting up against the animals lazy hocks and rousing him occasionally to ringing and retaliatory kicks around the barracks the buildings were closer mainly in the way of saloons then came a milelong northward stretch of track with wet fields on either side fringed along the river by solid structures and walled enclosures that told of days more prosperous than those which so closely followed the war it was to one of these graceless drinkingshops and into the hands of a rascally dago known as anatole that mrs doyle commended her trio of allies and being rid of them she turned back to her prisoner their erstwhile companion absinthe wrought its work on his meek and pliant spirit and the shaking hand was nerved to do the womans work at her dictation with such corrections as his better education suggested two letters were draughted and with these in her hand she went aloft in fifteen minutes she returned placed one of these letters in an envelope already addressed to monsieur armand lascelles no rue royale the other she handed to dawson it was addressed in neat and delicate feminine hand to colonel braxton jackson barracks now dawson ye cant see her this day and she dont want ye till you can come over here sober off wid ye now to barracks theyre all out at inspection yet and will be for an hour lay this wid the colonels mail on his desk and thin go you to your own come to me this afthernoon for more dhrink if ye can tell me what he said and did when he read it no no more liquor now thatll brace ye till dinnertime and more would make ye dhrunk miserably he plodded away down the levee while she his ruler throwing on a huge dirty white sunbonnet followed presently in his tracks and shadowed him until she saw him safely reach the portals of the barracks after one or two fruitless scouts into wayside bars in hope of finding some one to treat or trust him to a drink then retracing her steps a few blocks she rang sharply at the lattice gate opening into a cool and shaded enclosure beyond which could be seen the whitepillared veranda of a long low southern homestead a grinning negro boy answered the summons its you is it alphonse is your mistress at home no gone town chez madame dhervilly madame devillease is it very well you skip to town wid that note and get it in your masters hands before the cathedral clock strikes twelve or yell suffer theres a car in tree minutes and then well content with her mornings work the consort of the senior first lieutenant of light battery x a dame whose credentials were too clouded to admit of her reception or recognition within the limits of a regular garrison where indeed to do him justice mr doyle never wished to see her or for that matter anywhere else betook herself to the magnoliashaded cottage where she dwelt beyond the pale of military interference and some hours later sent louette to say to doyle she wanted him and doyle obeyed in his relief at finding the colonel had probably forgotten the peccadillo for which he expected punishment in blissful possession of mr warings sittingroom and supplies now that waring was absent the big irishman was preparing to spend the time in drinking his juniors health and whiskey and discoursing upon the enormity of his misconduct with all comers when ananias entered and informed him there was a lady below who wished to see him lady being the euphemism of the lately enfranchised for the females of their race it was louette with the mandate from her mistress a mandate he dared not disregard say ill be along in a minute was his reply but he sighed and swore heavily as he slowly reascended the stair give me another dhrink smut he ordered ananias disregarding ferrys suggestion better drink no more till after dark then swallowing his potion he went lurching down the steps without another word ferry and pierce stepped to the gallery and gazed silently after him as he veered around to the gate leading to the old warhospital enclosure where the battery was quartered already his walk was perceptibly unsteady keeps his head pretty well even after his legs are gone said ferry knows too much to go by the sallyport hes sneaking out through the back gate why what does he go out there for when he has the run of warings sideboard oh didnt you hear mrs doyle sent for him thats it is it sometimes i wonder which one of those two will kill the other oh he wouldnt dare that fellow is an abject coward in the dark he believes in ghosts spooks banshees and wraiths everything uncanny and shed haunt him if he laid his hands on her theres only one thing that hed be more afraid of than bridget doyle living and that would be bridget doyle dead why cant he get rid of her what hold has she on him this things an infernal scandal as it stands shes only been here a month or so and everybody in garrison knows all about her and these doughboys dont make any bones about chaffing us on our lady friends well everybody supposed he had got rid of her years ago he shook her when he was made first sergeant just before the war why ive heard some of the old stagers say there wasnt a finerlooking soldier in all the regiment than jim doyle when he married that specimen at brownsville doyle too supposed she was dead until after he got his commission then she reappeared and laid claim to him it would have been an easy enough matter five years ago to prove she had forfeited all rights but now he cant then shes got some confounded hold on him i dont know what but its killing the poor beggar good thing for the regiment though so let it go oh i dont care a rap how soon were rid of him or her the sooner the better only i hate to hear these fellows laughing and sneering about mrs doyle and here the young fellow hesitated ferry you know im as fond of sam waring as any of you i liked him better than any man in his class when we wore the gray when they were yearlings we were plebes and devilled and tormented by them most unmercifully day and night i took to him then for his kindly jolly ways no one ever knew him to say or do a cross or brutal thing i liked him more every year and missed him when he was graduated i rejoiced when he got his transfer to us its because i like him so much that i hate to hear these fellows making their little flings now what flings said ferry well you know as much as i do youve heard as much too i havent a doubt nobodys said anything about sam waring in my hearing that reflected on him in any way worth speaking of said ferry yet not very stoutly not on him so much perhaps as the world looks at this sort of thing but on her shes young pretty married to a man years her senior a snuffy frowzy old frenchman shes alone with her child and one or two servants from early morning till late evening and with that weazened little monkey of a man the rest of the time the only society she sees is the one or two gossipy old women of both sexes who live along the levee here the only enjoyment she has is when she can get to her mothers up in town or run up to the opera when she can get lascelles to take her that old mummy cares nothing for music and still less for the dance she loves both and so does waring monsieur le mari goes out into the foyer between the acts to smoke his cigarette and gossip with other relics like himself waring has never missed a night she happened to be there for the last six weeks i admit he is there many a time when she is not but after hes had a few words with the ladies in the generals box what becomes of him i dont know because im seldom there but dryden and taggart and jack merton of the infantry can tell you he is sitting by her in the dhervilly loge grillйe and going over the last act with her and rhapsodizing about verdi bellini mozart or gounod gounod especially and the gardenscene from faust isnt her mother with her and being in mourning doesnt she have to stay in her latticed loge instead of promenading in the foyer and drinking that twoheadachesforapicayune punch queried ferry eager for a diversion suppose she is answered pierce stoutly im a crank straitlaced if you like its the fault of my bringing up but i know and you know that that little woman in her loneliness and in her natural longing for some congenial spirit to commune with is simply falling madly in love with sam waring and there will be tragedy here before we can stop it see here pierce asked ferry do you suppose mrs cram would be so loyal a friend to waring if she thought there was anything wrong in his attentions to madame lascelles do you suppose cram himself wouldnt speak he has spoken he has to whom to me three days ago said i had known waring longest and best perhaps was his most intimate friend and he thought i ought to warn him of what people were saying what have you done nothing yet simply because i know sam waring so well that i know just what hed do go and pull the nose of the man who gossiped about him and her then wed have a fight on our hands well we can fight i suppose cant we not without involving a womans name oh good lord pierce was there ever a row without a woman au fond thats a wormeaten witticism ferry and youre too decent a fellow as a rule to be cynical ive got to speak to waring and i dont know how to do it i want your advice well my advice is punchs dont hello heres dryden thought you were on court duty up at headquarters today old man come in and have a wet mr ferry had seen some happy days at fortress monroe when the ships of her majestys navy lay off the hygeia and the gallants of england lay to at the bar and ferry rejoiced in the vernacular of the united service so far as he could learn it as practised abroad thanks just had one over at mertons hear youve been having review and all that sort of thing down here said the infantryman as he lolled back in an easychair and planted his bootheels on the gallery rail glad i got out of it court met and adjourned at ten so i came home howd waring get off huh crams wagon laughed ferry rather uncomfortably however oh lord yes i know that didnt i see him driving madame lascelles up rampart street as i came down in the mulecar and then pierce and ferry looked at each other startled that evening therefore it was a comfort to both when sam came tooling the stylish turnout through the sallyport and his battery chums caught sight of the allertons pierce was just returning from stables and ferry was smoking a pipe of perique on the broad gallery and both hastened to don their best jackets and doff their best caps to these interesting and interested callers cram himself had gone off for a ride and a think he always declared his ideas were clearer after a gallop the band played charmingly the ladies came out and made a picturesque croquetparty on the green carpet of the parade the officers clustered about and offered laughing wagers on the game a dozen romping children were playing joyously around the tall flagstaff the air was rich with the fragrance of the magnolia and cape jasmine and glad with music and soft and merry voices then the stirring bugles rang out their lively summons to the batterymen beyond the wall the drums of the infantry rolled and rattled their echoing clamor the guard sprang into ranks and their muskets glistening in the slanting beams of the setting sun clashed in simultaneous present to the redsashed officer of the day and that official raised his plumed hat to the lieutenant with the lovely girl by his side and the smiling elders on the back seat as the team once more made the circuit of the post on the back trip to town and miss flora allerton clasped her hands and looked enthusiastically up into her escorts face oh she cried isnt it all just too lovely for anything why i think your life here must be like a dream but miss allerton as mrs cram had said sometimes gushed and life at jackson barracks was no such dream as it appeared the sun went down red and angry far across the tawny flood of the rushing river the night lights were set at the distant bend below the stars came peeping through a shifting filmy veil the big trees on the levee and about the flanking towers began to whisper and complain and creak and the rising wind sent long wisps of straggly cloud racing across the sky the moon rose pallid and wan hung for a while over the dense black mass of mossgrown cypress in the eastward swamp then hid her face behind a heavy bank of clouds as though reluctant to look upon the wrath to come for a storm was rising fast and furious to break upon and deluge old jackson barracks chapter iv when jeffers came driving into barracks on his return from town his first care as became the trained groom was for his horses and he was rubbing them down and bedding their stalls for the night when the sergeant of the battery guard lantern in hand appeared at the door it was not yet tattoo but by this time the darkness was intense the heavens were hid and the wind was moaning about the stables and gunshed and whistling away over the dismal expanse of flat wet ditchtangled fields towards the swamp but the cockneys spirits were blithe as the clouds were black as was usual when he or any other servitor was in attendance on waring the reward had been munificent he had lunched at cassidys at the lieutenants expense while that officer and his friends were similarly occupied at the more exclusive moreaus he had stabled the team at the quartermasters while he had personally attended the matinйe at the st charles which was more to his taste than booth and high tragedy he had sauntered about the tattersalls and smoked warings cigars and patronized the jockeys gathered there for the spring meeting on the metairie but promptly on time was awaiting the return of the party from their drive and lolling about the ladies entrance to the st charles hotel when he became aware as the lamps were being lighted and the dusk of the evening gave place to lively illumination that two men had passed and repassed the open portals several times and that they were eying him curiously and chattering to each other in french one of them he presently recognized as the little frogeater who occupied the old house on the levee lascelles the husband of the pretty frenchwoman he and the lieutenant had dragged out of the mud that very morning and had driven up to the old dhervilly place on rampart street even as he was wondering how cabby got out of his scrape and chuckling with satisfaction over the scientific manner in which mr waring had floored that worthy mr jeffers was surprised to find himself most civilly accosted by old lascelles who had been informed he said by madame his wife of the heroic services rendered her that morning by monsieur jeffers and monsieur le capitaine he begged of the former the acceptance of the small douceur which he slipped into the englishmans accustomed palm and inquired when he might hope to see the brave captain and disembarrass himself of his burden of gratitude here they come now said jeffers promptly pocketing the money and springing forward to knuckle his hatbrim and stand at the horses heads all grace and animation mr waring had assisted his friends to alight had promised to join them in the ladies parlor in ten minutes had sprung to the seat again signalling jeffers to tumble up behind and then had driven rapidly away through carondelet street to the broad avenue beyond here he tossed the reins to jeffers disappeared a moment and came back with a little indianmade basket filled to overflowing with exquisite double violets rich with fragrance give this to mrs cram for me and tell the captain ill drop in to thank him in a couple of hours and here jeffers he said and jeffers had pocketed another greenback and had driven briskly homeward well content with the result of his days labors and without having mentioned to mr waring the fact that lascelles had been at the hotel making inquiries for him a day so profitable and so pleasant jeffers had not enjoyed since his arrival at the barracks and he was humming away in high good humor all reckless of the rising storm when the gruff voice of sergeant schwartz disturbed him chevvers you will rebort at vonst to captain cram who says i will said jeffers cheerfully though bent on mischief but was awed into instant silence at seeing that veteran step quickly back stand attention and raise his hand in salute for there came cram himself pierce with him did mr waring come back with you was the first question no sir hi left mr warink on canal street e said ed be back to thank the captin in a little while sir and e sent these for the captins lady cram took the beautiful basket of violets with dubious hand though his eyes kindled when he noted their profusion and fragrance nell loved violets and it was like waring to remember so bountifully her fondness for them what detained him did he send no word e said nothink and sent nothink but the basket sir e said a couple of hours now i think of it sir e was going back to the otel to dine with a lady and gent for a moment cram was silent he glanced at pierce as much as to say have you no question to ask but the youngster held his peace the senior officer hated to inquire of his servant into the details of the days doings he was more than half indignant at waring for having taken such advantage of even an implied permission as to drive off with his equipage and groom in so summary a way of course nell had said take it and go but nell could have had no idea of the use to which the wagon was to be put if waring left the garrison with the intention of using the equipage to take madame lascelles driving it was the most underhand and abominable thing he had ever heard of his doing it was unlike him it couldnt be true yet had not braxton shown him the letter which said he was seen on the levee with her by his side had not dryden further informed every man and woman and child with whom he held converse during the day that he had seen waring with crams team driving madame lascelles up rampart street and was not there a story already afloat that old lascelles had forbidden him ever to darken his threshold again forbidden madame to drive dance or even speak with him and was there not already in the post commanders hand a note intimating that monsieur lascelles would certainly challenge waring to instant and mortal combat if waring had used the wagon as alleged jeffers must know about it and could and should tell if required but cram simply could not and would not ask the groom to detail the movements of the gentleman had not waring sent word he would be home in two hours and would come to see his battery commander at once did not that mean he would explain fully cram gulped down the query that rose to his lips all right then pierce well take these over to mrs cram and have a bite ready for waring on his return said the stouthearted fellow and in refusing to question his servant missed the chance of averting catastrophe and so they bore the beautiful cluster of violets with its mute pledge of fidelity and full explanation to his rejoicing nell and the trio sat and chatted and one or two visitors came in for a while and then scurried home as the rain began to plash on the windows and the bugles and drums and fifes sounded far away at tattoo and more than usually weird and mournful at taps and finally tenthirty came by which time it had been raining torrents and the wind was lashing the roaring river into foam and the trees were bowing low before their master and the levee road was a quagmire and cram felt convinced no cab could bring his subaltern home yet in his nervousness and anxiety he pulled on his boots threw his gum coat over his uniform tiptoed in to bend over nells sleeping form and whisper should she wake that he was going only to the sallyport or perhaps over to warings quarters but she slept peacefully and never stirred so noiselessly he slipped out on the gallery and down the stairs and stalked boldly out into the raging storm guided by the dim light burning in warings room ananias was sleeping curled up on a rug in front of the open fireplace and cram stirred him up with his foot the negro rolled lazily over with a stretch and yawn did mr waring take any arms with him queried the captain any whut suh responded ananias rubbing his eyes and still only half awake any pistol or knife lord suh no mr waring dont never carry anything o dat sort a studentlamp was burning low on the centretable there lay among the books and papers a couple of letters evidently received that day and still unopened there lay warings cigarcase a pretty trifle given him by some faraway friend with three or four fragrant havanas temptingly visible there lay a late magazine its pages still uncut cram looked at the dainty wall clock ticking merrily away over the mantel eleventhirtyfive well he was too anxious to sleep anyhow why not wait a few minutes waring might come probably would come if no cab could make its way down by the levee road there were the late cars from town they had to make the effort anyhow cram stepped to the sideboard mixed a mild toddy sipped it reflectively then lighted a cigar and threw himself into the easychair ananias meantime was up and astir seeing that cram was looking about in search of a papercutter the boy stepped forward and bent over the table de lieutenant always uses dis suh said he lifting first one paper then another searching under each dont seem to be yer now suh youve seen it dough captain dat crosshandled dagger wid de straight blade yes i know where is it asked cram thatll do taint yer suh now cant find it yer nohow well then mr waring probably took a knife after all no suh i dont tink so i never knowed him to use it befo away from de room anybody else been here said cram oh dey was all in yer suh dis arternoon but mr doyle he was sent for suh and had to go a step and the rattle of a sword were heard on the gallery without the door opened and in came merton of the infantry officer of the day hello waring he began oh its you is it captain isnt waring back i saw the light and came up to chin with him a moment beastly night isnt it waring isnt back yet i look for him by the eleventhirty car answered the captain why thats in no waring there but half a dozen poor devils half drowned and half drunk moren half drunk one of your men among em we had to put him into the guardhouse to keep him from murdering dawson the headquarters clerk theres been some kind of a row sorry to hear that who is the man kane he said dawson was lying about his officer and he wouldnt stand it kane exclaimed cram rising why hes one of our best i never heard of his being riotous before hes riotous enough tonight he wanted to lick all six of our fellows and if i hadnt got there when i did they would probably have kicked him into a pulp all were drunk kane too i should say and as for dawson he was just limp would you mind going down and letting me talk with kane a moment i never knew him to be troublesome before though he sometimes drank a little he was on pass this evening well its raining cats and dogs captain but come along if you can stand it i can a few minutes later the sergeant of the guard threw open one of the wooden compartments in the guardhouse and there sat kane his face buried in his hands i ordered him locked in here by himself because i feared our fellows would hammer him if he were turned in with them explained mr merton and at sound of the voice the prisoner looked up and saw his commander dripping with wet unsteadily he rose to his feet captain he began thickly id never have done it in the world sir but that blackguard was drunk sir and slandering my officer and i gave him fair warning to quit or id hit him but he kept on yees and what did he say he said i wouldnt believe it sir that mr doyle was that drunk that him and some other fellers had lifted him out of the mud and put him to bed up there at up there at the house sir back of anatoles place i think the captain knows ah you should have steered clear of such company kane did this happen at anatoles saloon yes sir and them fellers was making so much noise that the dago turned them all out and shut up the shop at eleven oclock and thats what made them follow me home in the car and abuse me all the way i couldnt stand it sir you would only have laughed at them if your better judgment hadnt been ruined by liquor sorry for you kane but youve been drinking just enough to be a nuisance and must stay where you are for the night theyll be sorry for what they said in the morning did you lock up the others mr merton he asked as they turned away all but dawson sir i took him over to the hospital and put a sentry over him that fellow looks to be verging on jimjams and i wouldnt be surprised if hed been talking as kane says merton might have added and its probably true but courtesy to his battery friend forbade cram did add mentally something to the same effect but loyalty to his arm of the service kept him silent at the flagstaff the two officers stopped merton oblige me by saying nothing as to the alleged language about doyle will you certainly captain goodnight then as the officer of the days lantern flickered away in one direction cram turned in the other and presently went climbing up the stairs to the gallery leading to the quarters of his senior first lieutenant a dim light was shining through the shutters cram knocked at the door no answer opening it he glanced in the room was unoccupied a cheap marine clock ticking between the north windows over the washstand indicated midnight and the battery commander turned away in vexation of spirit lieutenant doyle had no authority to be absent from the post it was still dark and storming furiously when the bugles of the battery sounded the reveille and by the light of the swinging lanterns the men marched away in their canvas stable rig looking like a column of ghosts yet despite the gale and the torrents of rain pierce was in no wise surprised to find cram at his elbow when the horses were led out to water groom indoors this morning mr pierce is waring home no sir ananias told me when he brought me up my coffee hold the morning report then until i come to the office i fear we have both first lieutenants to report absent today you and i may have to go to town so get your breakfast early we will ride i doubt if even an ambulance could get through tell me pierce have you spoken to waring about about that matter we were discussing has he ever given you any idea that he had received warning of any kind from old lascelles or any of his friends no sir ive had no chance to speak to be sure and so far as i could observe he and mr lascelles seemed on very excellent terms only a few days ago well i wish i had spoken myself said cram and turned away that morning with two first lieutenants absent without leave the report of light battery x went into the adjutants office just as its commander and his junior subaltern went out and silently mounted the dripping horses standing in front the two orderlies with their heads poked through the slit of their ponchos briskly seated themselves in saddle and then the colonel hurried forth just in time to hail oh cram one minute and cram reined about and rode to the side of the post commander who stood under the shelter of the broad gallery i wouldnt say anything about this to any one at headquarters except reynolds theres no one else on the staff to whom waring would apply is there no one sir reynolds is the only man i can think of will you send an orderly back with word as soon as you know yes sir the moment i hear andd shall i send you word from there and cram nodded northward and then in a lower tone as to doyle oh damn doyle i dont care if he never but here the commander of the post regained control of himself and with parting wave of the hand turned back to his office riding in single file up the levee for the city road was one long pool with the swollen river on their left and the slanting torrents of rain obscuring all objects on the other hand the party made its way for several squares without exchanging a word presently the leading file came opposite the high wall of the lascelles place the green latticed gate stood open an unusual thing and both officers bent low over their pommels and gazed along the dark rainswept alley to the pillared portico dimly seen beyond not a soul was in sight the water was already on a level with the banquette and would soon be running across and into the gate a vagabond dog skulking about the place gave vent to a mournful howl a sudden thought struck the captain he led the way down the slope and forded across to the north side the others following joyce said he to his orderly dismount and go in there and ring at the door ask if mr lascelles is home if not ask if madame has any message she would like to send to town or if we can be of any service the soldier was gone but a moment and came hurrying back a negro boy holding a long fold of matting over his head to shed the rain chasing at his heels it was alphonse msieu not yet of return said he in labored translation of his negro french and madame remain chez madame dhervilly i am alone wiz my mudder and she has fear oh its all right i fancy said cram reassuringly they were caught by the storm and wisely stayed uptown i saw your gate open so we stopped to inquire well ride over to madame dhervillys and ask for them how came your gate open mo connais pas i dunno sare it was lock last night why thats odd said cram better bolt it now or all the cattle along the levee will be in there you cant lock out the water though who had the key besides mr lascelles or madame nobody sare but there is muddy foots all over the piazza the devil ill have to look in for a moment a nod to pierce brought him too from the saddle and the officers handed their reins to the orderlies then together they entered the gate and strode up the white shell walk looking curiously about them through the dripping shrubbery again that dismal howl was raised and pierce stopping with impatient exclamation tore half a brick from the yielding border of the walk and sent it hurtling through the trees with his tail between his legs the brute darted from behind a sheltering bush scurried away around the corner of the house glancing fearfully back then halting at safe distance squatted on his haunches and lifted up his mournful voice again whose dog is that demanded cram msieu philippes he not now here he is de brudder to monsieur at the steps the captain bent and closely examined them and the floor of the low veranda to which they led both were disfigured with muddy footprints pierce would have gone still further in the investigation but his senior held up a warning hand two men have been here he muttered they have tried the door and tried the blinds where did you sleep last night boy and with the words he turned suddenly on the negro did you hear no sound no sare i sleep in my bed way back no i hear noting noting and now the negros face was twitching his eyes staring something in the soldiers stern voice told him that there was tragedy in the air if this door is locked go round and open it from within said cram briefly then as alphonse disappeared around the north side he stepped back to the shell walk and followed one of its branches around the other an instant later pierce heard him call hastening in his wake the youngster came upon his captain standing under a window one of whose blinds was hanging partly open water standing in pools all around him look here was all he said and pointed upward the sill was above the level of their heads but both could see that the sash was raised all was darkness within come with me was crams next order and the lieutenant followed alphonse was unlocking the front door and now threw it open cram strode into the wide hallway straight to a door of the east side it was locked open this alphonse he said i have not the key it is ever with msieu lascelles it is his library cram stepped back gave one vigorous kick with a heavy ridingboot and the frail door flew open with a crash for a moment the darkness was such that no object could be distinguished within the negro servant hung back trembling from some indefinable dread the captain his hand on the doorknob stepped quickly into the gloomy apartment pierce close at his heels a broad flattopped desk stood in the centre of the room some shelves and books were dimly visible against the wall some of the drawers of the desk were open and there was a litter of papers on the desk and others were strown in the big rattan chair some on the floor two studentlamps could be dimly distinguished one on the big desk another on a little readingtable placed not far from the south window whose blinds half open admitted almost the only light that entered the room with its head near this readingtable and faintly visible a bamboo lounge stretched its length towards the southward windows where all was darkness and something vague and indistinguishable lay extended upon the lounge cram marched halfway across the floor then stopped short glanced down and stepped quickly to one side shifting his heavilybooted feet as though to avoid some such muddy pool as those encountered without take care he whispered and motioned warningly to pierce come here and open these shutters alphonse were the next words but once again that prolonged dismal mournful howl was heard under the south window and the negro seized with uncontrollable panic turned back and clung trembling to the opposite wall send one of the men for the post surgeon at once then come back here said the captain and pierce hastened to the gate as he returned the west shutters were being thrown open there was light when he reentered the room and this was what he saw on the china matting running from underneath the sofa fed by heavy drops from above a dark wet stain on the lounge stretched at full length a stiffening human shape a yellowwhite parchmentlike face above the black clothing a bluish halfopened mouth whose yellow teeth showed savagely a fallen chin and jaw covered with the gray stubble of unshaved beard and two staring sightless ghastly eyes fixed and upturned as though in agonized appeal stonedead murdered doubtless all that was left of the little frenchman lascelles chapter v all that day the storm raged in fury the levee road was blocked in places by the boughs torn from overhanging trees and here there and everywhere turned into a quagmire by the torrents that could find no adequate egress to the northward swamps for over a mile above the barracks it looked like one vast canal and by nine oclock it was utterly impassable no cars were running on the dilapidated road to the halfway house whatever they might be doing beyond there was only one means of communication between the garrison and the town and that on horseback along the crest of the levee and people in the secondstory windows of the storeand dwellinghouses along the other side of the way driven aloft by the drenched condition of the ground floor were surprised to see the number of times some yankee soldier or other made the dismal trip cram with a party of four was perhaps the first before the dripping sentries of the old guard were relieved at nine oclock every man and woman at the barracks was aware that foul murder had been done during the night and that old lascelles slain by some unknown hand slashed and hacked in a dozen places according to the stories afloat lay in his gloomy old library up the levee road with a flood already a foot deep wiping out from the grounds about the house all traces of his assailants dr denslow in examining the body found just one deep downward stab entering above the upper rib and doubtless reaching the heart a stab made by a long straight sharp twoedged blade he had been dead evidently some hours when discovered by cram who had now gone to town to warn the authorities old brax meantime having taken upon himself the responsibility of placing a guard at the house with orders to keep alphonse and his mother in and everybody else out it is hardly worth while to waste time on the various theories advanced in the garrison as to the cause and means of the dreadful climax that doyle should be away from the post provoked neither comment nor speculation he was not connected in any way with the tragedy but the fact that mr waring was absent all night coupled with the stories of his devotions to madame was to several minds prima facie evidence that his was the bloody hand that wrought the deed that he was now a fugitive from justice and madame lascelles beyond doubt the guilty partner of his flight everybody knew by this time of their being together much of the morning how could people help knowing when dryden had seen them in his elegantly jocular way dryden was already condoling with ferry on the probable loss of his hatfield clothes and comforting him with the assurance that they always gave a feller a new black suit to be hanged in so he might get his duds back after all only they must get waring first jeffers doubtless would have been besieged with questions but for crams foresight his master had ordered him to accompany him to town in silence a second time the little party rode away passing the flooded homestead where lay the murdered man then farther on gazing in mute curiosity at the closed shutters of the premises some infantry satirists had already christened the dovecot what cared they for him or his objectionable helpmate still they could not but note how gloomy and deserted it all appeared with two feet of water lapping the garden wall summoned by his master jeffers knuckled his oilskin hatbrim and pointed out the spot where mr waring stood when he knocked the cabman into the mud but jefferss tongue was tied and his cockney volubility gone the tracks made by crams wagon up the slope were already washed out bending forward to dodge the blinding storm the party pushed along the embankment until at last the avenues and alleys to their right gave proof of better drainage at rampart street they separated pierce going on to report the tragedy to the police cram turning to his right and following the broad thoroughfare another mile until jeffers indicating a big oldfashioned broadgalleried southern house standing in the midst of grounds once trim and handsome but now showing signs of neglect and penury simply said ere sir and here the party dismounted cram entered the gate and pulled a clanging bell the door was almost instantly opened by a colored girl at whose side with eager joyous face was the pretty child he had seen so often playing about the lascelles homestead and the eager joyous look faded instantly away she tink it msieur vareeng who comes to arrive explained the smiling colored girl ah it is madame dhervilly i wish to see answered cram briefly please take her my card and throwing off his dripping raincoat and tossing it to jeffers who had followed to the veranda the captain stepped within the hall and held forth his hands to nin nin begging her to come to him who was so good a friend of mr waring but she would not the tears of disappointment were in the dark eyes as the little one turned and ran away cram could hear the gentle soothing tones of the mother striving to console her child the one widowed and the other orphaned by the tidings he bore even then he noted how musical how full of rich melody was that soft creole voice and then madame dhervilly appeared a stately dignified picturesque gentlewoman of perhaps fifty years she greeted him with punctilious civility but with manner as distant as her words were few i have come on a trying errand he began when she held up a slender jewelled hand pardon permettez madame lascelles she called and before cram could find words to interpose a servant was speeding to summon the very woman he had hoped not to have to see oh madame he murmured low hurriedly i deplore my ignorance i cannot speak french try to understand me mr lascelles is home dangerously stricken i fear the worst you must tell her ome lа bas cest impossible it is true he burst in for the swish of silken skirt was heard down the long passage il est mort mort he whispered mustering up what little french he knew and then cursing himself for an imbecile mort o ciel the words came with a shriek of anguish from the lips of the elder woman and were echoed by a scream from beyond in an instant wildeyed horrorstricken emilie lascelles had sprung to her tottering mothers side when what mean you she gasped madame lascelles he sadly spoke i had hoped to spare you this but it is too late now mr lascelles was found lying on the sofa in his library this morning he had died hours before during the night and then he had to spring and catch the fainting woman in his arms she was still moaning and only semiconscious when the old family doctor and her brother pierre dhervilly arrived half an hour later cram astonished the aidesdecamp and other bored staff officials by appearing at the general loafingroom at headquarters to the chorus of inquiry as to what brought him up in such a storm he made brief reply and then asked immediately to speak with the adjutantgeneral and lieutenant reynolds and to the disgust and mystification of all the others he disappeared with these into an adjoining room there he briefly told the former of the murder and then asked for a word with the junior reynolds was a character tall handsome and distinguished he had served throughout the war as a volunteer doing no end of good work and getting many a word of praise but as all his service was as a staff officer it was his general who reaped the reward of his labors he had risen of course to the rank of major in the staff in the volunteers and everybody had prophesied that he would be appointed a major in the adjutantor inspectorgenerals department in the permanent establishment but there were not enough places by any means and the few vacancies went to men who knew better how to work for themselves take a lieutenancy now and we will fix you by and by was the suggestion and so it resulted that here he was three years after the war wearing the modest strap of a second lieutenant doing the duties and accepting the responsibilities of a far higher grade and being patronized by seniors who were as much his inferiors in rank as they were in ability during the war days everybody said it was a shame and nobody helped to better his lot he was a man whose counsel was valuable on all manner of subjects among other things he was well versed in all that pertained to the code of honor as it existed in the antebellum days had himself been out and as was well known had but recently officiated as second for an officer who had need of his services he and waring were friends from the start and cram counted on tidings of his absent subaltern in appealing to him great therefore was his consternation when in reply to his inquiry reynolds promptly answered that he had neither seen nor heard from waring in over fortyeight hours this was a facer whats wrong cram read that said the captain placing a daintilywritten note in the aidedecamps hand it was brief but explicit colonel braxton twice have i warned you that the attentions of your lieutenant waring to madame lascelles meant mischief this morning under pretence of visiting her mother she left the house in a cab but in half an hour was seen driving with mr waring this has been as i have reason to know promptly carried to monsieur lascelles by people whom he had employed for the purpose i could of told you last night that monsieur lascelless friend had notified lieutenant waring that a duel would be exacted should he be seen with madame again and now it will certainly come you have seen fit to scorn my warnings hitherto the result is on your head there was no signature whatever who wrote this rot asked reynolds it seems to me ive seen that hand before so have i and pitched the trash into the fire as i do everything anonymous that comes my way but brax says that this is the second or third and hes worried about it and thinks there may be truth in the story as to the duel or as to the devotions to madame asked reynolds calmly well both and we thought you would be most apt to know whether a fight was on waring promised to return to the post at taps last night instead of that he is gone god knows where and the old man the reputed challenger lies dead at his home isnt that ugly reynoldss face grew very grave who last saw waring that you know of my man jeffers left him on canal street just after dark last night he was then going to dine with friends at the st charles the allertons yes then wait till i see the chief and ill go with you say nothing about this matter yet reynolds was gone but a moment a little later cram and the aide were at the st charles rotunda their cards sent up to the allertons rooms presently down came the bellboy would the gentleman walk up to the parlor this was awkward they wanted to see allerton himself and cram felt morally confident that miss flora gwendolen would be on hand to welcome and chat with so distinguished a looking fellow as reynolds there was no help for it however it would be possible to draw off the head of the family after a brief call upon the ladies just as they were leaving the marblefloored rotunda a short swarthy man in pepperandsalt business suit touched cram on the arm begged a word and handed him a card a detective already asked cram in surprise i was with the chief when lieutenant pierce came in to report the matter was the brief response and i came here to see your man he is reluctant to tell what he knows without your consent could you have him leave the horses with your orderly below and come up here a moment why certainly if you wish but i cant see why said cram surprised you will see sir in a moment and then jeffers with white troubled face appeared and twisted his wet hatbrim in nervous worriment now what do you want of him asked cram ask him sir who was the man who slipped a greenback into his hand at the ladies entrance last evening what did he want of him jeffers turned a greenish yellow his every impulse was to lie and the detective saw it you need not lie jeffers he said very quietly it will do no good i saw the men i can tell your master who one of them was and possibly lay my hands on the second when he is wanted but i want you to tell and to explain what that greenback meant then jeffers broke down and merely blubbered hi meant no arm sir hi never dreamed there was hanythink wrong twas mr lascelles sir e said e came to thank me for elping is lady sir then e wanted to see mr warink sir why didnt you tell me of this before demanded the captain sternly you know what happened this morning hi didnt want to ave mr warink suspected sir was poor jefferss halftearful explanation as mr allerton suddenly entered the little hallway room the grave troubled faces caught his eye at once is anything wrong he inquired anxiously i hope waring is all right i tried to induce him not to start but he said he had promised and must go what time did he leave you mr allerton asked cram controlling as much as possible the tremor of his voice soon after the storm broke about ninethirty i should say he tried to get a cab earlier but the drivers wouldnt agree to go down for anything less than a small fortune luckily his creole friends had a carriage his what his friends from near the barracks they were here when we came down into the rotunda to smoke after dinner cram felt his legs and feet grow cold and a chill run up his spine who were they did you catch their names only one i was introduced only as they were about to drive away a little old fellow with elaborate manners a monsieur lascelles and waring drove away with him yes with him and one other seemed to be a friend of lascelles drove off in a closed carriage with a driver all done up in rubber and oilskin who said he perfectly knew the road why whats gone amiss chapter vi and all day long the storm beat upon the substantial buildings of the old barracks and flooded the low ground about the sheds and stables drills for the infantry were necessarily suspended several sentries even being taken off their posts the men clustered in the squadrooms and listened with more or less credulity to the theories and confirmatory statements of fact as related by the imaginative or loquacious of their number the majority of the officers gathered under the flaring lamplights at the sutlers store and occupied themselves pretty much as did their inferiors in grade though poker and punch specialties of mr finkbein the sutler lent additional color to the stories in circulation from this congress the better element of the commissioned force was absent the names nationalities and idiomatic peculiarities of speech of the individual members being identical in most instances with those of their comrades in arms in the ranks brax had summoned minor lawrence kinsey and dryden to hear what the post surgeon had to say on his return but cautioned them to keep quiet as a result of this precaution the mystery of the situation became redoubled by one oclock and was intensified by two when it was announced that private dawson had attempted to break away out of the hospital after a visit from the same doctor in his professional capacity people were tempted out on their galleries in the driving storm and colored servants flitted from kitchen to kitchen to gather or dispense new rumors but nobody knew what to make of it when soon after two an orderly rode in from town dripping with mud and wet delivered a note to the colonel and took one from him to mr ferry now sole representative of the officers of battery x present for duty ferry in return sent the bedraggled horseman on to the battery quarters with an order to the first sergeant and in about fifteen minutes a sergeant and two men mounted and each leading a spare horse appeared under ferrys gallery and that officer proceeded to occupy one of the vacant saddles and followed by his party went clattering out of the sallyport and splashing over to the levee stablecall sounded as usual at four oclock and for the first time in the record of that disciplined organization since the devastating hand of yellow jack was laid upon it the previous year no officer appeared to supervise the grooming and feeding two of them were at the post however mr doyle in arrest on charge of absence without leave was escorted to his quarters about fourfifteen and was promptly visited by sympathizing and inquisitive comrades from the hotel finkbein while mr ferry who had effected the arrest was detained making his report to the post commander night came on apace the wind began to die away with the going down of the sun the rain ceased to fall a pallid moon began peering at odd intervals through rifts in the cloudy veil when cram rode splashing into barracks worn with anxiety and care at eleven oclock and stopping only for a moment to take his wife in his arms and kiss her anxious face and shake his head in response to her eager query for news of waring he hurried downstairs again and over to doyles quarters all was darkness there but he never hesitated tramping loudly over the gallery he banged at the door then turning the knob intending to burst right in as was the way in the rough old days was surprised to find the bolt set doyle open i want to see you at once all silence within doyle open or if you are too drunk to get up ill kick in the door a groan a whispered colloquy then the rattle of bolt and chain the door opened about an inch and an oily irish voice inquired hwats wanted captin you here exclaimed cram in disgust what business have you in this garrison if the colonel knew it youd be driven out at the point of the bayonet sure where should wife be but at her husbands side whin hes sick and sufferin didnt they root him out of bed and comfort this day and ride him down like a felon in all the storm sure it was the doughboys orders sir i told doyle the captin niver would have oh be quiet i must see doyle and at once sure hes not able captin you know how it is wid him hes

stop this talk he wasnt drinking at all until you came back here to hound him open that door or a file of the guard will och thin wait till im dressed fur dacencys sake captin sure ill thry and wake him and then more whispering the clink of glass maudlin protestation in doyles thick tones cram banged at the door and demanded instant obedience admitted at last he strode to the side of an ordinary hospital cot over which the mosquitobar was now ostentatiously drawn and upon which was stretched the bulky frame of the big irishman his red bleareyed bloated face half covered in his arms the close air reeked with the fumes of whiskey in her distress lest jim should take too much the claimant of his name and protection had evidently been sequestrating a large share for herself how on earth did you get here your house was flooded all day angrily asked cram sure we made a raft sir louette and me and poled over to the levee and i walked every fut of the way down to follow me husband as i swore i would whin we was married id a come in anatoles boat sir but twas gone gone since last night did ye know that captin a groan and a feverish toss from the occupant of the narrow bed interrupted her hush jim darlin heres the captin to see you and tell you hes come back to have you roighted sure how could a poor fellow be expected to come home in all that awful storm this mornin captin tis for not comin the colonel had him under arrest but i tell him the captin ll see him through but cram pushed her aside as she still interposed between him and the bed doyle look up and answer doyle i say again vehement protestations and now an outburst of tears and pleadings from the woman oh he cant understand you captin ah dont be hard on him only this mornin he was sayin how the captin reminded him of the ould foine days whin the officers was all gintlemen and soldiers hes truer to ye than all the rest of thim sir dye moind that captin ye wouldnt belave it mabby but theres them that can tell ye

all patience doyle answer me and he shook him hard you were at the pelican last night and you saw mr waring and spoke with him what did he want of you where did he go who were with him was there any quarrel answer i say do you know but maudlin moaning and incoherencies were all that cram could extract from the prostrate man again the woman interposed eager tearful sure he was there captin he was there he told me of it whin i fetched him home last night to git him out of the storm and away from that place but hes too dhrunk now to talk sure there was no gittin down here to barx for anybody the

and in the storm and twas me wint out wid dawson and another of the byes and fetched him in and we niver heerd of the murther at all at all sir until i came down here today thats gods troot and hell tell ye so whin hes sober she ended breathless reckless of her descriptive confusion of doyle and divinity and still the irishman lay there limp soggy senseless and at last dismayed and disheartened the captain turned away promise to sober him up by reveille and you may stay but hear this if he cannot answer for himself by that time out you go in the battery cart with a policeman to take you to the calaboose and then he left no sooner had his footsteps died away than the woman turned on her patient now struggling to a sitting posture lie still you thafe and cur and swear you to every word i say unless youd hang in his place dhrink this now and go to slape and be riddy to tell the story i give ye in the mornin or may the knife ye drove in that poor mummys throat come back to cut your coward heart out and doyle shivering sobbing crazed with drink and fear covered his eyes with his hands and threw himself back on his hot and steaming pillow the morning sun rose brilliant and cloudless as the horses of the battery came forth from the dark interior of the stable and after watering at the long wooden trough on the platform were led away by their whitefrocked grooms each section to its own picketline ferry supervising the duty presently caught sight of the tall muscular form of his captain coming briskly around the corner little pierce tripping along by his side cram acknowledged the salute of the battery officer of the day in hurried fashion goodmorning ferry he said tell me who were there when you got doyle away from that woman yesterday only the three sir mr and mrs doyle and the negro girl no sign of anybody else none sir i didnt go in the house at all i rode in the gate and called for doyle to come out the woman tried to parley but i refused to recognize her at all and presently doyle obeyed without any trouble whatever though she kept up a tirade all the time and said he was too sick to ride and all that but he wasnt he seemed dazed but not drunk certainly not sick he rode all right only he shivered and crossed himself and moaned when he passed the lascelles place for that hound pup set up a howl just as we were opposite the gate he was all trembling when we reached the post and took a big drink the moment he got to his room yees hes been drinking ever since ive just sent the doctor to see him let the corporal and one man of the guard go with the ambulance to escort mrs doyle out of the garrison and take her home she shall not stay why shes gone sir said ferry the guard told me she went out of the back gate and up the track towards anatoles going for all she was worth just after dawn the mischief she has what can have started her did you see her yourself sergeant bennett asked the captain of a stocky little irish soldier standing at the moment with drawn sabre awaiting opportunity to speak to his commander yes sir and the sabre came flashing up to the present shed wint over to the hospital to get some medicine for the lieutenant just after our bugle sounded first call and she came runnin out as i wint to call the officer of the day sir she ran back to the lieutenants quarters ahead of me and was up only a minute or two whin down she came again wid some bundles and away she wint to the north gate runnin wildlike the steward told me a moment after of dawsons escape dawson escaped from hospital yes sir they thought he was all right last evening when he was sleeping and took the sentry off and at four this morning he was gone chapter vii fortyeight hours had passed and not a trace had been found of lieutenant waring the civil officers of the law had held grave converse with the seniors on duty at the barracks and crams face was lined with anxiety and trouble the formal inquest was held as the flood subsided and the evidence of the post surgeon was most important about the throat of the murdered man were indubitable marks of violence the skin was torn as by fingernails the flesh bruised and discolored as by fiercelygrasping fingers but death said the doctor was caused by the single stab driven downward with savage force a sharppointed twoedged straightbladed knife had pierced the heart and all was over in an instant one other wound there was a slashing cut across the stomach which had let a large amount of blood but might possibly not have been mortal what part the deceased had taken in the struggle could only be conjectured a little fivechambered revolver which he habitually carried was found on the floor close at hand two charges had been recently fired for the barrel was black with powder but no one had heard a shot the barkeeper at the pelican could throw but little light on the matter the storm had broken he said with sudden fury the rain dashed in torrents against his western front and threatened to beat in the windows he called to the two men who happened to be seated at a table to assist him and was busy trying to get up the shutters when lieutenant doyle joined them and rendered timely aid he had frequently seen doyle before during the previous month mrs doyle lived in the old lemaоtre house in the block below and he often supplied them with whiskey they drank nothing but whiskey as they ran in the side door they were surprised to see the lights of a carriage standing at the edge of the banquette and the driver begged for shelter for his team saying some gentlemen had gone inside the barkeeper opened a gate and the driver put his horses under a shed in a paved court in the rear then came in for a drink meantime said the barkeeper whose name was bonelli three gentlemen who were laughing over their escape from the storm had ordered wine and gone into a private room doyle with them the only one he knew was monsieur lascelles though he had seen one of the others frequently as he rode by and knew him to be an officer before mr doyle slapped him on the back and hailed him as sammy old buck or something like that mr doyle had been drinking and the gentleman whispered to him not to intrude just then and evidently wanted to get rid of him but mr lascelles who had ordered the wine demanded to be introduced and would take no denial and invited mr doyle to join them and ordered more wine and then bonelli saw that lascelles himself was excited by drink the first time he had ever noticed it in the year he had known him the third gentleman he had never seen before and could only say he was dark and sallow and did not talk except to urge the driver to make haste they must go on but he spoke in a low tone with mr lascelles as they went to the room and presently the rain seemed to let up a little though it blew hard and the driver went out and looked around and then returned to the private room where the gentlemen were having their wine and there was some angry talk and he came out in a few minutes very mad said he wouldnt be hired to drive that party any farther or any other party for that matter that no carriage could go down the levee and then he got out his team and drove back to town and then bonelli could hear sounds of altercation in the room and mr doyles voice very angry and the strange gentleman came out and one of the men whod been waiting said he had a cab if that would answer and hed fetch it right off and by the time he got back it was raining hard again and he took his cab in under the shed where the carriage had been and a couple of soldiers from the barracks then came in wet and cold and begged for a drink and bonelli knew one of them called dawson and trusted him as he often had done before when dawson heard lieutenant doyles drunken voice he said thered be trouble getting him home and hed better fetch mrs doyle and while he was gone lascelles came out excited and threw down a twentydollar bill and ordered more krug and some brandy and there was still loud talk and when bonelli carried in the bottles doyle was sitting back in a chair held down by the other officer who was laughing at him but nevertheless had a knife in hand a long sharp twoedged knife and doyle was calling him names and was very drunk and soon after they all went out into the rear court and doyle made more noise and the cab drove away around the corner going down the levee through the pouring rain one man on the box with the driver that was the last he saw then mrs doyle came in mad and demanded her husband and they found him reeling about the dark court swearing and muttering and dawson and she took him off between them this must have been before eleven oclock and that was absolutely all he knew then mr allerton had told his story again without throwing the faintest light on the proceedings and the hackdriver was found and frankly and fully told his that lascelles and another gentleman hired him about eight oclock to drive them down to the formers place which they said was several squares above the barracks he said that he would have to charge them eight dollars such a night anywhere below the old cottonpress where the pavement ended but then they had delayed starting nearly an hour and took another gentleman with them and when driven by the storm to shelter at the pelican saloon three squares below where the pavement ended and he asked for his money saying he dare go no farther in the darkness and the flood the frenchman wouldnt pay because he hadnt taken them all the way he pointed out that he had to bring another gentleman and had to wait a long time and demanded his eight dollars the other gentleman whom he found to be one of the officers at the barracks slipped a bill into his hand and said it was all he had left and if it wasnt enough hed pay him the next time he came to town but the others were very angry and called him an irish thief and then the big soldier in uniform said he wouldnt have a man abused because he was irish and lieutenant waring as he understood the name of this other officer to be told him the witness to slip out and say no more that hed fix it all right and that was the last he saw of the party but he heard loud words and the sound of a scuffle as he drove away and madame dhervilly had given her testimony which translated was to this effect she had known the deceased these twenty years he had been in the employ of her lamented husband who died of the fever in and monsieur had succeeded to the business and made money and owned property in town besides the old family residence on the levee below he was wedded to emilie only a little while before the war and lived at home all through but business languished then they had to contribute much and his younger brother monsieur philippe had cost him a great deal philippe was an officer in the zouaves raised in among the french creoles and marched with them to columbus and was wounded and came home to be nursed and emilie took care of him for weeks and months and then he went back to the war and fought bravely and was shot again and brought home and this time monsieur lascelles did not want to have him down at the house he said it cost too much to get the doctors down there so he came under madames roof and she was very fond of the boy and emilie would come sometimes and play and sing for him when the war was over monsieur lascelles gave him money to go to mexico with maximilian and when the french were recalled many deserted and came over to new orleans and monsieur lascelles was making very little money now and had sold his town property and he borrowed money of her to help as he said philippe again who came to visit him and he was often worried by philippes letters begging for money seven thousand dollars now he owed her and only last week had asked for more philippe was in key west to buy an interest in some cigarbusiness monsieur lascelles said if he could raise three thousand to reach philippe this week they would all make money but emilie begged her not to she was afraid it would all go and on the very day before he was found dead he came to see her in the afternoon on rampart street and emilie had told her of mr warings kindness to her and to nin nin and how she never could have got up after being dragged into the mud by that drunken cabman and she begged me to explain the matter to her husband who was a little vexed with her because of mr waring but he spoke only about the money and did not reply about mr waring except that he would see him and make proper acknowledgment of his civility he seemed to think only of the money and said philippe had written again and must have help and he was angry at emilie because she would not urge with him and emilie wept and he went away in anger saying he had business to detain him in town until morning when he would expect her to be ready to return with him much of this testimony was evoked by pointed queries of the officials who seemed somewhat familiar with lascelless business and family affairs and who then declared that they must question the stricken widow harsh and unfeeling as this may have seemed there were probably reasons which atoned for it she came in on the arm of the old family physician looking like a drooping flower with little nin nin clinging to her hand she was so shocked and stunned that she could barely answer the questions put to her with all courtesy and gentleness of manner no she had never heard of any quarrel between monsieur lascelles and his younger brother yes philippe had been nursed by her through his wounds she was fond of philippe but not so fond as was her husband mr lascelles would do anything for philippe deny himself anything almost asked if monsieur lascelles had not given some reason for his objection to philippes being nursed at his house when he came home the second time she was embarrassed and distressed she said philippe was an impulsive boy fancied himself in love with his brothers wife and armand saw something of this and at last upbraided him but very gently there was no quarrel at all was there any one whom monsieur lascelles had been angered with on her account she knew of none but blushed and blushed painfully had the deceased not recently objected to the attentions paid her by other gentlemen there was a murmur of reproach among the hearers but madame answered unflinchingly though with painful blushes and tears monsieur lascelles had said nothing of disapproval until very recently au contraire he had much liked mr waring he was the only one of the officers at the barracks whom he had ever invited to the house and he talked with him a great deal had never even to her spoken of a quarrel with him because mr waring had been so polite to her until within a week or two then yes he certainly had of her husbands business affairs his papers etc she knew little he always had certain moneys though not large sums with all his papers in the drawers of his cabinet and that they should be in so disturbed a state was not unusual they were all in order closed and locked when he started for town the morning of that fatal day but he often left them open and in disorder only then locking his library door when she left for town two hours after him the library door was open also the side window she could throw no light on the tragedy she had no idea who the stranger could be she had not seen philippe for nearly a year and believed him to be at key west alphonse the colored boy was so terrified by the tragedy and by his detention under the same roof with the murdered man that his evidence was only dragged from him nobody suspected the poor fellow of complicity in the crime yet he seemed to consider himself as on trial he swore he had entered the library only once during the afternoon or evening and that was to close the shutters when the storm broke he left a lamp burning low in the hall according to custom though he felt sure his master and mistress would remain in town overnight rather than attempt to come down he had slept soundly as negroes will despite the gale and the roar of the rain that drowned all other noises it was late the next morning when his mother called him the old mammy was frightened to see the front gate open the deep water in the streets and the muddy footprints on the veranda she called alphonse who found that his master must have come in during the night after all for the lamp was taken from the hall table the library door was closed and locked so was the front door also barred within which it had not been when he went to bed he tapped at the library got no answer so tiptoed to his masters bedroom it was empty and undisturbed neither had madame nor mademoiselle nin nin been to their rooms then he was troubled and then the soldiers came and called him out into the rain they could tell the rest crams story is already told and he could add nothing the officials tried to draw the batteryman out as to the relations existing between lieutenant waring and madame but got badly bluffed cram said he had never seen anything in the faintest degree worthy of comment had he heard anything yes but nothing worthy of consideration much less of repetition had he not loaned mr waring his team and carriage to drive madame to town that morning no how did he get it then took it was monsieur waring in the habit of helping himself to the property of his brother officers yes whenever he felt like it for they never objected the legal official thought such spirit of camaraderie in the light artillery must make life at the barracks something almost poetic to which cram responded oh at times absolutely idyllic and the tilt ended with the civil functionary ruffled and this was bad for the battery cram never had any policy whatsoever lieutenant doyle was the next witness summoned and a more godforsakenlooking fellow never sat in a shell jacket still in arrest physically at the beck of old braxton and similarly hampered intellectually at the will of bold john barleycorn mr doyle came before the civil authorities only upon formal subpoena served at post headquarters the post surgeon had straightened him up during the day but was utterly perplexed at his condition mrs doyles appearance in the neighborhood some weeks before had been the signal for a series of sprees on the irishmans part that had on two occasions so prostrated him that dr potts an acting assistant surgeon had been called in to prescribe for him and thanks to the vigorous constitution of his patient had pulled him out in a few hours but this time pills the less had found doyle in a state bordering on terror even when assured that the quantity of his potations had not warranted an approach to tremens the post surgeon had been called in too and pills the pitiless as he was termed thanks to his unfailing prescription of quinine and blue mass in the shape and size of buckshot having no previous acquaintance in doyle with these attacks poohpoohed the case administered bromides and admonition in due proportion and went off about more important business dr potts however stood by his big patient wondering what should cause him to start in such terror at every step upon the stair without and striving to bring sleep to eyes that had not closed the livelong night nor all the balmy beautiful day once he asked if doyle wished him to send for his wife and was startled at the vehemence of the reply for gods sake no and shuddering doyle had hidden his face and turned away potts got him to eat something towards noon and doyle begged for more drink but was refused he was sober yet shattered when mr drake suddenly appeared just about stablecall and bade him repair at once to the presence of the commanding officer then potts had to give him a drink or he would never have got there with the aid of a servant he was dressed and accompanied by the doctor reached the office braxton looked him over coldly mr doyle said he the civil authorities have made requisition for but he had got no further when doyle staggered and but for the doctors help might have fallen for gods sake colonel it isnt true sure i know nothing of it at all at all sir indade indade i was blind dhrunk colonel sure theyd swear a mans life away sir just because he was the one he was the one that be silent sir you are not accused that i know of it is as a witness you are needed is he in condition to testify doctor he is well enough sir to tell what he knows but he claims to know nothing and this too doyle eagerly seconded but was sent along in the ambulance with the doctor to keep him out of mischief and a parting shot to the effect that when the coroner was through with him the post commander would take hold again so the colonel depressed more than the cocktail stimulated and as luck would have it almost the first person to meet him inside the gloomy enclosure was his wife and her few whispered words only added to his misery the water still lay in pools about the premises and the police had allowed certain of the neighbors to stream in and stare at the white walls and shaded windows but only a favored few penetrated the hallway and rooms where the investigation was being held doyle shook like one with the palsy as he ascended the little flight of steps and passed into the open doorway still accompanied by little pills people looked at him with marked curiosity he was questioned requestioned crossquestioned but the result was only a hopeless tangle he really added nothing to the testimony of the hackdriver and bonelli in abject remorse and misery he begged them to understand he was drunk when he joined the party got drunker dimly remembered there was a quarrel but he had no cause to quarrel with any one and that was all he never knew how he got home he covered his face in his shaking hands at last and seemed on the verge of a fit of crying but then came sensation quietly rising from his seat the official who so recently had had the verbal tilt with cram held forth a rusty crosshilted twoedged knife that looked as though it might have lain in the mud and wet for hours have you ever seen this knife before he asked and doyle lifting up his eyes one instant groaned shuddered and said oh my god yes whose property is it or was it at first he would not reply he moaned and shook at last sure the initials are on the top he cried but the official was relentless tell us what they are and what they represent people were crowding the hallway and forcing themselves into the room cram and ferry curiously watching their illstarred comrade had exchanged glances of dismay when the knife was so suddenly produced now they bent breathlessly forward the silence for the moment was oppressive if its the knife i mane he sobbed at last desperately miserably the letters are s b w and it belongs to lieutenant waring of our bathery but no questioning however adroit could elicit from him the faintest information as to how it got there the last time he remembered seeing it he said was on mr warings table the morning of the review a detective testified to having found it among the bushes under the window as the water receded ferry and the miserable ananias were called and they too had to identify the knife and admit that neither had seen it about the room since mr waring left for town of other witnesses called came first the proprietor of the stable to which the cab belonged horse and cab he said covered with mud were found under a shed two blocks below the french market and the only thing in the cab was a handsome silk umbrella london make which lieutenant pierce laid claim to mrs doyle swore that as she was going in search of her husband she met the cab just below the pelican driving furiously away and that in the flash of lightning she recognized the driver as the man whom lieutenant waring had beaten that morning on the levee in front of her place a stranger was seated beside him there were two gentlemen inside but she saw the face of only one lieutenant waring nobody else could throw any light on the matter the doctor recalled declared the knife or dagger was shaped exactly as would have to be the one that gave the deathblow everything pointed to the fact that there had been a struggle a deadly encounter and that after the fatal work was done the murderer or murderers had left the doors locked and barred and escaped through the window leaving the desk rifled and carrying away what money there was possibly to convey the idea that it was only a vulgar murder and robbery after all of other persons who might throw light upon the tragedy the following were missing lieutenant waring private dawson the cabman and the unrecognized stranger so too was anatoles boat chapter viii when four days and nights had passed away without a word or sign from waring the garrison had come to the conclusion that those officers or men of battery x who still believed him innocent were idiots so did the civil authorities but those were days when the authorities of louisiana commanded less respect from its educated people than did even the military the police force like the state was undergoing a process called reconstruction which might have been impressive in theory but was ridiculous in practice a reward had been offered by business associates of the deceased for the capture and conviction of the assassin a distant relative of old lascelles had come to take charge of the place until monsieur philippe should arrive the latters address had been found among old armands papers and despatches via havana had been sent to him also letters pierre dhervilly had taken the weeping widow and little nin nin to bonne mamans to stay alphonse and his woollypated mother true to negro superstitions had decamped nothing would induce them to remain under the roof where foul murder had been done de hahnts was what they were afraid of and so the old white homestead though surrounded on every side by curiosityseekers and prying eyes was practically deserted cram went about his duties with a heavy heart and light aid ferry and pierce both commanded sections now as doyle remained in close arrest and pills the less in close attendance something was utterly wrong with the fellow mrs doyle had not again ventured to show her red nose within the limits of the barx as she called them a hint from braxton having proved sufficient but that she was ever scouting the pickets no one could doubt morn noon and night she prowled about the neighborhood employing the byes so she termed such stray sheep in army blue as a dhrop of anatoles best would tempt to carry scrawling notes to jim one of which falling with its postman by the wayside and turned over by the guard to captain cram for transmittal was addressed to mister lootnt james doyle lite bothery x jaxun barx and brought the only laughter to his lips the big horseartilleryman had known for nearly a week her customary mercury dawson had vanished from sight dropped with many another and often a better man as a deserter over at warings abandoned quarters the shades were drawn and the green jalousies bolted pierce stole in each day to see that everything even to the augmented heap of letters was undisturbed and ananias drooped in the court below and refused to be comforted cram had duly notified warings relatives now living in new york of his strange and sudden disappearance but made no mention of the cloud of suspicion which had surrounded his name meantime some legal friends of the family were overhauling the lascelles papers and a darkcomplexioned thickset active little civilian was making frequent trips between department headquarters and barracks at the former he compared notes with lieutenant reynolds and at the latter with braxton and cram the last interview mr allerton had before leaving with his family for the north was with this same lively party the detective who joined them that night at the st charles and allerton being a man of much substance had tapped his pocketbook significantly the difficulty just now is in having a talk with the widow said this official to cram and reynolds whom he had met by appointment on the thursday following the eventful saturday of braxtons combined review she is too much prostrated ive simply got to wait awhile and meantime go about this other affair is there no way in which you can see her cram relapsed into a brown study reynolds was poring over the note written to braxton and comparing it with one he held in his hand an old one and one that told an old old story i know youll say i have no right to ask this it read but youre a gentleman and im a friendless woman deserted by a worthless husband my own people are ruined by the war but even if they had money they wouldnt send any to me for i offended them all by marrying a yankee officer god knows i am punished enough for that but i was so young and innocent when he courted me i ought to of left i would of left him as soon as i found out how goodfornothing he really was only i was so much in love i couldnt i was fastenated i suppose now ive sold everything but if youll only lend me fifty dollars ill work my fingers to the bone until i pay it for the old homes sake please do its the same hand the same woman cram beyond a doubt she bled waring for the old homes sake the first winter he was in the south he told me all about it two years ago in washington when we heard of her the second time now shes followed him over here or got here first tried the same game probably met with a refusal and this anonymous note is her revenge the man she married was a crackbrained weakling who got into the army the fag end of the war fell in love with her pretty face married her then they quarrelled and he drank himself into a muddlehead she ran him into debt then he gambled away government funds bolted was caught and would have been tried and sent to jail but some powerful relative saved him that and simply had him dropped never heard of him again she was about a month grasswidowed when waring came on his first duty there he had an uncongenial lot of brother officers for a twocompany post and really had known of this girl and her people before the war and she appealed to him first for sympathy and help then charity then blackmail i reckon from which his fever saved him then she struck some quartermaster or other and lived off him for a while drifted over here and no sooner did he arrive all ignorant of her presence in or around new orleans than she began pestering him again when he turned a deaf ear she probably threatened and then came these anonymous missives to you and braxton yours always came by mail you say the odd thing about the colonels this one at least is that it was with his mail but never came through the postoffice thats all very interesting said the little civilian dryly but what we want is evidence to acquit him and convict somebody else of lascelless death what has this to do with the other this much this letter came to braxton by hand not by mail by hand probably direct from her what hand had access to the office the day when the whole command was out at review certainly no outsider the mail is opened and distributed on its arrival at nine oclock by the chief clerk or by the sergeantmajor if he happens to be there though hes generally at guard mount on this occasion he was out at review leary chief clerk tells colonel braxton he opened and distributed the mail putting the colonels on his desk root was with him and helped the third clerk came in later had been out all night drinking his name is dawson dawson goes out again and gets fuller and when next brought home is put in hospital under a sentry then he hears of the murder bolts and isnt heard from since except as the man who helped mrs doyle to get her husband home he is the fellow who brought that note he knew something of its contents for the murder terrified him and he ran away find his trail and you strike that of the woman who wrote these by the lord lieutenant if youll quit the army and take my place youll make a name and a fortune and if youll quit your place and take mine youll get your coup de grвce in some picayune indian fight and be forgotten so stay where you are but find dawson find her find what they know and youll be famous chapter ix that night or very early next morning there was pandemonium at the barracks it was clear still beautiful a soft april wind was drifting up from the lower coast laden with the perfume of sweet olive and orange blossoms mrs cram with one or two lady friends and a party of officers had been chatting in low tone upon their gallery until after eleven but elsewhere about the moonlit quadrangle all was silence when the second relief was posted far at the rear of the walled enclosure where in deference to the manners and customs of war as observed in the good old days whereof our seniors tell the sutlers establishment was planted within easy hailingdistance of the guardhouse there was still the sound of modified revelry by night and poker and whiskey punch had gathered their devotees in the grimy parlors of mr finkbein and here the belated ones tarried until long after midnight as most of them were bachelors and had no better halves as had doyle to fetch them home out of the wet cram and his lieutenants with the exception of doyle were never known to patronize this establishment whatsoever they might do outside they had separated before midnight and little pierce after his customary peep into warings preserves had closed the door gone to his own room to bed and to sleep ferry as battery officer of the day had made the rounds of the stables and gunshed about one oclock and had encountered captain kinsey of the infantry coming in from his long tramp through the dewwet field returning from the inspection of the sentrypost at the big magazine no news of poor sam yet i suppose said kinsey sadly as the two came strolling in together through the rear gate nothing whatever was ferrys answer we cannot even form a conjecture unless he too has been murdered think of there being a warrant out for his arrest for him sam waring well said kinsey no other conclusion could he well arrived at unless that poor brute doyle did it in a drunken row pills says he never saw a man so terrorstricken as he seems to be hes afraid to leave him really and doyles afraid to be alone thinks the old woman may get in she has no excuse for coming captain said ferry when she told cram she must see her husband today that she was out of money and starving the captain surprised her by handing her fifty dollars which is much more than shed have got from doyle she took it of course but that isnt what she wanted she wants to get at him she has money enough yes that womans a terror ferry old mrs murtagh wife of my quartermaster sergeant has been in the army twenty years and says she knew her well knew all her people she comes from a tough lot and they had a bad reputation in texas in the old days doyles a totally different man since she turned up cram tells me hello heres pills the less he suddenly exclaimed as they came opposite the west gate leading to the hospital hows your patient doc well hes sleeping at last he seems worn out its the first time ive left him but im used up and want a few hours sleep there isnt anything to drink in the room even if he should wake and jim is sleeping or lying there by him oh hell do all right now i reckon said the officer of the day cheerfully go and get your sleep the old woman cant get at him unless she bribes my sentries or rides the air on a broomstick like some other old witches ive read of ferry sleeps in the adjoining room anyhow so he can look out for her goodnight doc and so on they went glancing upward at the dim light just showing through the windowblinds in the gable end of doyles quarters and halting at the foot of the stairs come over and have a pipe with me ferry said the captain its too beautiful a night to turn in i want to talk to you about waring anyhow this thing weighs on my mind done with you for an hour anyhow said ferry just wait a minute till i run up and get my baccy presently down came the young fellow again meerschaum in hand the moonlight glinting on his slender figure so trim and jaunty in the battery dress kinsey looked him over with a smile of soldierly approval and a whimsical comment on the contrast between the appearance of this young artillery sprig and that of his own stout personality clad as he was in a bulging blue flannel sackcoat only distinguishable in cut and style from civilian garb by its having brass buttons and a pair of tarnished old shoulderstraps ferry was a swell his shell jacket fitted like wax the russian shoulderknots of twisted gold were of the handsomest make the ridingbreeches topboots and spurs were such that even waring could not criticise his sabre gleamed in the moonbeams and kinseys old leathercovered sword looked dingy by contrast his belt fitted trim and taut and was polished as his boottops kinseys sank down over the left hip and was worn brown the sash ferry sported as battery officer of the day was draped west point fashion over the shoulder and around the waist and accurately knotted and looped kinseys old warworn crimson net was slung higgledypiggledy over his broad chest what swells you fellows are ferry he said laughingly as the youngster came dancing down even old doyle gets out here in his scarlet plume occasionally and puts us doughboys to shame whats the use in trying to make such a rig as ours look soldierly if it were not for the brass buttons our coats would make us look like parsons and our hats like monkeys as for this undress all that can be said in its favor is you cant spoil it even by sleeping out on the levee in it as i am sometimes tempted to do lets go out there now it was perhaps quarter of two when they took their seats on the wooden bench under the trees and lighting their pipes gazed out over the broad sweeping flood of the mississippi gleaming like a silvered shield in the moonlight far across at the opposite shore the low line of orangegroves and plantation houses and quarters was merged in one long streak of gloom relieved only at intervals by twinkling light farther upstream like dozing seadogs the fleet of monitors lay moored along the bank with the masts and roofs of algiers dimly outlined against the crescent sweep of lights that marked the levee of the great southern metropolis still prostrate from the savage buffeting of the war yet so soon to rouse from lethargy resume her sway and stretching forth her arms to draw once again to her bosom the wealth and tribute tenfold augmented of the very heart of the nation until mistress of the commerce of a score of states she should rival even new york in the volume of her trade below them away to the east towards english turn rolled the tawny flood each ripple and eddy and swirling pool crested with silver the twinkling lights at chalmette barely distinguishable from dim lowhanging stars midway the black hulk of some big ocean voyager was forging slowly steadily towards them the red light of the port side already obscured the white and green growing with every minute more and more distinct and save the faint rustle of the leaves overhead murmuring under the touch of the soft southerly night wind the plash of wavelet against the wooden pier and the measured footfall of the sentry on the flagstone walk in front of the sallyport not a sound was to be heard for a while they smoked in silence enjoying the beauty of the night though each was thinking only of the storm that swept over the scene the sunday previous and of the tragedy that was borne upon its wings at last kinsey shook himself together ferry sometimes i come out here for a quiet smoke and think did it ever occur to you what a fearful force what illimitable power there is sweeping by us here night after night with never a sound oh you mean the mississip said ferry flippantly it would be a case of mops and brooms i fancy if she were to bust through the bank and sweep us out into the swamps exactly thats in case she broke loose as you say but even when in the shafts as she is now between the levees how long would it take her to sweep a fellow from here out into the gulf providing nothing interposed to stop him matter of simple mathematical calculation said ferry practically they say its an eightmile current easy out there in the middle where shes booming look at that barrel scooting down yonder now id lay a fiver i could cut loose from here at reveille and shoot the passes before taps and never pull a stroke its less than eighty miles down to the forts well then a skiff like that that old anatoles blaspheming about losing wouldnt take very long to ride over that route would it said kinsey reflectively no not if allowed to slide but somebodyd be sure to put out and haul it in as a prize flotsam and whatyoumaycallem you see these old niggers all along here with their skiffs tacking on to every hit of driftwood thats worth having but ferry do you think theyd venture out in such a storm as sunday last think anything could live in it short of a decked ship no probably not certainly not anatoles boat well thats just what im afraid of and what cram and reynolds dread do they well so far as that storms concerned it would have blown it downstream until it came to the big bend below here to the east then by rights it ought to have blown against the left bank but every inch of it has been scouted all the way to quarantine the whole river was filled with drift though and it might have been wedged in a lot of logs and swept out anyhow splendid ship that who is she do you suppose the great black hull with its lofty tracery of masts and spars was now just about opposite the barracks slowly and majestically ascending the stream one of those big british freight steamers that moor there below the french market i reckon they seldom come up at night unless its in the full of the moon and even then they move with the utmost caution see shes slowing up now hello listen whats that exclaimed ferry starting to his feet a distant muffled cry a distant shot the sentry at the sallyport dashed through the echoing vault then bang came the loud roar of his piece followed by the yell of fire fire the guard with one spring ferry was down the levee and darted like a deer across the road kinsey lumbering heavily after even as he sped through the stoneflagged way the hoarse roar of the drum at the guardhouse followed instantly by the blare of the bugle from the battery quarters sounded the stirring alarm a shrill agonized female voice was madly screaming for help guards and sentries were rushing to the scene and flames were bursting from the front window of doyles quarters swift though ferry ran others were closer to the spot half a dozen active young soldiers members of the infantry guard had sprung to the rescue when ferry dashed up to the gallery he was just in time to stumble over a writhing and prostrate form to help extinguish the blazing clothing of another to seize his waterbucket and douse its contents over a third one yelling the others stupefied by smoke or something in less time than it takes to tell it daring fellows had ripped down the blazing shades and shutters tossed them to the parade beneath dumped a heap of soaked and smoking bedding out of the rear windows splashed a few bucketfuls of water about the reeking room and the fire was out but the doctors were working their best to bring back the spark of life to two senseless forms and to still the shrieks of agony that burst from the seared and blistered lips of bridget doyle while willing hands bore these scorched semblances of humanity to neighboring rooms and tenderhearted women hurried to add their ministering touch and old braxton ordered the excited garrison back to quarters and bed he with cram and kinsey and ferry made prompt examination of the premises on the table two whiskeybottles one empty one nearly full that dr potts declared were not there when he left at one on the mantel a phial of chloroform which was also not there before but a towel soaked with the stifling contents lay on the floor by jims rude pallet and a handkerchief half soaked half consumed was on the chair which had stood by the bedside among the fragments of an overturned kerosene lamp a quick examination of the patients showed that jim the negro had been chloroformed and was not burned at all that doyle was severely burned and had probably inhaled flames and that the woman was crazed with drink terror and burns combined it took the efforts of two or three men and the influence of powerful opiates to quiet her taxed with negligence or complicity on the part of the sentry the sergeant of the guard repudiated the idea and assured colonel braxton that it was an easy matter for any one to get either in or out of the garrison without encountering the sentry and taking his lantern led the way out to the hospital grounds by a winding footpath among the trees to a point in the high white picket fence where two slats had been shoved aside any one coming along the street without could pass far beyond the ken of the sentry at the west gate and slip in with the utmost ease and once inside all that was necessary was to dodge possible reliefs and patrols no sentry was posted at the gate through the wall that separated the garrison proper from the hospital grounds asked why he had not reported this the sergeant smiled and said there were a dozen others just as convenient so what was the use he did not say however that he and his fellows had recourse to them night after night it was three oclock when the officers families fairly got settled down again and back to their beds and the silence of night once more reigned over jackson barracks one would suppose that such a scene of terror and excitement was enough and that now the trembling frightened women might be allowed to sleep in peace but it was not to be hardly had one of their number closed her eyes hardly had all the flickering lights save those at the hospital and guardhouse been downed again when the strained nerves of the occupants of the officers quadrangle were jumped into mad jangling once more and all the barracks aroused a second time and this too by a womans shriek of horror mrs conroy a delicate fragile little body wife of a junior lieutenant of infantry occupying a set of quarters in the same building with but at the opposite end from pierce and waring was found lying senseless at the head of the gallery stairs when revived amid tears and tremblings and incoherent exclamations she declared that she had gone down to the big icechest on the groundfloor to get some milk for her nervous and frightened child and was hurrying noiselessly up the stairs again the only means of communication between the first and second floors when face to face in front of his door she came upon mr waring or his ghost that his eyes were fixed and glassy that he did not seem to see her even when he spoke for speak he did his voice sounded like a moan of anguish she said but the words were distinct where is my knife who has taken my knife and then little pierce who had helped to raise and carry the stricken woman to her room suddenly darted out on the gallery and ran along to the door he had closed four hours earlier it was open striking a match he hurried through into the chamber beyond and there face downward upon the bed lay his friend and comrade waring moaning like one in the delirium of fever chapter x lieutenant reynolds was seated at his desk at department headquarters about nine oclock that morning when an orderly in lightbattery dress dismounted at the banquette and came up the stairs three at a jump captain crams compliments sir and this is immediate he reported as he held forth a note reynolds tore it open read it hastily through then said go and fetch me a cab quick as you can and disappeared in the generals room half an hour later he was spinning down the levee towards the french market and before ten oclock was seated in the captains cabin of the big british steamer ambassador which had arrived at her moorings during the night cram and kinsey were already there and to them the skipper was telling his story off the tortugas just about as they had shaped their course for the belize they were hailed by the little steamer tampa bound from new orleans to havana the sea was calm and a boat put off from the tampa and came alongside and presently a gentleman was assisted aboard he seemed weak from illness but explained that he was lieutenant waring of the united states artillery had been accidentally carried off to sea and the ambassador was the first inwardbound ship they had sighted since crossing the bar he would be most thankful for a passage back to new orleans captain baird had welcomed him with the heartiness of the british tar and made him at home in his cabin the lieutenant was evidently far from well and seemed somewhat dazed and mentally distressed he could give no account of his mishap other than that told him by the officers of the tampa which had lain to when overtaken by the gale on saturday night and on sunday morning when they resumed their course downstream they overhauled a light skiff and were surprised to find a man aboard drenched and senseless the left side of his face was badly bruised and discolored even when he came to us said baird and he must have been slugged and robbed for his watch his sealring and what little money he had were all gone the second officer of the tampa had fitted him out with a clean shirt and the steward dried his clothing as best he could but the coat was stained and clotted with blood mr waring had slept heavily much of the way back until they passed pilot town then he was up and dressed thursday afternoon and seemingly in better spirits when he picked up a copy of the new orleans picayune which the pilot had left aboard and was reading that when suddenly he started to his feet with an exclamation of amaze and when the captain turned to see what was the matter waring was ghastly pale and fearfully excited by something he had read he hid the paper under his coat and sprang up on deck and paced nervously to and fro for hours and began to grow so ill apparently that captain baird was much worried at night he begged to be put ashore at the barracks instead of going on up to town and baird had become so troubled about him that he sent his second officer in the gig with him landed him on the levee opposite the sallyport and there thanking them heartily but declining further assistance waring had hurried through the entrance into the barrack square mr royce the second officer said there was considerable excitement beating of drums and sounding of bugles at the post as they rowed towards the shore he did not learn the cause captain baird was most anxious to learn if the gentleman had safely reached his destination cram replied that he had but in a state bordering on delirium and unable to give any coherent account of himself he could tell he had been aboard the ambassador and the tampa but that was about all and then they told baird that what waring probably saw was wednesdays paper with the details of the inquest on the body of lascelles and the chain of evidence pointing to himself as the murderer this caused honest captain baird to lay ten to one he wasnt and five to one hed never heard of it till he got the paper above pilot town whereupon all three officers clapped the briton on the back and shook him by the hand and begged his company to dinner at the barracks and at moreaus and then while reynolds sped to the policeoffice and kinsey back to colonel braxton whom he represented at the interview cram remounted and followed by the faithful jeffers trotted up rampart street and sent in his card to madame lascelles and madames maid brought back reply that she was still too shocked and stricken to receive visitors so also did madame dhervilly deny herself and cram rode home to nell it is useless he said she will not see me then she shall see me said mrs cram and so a second time did jeffers make the trip to town that day this time perched with folded arms in the rumble of the ponyphaeton and while she was gone the junior doctor was having the liveliest experience of his few years of service scorched and burned though she was mrs doyles faculties seemed to have returned with renewed acuteness and force she demanded to be taken to her husbands side but the doctor sternly refused she demanded to be told his condition and was informed that it was so critical he must not be disturbed especially by her who was practically responsible for all his trouble then she insisted on knowing whether he was conscious and whether he had asked for a priest and when informed that father foley had already arrived it required the strength of four men to hold her she raved like a maniac and her screams appalled the garrison but screams and struggles were all in vain pills the less sent for his senior and pills the pitiless more than ever deserved his name he sent for a straitjacket saw her securely stowed away in that and borne over to a vacant room in the old hospital set the stewards wife on watch and a sentry at the door went back to warings bedside where sam lay tossing in burning fever murmured his few words of caution to pierce and ferry then hastened back to where poor doyle was gasping in agony of mind and body clinging to the hand of the gentle soldier of the cross gazing piteously into his father confessors eyes drinking in his words of exhortation yet unable to make articulate reply the flames had done their cruel work only in desperate pain could he speak again it was nearly dark when mrs cram came driving back to barracks bringing mr reynolds with her her eyes were dilated her cheeks flushed with excitement as she sprang from the low phaeton and with a murmured come to me as soon as you can to her husband she sped away up the stairs leaving him to receive and entertain her passenger i too went to see madame lascelles late this afternoon said reynolds i wished to show her this it was a copy of a despatch to the chief of police of new orleans it stated in effect that philippe lascelles had not been seen or heard of around key west for over two weeks it was believed that he had gone to havana can you get word of this to our friend the detective asked cram i have wired already he has gone to georgia what i hoped to do was to note the effect of this on madame lascelles but she was too ill to see me luckily mrs cram was there and i sent it up to her she will tell you now i have to see braxton and then came a messenger to ask cram to join the doctor at doyles quarters at once so he scurried upstairs to see nell first and learn her tidings did i not tell you she exclaimed as he entered the parlor philippe lascelles was here that very night and had been seen with his brother at the office on royal street twice before this thing happened and they had trouble about money oh i made her understand i appealed to her as a woman to do what she could to right mr waring who was so generally believed to be the guilty man i told her we had detectives tracing philippe and would soon find how and when he reached new orleans finally i showed her the despatch that mr reynolds sent up and at last she broke down burst into tears and said she too had learned since the inquest that philippe was with her husband and probably was the stranger referred to that awful night she even suspected it at the time for she knew he came not to borrow but to demand money that was rightfully his and also certain papers that armand held and that now were gone it was she who told me of philippes having been seen with armand at the office but she declared she could not believe that he would kill her husband i pointed out the fact that armand had fired two shots from his pistol apparently and that no bulletmarks had been found in the room where the quarrel took place and that if his shots had taken effect on his antagonist he simply could not have been waring for though waring had been bruised and beaten about the head the doctor said there was no sign of bulletmark about him anywhere she recognized the truth of this but still she said she believed that there was a quarrel or was to be a quarrel between her husband and mr waring otherwise i believe her throughout i believe that no matter what romance there was about her nursing philippe and his falling in love with her she did not encourage him did not call him here again was true to her old husband she is simply possessed with the idea that the quarrel which killed her husband was between himself and mr waring and that it occurred after philippe had got his money and papers and gone weell philippe will have a heap to explain when he is found was crams reply now i have to go to doyles he is making some confession i expect to the priest but cram never dreamed for an instant what that was to be that night poor doyles spirit took its flight and the story of misery he had to tell partly by scrawling with a pencil partly by gesture in reply to question partly in painfullygasped sentences a few words at a time was practically this lascelles and his party did indeed leave him at the pelican when he was so drunk he only vaguely knew what was going on or what had happened in the barroom where they were drinking but his wife had told him the whole story lascelles wanted more drink champagne the bartender wanted to close up they bought several bottles however and had them put in the cab and lascelles was gay and singing and instead of going directly home insisted on stopping to make a call on the lady who occupied the upper floor of the house doyle rented on the levee doyle rarely saw her but she sometimes wrote to lascelles and got bridget to take the letters to him she was setting her cap for the old frenchman we called her mrs dawson the cabman drove very slowly through the storm as doyle walked home along with bridget and some man who was helping and when they reached the gate there was the cab and waring in it the cabdriver was standing by his horse swearing at the delay and saying he would charge double fare doyle had had trouble with his wife for many years and renewed trouble lately because of two visits lascelles had paid there and that evening when she sent for him he was drinking in warings room had been drinking during the day he dreaded more trouble and twas he who took warings knife and still had it he said when he entered the gate and no sooner did he see lascelles at his door than he ordered him to leave lascelles refused to go doyle knocked him down and the frenchman sprang up swearing vengeance lascelles fired two shots and doyle struck once with the knife and there lay lascelles dead before doyle could know or realize what he was doing in fact doyle never did know it was what his wife had told him and life had been a hell to him ever since that woman came back she had blackmailed him more or less ever since he got his commission because of an old trouble hed had in texas and this confession was written out for him signed by doyle on his dying bed duly witnessed and the civil authorities were promptly notified bridget doyle was handed over to the police certain detectives out somewhere on the trail of somebody else were telegraphed to come in and four days later when the force of the fever was broken and waring lay weak languid but returning to his senses cram and the doctor read the confession to their patient and then started to their feet as he almost sprang from the bed its an infernal lie he weakly cried i took that knife from doyle and kept it i myself saw lascelles to his gate safe and sound chapter xi the sunshine of an exquisite april morning was shimmering over the louisiana lowlands as battery x was hitching in and mrs crams pretty ponyphaeton came flashing through the garrison gate and reined up in front of the guns a proud and happy woman was mrs cram and daintily she gathered the spotless creamcolored reins and slanted her long english drivingwhip at the exact angle prescribed by the vogue of the day by her side reclining luxuriously on his pillows was sam waring now senior first lieutenant of the battery taking his first airing since his strange illness pallid and thin though he was that young gentleman was evidently capable of appreciating to the fullest extent the devoted attentions of which he had been the object ever since his return stanch friend and fervent champion of her husbands most distinguished officer at any time mrs cram had thrown herself into his cause with a zeal that challenged the admiration even of the men whom she mercilessly snubbed because they had accepted the general verdict that lascelles had died by warings hand had they met in the duello as practised in the south in those days sword to sword or armed with pistol at twelve paces she would have shuddered but maintained that as a soldier and gentleman waring could not have refused his opponents challenge inexcusable though such challenge might have been but that he could have stooped to vulgar unregulated fracas without seconds or the formality of the cartel first with fists and those womens weapons nails then knives or stilettoes as though he was some low dago or sicilian why that was simply and utterly incredible none the less she was relieved and rejoiced as were all warings friends when the full purport of poor doyles dying confession was noised abroad even those who were sceptical were now silenced for four days her comfort and relief had been inexpressible and then came the hour when with woe and trouble in his face her husband returned to her from warings bedside with the incomprehensible tidings that he had utterly repudiated doyles confession had indeed said that which could probably only serve to renew the suspicion of his own guilt or else justify the theory that he was demented though cram and the doctor warned waring not to talk talk he would to pierce to ferry to ananias and though these three were pledged by cram to reveal to no one what waring said it plunged them in an agony of doubt and misgiving day after day had the patient told and retold the story and never could crossquestioning shake him in the least cram sent for reynolds and took him into their confidence and reynolds heard the story and added his questions but to no effect from first to last he remembered every incident up to his parting with lascelles at his own gateway after that nothing his story in brief was as follows he was both surprised and concerned while smoking and chatting with mr allerton in the rotunda of the st charles to see lascelles with a friend evidently watching an opportunity of speaking with him he had noticed about a week previous a marked difference in the old frenchmans manner and three days before the tragedy when calling on his way from town to see madame and nin nin was informed that they were not at home and monsieur himself was the informant nor did he as heretofore invite waring to enter sam was a fellow who detested misunderstanding courteously but positively he demanded explanation lascelles shrugged his shoulders but gave it he had heard too much of monsieurs attentions to madame his wife and desired their immediate discontinuance he must request monsieurs assurance that he would not again visit beau rivage or else the reparation due a man of honor etc whereupon said waring i didnt propose to be outdone in civility and therefore replied in the best french i could command permit me to tender monsieur both monsieurs friends will find me at the barracks all the same said waring when i found madame and nin nin stuck in the mud i did what i considered the proper thing and drove them coram publico to bonne mamans never letting them see of course that there was any row on tap and so when i saw the old fellow with a keenlooking party alongside i felt sure it meant mischief i was utterly surprised therefore when lascelles came up with hat off and hand extended bowing low praying pardon for the intrusion but saying he could not defer another instant the desire to express his gratitude the most profound for my extreme courtesy to madame and his beloved child he had heard the whole story and to my confusion insisted on going over all the details before allerton even to my heroism as he called it in knocking down that big bully of a cabman i was confused yet couldnt shake him off he was persistent he was abject he begged to meet my friend to present his to open champagne and drink eternal friendship he would change the name of his chвteau the rotten old rookery from beau rivage to belle alliance he would make this day a fкte in the calendar of the lascelles family and then it began to dawn on me that he had been drinking champagne before he came i did not catch the name of the other gentleman a much younger man he was very ceremonious and polite but distant then in some way came up the fact that i had been trying to get a cab to take me back to barracks and then lascelles declared that nothing could be more opportune he had secured a carriage and was just going down with monsieur they had des affaires to transact at once he took me aside and said in proof that you accept my amende and in order that i may make to you my personal apologies you must accept my invitation so go with them i did i was all the time thinking of crams mysterious note bidding me return at taps i couldnt imagine what was up but i made my best endeavors to get a cab none was to be had so i was really thankful for this opportunity all the way down lascelles overwhelmed me with civilities and i could only murmur and protest and the other party only murmured approbation he hardly spoke english at all then lascelles insisted on a stop at the pelican and on bumpers of champagne and there as luck would have it was doyle drunk as usual and determined to join the party and though i endeavored to put him aside lascelles would not have it he insisted on being presented to the comrade of his gallant friend and in the private room where we went he overwhelmed doyle with details of our grand reconciliation and with bumper after bumper of krug this enabled me to fight shy of the wine but in ten minutes doyle was fighting drunk lascelles tipsy the driver came in for his pay saying he would go no further they had a row lascelles wouldnt pay called him an irish thief and all that i slipped my last v into the drivers hand and got him out somehow monsieur philippes or whatever his name was said he would go out hed get a cab in the neighborhood and the next thing i knew lascelles and doyle were in a fury of a row lascelles said all the irish were knaves and blackguards and swindlers and doyle stumbled around after him out came a pistol out came a knife i tripped doyle and got him into a chair and was so intent on pacifying him and telling him not to make a fool of himself that i didnt notice anything else i handled him goodnaturedly got the knife away and then was amazed to find that he had my own pet papercutter i made them shake hands and make up it was all a mistake said lascelles but what made it a worse mistake the old man would order more wine and with it brandy he insisted on celebrating this second grand reconciliation and then both got drunker but the tall frenchman had lascelless pistol and i had the knife and then a cab came and though it was storming beastly and i had ferrys duds on and larkins best tile and pierces umbrella we bundled in somehow and drove on down the levee leaving doyle in the hands of that amazon of a wife of his and a couple of doughboys who happened to be around there now lascelles was all hilarity singing joking confidential nothing would do but we must stop and call on a lovely woman a belle amie he could rely on our discretion he said laying his finger on his nose and looking sly and coquettish for all the world like some old rouй of a frenchman he must stop and see her and take her some wine indeed he said mysteriously it is a rendezvous well i was their guest i had no money what could i do it was then after eleven i should judge monsieur philippes or whatever his name was gave orders to the driver we pulled up and then to my surprise i found we were at doyles that ended it i told them they must excuse me they protested but of course i couldnt go in there so they took a couple of bottles apiece and went in the gate and i settled myself for a nap and got it i dont know how long i slept but i was aroused by the devils own tumult a shot had been fired men and women both were screaming and swearing some one suddenly burst into the cab beside me really pushed from behind and then away we went through the mud and the rain and the lightning was flashing now and presently i could recognize lascelles raging infвme coquin assassin were the mildest terms he was volleying at somebody and then recognizing me he burst into maudlin tears swore i was his only friend he had been insulted abused denied reparation was he hurt i inquired and instinctively felt for my knife it was still there where id hid it in the inside pocket of my overcoat no hurt not a blow did i suppose that he a frenchman would pardon that or leave the spot until satisfaction had been exacted then i begged him to be calm and listen to me for a moment i told him my plight that i had given my word to be at barracks that evening that i had no money left but i could go no further instantly he forgot his woes and became absorbed in my affairs parole dhonneur he would see that mine was never unsullied he himself would escort me to the maison de capitaine cram he would rejoice to say to that brave ennemi behold here is thy lieutenant of honor the most unsullied of courage the most admirable of heart the most magnanimous the lord only knows what he wouldnt have done had we not pulled up at his gate there i helped him out on the banquette he was steadied by his row whatever it had been he would not let me expose myself even under pierces umbrella he would not permit me to suffer from times so of the dog you will drive monsieur to his home and return here for me at once he ordered cabby grasped both my hands with fervent goodnight and the explanation that he had much haste implored pardon for leaving me on the morrow he would call and explain everything then darted into the gate we never could have parted on more friendly terms i stood a moment to see that he safely reached his door for a light was dimly burning in the hall then turned to jump into the cab but it wasnt there nothing was there i jumped from the banquette into a berth aboard some steamer out at sea they tell me the first thing i asked for was pierces umbrella and larkins hat and this was the story that waring maintained from first to last pills ventured a query as to whether the amount of krug and clicquot consumed might not have overthrown his mental equipoise no sam declared he drank very little the only bacchanalian thing i did was to join in a jovial chorus from a new french opera which lascelless friend piped up and i had heard in the north oui buvons buvons encore sil est un vin quon adore de paris а macao cest le clicquot cest le clicquot asked if he had formed any conjecture as to the identity of the stranger sam said no the name sounded like philippes but he couldnt be sure but when told that there were rumors to the effect that lascelless younger brother had been seen with him twice or thrice of late and that he had been in exile because if anything of a hopeless passion for madame his sisterinlaw and that his name was philippe waring looked dazed then a sudden light as of newer fresher memory flashed up in his eyes he seemed about to speak but as suddenly controlled himself and turned his face to the wall from that time on he was determinedly dumb about the stranger what roused him to lively interest and conjecture however was crams query as to whether he had not recognized in the cabman called in by the stranger the very one whom he had knocked endwise and who had tried to shoot him that morning no said waring the man did not speak at all that i noticed and i did not once see his face he was so bundled up against the storm but if it was the same party suggested he it seemed hardly necessary to look any further in explanation of his own disappearance cabby had simply squared matters by knocking him senseless helping himself to his watch and ring and turning out his pockets then hammering him until frightened off and then to cover his tracks setting him afloat in anatoles boat perhaps cabby took a hand in the murder too suggested sam with eager interest you say he had disappeared gone with his plunder now who else could have taken my knife then reynolds had something to tell him that the lady who wrote the anonymous letters the belle amie whom lascelles proposed to visit the occupant of the upper floor of the dovecot was none other than the blighted floweret who had appealed to him for aid and sympathy for fifty dollars at first and later for more the first year of his army service in the south for the sake of the old home then waring grew even more excited and interested pills put a stop to further developments for a few days he feared a relapse but in spite of pills the developments like other maladies throve the little detective came down again he was oddly inquisitive about that chanson а boire from fleur de thй would mr waring hum it for him and sam now sitting up in his parlor turned to his piano and with long slender fragilelooking fingers rattled a lively prelude and then faintly quavered the rollicking words odd said mr pepper as they had grown to call him i heard that sung by a fellow up in chartres street two nights handrunning before this thing happened a merry cuss too with a rather loose hand on his shekels lots of people may know it though maynt they no indeed not down here said sam it only came out in new york within the last four months and hasnt been south or west at all that i know of what did he look like well what did the feller that was with you look like but here sams description grew vague so pepper went up to have a beer by himself at the cafй chantant on chartres street and didnt return for nearly a week meantime came this exquisite april morning and sams appearance in the ponyphaeton in front of battery x even the horses seemed to prick up their ears and be glad to see him grim old war sergeants rode up to touch their caps and express the hope that theyd soon have the lieutenant in command of the right section again not but what lootnt ferrys doing firstrate sir and for a few minutes as his fair charioteer drove him around the battery in his weak languid voice waring indulged in a little of his own characteristic chaffing i expect you to bring this section up to top notch mr ferry as i am constitutionally opposed to any work on my own account i beg to call your attention sir to the fact that its very bad form to appear with fulldress schabraque on your horse when the battery is in fatigue the red blanket sir the red blanket only should be used be good enough to stretch your traces there right caisson yes i thought so swing trace is twisted carelessness mr ferry and indifference to duty are things i wont tolerate your cheekstrap too sir is an inch too long your bit will fall through that horses mouth this wont do sir not in my section sir ill fine you a box of partagas if it occurs again but the blare of the bugle sounding attention announced the presence of the battery commander nell whipped up in an instant and whisked her invalid out of the way goodmorning captain cram said he as he passed his smiling chief i regret to observe sir that things have been allowed to run down somewhat in my absence oh out with you you combination of cheek and incapacity or ill run you down with the whole battery oh waring some gentlemen in a carriage have just stopped at your quarters all in black too ah heres the orderly now and the card blackbordered handed into the phaeton bore a name which blanched warings face why what is it waring asked cram anxiously bending down from his saddle for a moment waring was silent mrs cram felt her own hand trembling can you turn the battery over to ferry and come with me asked the lieutenant certainly bugler report to lieutenant ferry and tell him i shall have to be absent for a while drive on nell when five minutes later waring was assisted up the stairway cram towering on his right the little party came upon a group of strangers three gentlemen one of whom stepped courteously forward raising his hat in a blackgloved hand he was of medium height slender erect and soldierly in bearing his face was dark and oval his eyes large deep and full of light he spoke mainly in english but with marked accent and the voice was soft and melodious i fear i have intrude have i the honor to address lieutenant waring i am philippe lascelles for a moment waring was too amazed to speak at last with brightening face and holding forth his hand he said i am most glad to meet you to know that it was not you who drove down with us that night alas no i left armand but that very morning returning to havana thence going to santiago it was not until five days ago the news reached me it is of that stranger i come to ask it was an odd council gathered there in warings room in the old barracks that april morning while ferry was drilling the battery to his hearts content and the infantry companies were wearily going over the manual or bayonet exercise old brax had been sent for and came monsieur lascelless friends both like himself soldiers of the south were presented and for their information warings story was again told with only most delicate allusion to certain incidents which might be considered as reflecting on the character and dignity of the elder brother and then philippe told his true there had been certain transactions between armand and himself he had fully trusted his brother a man of affairs with the management of the little inheritance which he a soldier had no idea how to handle and armands business had suffered greatly by the war it was touching to see how in every word the younger strove to conceal the fact that the elder had misapplied the securities and had been practically faithless to his trust everything he declared had been finally settled as between them that very morning before his return to havana armand had brought to him early all papers remaining in his possession and had paid him what was justly due he knew however that armand was now greatly embarrassed in his affairs they had parted with fond embrace the most affectionate of brothers but philippe had been seeing and hearing enough to make him gravely apprehensive as to armands future to know that his business was rapidly going downhill that he had been raising money in various ways speculating and had fallen into the hands of sharpers and yet armand would not admit it would not consent to accept help or to use his younger brothers property in any way the lawyer said philippe informed me that beau rivage was heavily mortgaged and it is feared that there will be nothing left for madame and nin nin though for that matter they shall never want what he had also urged and he spoke with reluctance here and owned it only because the detectives told him it was now well known was that armand had of late been playing the rфle of galant homme and that the woman in the case had fled of all this he felt he said bound to speak fully because in coming here with his witnesses to meet lieutenant waring and his friends he had two objects in view the first was to admit that he had accepted as fact the published reports that lieutenant waring was probably his brothers slayer had hastened back to new orleans to demand justice or obtain revenge had here learned from the lawyers and police that there were now other and much more probable theories having heard only one of which he had cried enough and had come to pray the forgiveness of mr waring for having believed an officer and a gentleman guilty of so foul a crime second he had come to invoke his aid in running down the murderer philippe was affected almost to tears there is one question i must beg to ask monsieur said waring as the two clasped hands is there not still a member of your family who entertains the idea that it was i who killed armand lascelles and philippe was deeply embarrassed ah monsieur he answered i could not venture to intrude myself upon a grief so sacred i have not seen madame and who is there who could who would tell her of armands and philippe broke off abruptly with despairing shrug and outward wave of his slender hand let us try to see that she never does know said waring these are the men we need to find the driver of the cab the stranger whose name sounded so like yours a tall swarthy blackhaired blackeyed fellow with pointed moustache cest lui cest bien lui exclaimed lascelles the very man who insisted on entering the private office where armand and i we close our affairs that morning his whispered words make my brother all of pale and yet he go off humming to himself oh well nail him said cram two of the best detectives in the south are on his trail now and then came ananias with a silver tray champagne and glasses from mrs cram and the conference went on another hour before the guests went off bless my soul said brax whose diameter seemed in no wise increased by the quart of roederer he had swallowed with such gusto bless my soul and to think i believed that we were going to have a duel with some of those fellows a fortnight or so ago then entered pills and ordered waring back to bed he was sleeping placidly when late that evening reynolds and cram came tearing up the stairway full of great news but the doctor said not to wake him meantime how fared it with that bruised reed the lone widow of the late lieutenant doyle poor old jim had been laid away with military honors under the flag at chalmette and his faithful bridget was spending the days in the public calaboose drunk and disorderly was the charge on which she had been arraigned and though she declared herself abundantly able to pay her fine twice over mr pepper had warned the authorities to keep her under lock and key and out of liquor as her testimony would be of vital importance if for nothing better than to send her up for perjury now she was alternately wheedling cursing coaxing bribing all to no purpose the agent of the lemaоtre property had swooped down on the dovecot and found a beggarly array of empty bottles and a good deal of discarded feminine gear scattered about on both floors one room in which certain detectives were vastly interested contained the unsavory relics of a late supper three or four empty champagnebottles some shattered glasses and what seemed most to attract them various stubs of partiallyconsumed cigarettes lay about the tables and floor adjoining this was the chamber which had been known as mrs dawsons and this too had been thoroughly explored louette who had disappeared after doyles tragic death was found not far away and the police thought it but fair that mrs doyle should not be deprived of the services of her maid then came other additions though confined in other sections of the city mr pepper wired that the party known as monsieur philippes had been run to earth and would reach town with him by train about the same time that another of the force returned from mobile by boat bringing a young man known as dawson and wanted as a deserter and a very sprightly young lady who appeared to move in a higher sphere of life but was unquestionably his wife for the officer could prove their marriage in south carolina in the spring of as mr pepper expressed it when he reported to reynolds its almost a full hand but for a fact its only a bobtail flush we need that cabman to fill how did you trace philippes asked reynolds him oh he was too darned musical it was what do you call it flure de tay that did for him why hes the fellow that raised all the money and most of the h ll for this old man lascelles hed been sharping him for years well when can we bring this thing to a head asked the aidedecamp poco tiempo by saturday i reckon but it came sooner waring was seated one lovely evening in a low reclining chair on mrs crams broad gallery sipping contentedly at the cup of fragrant tea she had handed him the band was playing and a number of children were chasing about in noisy glee the men were at supper the officers as a rule at mess for several minutes the semirestored invalid had not spoken a word in one of his customary daydreams he had been calmly gazing at the shapely white hand of his hostess all queenly with its weight of rings will you permit me to examine those rings a moment he said why certainly no you sit still mr waring she replied promptly rising and pulling them off her fingers dropped them into his open palm with the same dreamy expression on his clearcut pallid face he turned them over and over held them up to the light finally selected one exquisite gem and then half rising held forth the others as she took them and still stood beside his chair as though patiently waiting he glanced up oh beg pardon you want this i suppose and handing her the dainty teacup he calmly slipped the ring into his waistcoatpocket and languidly murmured thanks well i like that yes so do i rather better than the others may i ask what you purpose doing with my ring i was just thinking ive ordered a new amidon for larkin a new ninetydollar suit for ferry and i shall be decidedly poor this month even if we recover mertons watch oh well if its only to pawn one why not take a diamond but it isnt what then pray well again i was just thinking whether i could find another to match this up in town or send this one to her mr waring really and now mrs crams bright eyes are dancing with eagerness and delight for all answer though his own eyes begin to moisten and swim he draws from an inner pocket a dainty letter postmarked from a far far city to the northeast you dear fellow how can i tell you how glad i am i havent dared to ask you of her since we met at washington but oh my heart has been just full of her since since this trouble came god bless the trouble it was that that won her to me at last i have loved her ever since i first saw her long years ago oh oh oh if ned were only here im wild to tell him i may maynt i yes the moment he comes but ned brought a crowd with him when he got back from town a little later reynolds was there and philippe lascelles and mr pepper and they had a tale to tell that must needs be condensed they had all been present by invitation of the civil authorities at a very dramatic affair during the late afternoon the final lifting of the veil that hid from public view the strange eventful history of the lascelles tragedy cram was the spokesman by common consent with the exception of the dawsons said he none of the parties implicated knew up to the hour of his or her examination that any one of the others was to appear mrs dawson eager to save her own pretty neck had told her story without reservation dawson knew nothing the story had been wrung from her piecemeal but was finally told in full and in the presence of the officers and civilians indicated she had married in april to the scorn of her people a young yankee officer attached to the commissary department she had starved all through the war she longed for life luxury comforts she had nothing but her beauty he nothing but his pay the extravagances of a month swamped him the drink and desperation of the next ruined him he maintained her in luxury at the best hotel only a few weeks then all of his and much of uncle sams money was gone inspection proved him a thief and embezzler he fled and she was abandoned to her own resources she had none but her beauty and a gift of penmanship which covered the many sins of her orthography she was given a clerkship but wanted more money and took it blackmailing a quartermaster she imposed on waring but he quickly found her out and absolutely refused afterwards to see her at all she was piqued and angered a woman scorned but not until he joined battery x did opportunity present itself for revenge she had secured a room under mrs doyles reputable roof to be near the barracks where she could support herself by writing for mrs doyle and blackmailing those whom she lured and where she could watch him and to her eager delight she noted and prepared to make much of his attentions to madame lascelles incidentally too she might inveigle the susceptible lascelles himself on the principle that theres no fool like an old fool mrs doyle lent herself eagerly to the scheme the letters began to pass to and fro again lascelles was fool enough to answer and when all on a sudden mrs doyles longmissing relative as she called him turned up a pensioner on her charity it was through the united efforts of the two women he got a situation as cabdriver at the stable up at the eastern skirt of the town dawson had enlisted to keep from starving and though she had no use for him as a husband he would do to fetch and carry and he dare not disobey twice when doyle was battery officer of the day did this strangelyassorted pair of women entertain lascelles at supper and fleece him out of what money he had then came philippes with lascelles in mikes cab as luck would have it but they could not fleece philippes old lascelles was rapidly succumbing to nitas fascinations when came the night of the terrible storm mike had got to drinking and was laid low by the lieutenant mike and bridget both vowed vengeance but meantime doyle himself had got wind of something that was going on and he and his tyrant had a fearful row he commanded her never to allow a man inside the premises when he was away and though brought home drunk that awful night furiously ordered the frenchman out and might have assaulted them had not bridget lassoed him with a chloroformed towel that was the last he knew until another day lascelles philippes and she mrs dawson had already drunk a bottle of champagne when interrupted by doyles coming lascelles was tipsy had snatched his pistol and fired a shot to frighten doyle but had only enraged him and then he had to run for his cab he was bundled in and doyle disposed of it was only three blocks down to beau rivage and thither mike drove them in all the storm she did not know at the time of warings being in the cab in less than fifteen minutes mike was back and called excitedly for bridget had a hurried consultation with her she seized a waterproof and ran out with him but darted back and took the bottle of chloroform she had used on her husband now lying limp and senseless on a sofa below and then she disappeared when half an hour passed and lascelles failed to return with them bringing certain papers of which hed been speaking to philippes the latter declared there must be something wrong and went out to reconnoitre despite the storm he could see nothing it was after midnight when mrs doyle came rushing in gasping all out of breath along of the storm she said she had been down the levee with mike to find a cushion and laprobe he dropped and couldnt afford to lose they never could have found it at all but for ould lascelles lending them a lantern he wanted mike to bring down two bottles of champagne hed left here but it was storming so that he would not venture again and lieutenant waring she said was going to spend the night with lascelles at beau rivage mike couldnt drive any farther down towards the barracks lascelles sent word to philippes that hed bring up the papers first thing in the morning if the storm lulled and philippes went out indignant at all the time lost but mike swore hed not drive down again for a fortune so the frenchman got into the cab and went up with him to town the moment he was gone mrs doyle declared she was dead tired used up and drank huge goblets of the wine until she reeled off to her room leaving an apron behind then mrs dawson went to her own room after putting out the lights and when two days later she heard the awful news of the murder knowing that investigation would follow and she and her sins be brought to light she fled for she had enough of his money in her possession and poor demented dawson finding her gone followed philippess story corroborated this in every particular the last he saw of the cab or of the cabman was near the house of the hookandladder company east of the french market the driver there said his horse was dead beat and could do no more so philippes went into the market succeeded in getting another cab by paying a big price slept at cassidys waited all the morning about lascelless place and finally having to return to the northeast at once he took the evening train on the jackson road and never heard of the murder until ten days after he was amazed at his arrest and then came before his examiners a mere physical wreck the shadow of his former self caught at the high tide of a career of crime and debauchery a much less bulky party than the truculent jehu of madame lascelless cab yet no less important a witness than that same driver he was accompanied by a priest he had been brought hither in an ambulance from the hфteldieu where he had been traced several days before and found almost at deaths door his confession was most important of all he had struck lieutenant waring as that officer turned away from lascelless gate intending only to down and then kick and hammer him but he had struck with a leadloaded rubber club and he was horrified to see him drop like one dead then he lost his nerve and drove furiously back for bridget together they returned and found waring lying there as he had left him on the dripping banquette youve killed him mike theres only one thing to do she said take his watch and everything valuable he has and well throw him over on the levee she herself took the knife from his overcoatpocket lest he should recover suddenly and then said the driver even as we were bending over him there came a sudden flash of lightning and there was lascelles bending over us demanding to know what it meant then like another flash he seemed to realize what was up sprang back and drew pistol he had caught us in the act there was nothing else to do we both sprang upon him he fired and hit me but only in the arm and before he could pull trigger again we both grappled him i seized his gun bridget his throat but he screamed and fought like a tiger then wilted all of a sudden i was scared and helpless but she had her wits about her and told me what to do the lieutenant began to gasp and revive just then so she soaked the handkerchief in chloroform and placed it over his mouth and together we lifted him into the cab then we raised lascelles and carried him in and laid him on his sofa for he had left the door open and the lamp on the table bridget had been there before and knew all about the house we set the pistol back in his hand but couldnt make the fingers grasp it we ransacked the desk and got what money there was locked and bolted the doors and climbed out of the side window under which she dropped the knife among the bushes theyll never suspect us in the world mike she said its the lieutenants knife that did it and as he was going to fight him anyhow hell get the credit of it all then we drove up the levee put waring in anatoles boat sculls and all and shoved him off ill muzzle jim she said ill make him believe twas he that did it when he was drunk she took most of the money and the watch and ring she said she could hide them until theyd be needed then i drove philippes up to town until i began to get so sick and faint i could do no more i turned the cab loose and got away to a house where i knew theyd take care of me and from there when my money was gone they sent me to the hospital thinking i was dying i swear to god i never meant to more than get square with the lieutenant i never struck lascelles at all twas she who drove the knife into his heart then exhausted he was led into an adjoining room and mrs doyle was marched in the picture of injured irish innocence for ten minutes with wonderful effrontery and nerve she denied all personal participation in the crime and faced her inquisitors with brazen calm then the chief quietly turned and signalled an officer led forward from one side the wreck of a cabman supported by the priest a door opened on the other and escorted by another policeman mrs dawson reentered holding in her hands outstretched a gingham apron on which were two deep stains the shape and size of a long straightbladed twoedged knife it was the apron that bridget doyle had worn that fatal night one quick furtive look at that one glance at her trembling shrinking cowering kinsman and with an irish howl of despair a loud wail of mike mike youve sworn your sisters life away she threw herself upon the floor tearing madly at her hair and so ended the mystery of beau rivage there was silence a moment in crams pretty parlor when the captain had finished his story waring was the first to speak there is one point i wish theyd clear up whats that said cram whos got mertons watch oh by jove i quite forgot its all right waring anatoles place was pulled last night and he had her valuables all done up in a box to pay for his boat he said a quarter of a century has passed away since the scarlet plumes of light battery x were last seen dancing along the levee below new orleans beau rivage old and mossgrown at the close of the war fell into rapid decline after the tragedy of that april night heavily mortgaged the property passed into other hands but for years never found a tenant far and near the negroes spoke of the homestead as haunted and none of their race could be induced to set foot within its gates one night the sentry at the guardhouse saw sudden light on the westward sky and then a column of flame again the firealarm resounded among the echoing walls of the barracks but when the soldiers reached the scene a seething ruin was all that was left of the old southern home somebody sent cram a marked copy of a new orleans paper and in their cosey quarters at fort hamilton the captain read it aloud to his devoted nell the old house has been vacant an object of almost superstitious dread to the neighborhood said the times ever since the tragic death of armand lascelles in the spring of in police annals the affair was remarkable because of the extraordinary chain of circumstantial evidence which for a time seemed to fasten the murder upon an officer of the army then stationed at jackson barracks but whose innocence was triumphantly established madame lascelles it is understood is now educating her daughter in paris whither she removed immediately after her marriage a few months ago to captain philippe lascelles formerly of the confederate army a younger brother of her first husband well said cram ill have to send that to waring theyre in vienna by this time i suppose look here nell how was it that when we fellows were fretting about warings attentions to madame you should have been so serenely superior to it all even when as i know the stories reached you ah ned i knew a story worth two of those he was in love with natalie maitland all the time the end
