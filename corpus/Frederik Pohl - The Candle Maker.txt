 the candle lighter the trusteeship director fished out a pack of ciga rettes and offered them to jaffa doane i heard your speech last night he said cigarette i dont smoke said jaffa doane it was a good speech the director lit his cigarette thoughtfully flicked the match away doane waited with patience in his eyesan expression that seemed very much out of place on the face of jaffa doane but doane had practiced patience before the directors invitation had reached him that morning he knew it was coming you cant tell blunt truths on a world hookup and not expect to make a stir the director said ive checked your record doane its a good one you have consistently fought for a lot of things that i happen to believe in myself naturally i think youre off base this time but i was with you on the kaffirs i was with you on the ainus ill be with you again im sure in fact if you look it up in the books of your equality league youll find that i sent in my two dollars dues long ago he peered at doane under his eyebrows and chuckled dont look so surprised i cant help it doane said severely after what your administration has done to the martians the martians why thosenever mind he clamped the words down in his throat just what he demanded have we done to them doane leaned forward turned them into savages ex ploited them degraded them reduced them to barbarism do you want the entire catalogue sir know how the mars trusteeship has been run the administrators have made themselves gods sir godsl their every whim is a commandment thats what youve done the director managed a smile though his nostrils were flaring i said i heard your speech he reminded doane you had some suggestions to make didnt you i did said doane proudly and among them you suggested that we remove ad ministrator kellem and replace him with someone accept able to the equality league it was kellems handling of the general mercantile incident was i know the director interrupted and for the first time his smile relaxed i have here a radiogram from the administration comzone on mars read it mr doane doane took it suspiciously but as he read he began to beam medical checkup shows lowpressure asthma approaching tertiary stage incurable and dan gerous without immediate permanent return to earth request immediate clearance for replacement and retirement kellem mars doane gloated hes retiring lowpressure asthma my foot i thought the stink from general mercantile would drive him out the director said in a level tone kellem almost died last week doane all right doane shrugged it makes no difference in any case i demand to be consulted in choosing his successor the director eyed him you do do you he pressed a button on his desk and said ask ne mieek to come in a sexy contralto replied yes sir the director looked at doane ever seen a martian he asked you take such an interest in them i wonder if youve ever met one facetoface i mean the pictures dont quite do them justice no well its about time you did he stood up and gestured toward the door jaffa doane he said meet ne mieek doane rose and turned to see who was coming in he swallowed how do you do he managed to say a suppressed sighing sound came from the thing that dragged itself through the doorway doane thought it formed words in a sort of airless whisper the sound that might be made by a man with a slashed throat it went gid f nw y the vowels were almost inaudible the consonants as though they were being forced out against a gag it was english all right you could make it out if you tried but if the things words were understandable its ex pression was not as the director had said you had to meet a martian in the flesh photos did not give more than a hint on the squashed whitely translucent face was what doane thought a grin of savage glee while the huge dull eyes held inexpressible sorrow neither interpretation doane told himself meant much that was anthrophomor phic thinking and dangerous but those looks took a little getting used to all the same dont try to shake hands with him mr doane said the director he hasnt any it was true four supple articulated tentacles waved around themartians midsection but there were no hands or arms the pearshaped body was supported on stubby little legs which had neither knee nor ankle as far as jaffa doane could see the director was saying ne mieek is the martian legate here in washington and like kellem the strain of an alien environment has hurt his health hell be going back to mars on your ship doane and youll be working with him working with him doane gasped the director allowed himself a look of surprise havent you figured it out yet doane since we must replace kellem anyhow we have decided to grant the equality leagues request we are picking a man for the post that the league is certain to approvebecause he is the president of it i mean you mr doane me me but ive never been on mars in eighteen days said the director you will no longer be able to make that statement that is unless you refuse the appointment jaffa doane stood up and there was corrosive anger in his voice youd like that wouldnt you you want me to turn it down so you can tell the news services what a lot of hot air the president of the equality league really is well i can recognize a shoddy little political trick when i see one you hand me a political hot potato throw me in on a job that your fatcats have finally messed up to the point where there are riots and investigations if things go wrong im the goat that shuts up the equality league if things go right your administration gets the credit i take it you refuse said the director no sir i dont refuse its a cheap trickand ill make you wish youd never thought of it i accept he looked over his shoulder at the martian who had become in the space of a heartbeat one of his charges jaffa doane couldnt help wincing a littlethey did look so much like ragged corpses but he said come along ne mieek were going to your home for more than a million members of the equality league jaffa doane was a severe and shining leader his words were trumpet calls and his surging drive for justice was a bright flame one or two of the members however took a more personal view of their president among them a young lady whose name was ruthann wharton on the books she was listed as mr doanes personal secretary but it had been several months now since she had first begun to contemplate a promotion for herself it had occurred to her that the eighteenday flight to mars on the shuttle rocket might provide the time and leisure for jaffa doane to notice just what a pearl he had as a secretary but it had been a disappointing voyage doane had kept to his stateroom most of the way a hatful of hours out of marsport ruthann was banging on her bosss stateroom door jaffa she called plaintively and not for the first time ne mieek and another martian are waiting for you please hurry doanes low controlled voice said ill be there in a moment miss wharton she scowled at the door ill give you exactly one minute but she didnt give him that much she ham mered again jaffa theyre waiting pause then the calm relaxed voice yes of course one moment ruthann stamped her foot oh darn you she said and did what she had wanted to do in the first place she turned the knob and walked in theyve been waiting half an hour and ne mieek says its very important the room was in semidarkness lit only by the light from the corridor outside from the rumpled heap of bedclothing jaffa doanes voice said placidly im aware of that miss wharton her hands found the light switch the bedclothing erupted and jaffa doane sat up leaning on an elbow blinking at her what he croaked blearily say havent i asked you to call me only from the outside you have she said hotly flinging back the rayscreen on the port the tempered glass was treated to filter out most of the glare but the direct sunlight lit up the little room like a movie set get up she ordered if youre not outside and fully dressed in five minutes im coming back and ill dress you myself anyway jaffa it looks as if it really is important ne mieek is sighing and talking about your duty to your job and the other martianwell its hard to tell every thing considered but he looks sick sick jaffa doane yawned and scratched sick how ruthann shook her head come on out and see for yourself looking hazily at his face in the mirror of the tiny washroom as he shaved jaffa doane decided that ruth ann after all was right he did have a tendency to be not difficult exactly not grumpy or nasty but a little hard to wake up in the mornings and besides this was an important day he was about to meet his charges he wiped off the depilatory and stubble and stood erect eyes burning into his own reflection in the mirror the sound of his stateroom door made him jump im coming right out he yelled in the room that had been fitted out as his office for the duration of the tripand which he had hardly set foot inne mieek and ruthann were waiting with them was another martian and looking at him jaffa doane knew what the girl had meant when she said there was something wrong a strapping young adult martian with a life expectancy of hundreds of years somewhat re sembles a wilting fungus but this one looked rotten good morning ne mieek jaffa doane said cour teously what can i do for you the martians wheezy voice was somewhat easier to understand in the spaceships halfandhalf atmosphere pressure an even eight pounds to the square inch compo sition largely heliumthan it had been when he was laboring to force his voice into the dense earth air in deed you can honored sir gadian pluur has the sickness and wishes your honor to cure him in the way that is known jaffa doanes eyebrows went up cure him you mean you want me to call a doctor ah no whispered the martian your honor will cure him yourself surely ruthann was signaling you dont know what he wants do you she said in a low tone good heavens no she nodded smugly he wants you to touch this other one thats all just touch him touch him doane stared at the martian ne mieek are you out of your mind not so the martian whispered indignantly the mad face working it is our custom as is known the ad ministrator kellem and the admiral rosenman who was his assistant have always healed those ill of the sickness barbarous marveled jaffa doane forgetting to be angry and you an intelligent manan intelligent mar tian like you you believe in this there is nothing to believe or disbelieve sighed ne mieek his tentacles agitated the pale eyes desolate it is our custom since the first of your honored administrators came doane shook his head wonderingly touch him ruthann advised but go ahead touch him doane frowned miss wharton this is a matter of principle i am responsible not only to the trusteeship director but to the league and i certainly couldnt justify touch him the girls face was set doane was about to reply but the ship gave a gentle coursecorrecting lurch and everyone in the little room staggered slightlyeveryone but the sick martian gadian pluur who staggered halfway across the room and brushed against doanes fingers jaffa doane jerked back his hand it had been a curious sensation almost like an electric shock but not localized he could feel a tiny tingle up his backbone and at the base of his skull thanks to your honor whispered ne mieek and the two martians slipped slowly out leaving jaffa doane staring frustratedly after them but i have a speech all ready doane objected rea sonably jfs not just a lot of glowing promises and empty words but facts it tells how i am going to put a stop to he hesitated over the word the indiscretions of the previous administrators admiral rosenman said cheerfully fine he was a chunky man with a big head of curly white hair and he wore the severe uniform as though he had been born with it on but you cant get out of the conjunction offering thats nothing short of murder and my speech its merely an execution mr doane the martian has had his trial and he has been convicted its up to you but im not a hangman youre the earth administrator on mars and one of your duties is carrying out the decisions of the martian courts doane glowered whats he convicted of he de manded suspiciously whats the difference under the martian laws its a crime punishable by death they call it bad thinking bad thinking doane shook his head and walked over to the window of the adbuilding office that was now his the orange sandscape dotted with smoketrees hurt his eyes it was the martian idea of a formal park in the heart of the little city of marsport and it was a great honor to have ones office looking out over it or so the martians thought they also thought it was an honor to be the executioner in what seemed to have some of the aspects of a ritual murder i cant even see the conjunction of the moons doane said peevishly the martians can both moons are perfectly visible to them and this conjunction offering is traditional what did they do back forty or fifty years ago before the first earth men got here admiral rosenman shrugged and glanced at the clock you ought to be getting ready he said am i dis missed youre dismissed doane said ungraciously and frowned at the admirals back as he left using the weav ing flatfooted mars walk that doane had not yet mastered he sat down at his desk carefully allowing for the light gravitationand misjudged it as he had six times before and bumped his shin against the desk as he had six times before ruthann wharton said sympatheticauy it takes a lit tle getting used to do you want me to come to the con junction offering with you no theres no need to take my skin off he said stiffly i am sorry miss wharton perhaps im a little upset i understand jaffa it didnt seem like this back on earth he said mo rosely staring out at the smoketrees you havent heard the worst of it miss wharton not only do i have to slit some poor devils throat this eveningnot only am i expected to perform the laying on of hands like somebody from the dark agesbut look at this he turned to his desk and picked up a thick sheaf of papers duties for the earth administratorme the most ridiculous mass of superstitious nonsense i ever saw if this is the way kellem kept the martians down i can understand why there were riots at the general mercantile base at niobe but those were earthmen involved in the brawl jaffa not martians how do you know he asked pugnaciously because kellems publicity men said so all we know for sure is that there was trouble theres bound to be trouble when you try to keep an intelligent civilized race like ne mieeks down with barbarous tricks like these he glanced at the list and flinched well theres an end to it he said grimly kellems gone and im here now ill be at the conjunction ceremony tonight all right and ill start things rolling right then and there youll see im telling you miss wharton mars is going towhats the matter he demanded irritably you look like youve got a question the girl nodded emphatically i have why do you call me miss wharton instead of ruthann the conjunction offering was to take place in what the martians had named the park of sparse beauty its sparse enough jaffa doane said from the rostrum watching the martians gather before him but is it beau tiful enough admiral rosenman asked sourly are you ready for the ceremony oh quite ready said jaffa doane he started to hum to himself with a satisfied air but you do not hum with oxygen plugs in your nostrils he coughed and choked and looked at the admiral suspiciously but the admiral wasnt laughing the admiral didnt think he had very much to laugh about he had been on duty on mars for seven years sur viving five administrators only one of whom had com pleted his threeyear term he had formed certain con clusions about the martians and one of them was that they werent too likely to get along well with the likes of jaffa doane it was dark and the martians carried torchesnot flam ing brands for flames do not thrive in mars thin atmos phere but glowing balls of punk from the little bushes that grew wild in the wide reaches between settlements the scene was hardly brightly illuminated martian eyes were not human eyes though and to them doane realized it might have been bright as day he looked fruitlessly at the spot in the sky where the two moons were supposed to be in conjunction with a particular star one moon was visible the other not the star might or might not be visiblewith all the stars in the martian sky one more or less made very little differ ence but to the martians of course with their very much more acute vision both moons were as visible as luna from earth and each star of the tens of thousands was an individual in its own right jaffa doane sighed it was hard remembering all the differences between martians and earthmenand trying to remember at the same time the diamondclear prin ciples of the equality league which said that the differ ences were as nothing there was no sound of trumpets no burst of prompted applause from the idly drifting audience but all of a sud den the ceremony seemed to have begun ne mieek ap peared on the high platform where the earth party was standing in three of your minutes and eleven seconds as is known to your honor he said the conjunction will occur this is he who is to die he stepped aside to reveal another martian who gestured courteously with his tentacles this is fnihi bel the condemned martian said politely it is an honor to meet your honor i am most sorry for the circum stances doane looked embarrassedly at ruthann and the admiral he had had no lessons in how jack ketch greeted his clients there was no precedent in his experi ence with the equality league to guide him in the proper conduct of the maulman meeting the steer at the top of the slippery chute but the martian was tactful he said since i shall not have the power afterward let me now thank your honor for the greatest of favors for killing you doane blurted scandalized he made a face expressing his mood about the enforced sub jection of the martians it was wasted on the martians who expressed their feelings with formalized gestures of the tentacles but not on admiral rosenman who licked his lips and started to speak but not soon enough fnihi bel doane said com passionately under the authority vested in me as ad ministrator i grant a stay of execution pending review of your case you shall not die tonight admiral rosenman swore and looked helplessly at ruthann if the crazy idiot had only talked it over first no not him he made up his mind ten years before he ever saw a martian and nothings going to change it especially facts what facts asked ruthann hotly you never told him anything its all in the files which he hasnt had a chance to look at honestly admiral youre unreasonable ruthann looked fret fully out the window it was nearly daybreak the sharp martian dawn had popped into light over the horizon minutes before do you suppose hes all right the admiral growled and flipped the switch on the intercom any word the uniformed man whose face appeared in the screen said not yet sir the administrator was seen about an hour ago near the shacks a detail has gone to search the area but they havent reported in yet all right the admiral grumbled clicking off what are the shacks ruthann wanted to know abandoned part of town the martians gave it up years ago nobody lives there now unpleasant place serves him right the watch yourself ruthann warned hes your boss the admiral glowered at her but stopped he yawned and stretched not used to staying up all night any more he said kind of takes it out of me but go ahead he snapped as the intercom called hi name administrator doane has been located by the search party sir said the officer any orders hold him there roared the admiral and get a car in front of the door in thirty secondsim going to meet him he clicked off the switch as ruthann corrected were going to meet him admiral if that big stuffedshirt thinks he can scare me out of my wits and stir up every martian from here to hey wait a minute the admiral protested i thought you wouldnt let me call him names thats you ruthann said shortly the rules are different for me come on admiral what are you wait ing for they found earth administrator jaffa doane sitting on the ramp before an abandoned and decrepit martian dwelling staring into space admiral rosenman dismissed the detail and helped the administrator into the pres surized car doanes attention was elsewhere rosenman had to remind him even to take the oxygen plugs out of his nostrils thanks said doane absently and after a pause i messed it up didnt i you did the admiral told him you messed it up enough to put fortyeight martians in the hospitalthe earth hospital doane biinked for physical injuries the admiral explained the martians dont ordinarily hospitalize for that a couple of hours of what they call good thinking and they can patch almost anything thats wrong with themselves but these were pretty well beat up mostly from running into moving vehicles and i dont think theres a martian within fifty miles thats capable of good thinking right now jaffa doane shook his head i dont get it he com plained all i did was try to save a mans life maybe i was wrong dont know but how could it make so much trouble rioting like crazy people getting themselves run overand all because of a thing like that i could under stand it if they were ignorant natives only theyre not ignorant they have a civilization of their own how can these silly customs mean so much to them the admiral exploded dont you understand yet it is not just a silly custom they were crazy all right but not because you violated a silly tabubecause you did the thing that was bound to drive them insane you pushed them across the brink they were sick infected by you but dont argue with me sickness is not only of the body even an earthman can have mental illnesses too and martians have no other kind shock them and they get sick when theyre sick they need to be healed if you break a leg you splint it if a martians mind is injured it needs to be splinted with a stronger stabler mind think back to the ship doane when ne mieek begged you to touch the other martian did you think it was only a primitive custom it was not it was splinting and healing when you made contact with him his mind was braced against yours and you were the one who helped him grow well doane swallowed all right he said reasonably granted but thats one thing and murder is another what about the one i was supposed to kill the same principle doane even a martian doesnt live foreverj and when he is too sick to be cured he has to die the only way a martian can die is by being phys ically destroyed he cant kill himself no martian can he cant be killed by another martianthe shock would destroy him so youre elected doanethe strongest stablest being on marsthe earth administrator doane protested but what about the time before the earthmen were here how did they manage rosenman shrugged they didnt have earthmen to do the dirty work so they used martians of course but you said i know what i said take a look around you doane he gestured out the window at the rickety abandoned buildings called the shacks compared with the clean functional lines of the rest of the martian architecture the shacks were a hideous blot they leaned and they staggered they were put to gether at random distances out of random materials they looked unfit for even human habitation much less mar tian this is where they lived the outcasts rosenman said the strongest and healthiest of every generation selected by rigorous tests and segregated into a caste of healers it was an honor to be a healer doanethe greatest most tragic honor that a martian could attain read the martian literature it has noble stories in it the healers who sacrificed themselves for others they were untouchables there were a couple of hundred of them all the time right here in the shacks injured mentally every time they had to put an incurable out of his misery until they were beyond repair and had to be destroyed after a few years of agonizing service and when we came we became the untouchables rosenman hesitated well not exactly he said a little less roughly we took over the functions of the healers to some extent yes after all we earthmen arent as sensitive and just for that reason were more stable but of course even we crack up when the pressure is too great suppose the picture was different doane sup pose it was the martians who were stronger and stabler and suppose they came to earth and showed us a way of emptying our asylums we use psychiatrists because theyre all we haveall the martians had were the healers but the healers werent altogether satisfactory as you can see because its an expensive cure that merely passes the disease on to someone else our psychiatrists arent as effective as they should be eithertheyre human too they have their own problems which seriously interfere with and become intermingled with those of their patients if the martians had come to us with a real cure not the halfcure that psychiatrists are capable of wed be stupid to go on using inadequate therapy and the mar tians arent stupid in fact thats the mistake you and your equality league made the administrator flared thats enough resenman the equality league never wait a minute admit it doaneyou came here all full of redhot ideas about how the earth masters should be kind to their martian slaves no dont argue thats how it looked to you think it over but the martians arent slaves you see in many ways theyre more cul tured and smarter and a lot more sensitive than you and in some ways in fact they remind me of my grand father your what doane gasped baffled my grandfather he was a very religious man the ad miral explained reminiscently every friday night wed have the candles for the sabbath andwell i dont know how familiar you are with the ritual but on the sabbath the truly orthodox arent allowed to work from sundown to sundown not even lighting the candles so my grand father used to hire an irish kid from the neighborhood to be our candle lightera shabbas goy he called him marty madden the boys name was marty wasnt any better than we were or any worse dont think my grandfather ever thought that but he was in that one way different he could do something for us that we werent allowed to do for ourselves so naturally he did it just as you and i doane do things for the martians that they cant do for themselves the admiral started the car for the trip back i used to know marty pretty well he said we went to the same school during the week in a way i was sorry for himhe missed all the fun of the feasts and so on in another way i envied him because he could do things i couldnt but i never thought that so many years later forty million miles from mosholu parkway id be taking his job away from him they rode back to the administration building in silence for most of the way while jaffa doane digested some of the most illtasting realizations of his career as the building came into sight he shook himself and sat up all right he said humbly ill start all over make believe i landed this morning where do i start rosenman smiled and leaned over to pat his shoulder youll do he promised where you start is in the clinic youll find about fifty martians with some degree of shock needing the healing touch of a sound mind like yours it wont be too bad youll have a headache afterward but you can take a minor discomfort like that cant you gladly doane said thats the least i can do i want to apologize to both of you you too ruthann ive been about as big a selfcentered wrongheaded she cut him off oh dont get all wound up youre a bit of a phony heaven knows she ignored the strangled noise he madebut there are worse deep down inside youre quite a guy you wouldnt be as much of a man as you are if you didnt have a little ham in you and a touch of pigheadedness too ive given the matter a lot of thought you see rosenman grinned at doanes expression shes right he agreed between us well get you straightened out so dont worry about it two more years here ought to do it basically your ideas are rightthe martians ought to learn to get by on their own feet you can start finding out how they can do it itll be good for you when the two years of your term are up youll go home with a better more human understanding of whats what ready to settle down to a normal productive existence on earth with your wife and family doane yelped hold on there i havent got a wife much less a family ruthann patted his arm reassuringly youre not home yet she said
