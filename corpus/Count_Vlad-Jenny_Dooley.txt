 chapter one a telegram from count dracula it was early autumn in the year alfred sackvillejones and lord ernest deboy were sitting in front of an open fire in alfreds apartment on the table lay a heap of bones all that remained of the meal they had just eaten licking a finger alfred got to his feet now after such a satisfying and filling meal ernest my dear fellow i suggest that we finish off with one of my very special wines alfred pulled the cork from a dusty bottle and filled a glass with dark red wine his eyes lit up as he passed the glass under his nose perfect absolutely perfect maison d armignac ive been saving it for a special occasion special occasion what are we celebrating old boy first of all my birthday which of course you completely forgot and secondly the end of another successful adventure alfred passed the glass to ernest who raised it in the air with a smile sorry for forgetting your birthday dear boy ive got a hopeless memory im not sure i even know my own birthday what age am i anyway twentyeight or twentynine youre thirtythree and a liar you have a brilliant memory you know by heart everything about every bat that has ever existed ah now thats different alfred who worked for a newspaper called the globe and lord ernest had just returned from norway where they had solved an unusual case a count and his family had gone to live in an old castle that the counts uncle had loft him in his will however after a week a strange figure without a head and dressed like a viking began appearing at midnight the viking roared as loudly as he could and scared everybody naturally everybody in the castle was very upset which was why they asked alfred and lord ernest for help as he drank his wine ernest looked out through the window into the streets of london but all he could see was smoke and fog you know alfred old chap i have to admit that this is jolly good wine you dont happen to have any more do you by any chance alfred poured more wine and ernest made himself comfortable again you know i rather like this ghosthunting business ernest began to laugh as he lit his pipe what a hopeless actor that viking was quite terrible ive seen better acting done by great aunt agathas church drama group he sounded more like a mouse than a monster what a devil imagine trying to frighten the family out of the castle so that he could claim it as his well we solved that case which makes three so far this year i think were becoming quite famous alfred went to his desk and picked up the newspaper and looked admiringly at the headline britons find vikings missing head suddenly he looked very serious do you believe in ghosts ernest id like to but im very much afraid they dont exist a pity really well im not so sure just then the doorbell rang which made both men jump a little who on earth can it be at this time of night a minute or so later alfreds servant entered holding a telegram alfred tore it open he disliked telegrams his eyes moved quickly down the paper a look of relief appeared on his face you know i think were in business again my dear ernest its from guess who oh come on dont keep me in suspense count dracula of transylvania count dracula dracula the name rings a bell i believe you have got a bad memory after all those pointed teeth ill never forget them as long as i live enough to make your blood run cold teeth yes of course a handsome pair all right perfect for sucking blood eh and those bloodshot eyes what a funny looking man he was and what a frightful accent he sounded like an old frog well come on alfred held the telegram under the lamp and started reading dracula village th november will always remember my visit to england and particularly meeting you and your remarkable friend who knows so much about bats i have bad news i am dying and badly in need of your help i wish to clear the dracula name before i leave this world please come quickly yours count vlad dracula alfred noticed the excitement on lord ernests face how about it then old chap can you pack your bags by tomorrow and be at the station by em let me see alfred took the train timetable from the shelf and looked up the departure times from charing cross to dover am or pm old boy why am of course thought so you know how i hate getting up early in the morning i can always go without you ernest jumped up out of his chair no you will not i wouldnt miss this for the world all right then meet you at the station at and dont be late alfred took his friend to the front door and waited until a cab appeared out of the thick fog the next day on the train to dover alfred was reading an early morning newspaper the headline on page three caught his eye ernest look at this vampire count dead ernest halfopened his eyes and looked sleepily at his friend whats that count dracula of transylvania died this morning in his castle near vilcea transylvania after a short illness oh and look at this it says a report from a reliable source says that before his death the count had asked two british experts to clear his name good heavens news travels fast well now that hes dead i suppose theres no point in going on the newspaper nearly fell out of alfreds hands what are you saying im certainly not going back ernest think of what youll be missing you might even get the chance to see the transylvanian vampire bat in person ernests eyes suddenly came alive all right youve persuaded me wonderful wonderful alfred lay back happily in his seat and allowed the rhythm of the train to send him to sleep suddenly he woke up with a start ernest do you think weve got everything we need you mean passports and so on well no i was thinking more of em protection let me see ive got my derringer my buffalo knife and some rope that should do and of course i was twice boxing champion at school well yes but i was wondering whether we should have brought a cross with us and em maybe some garlic i had no idea you were religious old boy and as for garlic i didnt know you had french tastes ernest burst into laughter which made alfred feel rather silly so he picked up his paper noisily and pretended to read ernest just fell back to sleep dreaming he was in a coffin and meeting the vampire bat chapter two a visit to count vlad the journey across europe was long and tiring ernest slept most of the day waking at night to study the night life through the carriage window or read his favourite writer edgar allan poe while alfred read endless books about famous people in transylvanian history by the time they reached vienna he knew all there was to know about every dracula back to the th century as the train made its way deeper into draculas country alfred was just finishing the fifth and last volume of complete history of transylvania fascinating it was partly thanks to him that the turks didnt conquer the rest of europe they say he was a fearless officer loved by his men who on earth are you talking about dear fellow i wish you wouldnt always expect me to read your mind the first dracula prince vlad dracula a great chap he had one little weakness though he enjoyed torturing his prisoners by pushing sharp pieces of wood through their stomach or tearing their body apart charming fellow it doesnt say anything about him drinking their blood too does it it seems that only the present count enjoys or should i say enjoyed human blood hard to believe really seemed pretty harmless to me it was those teeth of his not exactly what one would like ones dear old granny to have ernest for goodness sake how can humans suck blood just like vampire bats do dear boy through holes in their teeth theres no such thing as a vampire human is there thats what were here to find out dear boy isnt it sometimes you can be quite absurd now let me ask this kind old gentleman when we are expected to arrive in vilcea an old oneeyed man looked out of the window and pointed to the sky he looked at him out of the corner of his good eye and asked him where are you going stranger castle dracula to help the count with a spot of trouble its a bit hush hush you know at the name dracula the old man turned away from alfred in horror funny chap he doesnt seem to like foreigners four hours later just as the moon was appearing above the top of the mountain the train pulled into vilcea station alfred and ernest along with one other passenger got off and walked to the entrance to find draculas servant who was supposed to meet them there i hope he got our message i dont fancy staying here the night hardly had alfred spoken than a crooked old man appeared from the shadows his name was gregory and he wore a black overcoat black gloves and a black top hat he spoke so quietly that alfred had to bend over to hear him aleferd shackwill gons and lourd ernist i suppose just call me alfred i think it would be easier it was very good of follow alfred and ernest followed the old man to where a black carriage and two black horses were waiting outside as soon as they had got in the driver set off on the last part of their journey to dracula castle alfred was woken up by the sound of horses hooves on wood the carriage had stopped on the bridge over the water surrounding dracula castle then they passed under the thick stone walls by the dim light of the carriage ernest caught a glimpse of the enormous old door did you see that alfred a bat youve got bats on the brain dear boy no really carved on the door im sure it was a vampire bat when they entered the main building of the castle the two servants were standing in deadly silence ready to receive them they too were in black and their unsmiling faces looked like carved stone rodolfo the counts butler was a giant of a man and had a large head with deep hollow eyes mania the cook was about half his size and even older than gregory with a shrunken head covered in thin white hair as mania took them up to their room the sound of their feet echoed through the empty castle she said nothing just grunted and puffed as she slowly climbed the spiral stone steps finally alone alfred threw himself on the big fourposter bed and felt the soft velvet covers i dont know about you old boy but ive been looking forward to this moment for weeks ernest was wide awake and examining the room with his candle the silence is quite scary isnt it this place must be full of ghosts you cant scare me old boy im so tired id even share my bed with a ghost just as he said that he heard a tap which made him sit up with a start old gregory halfopened the door and held out a letter mr aleferd shackwill a letter from my master thats funny i thought the count was dead i expect he wrote it before he died just as gregory had left ernest let out a cry from the other end of the bedroom you know i think youve been given the counts bedroom ernest shone his candle on the portrait of the count on the wall the teeth were not visible only the dark bloodshot eyes alfred looked at the pillow where the counts head once lay do you mean to say that the count died here most likely old sport you wouldnt like to change beds would you alfred broke open the wax seal and began to read dear alfred i feel my life leaving me we may not meet in this world whatever happens come and see me when you arrive i will be waiting with a warm heart i have committed a crime but not the crime of which i am un used the time has come for my shame and that of others to be shown to the world dont leave a stone unturned and remember you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink beware of the vampire bat and the lover i cannot go on my mind and soul are preparing to leave for a better world i leave the name of dracula in your hands i trust him as an englishman and a gentleman you will tell the truth and nothing but the truth your honourable servant count dracula alfred looked up at the counts portrait and for a moment in thought he saw the mouth move that portrait is almost alive id swear i saw his face move just now funny you should say that old boy the canvas seems a bit wet ernest rubbed the canvas with a finger looks awfully like blood blood cant be probably just paint this damp climate unlikely ernest smelt the substance on his finger but said nothing now what do you think the count meant when he said come and visit me when you arrive after all he knew he was dying he probably meant visit him in his grave you mean dig up his coffin wont be too difficult they only buried him a few days ago do you realize what youre saying absolutely dear boy it might be more fun than sleeping in those coffins they call beds oh all right when shall we do it then i know youre dying to get down to work but im quite tired how about tomorrow night we can talk to the servants and find out more about the count good idea alfred yawned and started unbuttoning his shirt by the way did you mean it when you said youd like to have the counts bed yes dear boy but id hate to spoil your fun no no really ernest old chap i insist are you absolutely sure quite dear boy quite chapter three the man in the black cape ernest leant over alfred who was snoring peacefully boo ah alfred screamed and sent the covers flying then he saw ernest oh its you ernest who was fully dressed handed him his dressing gown who did you expect it to be dear boy count dracula alfred looked over at the portrait on the wall which in the daylight seemed even more alive than ever the manic eyes staring at him ernest gave him his razor and a shaving brush hurry up old chap its way past breakfast time and weve got work to do now ive done a little exploring i got rodolfo to show me where the count is buried im afraid his english is a little basic but hes got the general idea oh youve cut yourself dear fellow blood is running down your neck as he took a handkerchief from ernest alfred noticed the counts eyes did they really light up at the sound of the word blood the family graveyard is outside the castle up a narrow path by the river beautiful spot wouldnt mind being buried there myself they went down to the dining room and sat at an enormous wooden table loaded with eggs steak cheese liver and fish along with bread butter honey jam and coffee during the meal mania and rodolfo hovered over them like enormous bats with trays of food towards the end old gregory staggered in carrying logs for the fire alfred saw his opportunity gregory my dear fellow can we have a word gregory grunted and came up to the table can you tell us a little bit about the old chap the count i mean by the way its awfully dark in here dont you ever open the shutters a look of horror appeared on the old mans wrinkled face no sir aleferd not since the mistress died oh so he was married was he when did the good woman die fortyfive years ago sir aleferd fortyfive years ago did i understand correctly my romanian is a little rusty good heavens any children gregory looked down at the floor and then whispered a reply i see no children and the count never married again he must have been madly in love yes quite mad she was a very beautiful gentle eyes and long shining red hair a tragedy the count was heartbroken are you sure you wont sit down old boy you look a little unsteady gregory appeared not to hear when she died the count swore never to see the light of day again after that he only went out at night on warrior his white horse when there was a good moon and a clear sky of course fascinating now how did these nasty rumours start about that vampire nonsense suddenly gregory became very excited the master is was a good man im sure he was old boy but all these dead people with funny teeth marks on their necks who or what made them gregory waved his thin old arms in the air not the master not the master calm down old chap youll do yourself an injury i believe you gregory got down on his knees and took alfreds hand which alfred found rather embarrassing sir aleferd shagwill gons i would die for the master quite sure you would old boy fine now were going to need some spades any chance you could find us a couple spades yes you see lord ernest wants to go looking for truffles well no actually we have to see the count he told us to in his letter gregory drew away from alfred its the only way really all right sir aleferd but rodolfo must not know gregory looked round in the direction of the servants rooms oh of course we wont say a thing and by the way could you open the castle gates at about midnight tonight yes sir aleferd anything for the master that night alfred and ernest met as planned near the castle gates as promised gregory turned the wheel to let them out a strong wind had got up which roared through the valley they followed the path with difficulty as the moon kept hiding behind large black rain clouds every so often they heard the screech of an owl or some other night creature as they entered the graveyard the rusty old iron gate squealed the place was sheltered from the wind by massive cypress trees and was as silent as all the draculas that lay buried there ernest pointed to a white marble gravestone thats the one as they approached the counts grave he looked up into the sky at the pale light from the moon which threw a white veil over the crooked gravestones its a full moon they say it was on such nights that the count went looking for human blood well here we are got your spade alfred dont look so down old boy the exercisell do you good the soil on the grave was loose and it was not long before they had dug a large hole ernest was the first to touch wood ho ho i believe were about to meet the count again is it just the moonlight or are you looking rather pale dear boy i know its well past your bedtime but i wish you would be a little bit more enthusiastic about it all are you sure we ought to do this ernest i know that i wouldnt like to be disturbed just as i had started my eternal rest youre forgetting dear boy hes not at rest now help me take off the lid at that moment they heard a screech above their heads ernest let out a cry the vampire bat id recognise that sound anywhere ernest lit a candle and held it over the counts head now it was alfreds turn to cry out oh my god his eyes are still open just like the portrait stop staring and lets search him im afraid were going to have to turn him over just grab his left arm thats funny id swear he was warm they searched the coffin but all they found was the counts silver cane well look at that the end of the cane is in the shape of desmodus rotondus i beg your pardon whos he the vampire bat look at those pointed ears and the teeth just hold the candle a little closer ernest this is not the time not the place beautiful piece of work nothing here though pity they rolled the count on to his back again ernest stopped dead look his eyes are closed and i think yes im certain i believe hes smiling i can see his teeth and whats that blood blood oops sorry i must have cut myself on a nail opening the coffin this whole business is beginning to disturb me they put the coffin back covering it with soil and made their way back to the castle just as they arrived alfred remembered something oh dash it i completely forgot to tell old gregory to let us in again at that moment they heard the grinding of the castle gate when it was wide enough a white horse charged out ridden by a man in a black cape and hood they watched in amazement as the figure disappeared into the night ernest grabbed alfreds arm you once asked me whether i believed in ghosts old chap well i have to say that i think ive changed my mind on the subject a ghost what an article this is going to be the only trouble is the globe wont believe a word of it they ran through the castle yard and up to their bedroom as he was taking off his cloak alfred noticed the counts portrait look ernest the counts face it seems so much more peaceful than before almost happy whos imagining things now it looks like an ordinary portrait to me thats exactly what i mean chapter four draculas village the next morning it was mania who served the two men breakfast rodolfo was nowhere to be seen concerned alfred asked mania where he was but she was not one to waste energy on words rodolfo sick oh dear poor fellow its the climate awfully damp almost as bad as england well give him our regards will you by the time he had finished mania had already shuffled out of the room a jolly nice chap rodolfo takes life a bit too seriously but alfred dont dead people usually look sort of grey and well lifeless dont ask me youre the expert on death old boy i like to avoid it myself makes me feel rather insecure the count had red cheeks as if he were alive how very strange he looked as dead as a doornail to me probably put rouge on him undertakers like to have their customers looking their best on the big day yes maybe by the way i had a funny dream last night we were at the dracula cemetery digging up the count that was no dream old boy it really happened no no wait wed stopped for a rest and you were sitting on a gravestone eating a sandwich eating a sandwich id never eat a sandwich sitting on a gravestone i know you wouldnt it was only a dream anyway suddenly the coffin lid began to open very slowly and out came long white fingers with pointed nails followed by the head of the count his eyes shining in the moonlight when he was half out he looked up at us and his mouth opened in a broad smile and i could see his teeth dripping with blood suddenly he spoke in his funny romanian accent welcome my friends i am happy but before he had time to finish the sentence there was a horrendous screech and down flew a vampire bat which landed on his shoulder it was the screech that woke me up very unfortunate i dont have many dreams and i really wanted to see how this one would end im rather glad you didnt you said scream about what time i couldnt go back to sleep so i lit a candle to read a bit of edgar and i happened to look at my watch it was precisely why well at about that time i heard a scream too a long bloodchilling scream that seemed to rise from the very heart of the castle it sounded hollow as if it was coming from the bottom of a well quite disturbing yes it was rather it hasnt affected your appetite though quite the opposite i havent had an appetite like this for years i do recommend this fishy stuff very tasty with brown bread and butter alfred old chap this whole business is awfully good fun isnt it screams in the night ghosts on white horses what next i must say you have an odd idea of fun as for ghosts on horses im not convinced though the resemblance was quite astonishing i must say well i suggest we go into the village and try to get some information from the localsjust as soon as youve had your fill of that fishy looking stuff ugh you should try it old boy absolutely delicious ah heres gregory i say gregory would you be a good chap and run us into the village today lord ernest and i feel like seeing a bit of the local colour of course sir aleferd i suppose youve noticed ernest that ive joined the aristocracy sir alfred it sounds rather good actually sir alfred em the village was miles from anywhere cut off from the rest of the world by tall snowtopped mountains it was pouring with rain and the main street was deserted apart from the occasional wet bundle running from one doorway to another they decided to go straight for the inn ernest pushed open the door and entered a dimly lit room full of heavy wooden tables where some of the locals were drinking and talking an oil lamp hung from the wooden ceiling when gregory and the englishmen entered silence fell like a heavy cloud alfred raised his hand and smiled at the silent watchers good day to you all frightful weather isnt it jolly fine inn my compliments to the landlord ah my dear sir the barman i suppose a large man with a red face and white apron was standing by a barrel yes id like to buy these fine fellows a drink and if you have a moment id be grateful if you could give us some information im a journalist and my friend here is a historian and were writing a history of the dracula family at the sound of dracula heads turned towards the foreigners youd better ask some of them the barman indicated the drinkers at the tables now whod like to have a little chat about the dracula family no one answered after a minute or so a young man with fiery red hair rose unsteadily to his feet you mean the vampire family ill tell you about them come over here and sit down ernest and alfred pulled up two stools and sat opposite the redhaired man who seemed a bit drunk jolly nice of you old chap the count likes human blood especially the blood of young women just like his wifes who died mysteriously years ago what do you mean mysteriously she was found dead with tooth marks on her neck it is believed that they were done by her husband he killed her then just as he killed my sister last night what did you say last night yes and shes still up there with the marks on her neck for all the world to see count dracula may be dead but he can still kill my sister my beautiful sister shes dead and im certain that he killed her the man began to sob into his drink steady on old chap sorry to hear about your sister but these are quite strong accusations have you any proof just then an old man with a country face spoke up from the next table that man doesnt know what hes saying hes from another village the count was no vampire he was a good man he loved the people of the village ill never forget the winter of it started to snow in september and didnt stop until april the people were starving what did the count do he opened up his stores to the people and kept all of us alive he nearly starved to death himself the count is no vampire very interesting so how do you explain the deaths and the teeth marks the man stopped for a moment and thought the vampire bat ernest suddenly showed interest he had learnt the word for vampire bat in romanian whats that about vampire bat alfred told him what the old man had said i think we should go and see this young girl i say old fellow you said your sister was killed by the count you wouldnt care to prove it would you the drunken young man got to his feet and dragged them to the staircase they stumbled up the man talking to himself all the time we had to bring her here she was very ill coughing blood this was the nearest village with a doctor dr magorsky but they reached the bedroom door inside they could see the body of a young girl laid out on a bed with a sheet covering the lower part of her body a woman of about forty was crying beside the bed on the other side of the bed an old man in a black suit was gathering up some surgical instruments the drunken man fell into the room look look at the work of the vampire count alfred and ernest saw a beautiful pale face on her neck were two red dots about an inch apart the old man turned angrily at the intruders who are you get out of here at once theyre friends of mine doctor they didnt believe that well now you know what a devil the count was and still is you can leave well thank you doctor i hope we shall have the pleasure again alfred wished to get out as quickly as possible ernest on the other hand was quietly looking around the room alfred couldnt keep his eyes off the bloodless girl i say ernest old chap i think i need a drink at the table in the inn below ernest was thinking i didnt like the doctor at all nasty piece of work definitely not a gentleman did notice that scratch on his hand i dont know what youre saying old boy as soon as weve had this drink i suggest we get back to the castle chapter five the search back in dracula castle alfred and ernest were sitting in front of a blazing fire after yet another wonderful meal this time of roast goose and apple pie with cream on top alfred raised his glass of wine in the air i would like to drink a toast to the count and his superb hospitality and his excellent taste in wines the old fellow certainly knew how to eat and drink well as for mania shes an absolute treasure you know ernest i am a little bit worried the evidence does not seem to be in the old chaps favour does it a figure looking like the count rides out into the moonlit night and two hours later a girl dies with two teeth marks on her neck it can hardly be a coincidence now can it the question is whether we believe in ghosts or not as you know id love them to exist but my logic tells me that they dont therefore that person on the white horse could not have been the count so who was it well it certainly wasnt mania or gregory and the only other person in the castle is good thinking old boy perhaps thats why he didnt serve us at breakfast yesterday he was catching up on his sleep but why i cant help feeling that the answer must be in the counts letter ive got it here lets see dont leave a stone unturned stone we have to look under stones you can lead a horse to water suddenly a scream just like the one they had heard the previous night was heard faintly echoing through the castle alfred shivered did you hear it i certainly did old boy and i think it came from outside they ran out into the castle yard but there was nothing to be seen except the well they stood wondering where the sound could have come from alfred pointed to the well do you see that enormous stone covering the well how on earth do they get the water out interesting question old boy and whats that thick piece of wood for ernest come here quick alfred was holding his ear to the stone what is it i can hear something like an animal in pain crying or no its more of a moan can you hear it sorry cant hear a thing i think your minds playing tricks on you old boy its probably the rumbling of your stomach after that delicious goose lets get back inside its freezing out here gregory was standing inside the door of the dining room with a worried look on his face sir what is the matter probably my imagination i thought i heard someone scream ah that was don juan maybe he has bad dreams i beg your pardon don juan i mean rodolfo don juan is his nickname he was loved by many women but he loved the master more i see by the way gregory ive been meaning to ask you tell me about dr magorsky lord ernest and i didnt take to him very much he was the counts doctor but he is an evil man he uses old medicine the medicine of the witches herbs leaves nothing wrong with herbs my aunt agatha swears by them frogs snakes bats and mice and other living creatures well yes i think aunt agatha would draw the line there he bleeds all his patients he says losing blood is good for you but he does not care about health he is a greedy man who loves only money thank you very much gregory old fellow bleeds his patients good night sir aleferd i am an old man and must sleep oh of course old boy sweet dreams alfred told ernest what gregory said ernest was intrigued it becomes more interesting by the minute i suggest we go for a walk before breakfast when our minds are clear and try and sort this out ernest old boy what has got into you i thought you liked sleep i wish youd have pity on me im exhausted my dear fellow were on a case we cant waste time sleeping the next morning alfred and ernest got up early and went out into the yard for a walk through the thick mist they saw rodolfo near the well carrying a tray of food alfred was surprised thats funny whats rodolfo doing i didnt ask for breakfast in bed rodolfo had laid the tray on the well top and was holding an enormous piece of wood alfred called out rodolfo turned with a look of shock on his face bright and early i see rodolfo or should i say don juan i wanted to ask you about this well top how do you get the water out the well is not used the count put a stone over it many years ago i see what is that piece of wood for rodolfo seemed angry this well is not used the wood is rotten looks fine to me but i wont argue with you old fellow now i must leave of course oh dont forget your tray em those eggs and that bacon look good perhaps we should have breakfast now ernest rodolfo took the tray and went quickly towards the kitchen come on alfred stop thinking of your stomach and lets go for that walk i suggest we visit the count the count yes i feel he may give us inspiration dracula cemetery was as quiet as an empty house even the birds seemed to have stopped singing because of the thick mist they could hardly see more than a few feet in front of them suddenly alfred couldnt see ernest anywhere ernest where on earth have you gone there was no answer just the echo of his voice he called again and this time got an answer im over here dear boy at the counts grave and ive found something rather interesting just keep talking will you in that way i might be able to find you finally alfred found ernest leaning over the counts grave do you think its rather strange that there is no sign of our footsteps its as if the soil was taken out and put back again dont forget it rained last night what i cant understand is why the count told us in his letter to visit him when he had nothing to tell us hold on ive just had an idea you dont think that cane of his is hollow do you and that inside is a vital message my word youre a genius dear boy of course it must be oh dear does that mean we have to do more grave digging afraid so old chap but youre getting quite good at it by the way have you been eating garlic garlic well yes em i thought it better to be safe than sorry i got dear mania to let me have a few cloves for emergencies the smell is enough to keep away the devil himself as for the vampire bat he wouldnt dare fly within a mile of us come on lets go and have breakfast they made their way back by the river to the castle gate which gregory had left open for them alfred was still trying to work out the connection between stones water and horses you know ernest i feel that the solution to our mystery lies very close to that well theres a big stone there with water under it and opposite the stable where the counts horse is kept im sure the answer lies under that stone ernest touched alfreds arm and held a finger to his mouth sh look rodolfo just got out of the well and hes pushing the stone back by himself good heavens he must be as strong as an ox through the mist they saw rodolfo carrying a tray from the well to the kitchen alfred slapped the side of his head in annoyance dash it i should have thought of it before don juan was a great lover wasnt he what did the count say in his letter beware of the lover do you think rodolfo could be the lover wed better keep a very close eye on him and find out whats hidden down that well why was he carrying a tray all this detective work has given me quite an appetite what about you alfred oh yes and i think we deserve it i feel were getting very close to an important discovery chapter six the missing link that night alfred and ernest were too tired to go grave digging they decided however that they would keep a careful eye on rodolfo they felt that he and in fact all three servants were hiding something which might provide the key to the whole dracula mystery so next morning they got up early before the mist had risen and slipped out into the castle yard to wait for rodolfo to appear with his tray of food as they believed he almost certainly would about ten feet from the well gregory had parked the carriage with the dracula coat of arms and the head of the vampire bat painted in gold on the side they decided that this would be a good place to hide ernest looked at his watch do you think hes not coming weve been here for nearly an hour perhaps he heard us come out and realised that were after him well lets give him another fifteen minutes they waited another fifteen minutes and were about to give up when they heard the kitchen door slam shut i think its him sure enough rodolfo appeared carrying the same tray as on the previous day but instead of stopping at the well he walked straight to the carriage ernest and alfred began to feel uneasy however when he reached the drivers seat he stopped and laid the tray on it then he returned to the well and using the thick piece of wood as a lever pushed back the stone he came back for the tray and to their surprise climbed into the well and disappeared alfred whistled to himself i think this is our opportunity lets follow him alfred reached the well first he could hear the sound of rodolfos boots on the stone steps as he went deeper into the well at some point they seemed to just fade away alfred looked in but all he could see was a black hole i say i dont fancy getting in there looks like the way down to hell ernest struck a match and held it over the hole they could make out spiral steps built on the side of the well there was nothing to hold on to and the steps looked wet and slippery so if either of them fell he would almost certainly go hurtling down to a sure death ernest got into the mouth of the well be careful the steps are all wet and slimy step by step they climbed down into the darkness feeling their way as best they could by leaning against the well wall suddenly alfred saw ernest fall for a moment he thought he had seen the last of his friend and he expected to hear the fatal splash instead he heard ernests voice coming from the well then he realised what had happened there was a large hole in the wall and ernest had fallen into it and was now lying on the floor of what by the looks of it was a passageway which led somewhere underground are you all right old chap well just about i thought i was on my way to meet the count for a moment where the devil are we your guess is as good as mine the home of the vampire bat i should think hold on a tick i can just make out a dim light at the end there ernest got to his feet and felt his way along the passage to a door which was slightly open inside they could hear rodolfos voice and the grunts of some kind of animal ernest pushed the door slightly theres only one way to find out lets go he opened the door just enough to see what was happening rodolfo had his back to them and was facing someone sitting on a chair he appeared to have a spoon in one hand feeding a baby the room was warm and comfortable with expensive persian carpets on the floor rodolfo got up to put more wood on the fire revealing the ugliest creature they had ever seen one side of its face was twisted and shapeless and its arms and whole body were all bent and moving out of control uneaten food and meaningless sounds were coming out of its mouth alfred could not help exclaiming good heavens what is that rodolfo was speaking to the creature as if it understood what he was saying but could not reply alfred pulled ernests arm i think we ought to go rodolfo must have sensed someone was there because he let out a wild cry and started to run towards them you devils father said i should trust you because you are english gentlemen but everybody hates the dracula name and youre no different you want a story for your newspaper you dont care about the great family dracula well im going to kill you rodolfo reached the two men and was about to lift alfred into the air when ernest threw his bolas which was made of thick string with three metal balls tied to the ends the bolas went right around rodolfos legs alfred was thrown into the air and rodolfo fell forward onto the floor ernest threw the end of a piece of rope to alfred here grab the end of this and tie him up before he recovers bravo ernest old fellow where on earth did you learn that little trick didnt i tell you i spent three months with the rebels in argentina fighting the dictator i brought that little fellow back with me between the two of them they managed to tie up the struggling rodolfo ernest was afraid he was going to break the rope but it soon became clear that it was too strong for him when they had finally got him under control alfred started to speak now rodolfo old fellow im frightfully sorry to have to do this but you simply must understand were here to help you no youre just like the rest look old fellow why do you think the count asked us over here now i think youd better tell us the whole thing the creature in the corner let out an animal cry i suppose it was he who was making the screams in the night who is he i suppose it is a he rodolfo said nothing just boiled with anger then he spoke well you know now and i cannot kill you so i might as well tell you the whole story that is the counts son the counts son yes he is fortyfive years old he should have died but hold on a tick fortyfive but the countess died forty five years ago you mean that she died giving birth to that that gentleman over there yes radu is the heir to the dracula estate he should now be count dracula radu that means handsome doesnt it rather ironical naturally the count did not want the world to know about radu it would be a great shame for the family but he felt great guilt for keeping him here in this this hole but radu doesnt know any better well it looks as if youve let the cat out of the bag rodolfo but dont worry your secret will be safe with us i wont even mention it in my article i promise now one thing puzzles us who is this doctor magorsky doctor magorsky is an evil man but the count was a naive man and trusted him i think he killed her killed the countess by bleeding her this is what he does to make people better i see fascinating oh and one last little question old boy now that weve got you in this em difficult position so to speak that was you we saw on the counts horse the other night wearing his cloak and hood rodolfo was silent then hesitatingly he replied no are you sure you werent sleepriding old fellow because if it wasnt you i darent think who it was unless it was the count himself now you must trust us we can work together and sort this whole nasty business out our job is to clear the dracula name and thats exactly what we will do all right i will help you oh what a jolly good fellow did you understand that ernest rodolfo is going to help i think we can untie him now are you sure we can trust him he could throw both of us into the well with one arm well perhaps youd better keep your little handy just in case they first unwound the bolas and then the ropes from around his arms he made no attempt to attack them alfred sighed with relief well i dont know about you two but im starving how about breakfast when ernest and alfred were having breakfast alfred was still unsure of the situation there are still a lot of questions unanswered arent there old boy i mean who was that chappy on the horse now we dont believe in ghosts or do we im not sure we can trust rodolfo he may have been lying or at least not telling us the whole truth might he still throw us down the well or something oh no no no rodolfos a fine fellow i think we need to investigate the doctor all this bleeding nasty business well in that case i suggest that after breakfast we get old gregory to pop us into the village so that we can get to the bottom of this magorsky fellow ah rodolfo a superb breakfast as usual i hope you didnt just accidentally drop a few spoonfuls of cyanide into the coffee rodolfo did not reply or smile funny about foreigners they cant take a joke chapter seven dr benjamin magorsky they decided to go straight to the doctors house and face him for some reason rodolfo insisted on driving them there after a twohour journey they arrived at an iron gate leading into a large estate surrounded by a tall glasstopped wall a wellkept drive led up to the doctors house on looking out of the window of the carriage ernest was surprised to see a large house with at least twenty rooms take a look at that old boy hes not doing too badly for a country doctor a house like that must be worth a fortune the door was opened by a servant after a long wait the doctor who was still an extremely handsome man with long silver hair brushed back on both sides of his head came into the room surprisingly he spoke excellent english i believe weve met before gentlemen under less happy circumstances youre english i believe yes doctor were doing a spot of investigating for the late count they tell me youve been asking questions that have been upsetting some of the villagers not at all doctor people have been very happy to tell us all they know it seems that these rumours about the count having a taste for human blood are totally unfounded i dont know who youve been talking to gentlemen but i can assure you that the count was and i believe still is a vampire you forget gentlemen i was his doctor you say still is do you mean to say that you dont believe that the count is dead or do you believe in ghosts i believe he died yes but i also believe in his power to come back from the dead in fact i believe that vampires are humans who have died and come back to earth very interesting doctor but you say the count was also a vampire in real life yes the count had very rare powers i once examined his teeth at some length and at that moment a shout was heard from the hall and all seven feet of rodolfo came through the door into the sitting room that man is a liar he is the vampire not the count tell them how you the doctor looked at rodolfo with an ironic smile on his face you cant prove it the count never recognised you as his son maybe not publicly but im going to prove how you blackmailed the count so you would keep his secret you were the only person who knew about radu rubbish nonsense i can get all the villagers to say how you forced large sums of money out of them and threatened to kill them if they did not pay the doctor began to laugh hysterically this man is mad absolutely mad he needs to be locked up and if he doesnt shut up soon i shall call my men and have him taken away during this confrontation ernest and alfred just sat and watched not knowing who was telling the truth suddenly rodolfo came towards the doctor and took him by the shirt collar he probably would have broken his neck if alfred had not stopped him gentlemen theres no need to fight like animals were all civilised here civilised this doctor is an animal he has killed thousands by bleeding them to death lies prove it you monster suddenly rodolfo calmed down yes doctor lover i will prove it you can prove nothing yes i can before the count died he left me his diary in which he wrote everything when you killed the countess with your socalled medicines and your bleeding not one day went by that the count did not write down everything how you blackmailed him how you got rich by threatening the poor and sick how you used the vampire bat to do your dirty work for you how everybody hates you and fears you no one would believe it they all think the count was the vampire its his word against mine you know very well that if its a question of your word against his the people will believe his the people loved the count and never really believed the rumours suddenly a fearful screeching was heard from the next room everybody except the doctor froze its nothing gentlemen its my falcon he wishes to go hunting as soon as ernest heard the screech he showed great excitement alfred old chap this is the moment ive been waiting for ernest walked excitedly to the door and was about to open it when the doctor shouted at him dont open that door unless you want to die lord ernest i have specially trained them to go straight for the neck doctor you dont think i would come all the way from england and not see the vampire bat in the light of day after all i am a specialist i warned you no sooner had ernest opened the door than a loud flapping of wings and the screeching of a starving bat was heard and an ugly creature with pointed wings and a squashed nose with black hairs sticking out of it flew wildly at ernest alfred screamed and ran to fight off the vicious creature but by the time he had reached his friend the bat had already got its teeth in his neck to alfreds surprise ernest just stood there while the creature got its fill from his neck alfred did not know what to do soon the bat drew out its teeth from ernests neck and sat on his shoulder like a parrot or a tame bird do you know alfred old boy i think this is the most exciting moment of my life how many people back in england can say that they came in such close contact with a desmodus rotondus but wont it kill you dear boy good heavens no of course if i were one of the doctors patients and it fed off me three times a day i wouldnt last long the doctor stood in admiration listening to the man talking about his bats so casually a beautiful creature doctor but also a deadly one if you let it be you have them well trained doctor you dont mind if i see the rest of the family at that ernest went into the doctors laboratory and looked up at the ceiling sure enough hanging upside down on a wooden bar were four more vampire bats alfred by now had wrapped a scarf around his neck and was holding it tightly with both hands how many people have you killed doctor to keep your little family alive yes they are my family i love them more than any human being because they love me with all their heart they are faithful not like women who love you today and leave you tomorrow all those people they were going to die anyway i couldnt save them nobody could how can you be so sure doctor i think we should let the police decide on that dont you think alfred absolutely old chap i suggest we go right now at that they turned and left the doctor who was shouting nonsense after them you cant do anything to me theyre just peasants theyre all afraid of me i have all the power as they reached the carriage ernest turned to the doctor well goodbye doctor it was a pleasure we shall meet again soon oh and one more thing you wont need to feed one member of your family tonight when they were in the carriage alfred felt a little better and let his hands go from his neck but he seemed very concerned by the two pink spots on ernests neck are you all right old chap horrifying experience on the contrary dear boy it was like a gentle kiss you should try it some time i think give it a miss old fellow stick to the female kind now what im worried about is what the doctor will do to get his hands on the counts diary hell stop at nothing ill check my derringer just in case i think well be needing it chapter eight the lover by the time they left the doctors it had begun to snow and by the look of the dark clouds there was going to be a storm so they decided not to go to the police that night anyway alfred wished to examine the counts diaries first to make sure that rodolfo had got his facts correct alfred had two things on his mind that he had not had a chance to talk to ernest about he leaned towards ernest so that he could be heard above the noise of the carriage and the rising storm did you notice ernest that rodolfo called magorsky doctor lover im afraid i missed that old boy why do you think that the doctor is the the count mentioned in his letter suddenly the sound of horses approaching the carriage was heard and then a shot rang out ernest quickly stuck his head out of the window through the falling snow he could see three riders i think were being attacked by the doctors men i hope youre a good shot old boy because its the only gun weve got rodolfo was now going faster and the carriage was rolling dangerously from side to side another shot rang out and they heard a cry from rodolfo at that ernest started climbing out of the window much to alfreds concern be careful old boy theyre out to kill im afraid youre going to have to join me dear fellow you dont stand a chance of hitting any of them in here so both men climbed out on to the carriage roof rodolfo had been shot in the arm but was still able to drive the horses after nearly being thrown off the carriage three times alfred finally managed to get onto the carriage roof he lay down on his stomach and aimed his first shot knocked one of the riders off his horse ernest looked around in surprise i say well done you never told me you were such an ace the other two riders followed for a short distance and then dropped behind alfred relaxed but was not happy this doctor will stop at nothing to keep the world from finding out the truth i think weve got a rather unpleasant few days ahead of us jolly good show i was beginning to think things were getting rather boring they reached dracula castle without any further adventures rodolfo was bleeding badly but ernest who knew quite a lot about first aid cleaned and dressed the wound while this was going on alfred thought it was a good opportunity to get some straight answers from rodolfo rodolfo did i hear you say that the count was your father and if so why are you pretending to be his servant i should have told you everything from the beginning but i have learnt to trust nobody i am the son of mania the count married her secretly he brought a priest from far away so that no one would know but the count never treated me like a son more like a servant that made me bitter and i hated the count for that but i loved him as my father i see i see now what about magorsky why did you call him doctor lover it is a name he hates when he was young he loved a beautiful woman from vilcea and they were going to get married but she left him for another man a rich man from the town and after that people made fun of him by calling him the lover it was that which made the doctor hate women particularly young and beautiful women i am sure now that the lover killed the countess doesnt the count mention it in his diaries no you see the count was such a kind man that he could not believe that others could be evil he did not know how jealous the doctor was of him he did not even hate the doctor for blackmailing him the count was the kindest man but you say he treated you badly yes you see my mother is not an aristocrat she is nobody and so i too am nobody but i have the dracula blood in my veins that is hard to accept now this is all jolly interesting rodolfo but who was that fellow on the horse the other night pretending to be the count rodolfo looked at the ground and his pale bony face went red i lied to you it was me i have a confession to make i helped the doctor spread these rumours about the count i would ride the counts horse through the village whenever the doctor told me to so that everybody would think it was the count what i did was terrible but i wanted to hurt the count for the way he treated me and it appears that you did well theres no point in crying over spilt milk the important thing is to keep those diaries safe for the police and try and prove that you are the counts son does he mention it anywhere in his diaries no i have read them all i cant believe that if the count was such a kind man he would not recognise you as his son weve got to search the castle high and low ernest do you have any ideas where the count could have hidden a letter or a will or something ernest who was warming himself in front of the fire looked thoughtful well it was your idea really old boy you thought the counts cane might be hollow yes of course id completely forgotten deliberately perhaps you dont share my interest in coffins do you old chap so it looks as if weve got work to do tonight in this weather sometimes alfred you surprise me you call yourself a reporter and yet you like putting things off yes tonight not that i think well see the vampire bat im afraid its too cold well at least thats one good thing after supper they again set out with spades this time rodolfo came with them though he had a great fear of ghosts the snow was falling in large flakes and the wind was bitterly cold by the time they reached the cemetery everything was so white that they could see their way without lamps it took them about half an hour to dig down to the counts coffin at the sound of his spade on the coffin rodolfo jumped out of the grave i am sorry sir alfred but the rest you must do alone i agree with you old fellow i cant stand this part to tell you the truth i just keep my eyes closed i leave it all to ernest he enjoys it the snow was falling so fast that already a white layer covered the top of the coffin ernest was removing the lid i wonder if well see the end of my dream have the white fingers started to appear then ernest laughed and pulled off the lid ernest could not believe his eyes the counts face seemed younger and more alive than ever and the eyes had opened again for a moment he thought the count was going to speak alfred can you help me turn the count i the cane do i have to they both lifted the count over and underneath found the cane thats funny i thought i left the cane on top of him ah well lets see if all this was a waste of time or not ernest began to unscrew the handle when he had finished he turned it over and tapped the end sure enough a piece of thick paper fell out the end bingo what does it say on the top alfred i can only just see but yes lastwill and testament i think wonderful lets put the count back to rest hopefully for the last time when they had got him laid on his back ernest noticed something very strange good heavens his eyes have closed and his face what about it it actually looks dead this time but its as if hes smiling i believed in ghosts id swear that he knew everything that has gone on in the last few days but you dont do you ernest chapter nine the will back at the castle rodolfo immediately went to tell his old mother the news and they all gathered around the fire while alfred read the will translating it for ernest as he went in this my last will and testament i wish to undo a wrong i committed many years ago i married a good and kind woman below my position my excuse being that like all men i needed human warmth and comfort my greatest crime was being ashamed of it and never recognising the fruit of that marriage my son rodolfo in this will i ask his forgiveness and leave everything to him declaring that he has the right to call himself count dracula as for my firstborn the unfortunate radu i know that rodolfo will take care of him as long as he lives i have taken this will to my grave with the knowledge that if it is ever found it will be because the dracula name has been cleared of all the lies spread by that evil doctor lover magorsky i wish to thank alfred sackvillejones and lord ernest deboy for helping my son rodolfo to get what is rightfully his i can now rest in peace count vlad dracula alfred looked up from the handwritten letter with the dracula seal and the counts elaborate signature at the bottom well rodolfo old fellow we shall have to call you count from now on rodolfo was so overjoyed that he got up and lifted his ancient mother into the air and kissed her a hundred times on her wrinkled old face so that she actually smiled gregory too was jumping up and down doing some sort of strange romanian dance having put his mother down rodolfo then came and gave alfred and ernest kisses on both cheeks may i suggest count that we open one of the late counts excellent bottles of german wine i think this calls for a celebration so the five of them celebrated to the early hours they even got ernest to join in singing some traditional romanian songs of course alfred knew that many dangers lay ahead but he did not wish to spoil the fun next morning as usual alfred first said good morning to the portrait of the count whose cheeks were all rosy red as if he too had drunk a little too much the night before then he looked out of the window over the castle walls across to the river and down dracula valley the storm was over but the snow was at least two feet deep ernest was still fast asleep now that he had no coffins to visit or vampire bats to see the exciting part was over for him alfred shook him wake up old boy alfred really why do you always have to interrupt my dream at the most exciting moment i can see ill never get to the end come on weve got a long day ahead of us first weve got to bring these documents to the authorities and im sure that the doctors men are already on the road and will probably do anything to stop us the snow was too deep for the carriage so rodolfo rode warrior while alfred and ernest took a carriage horse each as they were not sure that they would be returning to the castle they took a bag full of their belongings and said goodbye to mania and gregory who both had tears in their eyes alfred paid one last visit to their room and said goodbye to the portrait on the wall he was almost certain he saw the lips move as they rode out of draculas castle the silence was immense all that could be heard was the muffled sounds of the river near the cemetery where the waterfall was about a mile out alfred turned to rodolfo if the doctors men try to attack us where is the most likely spot either where the valley narrows or where we have to cross the river about a mile out of vilcea they said little just kept their eyes on the hills and trees around them where a man with a gun might be hiding the doctors men were not waiting at the narrow pass which surprised rodolfo and he wondered whether the doctor was going to attack them after all alfred however was sure that he would and so when they were halfway across the river he stopped gentlemen get your guns ready no sooner had he spoken than a gun appeared from behind a tree and a shot rang out the bullet whistled past ernests ear good heavens that was close they jumped off their horses and ran for shelter they could now see that there were three attackers ernest who had more experience fighting than the others took charge rodolfo is it possible to cross the river at any other point about a half a mile farther up but there is no road if youll let me have warrior ill manage it all right you keep them busy while i approach from behind so ernest got up on the beautiful white horse which was almost invisible in the snow and rode off up the river about half an hour later a shot rang out and they saw a body fall from behind one of the trees alfred saw his chance rodolfo lets get to the other side ernest wont give them any time to think about us two minutes later they were on the other side by this time ernest had hit another and the third had laid down his gun and was holding up a white handkerchief ernest appeared from behind a tree followed by warrior well that wasnt too difficult then out of the corner of his eye alfred saw a movement it was the wounded man who was pointing his gun at rodolfo rodolfo get down but is was too late rodolfo fell to the ground his blood spilling onto the white snow ernest pointed his gun and shot the man ernest examined rodolfo and found that he was still breathing but the bullet had entered his chest and he was bleeding badly weve got to get him to vilcea quickly alfred throw the mens guns into the river and get that man to put the dead men on to a horse then lets get going they reached vilcea about twenty minutes later ernest held rodolfo in his arms and rode into vilcea on warrior at the first inn they got rodolfo on to a bed and ernest set to work trying to save his life two hours later ernest had managed to get the bullet out and the wound dressed alfred looked on in admiration i had no idea you were such an expert dear boy oh did i never tell you i studied medicine for two years before turning to archaeology you know i think i would have made quite a good doctor i suppose its all that blood you like dear fellow what are rodolfos chances of pulling through oh hell live but it may take a few days before he can get back on to his feet suddenly they heard rodolfos voice sir alfred get the mayor and the police chief to come i want witnesses straight away old fellow seeing ernests bare and bloody arms rodolfo realised that it was he who had saved his life lord ernest i now owe you a life how can i repay you one day count id like to spend some time at the castle just going through the archives would that be all right anything lord ernest anything half an hour later the mayor and the police chief arrived and the documents were formally handed over it was now up to the authorities to deal with doctor magorsky alfred was thinking it looks as if our job is over ernest old fellow id really love to see those vampire bats again cant i go with the police to arrest the doctor first of all we dont know where the doctor is he is probably hiding by now and his main aim now will be to kill us not rodolfo before we get back to england and publish everything quite so old boy rodolfos in good hands so i suggest we get out of here as quickly as possible we have a long journey ahead of us im going to miss this place alfred old fellow it suits me i cant altogether agree with you old boy but i do believe rodolfo will make a very good count i always thought he was a very solid chap chapter ten the end alfred and ernest said goodbye to rodolfo who could not thank them enough and caught the from vilcea to craiova where they planned to pick up the train to vienna they of course had no news of the doctor and wondered whether he would use his money and power to send a team to try to kill them strangely enough it was ernest who was most concerned do you know alfred old fellow were not home and dry yet it was we who uncovered his evil deeds and hes not the type who forgives easily do you really think hell send some of his killers after us why would he bother its a question of pride and honour and these foreign fellows think such things are terribly important alfred had great difficulty thinking of danger he was already imagining himself back in his room in london whats the first thing youll do when you get back ernest what a question let me see yes i think ill open a bottle of your finest wine dear boy whatll you do ill go for a walk through the fog of london and stand on tower bridge and watch the boats go underneath ernest laughed really alfred youre such a sentimentalist they arrived in craiova at about and had to wait an hour for their connection they were waiting on the crowded platform when alfred saw a man he thought he recognised ernest do you see that man over by the entrance the one with the beard and the scar above his left eye does he ring a bell dont think so old fellow probably my imagination however alfred kept an eye on him and noticed that he too got on the train to vienna there was something suspicious about him he was dressed like a man of wealth but looked like a boxer it was about in the morning and they were about halfway to vienna when the first attempt on their lives was made ernest was fast asleep and snoring so loudly that he was keeping alfred awake the door of their cabin opened allowing a strip of light to enter alfred opened his eyes for a second and saw the man with the beard he was holding a piece of rope in his hands and was obviously intending to strangle them both alfred wished he had put the derringer under his pillow and also that ernest was not fast asleep he decided to wait and grab the man by the legs as soon as he got close enough to the bunk bed alfred was about to jump when he heard the man grunt and fall to the floor of the compartment ernest switched on the light and looked at the man lying on the floor apparently dead it looks as if i saved your life alfred old fellow its a good thing i dont sleep as deeply as you do but i dont dont what sleep soundly you were the one snoring i was wide awake snoring was i really ernest looked at the body im afraid i broke his neck well what can a chap do if another chap tries to strangle him in the middle of the night i suppose well have to explain this mess to the guard for the next two days nothing unusual happened it wasnt until they were outside paris that the next attempt on their lives was made they had got to know another passenger a german by the name of wolf heinz he said he was an ornithologist and was on his way to england to study a bird species there ernest however was quite suspicious because that particular species of bird wouldnt arrive in england for another two months it all happened when they were having tea and cakes in the dining car herr heinz had arrived first and had already ordered alfred was delighted to see the cherry cakes and tea waiting i say wolf old chap jolly nice of you they sat down and wolf offered them a cake each ernest noticed that they smelt strongly of almond and suspected that wolf had put cyanide in some of them rather than cause a fuss he pretended to knock the cake out of alfreds hand frightfully sorry old fellow how clumsy of me good heavens look out there that bird very unusual what is it wolf looked out of the window and tried hard to see the bird during which time ernest changed his cake for the one on wolfs plate then he winked at alfred so that he understood what was happening oh dear it must have flown away when he turned round alfred and ernest were pretending to be finishing off their cakes which ernest had put into his pocket what lovely cakes wolf wolf joined in and ate his on arrival in paris they saw an empty coffin arrive and leave with a body in it ernest looked at alfred and smiled poor wolf and they did look like awfully nice cakes when they got off the train at charing cross they really felt their adventure had ended but they did not see the young man get into the cab behind them and follow them all the way suddenly a shot rang out alfred pushed ernest to the ground a man was standing on the pavement pointing a gun at them ernest was quite annoyed dear me and i was so looking forward to a nice cup of english tea the man in the street looked mad his eyes moving wildly in his head you ruined my father you will pay for this but by the time he had finished his last sentence ernest had got out his derringer and had shot him straight through the heart they ran to the body now lying in a pool of blood in his pocket alfred found a passport with the name nikolai magorsky really these foreign fellows are hotblooded arent they ernest was more concerned about the body now how are we going to explain this to the police for the next three months alfred and ernest went everywhere looking over their shoulder but it appeared that nikolai was the last assassin come on hold out your glass ernest old chap alfred raised his glass in the air and ernest filled it with champagne well heres to a successful end to the dracula affair the globe has been awfully good of course they didnt believe a word of it but they said that even as a work of fiction it was worth publishing oh well done old fellow yes were going to call it the real count dracula in ten episodes i have to admit that im going to make a fortune well i must tell you old fellow that youre not the only one whos had some success im going to have an article published in the british bat society magazine on the vampire bat and ive been booked to give talks on the subject all summer oh how superb lets drink to the late and present counts dracula i wonder what happened to the doctor probably took one of his deadly potions he had nothing to live for just then there was a knock on the door and alfreds servant entered with a letter alfred opened it quickly ah its from rodolfo lets see what he has to say dear alfred and ernest i have some good and some bad news the bad news is that my brother radu died and was buried next to his father in the dracula cemetery the good news is that the doctor is dead he was found with all the blood sucked out of him with his horrible bats standing on his body he died as he deserved to in the way that he killed his victims the other good news is that i am getting married and would like you to come to my wedding i am marrying the daughter of a count in craiova i know it may not be possible for you to come but it would make me very happy as i owe you my life and much more your true and devoted friend count rodolfo dracula well it is nice to know that everything turned out all right for him in the end what about this wedding thing then lets

family of monsters looking like the monster my grandfather created have been seen high up in a mountain in switzerland i do not know whether it is a he or not could you please come and investigate i
