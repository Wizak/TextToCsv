 chapter one new york city in fall monday october th a cool clear morning with the promise of a fine day ahead fall is my favorite season in this city the break between summer heat and winter cold its a time when youre not trying to escape the worst of new yorks weather in the city parks leaves on the trees were just beginning to turn red and gold the names nat marley licensed private investigator before i became an investigator i used to be a police officer a cop with the nypd the new york police department since then ive worked for myself so what does private investigator make you think of a cool handsome guy with an exciting sometimes dangerous job think again some of the time im looking for missing persons or maybe im watching a husband to find out if hes seeing another woman and when i look in the mirror i see an ordinary guy in his forties whos losing his hair as usual i caught the number seven subway train from my home in flushing main street queens to midtown manhattan through queens the subway runs above the streets below you can see different areas each home to people from around the world flushing chinese and koreans corona heights central and south americans at grand central station i picked up two coffees crowds of new yorkers were hurrying out onto nd street then like any other day i walked the couple of blocks to my office at east rd street my personal assistant stella delgado was already at her desk opening the mail shes a smart goodlooking puerto rican who understands everything about computers shes been with me for most of the time ive been a private investigator stella comes from spanish harlem on the upper east side of manhattan a part of the city where tourists dont go on the streets there youll hear more spanish than english she never finished school but later as an adult went to night school shes worked hard for what she has now a job comfortable home and loving family how are you doing stella i asked i got coffee for you thanks im fine she replied could you leave it on the desk a knock at the door two women entered one a lady in her middle fifties dressed in a dark green suit the suit looked expensive but she looked worried the other a young woman in her twenties i compared their faces they had to be mother and daughter do i have the right place said the mother this is the marley detective agency thats correct maam the names nat marley what can i do for you i asked well its kind of difficult she started come through to my office and take a seat i said your names please im joyce oneill and this is my daughter julia said the mother its about my husband patrick hes disappeared and i really need to find him it doesnt matter how much it costs im very sorry to hear that maam i said lets take it slowly from the beginning she looked at me with large sad eyes i havent seen him since saturday night when i woke up sunday morning he was gone he left this message on the kitchen table she took a postcard from her purse and read to me my dear joyce dont worry im safe but i cant come home the thing is i know something which puts me and maybe you in danger dont phone me or my office or the nypd if anyone asks for me say im out of town trust me stay at julias place and wait for my call all my love patrick i have an apartment in hamilton heights near columbia university julia explained mom has been staying with me there since sunday mr marley im worried sick joyce oneill continued patricks never done anything like this before i knew it could be bad news when someone disappears but i didnt want to make her any more worried than she was already there can be many reasons why someone disappears i said lets not expect the worst did your husband call she nodded hes ok but said he had to hide while he decided what to do he wouldnt tell me what was happening he just said the less i knew the safer i would be i just dont know what to do it sounds like hes in immediate danger i said it would be useful to know as much as possible about your husband i learned that patrick oneill worked as an accountant his employer was a firm on wall street called ocean star finance he had worked there for over ten years his home address was henry street brooklyn heights his photograph showed a tall grayhaired guy with black metal glasses but there was nothing special about him he had been married for twentythree years he was just an ordinary family man with a daughter studying for her mba at columbia university there must be a good reason why your husband asked you not to call his office so tell me some more about his work i said patricks the second highest person in his department joyce oneill answered the head of department is ronald steinmann what kind of guy is this steinmann i asked hes good at his job excellent in fact though hes not well liked patrick and steinmann arent the best of friends a few more questions if you dont mind i continued has your husband been acting strangely or differently in any way she thought carefully before answering i cant say he has his works really important to him he often has to work late and he sometimes brings work home thats normal im afraid i have to ask this could there be another woman i asked her she looked at me angrily then said sorry i guess its your job to ask my husband has never even looked at another woman one final question i said its useful to know how carefully a missing person has planned to disappear has your husband taken anything with him did he pack clothes did he take the car the cars gone and he took a travel bag with a change of clothes and some books she replied thanks maam youve been really helpful i said ill do everything possible to find out whats happened ill need to visit you at your home later to look at your husbands papers and computer that might give me some ideas could you meet me there at three oclock after mrs oneill and her daughter had left i looked out of the window the sun was trying to make the gray buildings of east rd street look beautiful it would need to try harder so a normal hardworking guy had suddenly disappeared he could be in serious trouble i had thought this was going to be another ordinary day my mistake chapter two wall street i told stella what id learned so far as i talked her fingers flew over the computer keyboard take a look nat she said the latest information from the ocean star finance website it was an investment firm on wall street the financial center of america investment meant lending out its clients money on international money markets to make more money so their already rich clients became even richer also it seemed to be one of the best firms a favorite of many famous new yorkers year after year ocean star had returned excellent money to its clients it was like a moneymaking machine the head of the firm was lorraine houston she was well known to the public through tv talk shows and magazine stories about her homes on long island and in new england her clothes only came from the best stores shed lived the american dream the daughter of a poor new jersey family who had become the president of ocean star i decided to call oneills office and spoke with his personal assistant i let her think i had some money to invest of course it wasnt the truth ive never had enough money to save much but after fifteen years in the nypd id learned how to tell a good lie this is mr marley i told her id like to meet with mr oneill this afternoon i just wanted to check if he could see me at three thirty im sorry said the personal assistant mr oneill called this morning to say he was sick really in that case ill have to speak to the head of department i said im afraid thats not possible she replied you see mr steinmann doesnt work here anymore he left the firm on friday left the firm i asked why did he find another job i couldnt say sir replied the personal assistant whose decision was this i asked i dont know she said do you mean you dont know or youre not allowed to tell me i asked as i said before sir i really couldnt say she said something felt wrong both the head guys in the department had gone working at ocean star didnt seem too good for your health was it steinmanns decision to leave you know what they say when someone suddenly leaves a job did he jump or was he pushed stella was going through the mail i picked up the phone bill ouch thats going to hurt my wallet i said did we really make that many calls well wed better find patrick oneill quickly and make ourselves some money come on stella were going to visit wall street lets see if we can find out anything more on ocean star some investigators take cabs everywhere not me if possible i take public transportation the new york subway its cheap fast and much safer than it used to be when i was a cop we took a train from grand central station to wall street while traveling downtown i described a plan to stella it was of course going to mean telling some more lies when we get to ocean star we check in with reception and let them think were millionaires with money to invest well tell them we need financial advice and ask to meet with one of their advisors immediately lets see what they can offer us well act all unsure and ask for promises that our investment will be completely safe ill do most of the talking and you watch the advisor from the subway station we walked east past the new york stock exchange outside the building tourists were busy taking pictures ahead of us we could see the full height of the new century building thirty floors of glass and metal a wall of silver in the sunshine ocean star finance used the top four floors at the reception desk you could almost smell money in the air the black office furniture looked expensive and the carpets were deep and soft a meeting was soon organized yes they wanted to talk to the millionaires its true what people say money does open doors the advisor gave complete answers to my questions and seemed to be sure of herself finally i asked so you can promise us a return of up to fifteen percent on our investment by this time next year no problem none at all she said immediately you dont need to worry we offer the best service on wall street afterwards i asked stella for her thoughts you know nat it was like listening to an actor whod learned her lines well she said she was giving the usual message dont worry what could possibly go wrong but you know and i know thats not always the case in the world of finance i told stella i was going to take an early lunch at mcfaddens bar to talk with the people from the daily news the information i needed to know about ocean star couldnt be found on the internet i wanted the inside information mcfaddens on the corner of east nd street and second avenue was the second home of daily news reporters these guys often knew much more than they could write about in their newspaper the kind of news that could be dangerous inside the bar the lunchtime crowd was beginning to come in i looked around and saw a tall man with white hair among a group of younger reporters he was ed winchester a reporter who had been with the daily news longer than i could remember he had helped me several times in the past nat over here and while youre at the bar get me another drink he called waving an empty glass i knew that the price of information from ed would be a beer but that was cheap enough i ordered two beers and went over to ed he had moved to an empty table and pushed a chair toward me well nat what brings you here he asked you got that i need to know something look on your face i described what had happened during the morning and what i already knew it seems kind of strange to me one of the two head guys in the department has suddenly left and the other has disappeared on sick leave ed thought carefully finance isnt my field but theres a young friend of mine who might be able to help he went over to the reporters and returned with a guy in his twenties nat id like to introduce brett johnson a financial reporter on the wall street page brett mr marley needs anything you might have on ocean star finance ok mr marley brett began there are two sides to the story each year ocean star makes excellent money for its clients how can they do it is it just luck or is lorraine houston really a financial superwoman second if ocean star can make such good money then why arent all the other firms on wall street doing the same thing however i dont have all of the facts so thats why you havent read about it thanks brett youve given me something to think about i said chapter three brooklyn heights after lunch i met stella at grand central station by the information desk under the big clock we were going to see joyce oneill at her home on henry street brooklyn heights as usual we took the subway henry street is just one block away from the subway station on either side of henry street are lines of old brownstone houses built in the nineteenth century we walked in the sunshine to the house the oneills opened the door before i could knock joyce oneill looked terrible she was crying and her eyes were red julia was holding her mothers hand please come in said mrs oneill as she was speaking the phone rang she picked it up and said joyce oneill speaking then she slowly put it down nobody there thats the third time today she told me ill check that number if i may i asked i called the service to find out who last phoned as i expected it refused to give me a number i didnt want to make mrs oneill any more worried no luck it wouldnt tell me anything maybe just a wrong number but if it happens again tell me now this morning i called your husbands office at ocean star i let them think i was a client i was told he was on sick leave and another thing steinmann has left the firm i couldnt find out why really said mrs oneill what on earths going on i wish i knew i said while were here wed like to find out more about your husband his interests what kind of person he is you never know any little thing could be important does he have a home office sure its through here said mrs oneill the room looked out onto the street on either side of the window were pictures of old new york under the window was a desk with nine drawers and on the desk sat a computer on the other walls were bookshelves ms delgado will look through your husbands computer files if thats ok with you i told her stella turned on the computer but of course we needed the password julia spelled it for stella its julie thats what my father always calls me while stella continued with the computer i began my search through the books they were of little interest to us then i continued with the drawers of the desk again i discovered nothing that might help us until i tried to open the final drawer it was locked but a minutes work with a small knife was enough to open it it was full of books about card games mainly poker i read the titles ninetynine ways to win at poker poker use your intelligence and win the complete poker player and so on oneill had read every book carefully on most pages there were notes in pencil the sort of notes that only a serious student of the game would make was he hiding the books from his wife i showed them to mrs oneill could you tell me if this is your husbands handwriting i asked yes thats patricks she replied did you realize that your husband was interested in card games i asked her i had no idea its a complete surprise thats something he never talked about and i thought i knew everything about him she said sadly stella opened oneills email and i waited patiently as she checked through all the information finally she was ready most of what ive opened here seems to be quite normal said stella work letters mainly but theres something here the last email to steinmann sent on friday afternoon it reads i didnt think you could be so stupid i cant believe what youve done do you have any idea what this could be about i asked mrs oneill it could be some kind of disagreement she replied stella needed mrs oneills help to get into the family bank accounts she entered the numbers and soon the information came up on the screen there was a joint account in the names of patrick and joyce oneill and also an account in joyce oneills name the joint account seemed normal as did mrs oneills account but we needed another password to open patrick oneills account mrs oneill went straight to the kitchen and returned with a little notebook patrick said i should keep this in a safe place if anything happened to him id be able to find the information on the computer she passed the book to stella who searched through it to find the necessary numbers new information came on the screen and stella now looked more serious mrs oneill do you know someone called f van zandt she asked ive never heard the name she answered why well if you look here there have been several large payments to this van zandt over the last six months stella explained mrs oneill looked at the screen and put her hand to her mouth i just dont understand she said this last payment is and look here patrick took out this morning theres more said stella two large payments to steinmann during the past three months over i really cant understand it said mrs oneill there must be a good reason i said van zandts an unusual name so i hope it wont be too much trouble to find him or her i had a good idea what was going on oneill could be a secret poker player those payments could mean that hed lost heavily at poker and was paying back the winner month by month but why had he paid all that money to steinmann chapter four a voice from the past tuesday october th stella and i were at east rd street early now we had another person to find stella see if you can find a phone number for this van zandt i asked ill look for a number for steinmann my search was much faster than stellas it was all there in the phone book the number and an address on west th street on the upper west side near central park you needed serious money to live in that part of town i made the call good morning may i speak with mr steinmann i asked who are you and whats your business with mr steinmann answered a loud voice a voice i knew very well captain oldenberg of the nypd what was he doing there i wondered oldenberg great to hear your voice again i said remember me nat marley why it only seems like yesterday when we used to be cops together oldenberg didnt want to talk about old times just answer the question marley he shouted ok ok im making the call for a client mr steinmann is the head of her husbands department its important that i speak with him very interesting replied oldenberg thats going to be kind of difficult you see steinmann has disappeared nobodys seen him since friday how about you tell me whats going on i knew i might need oldenbergs help i told myself to be patient my clients husband is in some kind of trouble i said i thought his boss could help with a few questions i get the picture said oldenberg as usual you cant tell me the full story but let me tell you this marley dont try hiding information that could help my investigation or else ill have you at police headquarters for questioning message received and understood oldenberg was a good cop and was doing his job but as i knew from the old days with the nypd he was neither the friendliest nor the easiest guy to work with as soon as i put the phone down it rang it was mrs oneill she had returned home to henry street to pick up a change of clothes and she had found the front door wide open someone had broken into the house i remembered the calls that mrs oneill had received yesterday now i knew that someone was checking to see when the house was empty is anything missing i asked i really dont know please come quickly im so afraid theyll come back she said dont touch anything i told her can you wait with a neighbor good im on my way i left stella looking for phone numbers for van zandts i took another subway ride to brooklyn heights with the number of traffic lights between midtown manhattan and brooklyn the subway was always faster i called mrs oneills cellphone five minutes before i arrived she was standing by the front door her hands shaking mr marley this is just horrible it must be something to do with my poor patrick she cried she led me into the house someone had made a complete mess of the home office all the books were off the shelves with their pages open empty desk drawers were lying on the carpet the computer was still there but when i felt around the back of the machine it was open the hard drive was missing look here i said thats what they were looking for information on the hard drive but if they dont find what theyre looking for on the hard drive they could return and youll be in serious danger so i dont want you to return to this house again ill stay at julias until this is over mrs oneill said sadly ok we have to make sure this house is safe before you leave i said ill call a twentyfour hour lock service youll need new stronger locks ill stay here while we wait i would probably have a couple of hours to wait with mrs oneill it was a chance to ask a few more questions and get a better picture of her husband i didnt think she realized how much danger she could be in when would she agree to call the nypd mrs oneill what can you tell me about your husbands boss steinmann i started yesterday you said they werent the best of friends a couple of years ago patrick had the chance to become the department head he was the right person for the job and he was well liked unfortunately he didnt get the job though that wasnt his fault lorraine houston the president wanted someone fresh and new from outside she preferred the kind of guy who didnt care if he wasnt liked so steinmann got the job patrick continued with his work as best as he could but there was no friendship between him and steinmann thanks thats useful to know has your husband always lived in brooklyn i went on no we moved here when julia was just a kid patricks family are irishamerican his grandparents arrived in the us from dublin in the s they more or less got off the ship and moved straight to the east village patrick grew up in alphabet city on th street alphabet city is the part of the east village which gets its name from avenues a b c and d which cut across it it didnt use to be a safe area in fact it was a center for drugs and crime but now things have changed today you can find cool cafes bars and stores in the area so he didnt come from a rich family i asked not at all patricks parents had a hard life they never lived the american dream it wasnt easy for patrick either hes the youngest of six children so there was no question of the family paying for college patrick did it the hard way and paid for everything by working nights at a store he never had the advantages that i had where do you think he might hide to escape from somebody i asked where would he feel safest in this city i couldnt say for sure but the area he knows best of all is the east village she replied right now mrs oneill i dont want to worry you more than necessary but i think youre in real danger the people that broke into your house could come back i think we should call the nypd mrs oneill got up from her armchair walked over to the window and looked out into the street at last she spoke mr marley i know youre offering the best advice but you remember what patrick said in his message dont call the nypd those are his wishes and i have to follow them chapter five death by the hudson river it was midday before i got back to east rd street i picked up a snack at grand central station before returning to the office it hadnt taken stella long to find phone numbers for van zandts there were over fifty in all of new york city ok stella we can share this job i said ill take the first phone book and you can start on the second say youre an old friend of oneills and that youre trying to find him it was slow and boring work but i felt it would be worth it in the end good afternoon is this mr van zandt if i could have a minute of your time you see im trying to find an old friend of mine patrick oneill would you know him no ok thanks for your time as the calls continued i wasnt feeling too hopeful then i got an answering machine i listened to the message im sorry i cant get to the phone right now leave a message or phone i called the number the phone was answered after a couple of rings first the sound of jazz music then a voice frankies cocktail lounge good afternoon is that mr van zandt i asked hold on i heard the guy shout above the noise frank call for you could this finally be the right van zandt i waited patiently frank van zandt speaking if i could have a moment of your time mr van zandt i began ive lost the phone number and address of an old friend patrick oneill would you know how i could find him oh yeah i might whos asking replied van zandt not very welcoming i thought time to tell another lie the names marley im an old college friend patrick and i were at accounting school together if youre so clever mister look in the phone book and dont call again he added then put the phone down the line went dead clearly this guy didnt like me asking after oneill this time i felt i was in luck perhaps i should visit frankies cocktail lounge before i could organize anything the phone rang i picked it up and heard that voice from the past again captain oldenberg marley he shouted your lines been busy for ages could i have a minute of your valuable time sure go ahead i replied holding the phone away from my ear get yourself to the th street boat basin i got something to show you he laughed when oldenberg laughs it usually means bad news ok but why whats going on i asked its a surprise but i want you here now oldenberg ordered i told stella what was happening she gave me a smile and said dont get mad at oldenberg remember we may need his help i was back on the subway again this time to west th street i walked the two blocks from the subway station west toward the hudson river and crossed the riverside park to the boat basin from here you could see across the river to new jersey the temperature had dropped and the sky was full of heavy gray clouds a cold wind started to blow from the west all around the boat basin were houseboats ive heard its the cheapest way to live in this city ahead i could see nypd cars in a parking lot near the river as i got closer an nypd cop stopped me and said sorry sir you cant enter the names marley captain oldenbergs expecting me i replied ok come with me and well find the captain said the cop oldenberg was standing in the parking lot behind a chevrolet impala he was smiling which always made me feel uncomfortable take a look at this said oldenberg waving at the car oldenberg moved to the back of the car and opened the trunk inside was a dead man oldenberg called to the police doctor could you show me his face again doc he asked ok marley time for your surprise the nypd doctor was wearing a suit of white material over her clothes and white plastic gloves and shoes she carefully took the dead mans head in her hands and moved it round so we could see the face his skin was gray and his mouth was open between his eyes was a hole marley meet ronald steinmann doc would you tell mr marley what you know said oldenberg id say hes been dead about two or three days a single shot to the head you see these cuts around his face this guy was hit hard a number of times before he died cant tell you much more just now the police doctor told me heavy rain began to fall i was feeling sick although ive seen dead bodies before i still get that same horrible feeling i just checked the license plate this car belongs to mr patrick oneill henry street brooklyn we need to talk marley said oldenberg and i guess you need a drink lets go somewhere warmer oldenberg took me to the boat basin cafe where he ordered me a double scotch the drink was just the right medicine marley i got an idea and i think i may be right your client could be patrick oneill an accountant with ocean star finance or one of his family he asked i nodded the safest thing was to listen and see what oldenberg wanted steinmann disappeared some time on friday afternoon ive been asking questions at ocean star on friday morning people heard steinmann and oneill arguing this was no conversation between friends people said it was more like a fight it was behind closed doors so they couldnt say what they were arguing about today steinmann is found in oneills car murdered at the same time nobody seems to know where oneill is you see where this is leading i understood very well the sick feeling in my stomach started to get stronger im talking murder marley i want to question patrick oneill about the murder of ronald steinmann i want to know why oneill was paying money into steinmanns account also the reason why oneill had sent him an angry email it began i didnt think you could be so stupid that means i have to find him and i believe you know where he is you used to be a cop marley so you know the way the police work if you refuse to tell me thats a crime i held my head in my hands i could only tell oldenberg the truth that wouldnt be what he wanted to hear believe me oldenberg im being completely straight with you i have no idea where oneill is yes my client is his wife all she knows is that her husband is hiding somewhere ok another thing marley i have to question mrs oneill but i cant find her i just get the answering machine every time i call i need your help said oldenberg ok oldenberg ill see what i can do i replied on the journey back to east rd street i thought about the information i already knew i took a fresh page in my notebook and wrote down the facts i knew for sure and the questions that needed answers i knew oneill had disappeared sometime between saturday night and sunday morning he didnt like his boss steinmann and on friday hed argued with him also he had sent an angry email to steinmann oneill had made large payments to steinmann and van zandt he was interested in poker someone had broken into his house and stolen the hard drive of his computer now the police had found steinmann dead in the trunk of oneills car what was i less sure about what did oneill know which put him in danger had steinmann known the same thing had oneill lost heavily at poker was ocean star in difficulties what could explain those payments to steinmann and van zandt and finally could a guy like oneill kill the more i thought about it ocean star had to be the key to all the questions i called mrs oneill at her daughters apartment you said that your husband took his car when he disappeared i said thats right its not parked in the street she replied im afraid i have some terrible news this morning steinmanns body was found in the trunk of your husbands car i heard a scream over the phone then nothing are you still there i asked yes she replied quietly this is just awful i cant believe it so what happens now the police are now looking for your husband i explained im sorry but youll have to talk to the police i realize i dont have any choice replied mrs oneill but theres one condition the meeting should be at your office on east rd street chapter six questions and answers wednesday october th captain oldenberg and mrs oneill were in my office at nine oclock mrs oneill was wearing a very fashionable black jacket and skirt with a white blouse maybe she did her shopping on fifth avenue oldenberg was dressed in an ugly brown suit with an orange tie clothes that had been in fashion sometime during the last century before oldenberg started questioning mrs oneill i told him what i knew about patrick oneill i was trying to show the captain that oneill was just a good ordinary guy not a murderer as i see it patrick oneill could be in the middle of something very dangerous i began so far we have no clear idea of what that might be we cant be sure if the key to this case is ocean star or something that happened between oneill and steinmann or both lets move on to oneill the person we have a happily married family man whos worked for the same employer for over ten years in that time hes risen to be second in his department hes given years of his life to the firm also he has no criminal history oldenberg started to question mrs oneill as i thought his main interest was the argument between oneill and steinmann mrs oneill said oldenberg i was told at ocean star that your husband and steinmann argued on friday before they both disappeared we dont know what it was about but people heard mr oneill shouting would you say they worked well together it was never easy for patrick she replied steinmann pushed people hard second best was never good enough for him i cant say patrick liked him but he did his work as well as he could two years ago your husband had the chance to become the department head but lorraine houston brought in steinmann how did your husband feel about this asked oldenberg at the time he was angry but he learned to accept what had happened life has to go on mrs oneill replied could you think of anybody who would want to kill steinmann oldenberg asked her no she replied ok so hes not the nicest of guys but thats no reason for murder your husband was paying money to steinmann do you have any idea why oldenberg went on none at all mrs oneill replied oldenberg continued with questions about the angry email which mrs oneill answered patiently at last he said one more thing mrs oneill would you agree to a search of your house i guess i have to she replied and handed him her keys go ahead and do it thanks he said if im going to get any further with this case i must find him will you call him mrs oneill looked him straight in the eyes and said thats impossible patrick only calls me from pay phones patrick oneill is wanted for murder oldenberg said and if you marley or you mrs oneill know where he is and refuse to tell me thats a crime you could both find yourselves in jail mrs oneill looked angrily at oldenberg if looks could kill he would be a dead man after oldenberg had left the building mrs oneill started to cry im sure patrick has nothing to do with steinmanns murder she said but what if the police dont believe me and what if the people who killed steinmann go after patrick next i will find him i promise you i said but you must be careful when you get back to julias apartment stay inside ok stella could you call a cab for mrs oneill when mrs oneill had left i organized some help from an old friend who used to be a policeman like myself a guy who was as useful as ten nypd officers joe blaney hed taught me more about staying alive on the streets of manhattan than you could ever learn at police academy hes the sort of person you needed if there was going to be trouble and he knew how to use a gun i last carried a gun when i was a new york cop i havent carried one since and havent wanted to but there are times when one is necessary i picked up the phone joe i have work for you it could be dangerous so bring a gun a missing persons in danger and were going to find him come to east rd street with your car as soon as you can chapter seven frankies cocktail lounge the plan was that joe and i would pay a visit to van zandt and see if he could lead us to oneill meanwhile mrs oneill would come back to the office that afternoon and stay with stella joe blaney arrived in his car soon after midday hes in his middlesixties but hes tall and slim with a full head of white hair although hes probably twenty years older than me id say he looks younger some guys have all the luck in the car joe pulled his jacket to one side to show me the gun lets hope we dont have to use this boss he said we drove downtown on second avenue toward th street the traffic wasnt too heavy and we soon arrived in the east village we went straight along th street to avenue a frankies cocktail lounge was on th street between avenues a and b joe stopped the car above the double doors i could read the words frankies cold drinks warm people hot sounds lets do it i said we went into frankies and sat at a table at first it seemed almost dark but soon i could see better it was a comfortable room with armchairs sofas red carpets and the sound of jazz guitar music we needed clear heads so we ordered two coffees not the cocktail specials there were no customers at the bar so i had a look at who was working behind it a couple of bartenders and someone who i guessed must be the boss he was medium height with a short black beard but without a single hair on his head i think weve found van zandt i said looking toward the bar well try and have a little talk i walked over to the bar with joe van zandt looked up from some papers he was checking would you be mr van zandt i asked thats me he replied what can i do for you could i talk to you about patrick oneill i asked who are you van zandt asked carefully and gave me a cold hard look nat marley licensed private investigator i said i spoke to you on the phone yesterday i believe you know oneill his wifes very worried about him and i think you could help i dont have to talk to you he said angrily suddenly a big strong bartender was standing in front of me you got a problem boss he asked van zandt its ok i said quietly were not looking for trouble look take my cellphone and press call youll get my office ask to talk with oneills wife van zandt did as i said and spent a couple of minutes checking facts with mrs oneill after a while he returned the cellphone and said ok what do you want he waved the bartender away and led us to a room behind the bar inside the air didnt smell too fresh old cigarette smoke van zandt found chairs and sat us at a round table i introduced joe then began questioning van zandt i believe that oneill has paid you a lot of money i asked youre not stealing from him i hope its not robbery replied van zandt thats what i won fairly in a poker game it works both ways patricks an excellent player and ive paid him thousands when i lost were old friends ive known him since we were both kids working nights at a store so explain this i continued why does a wall street accountant come to a back room in the east village to play poker ive met several guys like patrick hardworking family men who earn good money but they want a little more from life maybe theyre just bored so i give them a good time i know organizing backroom poker games is a crime but im not hurting anybody these guys have the money like patricks boss steinmann im just offering them a service so oneill brought steinmann here i asked van zandt in surprise yeah once or twice i dont think patrick really wanted to but i guess he couldnt refuse one night we all lost heavily to steinmann he played like poker was his second profession i had to ask patrick not to bring him again it would hurt my bank account too much van zandt had answered two questions why oneill had made payments to both himself and steinmann ok lets forget the money i said im really interested in finding oneill you know hes in some kind of trouble after reading about steinmanns murder in the morning papers i had a good idea what the trouble could be replied van zandt patrick got here soon after midnight sunday morning he said he was in danger but he wouldnt talk about it he needed to hide someplace for a few days and was going to check into a hotel around here he also told me to keep quiet if anyone came asking questions and one last thing he told me to expect a letter from his firm he said it was really important and i should keep it for him if its arrived could we take a look i asked i guess i could show you he said it was a thick envelope with the address written in oneills handwriting i took out my pocket knife and cut it open inside i found some papers probably about twenty pages at the top of each page i could see the words ocean star finance in red and gold letters on every page there were lines of numbers you know what this is asked van zandt i guess some sort of accounts from ocean star i said another guess this information may have something to do with steinmanns murder mr van zandt id like to thank you for your help we may be able to reach oneill in time i dont think anyone else knows these papers are here so could you keep them in a safe place before joe and i started searching the east village i called stella to tell her what wed discovered so far when id finished stella said mrs oneill wants to speak with you mr marley thank you said mrs oneill youre getting close to patrick i can feel it please find him and make the police believe that my husband is no killer chapter eight the east village our search area was wide everything between fourth avenue and avenue d then everything between east houston street and east th street within that area are fourteen streets and eight avenues now do the math that makes around eighty blocks the good news was that if oneill was staying in a hotel in the area like van zandt said we didnt have too many places to check most of the hotels are either along third avenue or the streets off it there were two problems first what sort of hotel would oneill choose somewhere busy on a crowded street where he wouldnt be noticed or would he prefer somewhere quieter and more basic with less activity a place where it would be easier to watch and listen second how would we find out if he was staying there would he check in under his own name and how could we get the hotel receptionist to tell us if he was there hotel receptionists dont give information about their guests to complete strangers so we had a plan id say i had a business meeting with oneill to help receptionists believe the story id asked stella to produce some company information for patrick oneill accounting there was a photo of oneill on the front which id hold so the receptionist could see his face time after time at hotels i introduced myself and spoke to the receptionists excuse me my names marley i have a meeting with patrick oneill would you call his room to tell him im at reception we had no luck at the more expensive places which were full of tourists and business people after asking at a few we knew what sort of answers to expect im sorry sir do you have the correct hotel i wish i could help you but hour after hour our search area grew wider we had moved away from third avenue deeper into the center of the east village toward alphabet city at some of the cheaper places the receptionists were less patient we got nobody by that name staying here mister look mister i just work here its not my job to remember faces we continued until early evening it was six thirty not long before sunset and the sky in the west was growing pink we just had one or two more places to check in alphabet city the next hotel the madigan inn on avenue b looked like an ugly dirty place but the receptionist was helpful i asked the usual questions and made sure that she could see oneills photo then the surprise i could see from the look on her face that she knew something sure i know the guy she said but not by the name of oneill i dont know if im allowed to say i showed her my investigators license and said the truth is this guys life is in danger im working for his family and we need to find him quickly before someone else does she believed me and turned to check the computer yeah there he is she said he stayed for one night and checked out yesterday the name he gave was brendan touhey can you tell me anything more i asked did he have any visitors how did he spend his time well he asked for a room on the street that seemed to be important he didnt have any visitors and spent most of the time in his room i think he was watching the street or thats what i thought when i looked up at his window thanks i said youve been really helpful you could ask at our other hotel she said i could phone ahead to tell them to expect you its the metro on avenue c between th and rd please if you would i replied as we left i said to joe at last were getting somewhere i think i know what hes doing just staying a night at one place then moving on joe suddenly stopped in front of the door to the street nat you see that car just across the street the black one i asked thats it i think ive seen it before outside your office but i couldnt be too sure joe went on i studied the car carefully a lexus which costs serious money three guys with dark glasses were inside it was starting to get dark and ive never liked guys who wear sunglasses at night i had a horrible feeling that those people meant trouble then the driver looked toward us and the car quickly moved along the avenue in the poor light i couldnt read the license plate what do you think boss asked joe are they following us the streetlights had now come on under their yellow light i could see the answer to joes question on the road beside joes car was a knife there was no air in two of the tires so it was impossible to drive now i realized what was happening those guys had followed us hoping we would lead them to oneill they knew we were checking hotels and the metro was the last one in the area they wanted to make sure they got there first we ran across to avenue c but we were losing valuable time the metro like the last hotel looked as if nobody cared for it the receptionist though was friendly and welcomed us with a smile hi im gina she said you guys didnt need to hurry we got i stopped her and said the receptionist at the madigan just phoned ahead and told you to expect us were looking for patrick oneill hes in danger and might be using a different name has anyone asked for him i showed her oneills photograph oh yes said gina hes staying here but under the name of bernard delaney nice quiet guy he stays in his room most of the time theres something i dont understand youre the second group of people asking about him the others went up to his room five minutes ago but they just left what others i shouted three guys in black suits and dark glasses she replied i thought they were the ones i was expecting did oneill leave with them i asked no gina replied oh my god give me the room number quick i shouted i hope were not too late chapter nine the metro avenue c second floor room said gina no time to lose joe and i ran upstairs to the room the door was open and the lock was broken inside we could see that someone had quickly searched the room an empty travel bag was lying on the floor the blankets had been pulled off the bed and clothes thrown around the room oneills not here but those other guys wont be far away i said i dont like this one bit lets get back to the lobby at the desk i made a call for the police described the three guys and their car and said i believe theyre looking for patrick oneill whos staying at this hotel we walked out onto the street to wait for the police who i knew ought to be here in minutes but things now happened very quickly a guy in dark glasses was standing opposite us across the road he laughed and said i guess you aint going no place fast then he began to cross the street like he didnt need to hurry he spoke again you guys just tell me where oneill is then you can go home and forget you ever saw me he wanted oneill but we had no idea where he might be i looked left and right along the street on either side of us was a guy in a black suit walking slowly toward us both of them were carrying guns we had no place to run no place to hide luckily joe was thinking more quickly than me back inside the hotel now he shouted and pushed me toward the entrance we turned and ran inside behind us i could hear the sound of running feet as they chased after us on the floor behind the desk now said joe there was no time to say if you please maam as i threw gina to the ground the front door opened with a crash but joe was ready for them i heard two shots followed by a scream then everything was quiet there was a cloud of smoke from the shots in the air joe was now at the desk i think i hit one but theyll be back said joe we have to hurry gina you got to help us is there a back entrance through here replied gina follow me she led us through a door behind the desk then down some steps behind us i heard a crash as the men in black returned we were now hurrying through the hotel kitchen i heard shouts and feet on the stairs they were getting close turn off any lights and lock doors behind us if you can i told gina i decided to make things more difficult for the guys following us i pulled glasses and bottles to the floor we reached the back door just as we heard the men coming into the kitchen there was a shot which left a hole in the wall beside me that was much too close a second later the room was in complete darkness as gina turned off the lights there were shouts as one of the guys fell over up these steps hurry said gina we were now outside in the cold night air we went up a few more steps then out into a narrow street behind the hotel in the darkness i could just see back entrances to buildings along avenue c we had passed a few doors when gina suddenly stopped i dont know what to do she screamed through this door quickly i ordered and get down we hit the ground behind some boxes it didnt smell too clean down there but this wasnt the time to worry about the dry cleaners bill gina had started to cry so i put my hand over her mouth to keep her quiet dont make a sound joe whispered with luck the nypd should arrive before they find us as we hid there in the darkness we heard feet running to the left and right along the narrow street then we heard the steps returning more slowly and voices they got to be here someplace said one they cant have gotten far start with these doors said another lets see where theyre hiding there was crash after crash as the doors were opened more shots well thats one way to unlock a door if you dont have the key the noise was now getting closer i kept my hand over ginas mouth her body was shaking finally above the crashes and shots a new but very welcome sound the scream of a police car its the cops lets get out of here shouted a voice on the other side of the door we heard them running back toward the hotel then all went quiet after waiting a few minutes i decided it was safe to come out back inside the hotel kitchen it looked like the morning after a wild party we walked carefully around the broken glasses and bottles on the floor in the hotel lobby two guys in black suits were lying on the floor above them stood two nypd cops am i pleased to see you i said im nat marley licensed private investigator did you catch all three of them yes sir the other one is outside with the sergeant hell need an ambulance said one of the cops we got here just in time said the other captain oldenbergs on his way hell need to question you gina was feeling better her suit was black with dirt and oil mine didnt look much cleaner though now i started to shake its always the same it never hits me at the time but later when i realize im lucky to be alive i guess i could make everyone coffee said gina thatd be great but then i had a sudden thought and shouted joe upstairs now we ran back up to room the door was closed and when i knocked there was no reply i put my ear to the door and listened somebody was moving around in the room i tried to open the door but there was something against it on the other side however it wasnt strong enough for joes boot and flew open inside we saw a man holding the travel bag he threw the bag into joes face and tried to push past me but i was able to catch his coat and pull him to the floor i looked at him closely a middleaged guy with gray hair and black metal glasses patrick oneill dont be afraid i said im nat marley private investigator im working for your wife joyce youre going be safe its time to stop running chapter ten time to fight back there was a hopeless look in oneills eyes his lips moved but he couldnt speak i shook his shoulders and made him look straight at me listen were the good guys youre out of danger your wife sent us to find you he still seemed to be unsure so i pulled him to his feet and tried again heres my cellphone its calling my office number as soon as my personal assistant answers ask to speak to joyce we waited while he spoke to his wife he sat down on the bed as he talked now he looked tired and weak like a lost child if you dont mind mr oneill i need to talk to my personal assistant now i said he returned my cellphone stella listen carefully i said call a cab and take mrs oneill to frankies cocktail lounge on th street were going to meet you there as soon as possible we need to make oldenberg believe that oneill is not steinmanns killer now oneill was beginning to look more normal i guess i should say sorry he said how did you know where to find me i can explain that i replied through information in your bank accounts we learned that youd made payments to a van zandt thats how we found your old friend frank so you know about the poker games said oneill when i told joyce i was working late i was actually it doesnt matter now i said van zandt told us that youd checked into a hotel somewhere in the east village you heard about steinmanns murder the police think you did it but i didnt think that could be true so i thought you might be in danger too but how did you get away from the guys in black suits i was watching the street from my window began oneill i saw them arrive and thought they had to be bad news i ran up to the top floor and hid in a blanket cupboard id been up there for about ten minutes when i heard the shots so i stayed there until i heard the police car arrive and came down to my floor when i looked out of my window again i could see the sergeant outside with one of them finally i thought it was safe enough to escape that letter you sent to van zandt what do all those numbers mean i asked theyre the reason why steinmann was murdered replied oneill suddenly there was someone at the door it was captain oldenberg he looked around shook his head and asked in a tired voice would you mind telling me whats going on marley oldenberg let me introduce mr patrick oneill mr oneill was almost murdered here tonight thanks to the sergeant and his team were all still alive mr oneill has a story to tell you i believe that once you know all the facts it will be clear that he cant be steinmanns killer im listening marley said oldenberg but whether hes the killer is for the police to decide not you mr oneill can show you all the information you need i continued if you agree it means a quick journey to frankies cocktail lounge on th street everythings there agreed said oldenberg but for the moment oneill youre still wanted for murder and that means youre my prisoner anyway i guess police headquarters will be rather safer than this hotel we all went downstairs back to reception where oldenberg organized everyone sergeant youre coming with me and oneill have your men take away the other two prisoners and one officer should stay with the guy who was shot joe had to leave and get some help with his car oldenberg drove us through the east village back to th street frankies cocktail lounge was now noisy with the evening crowd a jazz band was getting ready to play i saw stella and mrs oneill sitting at a corner table waiting for us to arrive your husbands outside mrs oneill i told her if you could be patient for a few more minutes ill find somewhere less public to talk i went over to the bar and shouted above the noise to the bartender i need to speak to frank where can i find him in the back room answered the bartender just go straight through i coughed as i entered because the air was heavy with cigarette smoke oneills outside with the police i said could we meet in here oh and well need that envelope sure lets get some fresh air in here said van zandt as he threw open a window oldenberg brought oneill into the room and stella followed with mrs oneill as soon as everybody was inside the office oneill took his wife in his arms its wonderful to see you again joyce he said im going to stop hiding now its time to fight back patrick ive been so worried for you she said whats been happening why all these secrets theres so much to ex plain replied oneill ill tell you everything i promise but first i have to make the captain understand that im not to blame for steinmanns death oneill turned to oldenberg and opened the envelope he took out the papers and laid them on the table he said these are secret papers from the ocean star presidents office theres enough information here to send lorraine houston to jail if you could keep it short said oldenberg ok ocean star is an investment firm its business is making money for its clients continued oneill how do they do this by investing clients money in the international money markets or thats what should happen look at this page its organized in two halves so lets compare the two sides on the left the numbers show money that was paid to clients often a fifteen per cent return on the right we see what the firm actually made from investments surprise surprise these numbers are far less you realize what this means go on tell me said oldenberg youre the accountant ocean star cant possibly earn enough from its investments to pay big money to the clients and millions to the president its using the money from new clients to pay the old clients as long as it continues to get large numbers of new clients this can work and people think its the smartest firm on wall street however its a serious crime i believe thats why steinmann was murdered he knew about it too after i showed him these accounts and he talked to houston i want to make all this public and now i dont care if it destroys ocean star at the same time is that clear captain more or less replied oldenberg if i could take those papers thanks but there are a lot more questions which i want answered well continue at police headquarters mr oneill youre still my prisoner chapter eleven oneills story at police headquarters oldenberg led us up to his office id sent stella home at least one of us should try and get a good nights sleep mrs oneill wouldnt leave her husband inside oldenbergs office it couldnt be more different from the offices id seen at ocean star the walls were a dirty green color and there was no carpeting on the floor basic was the best word to describe it oldenberg had ordered coffee and sandwiches for everybody at least the nypd coffee tasted better than it used to when i was a cop you have a story to tell us mr oneill said oldenberg i want to know everything about you steinmann and ocean star ok two years ago the old department head moved to another firm began oneill id worked at ocean star for over eight years and i thought i had a good chance of getting the job i was wrong the president lorraine houston had decided to bring in someone new someone who didnt care who he hurt so i went on with my work and did what was necessary with steinmann as head of department the firm was making even more money than before houston thought he was wonderful but people who were working with me thought the opposite steinmann loved to push people hard a year ago i asked steinmann how the firm could continue paying so much money to its clients the money our department made from clients investments wasnt that high i did the math again and still didnt understand where was the money coming from i was worried but steinmann promised me that there were no problems he said just do your job and dont ask too many questions she knows what shes doing on the top floor the top floor is where lorraine houston has her offices steinmann hoped to get his own office there some day it seemed impossible to talk to him so i kept my mouth shut time passed and ocean star went on paying out big money to its clients then on friday morning last week i received the information that could destroy the firm and send lorraine houston to jail it happened by chance i got a letter from houstons office at first i didnt understand why id been sent a hard copy of the accounts usually everything like that is sent through office email i soon realized that it had been a mistake houstons personal assistant had sent me an envelope which was meant to go to the vicepresident i knew i shouldnt but i continued reading as i read i was more and more surprised now i understood that the public accounts werent the truth these were secret accounts which werent on computer they showed that ocean star was using the money from its new clients to pay the old ones now i understood how houston had so much to spend on her cars homes clothes and vacations i didnt like the idea but i thought i should talk with steinmann i knew i had to be careful so i made a copy of the accounts to show him what about the ones id received how could i get the information out of the building safely i had an idea i put the accounts in an envelope and addressed it to my old friend frank van zandt then i left the building for five minutes and dropped the envelope in the nearest mailbox later that morning i spoke with steinmann and gave him the copy of the accounts he was immediately very interested he laughed and said so thats how she does it youve done the right thing ill go straight upstairs and talk with houston with this information i could make a lot of money maybe ill share some with you his plan was to ask houston to pay him to keep quiet i became really angry with him and tried to make him change his mind but he refused he wouldnt listen to me and went up to the top floor now i knew that i could be in real trouble because steinmann had gotten the accounts from me i wasnt sure what to do but my first move was to get out of the office quick i told my personal assistant that id had an awful headache all day and had to go home back home i waited a couple of hours then made some phone calls first i called steinmanns personal assistant she told me that steinmanns desk was empty and his computer was gone but she couldnt tell me anything more i sent steinmann an angry email to his home computer i wrote something like i didnt think you could be so stupid i cant believe what youve done the next day i felt bad about what id said in the email so i tried to phone steinmann his wife answered and told me that he hadnt come home and she was very worried that night i stayed up late thinking about what i should do just before midnight i got a call someone said you have information which belongs to the firm return this information to ms houston by midday tomorrow if you want to stay alive how could i return the accounts they were in the us mail so i thought the safest thing to do was to hide i wrote a note for joyce and left in the middle of the night looking back maybe it wasnt the most intelligent decision i packed a bag left by the back entrance took a cab to frank van zandts place i can promise you i left my car on henry street i told frank to expect the letter with the accounts then i checked into a hotel on monday morning i took out from the bank so i wouldnt need to use any credit cards i think you know the rest of the story thanks mr oneill said oldenberg thats very helpful oldenberg led me to another office he thought for a few moments then said marley i need some advice my problem is this if i accept that houston ordered steinmanns murder how can i show that its true if youll allow me captain i said i got an idea that just might work chapter twelve if the price is right what if nobody knew that oneill was at police headquarters that would give us the chance to tell some clever lies lies that might give us the advantage i shared my ideas with the captain we dont know for sure but lets say lorraine houston planned steinmanns murder i began shes killed one person and she wants oneill badly enough to kill again why dont we try out this plan give the news of what happened at the metro hotel tonight to the newspapers tv and radio stations some of it can be true but a few things can be changed we tell them that oneill escaped and is believed to be somewhere in the east village area houston will be very afraid she has a lot to lose if she doesnt find oneill first and stop him from talking ok marley so far so good what next asked oldenberg if you agree i could speak with her ill tell her i have something to sell the secret accounts go on said oldenberg im interested but why you why couldnt an nypd officer do it ill tell her ive found oneill and am keeping him someplace safe where shell never find him ill also tell her i have the accounts which ill offer to sell if the price is right ill make her an offer which she cant refuse for ill return the accounts to her and give oneill to the police houston will think she has won the secret accounts will be safe and oneill will be in jail for steinmanns murder ill meet with her then try and get her to talk come on marley get real said oldenberg you think a hard businesswoman like houston is just going to say oh by the way i ordered steinmanns murder ill let her think im the same sort of person as her i continued a businessman who doesnt care how he earns his money or who he hurts if she feels comfortable with me then we might get the truth this had better work marley i hope youre a good enough actor said oldenberg believe me oldenberg on a good day i could win oscars i told him all right well do it replied oldenberg this could be dangerous you know that as well as i do youll need a full nypd team behind you ill organize that as soon as you and houston have a time and a place to meet so now ill talk to the newspapers and houston will think that oneill is still in hiding ok and one more thing i said mrs oneill and her daughter julia could be in real danger could you move them to an nypd safe house consider it done said oldenberg wednesday had been a very long day i got home at three oclock in the morning and i was so tired that i felt like a dead man walking i fell into bed and slept well the next morning i woke up late feeling much better after quickly getting dressed i ran down to the nearest newsstand and picked up the morning newspapers i took the papers into slim petes diner on main street to read more carefully the name slim is a joke actually he has a serious weight problem whatll it be mr marley asked pete with a big smile eggs pancakes and bacon i answered and make that coffee strong will you you got it so whats the famous mr marley doing today asked pete helping new yorks finest win the war against crime something like that i replied new yorks finest thats what people call the nypd i never thought of myself as one of the finest when i was a cop and i never thought i was fighting a war i was just doing my job if there was a little less crime on the streets by the end of the day that was good enough for me i read through the newspapers oldenberg had done an excellent job the oneill story was on all the front pages the headline of the daily news read nypds most wanted escapes the new york post headline made me smile killer accountant on the run there was some truth but the rest of the story sounded like something from the movies this man is both intelligent and dangerous said captain oldenberg this wasnt the oneill that i knew while i ate my breakfast i watched the tv news their reporter said this is cindy lu outside the metro hotel on avenue c here last night nypd officers almost caught patrick oneill the man wanted for the murder of ronald steinmann well done oldenberg i thought now houston would get a clear message neither her people nor the nypd had found oneill so she still had a real problem on her hands i hoped she was one very worried woman i got to the office by ten oclock stella had already been there a couple of hours that was quite a day yesterday you feeling ok now she asked a lot better i replied and thank you for taking care of mrs oneill all day with luck were going to send lorraine houston to jail during the morning i agreed on a plan with oldenberg i would meet with houston in a public area the kind of place where it would be easy for an nypd team to watch and wait our choice was battery park at the foot of manhattan with its tall trees and green grass this is where new york meets the ocean from here you can look across upper new york bay to the statue of liberty and staten island i tried to get through to houston on my cellphone but her personal assistant wouldnt allow me to speak with her im sorry sir but ms houston isnt taking any calls she said i wasnt going to take no for an answer listen carefully and just do what i say your boss lost something of great importance tell her ive found it and want to return it to her ill call back in ten minutes and expect to speak with her in person understood careful now i told myself no mistakes i waited a full fifteen minutes before calling back people think less clearly when they get impatient this time i got ahold of houston immediately who are you and what do you want she asked crossly the names marley i was working for mr oneill he found some interesting papers of yours which he gave me to look after now im working for myself and i thought that you might like to have those papers back ill make this offer even more generous the police will be very interested when i tell them where oneill is the price is wait in your office for my call at eight oclock tomorrow morning what began houston thats it lady i shouted be ready in your office eight oclock tomorrow with ok and dont think of doing anything clever or every newspaper in this city will know the truth about ocean stars accounts with that i ended the call i felt very pleased with myself would i still feel so pleased tomorrow chapter thirteen battery park friday october th am i was on my way from grand central station to bowling green on a number five train this subway station is just north of battery park which was where i was going to meet lorraine houston battery park is a public area where it would be easier for the nypd team to watch and wait i thought that houston would feel uncomfortable away from the deep carpets and expensive furniture of her offices from the subway station it was just a few minutes walk to battery park i walked across to the sphere a famous piece of public art at the north end of the park a large gold metal ball as tall as a house oldenbergs team was already waiting there with hidden cameras though you wouldnt know they were police officers two young guys talking on a seat a couple standing under an umbrella their orders were to watch and wait but if i waved my hat they would immediately help me the sky was full of black clouds and it was starting to rain i put up my umbrella and looked at my watch it was eight oclock time to call houston ms houston im waiting for you i said bring the money and come alone if theres any trouble my personal assistant has a copy of your accounts ready to email to every newspaper in new york if all goes to plan shell destroy that copy ok thats understood she replied how do i know youre telling the truth ask yourself this question what will happen if you dont believe me ill need your cellphone number thanks now leave the building and wait outside the front entrance i let her wait a few minutes in the cold i wanted her to feel angry and impatient by the time she arrived at battery park now for my next call so sorry to keep you waiting i lied you see a tall whitehaired guy in a dark green overcoat carrying a copy of the wall street journal he should be opposite you standing by a cab houston said she could see him thats my assistant mr blaney go and talk with him i continued he has a cab waiting for you we had to make sure that houston arrived alone joe blaneys job was to make sure that she took our cab a cab with an nypd driver houston was going to be taken on a little tour of lower manhattan we were going to take our time and make sure she was in a very bad mood by the time she met me thirty minutes later i called houston again tell the driver to drop you at the north entrance to battery park opposite bowling green then walk south to the sphere youll see me holding a blue and white golf umbrella by the way you dont need to pay the driver hope you enjoyed your sightseeing i wouldnt like to repeat houstons reply such bad language the rain was beginning to fall more heavily as i saw her she was tall and slim and was wearing a red suit with a short skirt that showed a lot of leg she really wasnt dressed for the weather i turned on my little secret recorder i waved to her and sat on a park seat under the trees opposite the sphere this had better be good marley she said do you have my papers not so fast i replied do you have my money she put her case on her knees and opened it inside it was packed with hundreddollar bills count it if you like she said dont you think the park looks lovely in fall i asked i dont have all day hurry up and give me the papers she said impatiently i slowly reached into my case and took out an envelope which i gave to her then i reached into my coat pocket for my cellphone houston took a single piece of paper out of the envelope and looked at me like a dog which was about to bite give me the rest of the accounts marley or youre dead meat she had taken a small gun out of her purse and was pressing it into my side not very intelligent ms houston i said remember if anything happens to me my personal assistant will email your accounts to every newspaper in this city if i press send my personal assistant gets that message also shooting people in public isnt a good idea youll get the rest of the papers just be patient like any good businessman i like to count my money first she gave me a cold hard look through narrow eyes then put the gun back in her purse now she was beginning to shake with the cold here take my overcoat i said she took the coat and put it over her shoulders she smiled for the first time and thanked me now i felt i might have the advantage i quickly checked the money then took a second envelope from my case and held it in front of her there must be some very important information here youre one smart businesswoman ms houston and a good employer i like the way you find answers to problems with your people like sending steinmann on his final drive in oneills car good work the police think that oneill is the killer that way you can be completely sure its the end of your trouble with those two as soon as i tell the police where oneill is youre safe she smiled again youre a smart guy im sorry about steinmann he was good at his job until he started to think he was smarter than me i couldnt let him tell me what to do i had to get rid of him at last i had it and everything was on the recorder i passed her the second envelope she opened it quickly took out the papers and counted them looks like its all here its been good doing business with you she said and returned my overcoat now just make sure the police get ahold of oneill as she walked away i called to her actually ms houston i got a message from oneill hed like to tell you smile youre on a police camera i waved my hat in the air houston screamed and pulled out her gun but in seconds the nypd team was all around her she dropped the gun and fell to the ground a minute ago she had been the president of ocean star finance and a very rich woman now she was going to spend many years in jail i called oldenberg to tell him the news good work marley he said oneill will soon be a free man the rain had stopped and the sun had begun to break through the heavy clouds in the sunshine leaves were dropping from the trees and turning in the wind the air from the ocean smelled fresh and clean it felt good to be alive i should spend more time in this citys parks the end
