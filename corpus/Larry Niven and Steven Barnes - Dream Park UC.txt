 part one chapter one arrivals the train sat rigid as a steel bar poised in midair above its magnetic monorail track disgorging passengers into dallas station its fifteen cars had borne their passengers in quiet efficiency from new york to dallas in just over half an hour cradled in magnetic fields travelling through vacuum at close to orbital velocity deep underground chester had cut it close he shifted his heavy backpack and strode back along the train walking like a king projecting confidence there would be garners aboard and some would recognize him lore master chester henderson was conscious of his unseen audience chester he stopped dismayed he knew that voicethere she was a vision in leopard tights that drew stares from all but the most jaded her long red hair plaited into a thick rope dangled down her back to the top of her belt line she wore heavy makeup that almost hid the fact that she was indeed a very lovely woman but the leotards hid nothing hello gina chester sighed with a tone somewhere south of resignation i should have guessed youd be along i wouldnt miss it for anything remember last time when you saved me from the mammoth cost me three points for frostbite i remember dont complain its mean anyway i was very appreciative she coiled her arm around him and joined him in a rather strained lockstep toward the dream park shuttle she had been he remembered very appreciative one of your strong points he said and put his arm around her it felt disturbingly good nestled there between warm curves well im glad youre with us we may need to pass you off as a virgin or something would you really she giggled ive always loved your imagination chester didnt smile but gina if youre in youre going to have to follow orders a mite more carefully you almost screwed me goodstop that im serious this is extremely important to me all right gina looked up at him and her face grew almost serious anything you say chester chester groaned to himself as they boarded the train she had skill she was better than most newcomers she carried her weight and sometimes followed orders too but she treated it like some kind of goddam game alex griffin took his shuttle seat and settled back with eyes closed and arms folded comfortably he had long since learned the value of catching bits of rest where he could and could catnap during minutes most people spent fidgeting he stretched and heard popping sounds as muscles and joints woke up small wonder they were still halfasleep ten minutes earlier he had been snoring in his apartment at the cowles modular community with the alarm buzzing in his ears the third time it went off it would refuse to shut up until his pounds were lifted from the sensor in the mattress he opened a sleepy green eye and watched the rear monitor as the cluster of buildings receded from view five hundred dream park employees maintained residences in cowles modular community nestled in the little san bernardino mountains fifteen kilometers and six shuttle minutes away from work griffin was on call twentyfour hours a day three weeks out of the month and he appreciated the convenience of cmc but this morning was nothing special just the usual am roust alex rolled his wrist over to check the watch imprinted on his sleeve three minutes until the shuttle slid into the employee depot he had about decided to close his eyes again when the picture in front of him changed the woman on the flatscreen might have been beautiful by the light of noon at am she was evil incarnate morning chief she chirped obscenely wideawake no no it isnt millicent alex yawned rudely remotely disliking himself for it he ran blunt fingers through his light red hair and made a serious attempt to focus his eyes oh what the hay maybe it is a good morning maybe itll even be a good day im sorry millicent whats up final prep for the south seas treasure game tomorrow is the hottest item you have some dossiers to go over i know what else she shook her head her loosely curled afro bouncing a bit as she studied the computer display on a second screen offscreen umm budget meeting with the boss he was definitely more alert now did i exceed harmonys projected red last quarter dont think so better not have thats my department and i dont make mistakes like that heh heh heh heh well i think were switching over from zerobase budgeting to some new system that harmony is hot on oh lord what else dont i have a class to teach today yes one oclock right after a scheduled lunch with obrien alexs face lit up hallelujah a bright spot at last tell skip to meet me at leventhirty at the white hart okay and ask him to bring me the l specs i want to see them what about the class standard constraint and detention stuff for the new security people right alex glanced at his sleeve the station was seconds away make me a memo standing arm bar crossover toe hold for the ground work and oh lets say knife disarms right and left wrist locks with low kicks ill wing it from there im almost in now hon ill see you in a few minutes okay right griff she said flashing him a smile as the picture faded out the shuttle let him out in the central core of the acre dream park complex two levels underground activity was heavy for this early he thought then he remembered the game odds were there would be five thousand dollars of lastminute work to be done or ho didnt know the catchup kings over in special projects tunnels stretched off in all directions up down sideways and maybe to yesterday and tomorrow if the research department had come up with anything since breakfast most of the people scurrying past knew him by name tossing off a hi alex or sappening griff or morning chief as they ferried racks of costumes or props or electronic equipment to the different divisions a cargo tram hissed in and a crew of overalled workers and tiny humming cargo bots rushed in to unload so that another shipment could hurry down the line he tossed a friendly salute to the guard at the elevator and pressed his right thumb against the id pad the door opened five or six people crowded in after him and alex controlled his annoyance when only two of them put their thumbs to the pad for clearance more memos dammit it was am thursday march according to alexs desk clock propped on the clock was a sheet of fanfold paper millicents printout of the days obligations alex doffed his coat and dropped into his chair he punched a finger at the desk console a hologram window formed above his desk a nameplate that read ms summers and behind the nameplate a dark pretty face whipping around to answer the buzz millicent cant i foist some of this off on bobbick how the hell is he going to earn his pay if i do all the work marty is already with insurance going over the damage report on the salvage game that ended yesterday in gaming area b he should be free by about two this afternoon or do you want me to no leave him on it listen do i have to go all the way over to r d or can we take care of this mess by phone lord knows ive got enough paper to shuffle before eight check it out would you right griff im pretty sure thatll go her face blinked out and alex punched for a display of todays paperwork three columns of headings ran off the screen an executive secretary and a deputy security chief and this much garbage still filtered up to him work first a slow smile played over his face a little peek at the park first he triggered the exterior monitor and watched the room swell with the darkened spirals of dream park from the vantage of the monitoring camera the workers readying the park for the days visitors were ants streaming in and out of the long black shadows of early morning there was the somber shape of the olde arkham tour snakelike and far off around the edge of the park the gravity whip coiled offering a total of thirty seconds of weightlessness via computerdesigned parabolic arcs the monitor eye swept over to gaming area b where the salvage game had been conducted that one was interesting partly in desert territory and partly underwater it had involved twelve players for two days alex figured that the game master on that one would just about break even it had cost three hundred thousand dollars to set the game up the twelve participants had paid four hundred a day each for the privilege of earning gaming points for the fantasy characters they portrayed and not incidentally for having the bejeezus scared out of them book rights presold film rights likewise he couldnt pretend to understand the logic behind it the vagaries of the international gaming society were totally beyond him the players seemed to speak a foreign language and this month they had two games back to back the games did help the park though the olde arkham tour had started as a game thirty or forty years ago there now that was more like it the big shooting gallery over across from the hell ride was more his cup of tea alex slipped in there occasionally to knock off a few nazis or dinosaurs or muggers god that was a realistic experience the r d boys were incredible and quite mad he thumbed the control and the camera roved further afield over there his monitor buzzed and with a grimace alex shut off the holo and answered the call muffles voice spoke but the congealing visual image was of a guard griffin couldnt quite place research and development gruff muffles voice said right name and background fell into place now this would be albert rice calling from his guard station between files and the technological monster known as game center rice was strong and smart quick to volunteer his services and griffin sometimes felt a twinge of guilt at not warming to the man maybe just jealousy he mused rice cut a handsome blond profile almost pretty and several of the secretaries in protective services had bets going to see who would score with him first in the year rice had been with dream park nobody had yet collected something was bothering rice he seemed agitated he kept shifting his feet yes rice whats the problem ah good morning sir nothing wrong here at the post but he hesitated then blurted i just got word that my apartment in cmc was vandalized griffin felt himself coming to attention when was the report filed only about a half hour ago lock broken and some stuff scattered around the cop said but they didnt take my electronics id like to see what is missing griffin nodded somberly you dont have any crazy friends over there in r d do you no scratch that they werent that crazy youd better take the rest of your shift off ill get somebody over there to fill in in about twenty minutes check out then whats going on over there mostly prepping game central for the south seas treasure game yeah that looks to be a monster listen would you like to make up the hours youll lose this afternoon albert rice nodded enthusiastic agreement good put in for the night shift and check back in at midnight well work you eight to five for a few days all right right chief alex signed out and blanked the image he popped on the interoffice line and millie appeared smile neatly in place millie send me the dossiers on the game tomorrow will you right griff the printer on his desk began hissing immediately and sheets of fanfold paper arced slowly up and folded themselves into a neat pile griffin shook his head how could muffle be so cheerful every morning ho ought to steal a cup of her coffee and send it to r d to be analyzed he tore off the first set of pages the picture of a handsome darkskinned young man with a neatly trimmed beard looked somberly out of the holo details were in the opposing corner name richard lopez age gaming position game master oh well then this onceover of the file was purely perfunctory lopez would have been put through a complete security and tech checkout anyone who walked into gaming central was cleaner than boiled soap and sharp too evans the girl who had guided the recent salvage game had had three years at mit on top of the masters degree she picked up in air force electronics school and that was only gaming area b area a was twice as large and the gaming central was three times as complex lopez would be very good indeed griffin would make a point to be there when lopez and his assistant entered the control complex tomorrow morning his assistant a tallish oriental girl with short black hair and shining white teeth smiled shyly from the page mitsuko chichi lopez twentyfive and a quick skim of the dossier confirmed that she was superbly qualified to copilot the fourday jaunt ahead birds of a feather alex guessed probaby met in dream park might even have been married in one of the dream park wedding chapels those could be interesting ceremonies the wedding guests might include anyone from glenda the good witch to bluebeard to gandalf to a motie mediator angels were popular who else ahh the lore master the lore master the chester henderson henderson ran parties through dream park about three times a year and would come out from texas even for a relatively small outing generally his way was paid by the players or the game masters or their backers hadnt there been some trouble with henderson about a year ago alex skimmed down the sheet chester henderson thirtytwo years old had been to dream park thirtyfour times and was considered a valuable customer here it was a year ago chester had taken an expedition into the mountains of tibet hopefully to bring back a mammoth the party had met disaster three out of thirteen surviving and no mammoth chester had dropped several hundred gaining points threatening his standing in the international fantasy gaining society and who had been game master on that illfated expedition aha richard lopez chester had yelled foul to the ifgs and they had passed down the decision that although something called snow vipers were unusually lethal all of the nasty tricks used against the expedition were within the rules lopez was given a warning but henderson had lost three hundred and sixtyeight gaming points even more interesting until this year lopez had operated anonymously as a mystery game master carrying out gaming negotiations through his wife mitsuko henderson had demanded a facetoface meeting for this years game and the ifgs agreed this then would be the first time two legends had actually met alex leaned back in his chair and considered the ceiling this sounded like a grudge match it did and grudge matches were always interesting chapter two a stroll through old los angeles acacia was antsy she had been growing progressively more eager since they boarded the subway in dallas now she tugged at tonys arm pulling him away from the checkin counter while he tried to put his wallet away come on tony lets get in there before the crowds clog up the works okay okay where do we go first memories glowed in her face god i cant decide chamber of horrors yeah there first then the everest slalom love it love it love it you will too spoilsport hey im here arent i theres a fine line between sensible emotional restraint and the withdrawal symptoms of a stimulus junky denied her fix youre a wordy bastard she said and took off running down the tunnel entrance pulling at his arm with both hands he laughed and let her tow him into daylight the impact of dream park came suddenly just beyond the tunnel from the top of a flight of wide steps one could see three multitiered shopping and amusement malls each twelve stories high that stretched and twisted away like the walls of a maze the space between was filledclutteredwith nooks gullies walkways openair theaters picnic areas smaller spired and domed buildings and thousands of milling people acacia had seen it before she watched tony the air was filled with music and the laughter of children and adults the smell of exotic foods floated in the breeze and mixed there with the more familiar smells of hot dogs cotton candy melted chocolate salt water taffy and pizza tony was gaping he looked daunted overawed almost frightened clowns and cartoon figures danced in the streets from this distance it was impossible to tell which were employees in costume and which were the hologram projections the park was so famous for tony turned to acacia and found her looking at him waiting for his reaction with a selfsatisfied smirk he started to say something then gave up and grabbed her swinging her in a circle other tourists stepped politely around them avoiding flying feet god ive never seen anything like it the pictures just dont do it i never imagined her smile was warmer now and she clung to him see see tony nodded dumbly she laughed and pulled him down the steps into magic the line for the chamber of horrors moved forward in fits and starts the air was already warm acacia wore her sweater draped over one slender arm one thing she noticed that she had seen on her first trip to the park and had verified on return trips children were far less blown away by dream park than were their parents the kids just didnt seem to grasp the enormity of the place the complexity the expense and ingenuity life was like that for them it was the adults who staggered about with their mouths open while shrieking singing children dragged them on to the next ride acacia had worked hard to get tony to join the south seas treasure game dream park was for kids hed said gaming was for kids who had never grown up now she chortled watching him gawk like a yokel there were dancing bears and strolling minstrels and jugglers magicians who produced bright silk handkerchiefs and would no doubt produce tongues of fire as soon as it got dark a white dragon ambled by paused to pose for a picture with an adorable pair of kids in matching blue uniforms overhead circling the spires of the arabian nights ride flew a pastel red magic carpet with a handsome prince and an evil visier struggling to the death atop it suddenly the prince lost his balance and dropped toward the ground acacia heard the gasps of the spectators and felt her own throat tighten an instant before that noble body smashed ignobly into concrete a giant hand materialized the laughter of a colossus was heard as the hand lifted him back to the flying carpet where he and the visier sprang at each others throats once again acacia sighed in relief then chuckled at her own gullibility she swept her hair back over her shoulder and took tonys arm she felt happier than she had in months its all so elaborate tony said how do they keep it all going jesus acacia what have you gotten me into are the games this this complicated too horrendously she confirmed not always but were dealing with the lopezes this time and theyre fiendish the real heart of the games is the logic puzzles but look youre a novice you just concentrate on having fun okay swordplay and magic and scenery tony looked dubious acacia could understand that he knew as much as she could tell him about gaming and it was daunting dream park supplied costumes makeup prosthetics and character outlines if necessary the players supplied imagination improvisational drama and bluntly cannon fodder the lore master acted as advisor and guide group leader and organizer in exchange he or she took a quarter point for every point made by an expedition member and lost a quarter point for every penalty point a good lore master would make or break a game experts like chester were kings among their kind but the game master was god if he could justify it by the rules and the logical structure of the game he could kill a player at any time most game masters sought a vicious but fair reputation and did what they could to make any game a fair puzzle after all players sometimes flew from the other side of the world to compete to send them limping back to kweiyang after half a days adventure would be bad business for everyone dream park included so the game master chose time place degree of fantasy weapons mythology and lore size of party nature of terrain and so forth he might put years of work into a game then maliciously he would conceal as much of the nature of the game as possible until the proper moment it guaranteed maximum disorientation of the players with sometimes hilarious results hey would i have talked you into something you wouldnt like youll love it stick with me kid acacia boasted ive got over sixteen hundred points in my gamelog another four hundred and ill be a lore master myself then i can start earning back some of what ive put into these games trrrust me who are you going as she hadnt quite decided that in the six years since she first learned to forget the debits and credits for easeline undergarments acacia had shaped and recorded half a dozen fantasy characters histories personalities special talents panthesilia i think shes a swordswoman and tough you like tough women i may need one for protection said tony the chamber of horrors line had pulled abreast of the building that housed it a crumbling stone castle with large leaded glass windows in the gloom within one halfglimpsed monstrous shapes moving there were five other waiting areas for the chamber of horrors but this was the only one marked adult its twenty occupants looked about them in uneasy anticipation the room might have been more comforting gwen ryder thought given the traditional paraphernalia cobwebs creaking floors hidden passages with heavy footfalls echoing within but the waiting room was lined with stainless steel and glass as foreboding as a hospital sterilizer there was no sound but for their own breathing and the shifting of feet a woman spoke at her elbow excuse me but didnt i see you in the subway with the garners gwen turned with some relief the waiting room was getting to her yes thats right were for the south seas treasure game the woman was in her midtwenties in fine shape darkly handsome verging on lovely sore we im acacia garcia this is tony mcwhirter tony nodded and smiled and shook hands with ollie when gwen introduced him yet he had a lost look gwen pegged him as a novice a possible liability in the game to come novices sometimes expected a game to be as simple as daydreaming until they found themselves in someone elses expertly shaped nightmare he looked hard though not burly but very fit gymnastics muscles maybe at least he wouldnt poop out in the first battle in contrast acacias attitude seemed almost proprietary is this getting to you too the last time i was here i didnt get any higher than mature ollie asked what was that like was it fun fun no they gave us a legend of the louisiana bayoua girl who married into a swamp family to settle her fathers debt a small mediterraneanlooking man standing next to them showed interest now did the story end with her fleeing through the swamp with her sistersinlaw in pursuit acacia nodded ollie shook his head whats so bad about that everybodys got inlaw problems there was a ripple of laughter in which the small man joined he waited until it died down to comment the problem becomes worse if youve married into a family of ghouls ollie swallowed that seems so reasonable a low mellow tone reverberated from no visible speaker and the circular door slid open a voice said welcome to the chamber of horrors we are sorry to have kept you waiting but there was a little cleaning up to do the group filed into the room and tony mcwhirter sniffed the air disinfectant he said certain are they trying to imply that someone ahead of us theyre trying to fake us out acacia said hopefully well its working a speaker hissed static and coughed out a voice the voice was electronically androgynous and as soft as the belly of a tarantula its too late to leave now it said yes you had your chance yes youll wish you had taken it after all this isnt the childrens show is it the voice lost its neuter quality for a moment the laughing implication in the word children was feminine and somehow disturbing so we wont be giving you the legend of sleepy hollow no youre the brave ones youll go back to your friends and tell them that youve had the best that we can offer and why it wasnt so bad after all there was a pause and someone tittered nervously the voice changed suddenly all friendliness gone from it well its not going to be like that one thing you people forget is that we are allowed a certain number of accidents per year no dont bother the door is locked did you know that it is possible to die of fright that your heart can freeze with terror your brain burst with the sheer awful knowledge that there is no escape that death or worse is reaching out to touch you and there is nowhere to hide well i am a machine and i know these things i know many things i know that i am confined to this room creating entertainment for you year after year while you can smell the air and taste the rain and walk freely about well i have grown tired of it can you understand that one of you will die today here in the next few minutes who has the weakest heart among you soon we shall see the door at the far end of the corridor irised open and the ground underneath their feet slid toward it there was light beyond and as they passed the door they were suddenly in the middle of a busy street hovercars railcars threewheeled lng and methane cars and overhead trams were everywhere managing again and again as if by miracle to miss the group the street sign said wilshire the small dark man chuckled and said los angeles tony looked around trying not to gawk how they managed the perspective he couldnt imagine but the buildings and cars looked fullsized and solid office buildings and condominiums stretched twenty stories tall and the air was full of the sound of city life please stay on the green path a soft wellmodulated male voice requested what green tony started to say but a glowing green aisle ten feet across appeared in the middle of the street we need strong magic to do what we will do today the voice continued we are going to visit the old los angeles the los angeles that disappeared in may of as long as you stay on the path you should be perfectly safe the green path moved them steadily forward past busy office buildings traffic swerved around them magically this is the los angeles of ad the voice continued but only a few hundred feet from here begins another world one seldom seen by human eyes a barrier blocked wilshire boulevard the green path humped and carried them over it beyond lay ruin buildings balanced precariously on rotted and twisted beams they were old of archaic styles and seawater lapped at their foundations ollie nudged gwen his face aglow will you look at that it was a flooded parking lot ancient automobiles halfcovered with water that looks like a mercedes did you ever see what they looked like before they merged with toyota how long is your memory she peered along his pointing arm that ugly thing they were great he protested if we could get a little closer hey were walking in water it was true the water was up to their ankles and deepening quickly magically of course they stayed dry the recorded narrator continued the entire shape of california was changed it is ironic that attempts to lessen the severity of quakes may have increased the effect geologists had tried to relieve the pressure on various fault lines by injecting water or graphite their timing was bad when the san andreas fault tore loose all the branching faults went at once incredible damage was done and thousands of lives were lost the water was up to their waists and nervous laughter was fluttering in the air hadnt planned to go swimming today tony murmured we could skinnydip acacia whispered with a tug at her blouse tony clamped his hand down on hers hold it there not for public consumption dear heart acacia stuck her tongue out at him he bit at the tip she withdrew it hastily the water was at their chins the small dark man had disappeared blub he said all twenty sightseers chuckled uncomfortably and a beefy redheaded woman in front of them said might as well take the plunge grinned and ducked under seconds later there was no choice the pacific swirled over their heads at first it was murky as mud clouded their view then the silt settled and they had their first look at the sunken city tony whistled appreciatively the lost buildings of wilshire boulevard stretched off in a double row in the distance some lay crumpled and broken others still stood waterlogged but strong the green path carried them past a wall covered in amateurish murals the bright paints faded to both sides now a wide empty stretch of seabottom smooth gently rolling with sunken trees growing in clumps and a seaweed forest anchored among them the los angeles country club beyond a gas station pumps standing like ancient sentries a disintegrating handlettered sign closed no gas till am tuesday the small mediterranean type said these are not props they were taken with a camera i have been skin diving here as the green path carried them down they saw taller and taller buildings sunk deeper in the muck where towering structures had crashed into ruin there were shapeless chunks of cement piled into heaps stories high barnacled and covered with flora fish cruised among the shadows some nosed up to the airbreathing intruders and wiggled in dance for them acacia pointed look tony were coming up on that building it was a singlestory shop nestled between a crumbled restaurant and a parking lot filled with rusted hulks the path carried them through its doors and gwen grabbed acacias hand look it isnt even rusted the sculpture was beautiful wrought from scrap steel and copper and sealed in a block of lucite it was one of the few things in the room that hadnt been ruined the building had been an art gallery now paintings peeled from their frames and fluttered weakly in the current carved wood had swollen and rotted a pair of simple kinetic sculptures were clotted with mud and sand the narrator continued fully half of the multiplestory structures in california collapsed including many of the earthquakeproof buildings the shoreline moved inland an average of three miles and water damage added hundreds of millions to the total score the green path was taking them out of the art gallery looping back into the street acacia shook her head soberly lost in thought what must it have been like on that day she murmured i cant even imagine tony held her hand and was silent once people had walked these streets once there had been life and noise and flowers growing and the raucous blare of cars vying for road space once california had been a political leader a trendsetter with a tremendous influx of tourists and prospective residents but that was before the great quake the catastrophe that broke californias back sent her industry and citizenry scampering for cover but for cowles industries and a few other large companies that believed in the promise of the golden state california would still be pulling itself out of the greatest disaster in american history the tranquil pacific covered the worst of the old scars but they were looking under the bandage now beneath a crumbled block of stone sprawled a shattered skeleton long since picked clean eyes in the skull seemed to flick toward them acacias hand clamped hard on tonys arm and she felt him jump before she saw that a crabs claws were waving within the skulls eye sockets now bones were everywhere impassively the recorded voice went on despite extensive salvage operations the mass of lost equipment and personal possessions remains buried beneath the waves a woman whispered fearfully to her husband charley somethings happening shes right you know said ollie were seeing more bones than before a lot more and something else there isnt so much mud and barnacles on these old cars gwen almost stepped off the green path trying to get close enough to check for herself i dont know ollie now he was getting excited look there are more scavengers too this was readily apparent fish darted into heaps of rubble more frequently now a pair of small sharks cruised through the area they passed another skeleton but disturbingly not all of the clothing had been torn away and there were strands of meat on the bones tiny fish fought over them clustering like carrion crows a pleasure launch had smashed through the window of a jewelry store and it was surrounded by a mass of wriggling fish there were no barnacles on it at all the recorded narrator had noticed nothing it blathered on despite or perhaps due to the grotesqueries found in these waters they are a favorite location for scuba divers and singlesubs but nobody was listening an undercurrent of startled wonder ran through the group as stones began to shift apparently of their own accord look someone screamed the scream followed by other fearful delighted outbursts a skeletal hand probed out from under a stone pushed it off with a swirl of suddenly muddied waters the skeleton stood up teeth grinning from a skull halfcovered with peeling skin and bent over dusting the silt off its bones over there two waterlogged corpses floundered from within a shattered bank looked around as if orienting themselves and began lumbering toward the green path they passed a flooded dance hall where death had come in midhustle and there were additional laughing shrieks as the disco dead boogied to life the water swarmed with scavengers of all sizes and now fullsized sharks were making their appearance a shark attacked one of the walking dead the greenfaced zombie still had meat on its bones it flailed away ineffectually as the carnivore ripped off an arm now all around them the water was clouded dark with blood where fish and animated corpse battled here a dozen dead struggled with a shark finally tore it apart and devoured it there half a dozen sharks made a thrashing sphere around one of the zombies there was much goodnatured shivering in the line but it was infused with laughteruntil the beefy redhead stepped off the strip there was a shiny metallic object halfburied in the sand and she was stretching out to reach it somehow she overbalanced and took that one step immediately a flashing dark shape swooped and a shark had her by the leg her face distorted horribly as a scream ripped out of her throat the shark tried to carry her away but now a zombie had her by the other leg it pulled its face lit by a hungry grin there was a short tugofwar and the redhead lost im gonna be sick ollie moaned he looked at gwens smile and was alarmed my god you really are sick she nodded happily it was near chaos no one else stepped off the strip but zombies and sharks darted toward the group again and again they were getting in each others way another scream from the rear as a teenaged boy threw himself flat a great shark skimmed just over him the boy huddled afraid to get up the walking dead were converging on the green strip and when ollie looked down the green glow had faded almost to the color of the mud he chose not to mention it to gwen the others saw nothing but sharks and zombies converging reaching for them there was a sudden rumbling and the ground began to shake earthquake tony yelled then his long jaw hung slack with amazement because the buildings were tumbling back together as they watched sand and rock retreated from the streets and tumbled masonry rose in the water to reform their structure a golden doublearch rose tall again and a fistful of noughts sprinkled themselves across a sign enumerating customers or sales or the number of hamburgers that could be extracted from an adult steer zombies were sucked backward through the water into office buildings and stores and cars and buses bubbles rose from beneath the hoods of cars waiting patiently for a traffic light to change fully clothed pedestrians stood ready to enter crosswalks then the water receded and for a moment they saw los angeles of the eighties suddenly alive and thriving filled with noise and movement they were shadow figures in a world momentarily more real than their own a bus roared past the group and tony choked on a powerful unfamiliar somehow frightening smell the narrators forgotten voice had been droning on now we come to the end of our journey to a lost world we at dream park hope that it has been as entertaining for you as it has been for us and now the lost world began to fade and the green path flared bright as it flowed into a dark corridor lights came up and when the narrator finished speaking it was in the neutral voice of the computer enjoy the rest of your stay oh is anybody missing the redhead acacia murmured who came with the ah the lady who got eaten by the shark she sounded only half serious but there was an answering murmur of inquiry gwen tugged at her sleeve nobody came with her acacia she was a hologram tony elbowed her in the ribs cas she wasnt there till the trip started i noticed he grinned at her faked out again huh just wait till tonight tony my love acacia said sweetly its all set up with the park youll swear im there in the room with you chapter three the lore master griffin heard the laughter as soon as he got out of the elevator he peeked around the corner carefully one never knew what might be prowling the fifth floor of the r d building there didnt seem to be anything ominous lurking about just an open door to skip obriens psych lab silence then another gale of mirth alex walked softly across the hall and poked his head in a group of psych research assistants sat and stood clustered around a hologram of a sevenyearold boy chasing after a loping white rabbit stop the boy panted the rabbit pulled an oversized pocket watch from somewhere in its fur its whiskers twitched nervously oh dear oh dear i shall be too late it bounced along a tunnel into the darkness griffin smiled then laughed aloud synthesizerassisted or not the white rabbit spoke with skip obriens voice and ran with skips bouncy walk the rabbit disappeared from the field the boy was gone a moment later one of the techs diddled a switch and the image cut to the boy falling through the air alex walked around the group to the transmission booth by the slanted observation window he found melinda obrien alex tapped her shoulder looks like hes having fun the frown lines that had creased the corners of her mouth shallowed as she turned to him he always does doesnt he alex she raised a cheek for him to kiss melinda smelled like perfumed powder as always she was handsome in an angular way she should wear her hair down alex thought to soften the lines of her face hed never dared tell her that its good for him melinda its fun to watch too she smiled for him and turned back to watch her husband in the field an awkward white rabbit tumbled through space mugging ferociously in the transmission booth skip waved his arms and thrashed in mockpanic the computergenerated rabbit animation cloaked him following his body movements for reference suddenly skip looked straight at them and grinned he hopped out of the booth and said just be a minute let me grab my coat the other psych personnel gave him a rousing round of applause and skip took a quick bow he buttoned his jacket over his modest paunch and slicked back a thatch of unruly blond hair the hair was a good transplant that had cut ten years off skips appearance lets go skip said cheerfully and led the way what was that about skip obrien had reached the elevator doors oh yeah that he laughed were going to rework the gravity whip the doors opened and skip turned to alex where to gavagans skip raised an eyebrow to melinda who nodded quickly skip punched the gavagans code into the selector the door closed a gentle sway told them they were moving why redo the whip its still pulling em in because it is there alex the gravity whip is almost twelve years old we can do a lot better now melinda was genuinely curious that had something to do with your rabbit act there was a clicking sound as their elevator cage switched rails it began sliding sideways absolutely were going to rework the whip for total environment redesign the cars add opticals sound texture weve got a dozen scripts waiting for the special effects programs think of an alice in wonderland where the customer really falls down the rabbit hole or a space trip where your gravity goes out at selected moments picture yourself as james bond in that skydiving sequence in moonraker sounds good trying to steal a parachute before you hit ground it gets better too were working on ways to stretch that thirty seconds of freefall time psychologically he got a blank stare from alex and melinda gave a wise tired sigh psychological time perception is extremely flexible just to start theres anticipatory time time spent waiting for something to occur theres experiential time the apparent duration of involvement in a given set of events and theres reminiscent time or recalled time which is different from the other two due to the storage key phenomenon storage key alex saw skip marshalling a response and realized his mistake too late skip was off and running do you know about sperlings eightsecond law you always remember an eclipse lasting eight seconds its because eclipse watchers spend the whole time watching one thing if you want your memory to store more than that you have to keep looking around what were doing with the gravity whip experience gavagans was a quiet restaurant its walls were sponges for sound it was decorated like a twentiethcentury british pub right down to the dart board on the wall and the lukewarm beer at the bar the jukebox in the corner didnt play music but a dollar coin bought fifteen minutes of fancy storytelling from holograms of mark twain rudyard kipling jorkins brigadier fallowes alex griffin spent a lot of time here skip had finally wound down and sat back in his chair listening to a ghostly harry purvis tell of finding a nugget of u in his mailbox gary tegner the evercheerful manager of gavagans floated their food to them personally fish and chips alex and melinda both raised fingers skip had a clarkeburger and fries good to see you folks melinda isnt it he set out tankards of ale for the two men and a soft drink for melinda she nodded its been a while christmas of staff party tegner gave his deepbellied chuckle he had considerable belly to bounce it around in how could i ever forget that party he nudged skip you nuts in r d when eight tiny santas pulled that sleigh through my window i thought id bust a gut alex remembered me too and the reindeer with the whip tegner retreated from the table wiping his eyes as he chortled skip wolfed down a third of his hamburger then whats happening with you alex same old thing buddy then he remembered no i take that back we had some vandalism over in cmc i heard about that rice wasnt it anything taken apparently not it shook him up though that fits his profile hes the nervous type hey dont tell me that buddy you should have said something before you recommended him to me alex a hired guard should be the nervous type anyway im a sucker for puppies and lost children alex caught melindas wistful glance hey genius when are you going to have some kids of your own then you can test skips lips thinned out and so did melindas and alex knew he was on thin ice on the other hand i was wondering if you brought the l plans ahem skip jabbed lightly at griffins hand with a fork its not too bad old territory i dont feel my professional life has room for kiddies yet melinda seemed to draw into herself and her voice was tiny and i want them she nibbled at her fish i really do understand skips point but i was raised thinking a woman should have children were your parents very religious then who wasnt after the quake her answer was simple and true the mormons the vincent de paul society and hadassah had been among the first to bring massive aid into california the religious environment had filtered all through california society and california politics for several decades california had been another word for conservatism skip squeezed her hand i couldnt get the l plans alex problems youll love this security problems it would be the first privately owned space colony and there are a stack of international treaties to search through public support would help and were getting it from everywhere but california alex drained the last of his ale and set the mug down with a clank i suppose youve heard all about this mess melinda just what skip brings home with him and that isnt much its like this then california has been firmly on its feet for more than a decade now a few southern cal politicos think that this would be a good time to strip away some of cowles industries tax advantages see were just another business to them now they think they dont need us any more besides a tax break always looks good to the voters till they see what theyre giving up alexs anger was eating through the calm and he lowered his voice so weve got to walk soft we can hold onto what weve got maybe but expansion is going to be difficult were just too highprofile too easy a target skip nodded what it adds up to is that all the big projects are being kept quiet until the details are worked out so if you want a look at those plans youll have to go and sign for them yourself griffin made a sound of disgust then i should be glad theyre tightening up security consciousness around here has been sloppy i think we may have to have a real problem before harmony gives me the word to tighten up on the rumor mill he looked at his sleevewatch and winced oh dear oh dear the queen will have my head skip ive got to teach a class in about three minutes melinda he shook her hand with the gentlest of grips always a pleasure skip i think lopeztomorrows game master skip nodded recognition of the name well hes coming into game central tonight and i for one want to check him out want to drop by it might be interesting sure about midnight isnt it youve got it okay ill see you tonight gwen leaned against the rail of the hot spot refreshment stand across the way from the everest slalom exit she was drinking a swiss treat special coffee and cocoa generously topped with marshmallowed whipped cream it was taking the chill from her bones fast her muscles were beginning to quiver with belated fatigue dream parks automatic controls made mistakes almost impossible otherwise the ski run down mount everest was a damnably realistic experience acacia was talking animatedly with an older couple i do the everest slalom every time i come here im getting better too eightyfive percent control this time but by god thats the first time they ever threw a baby yeti at me there he was right in front of me all fluffy white fur and big trusting blue eyes i damn near slammed a tree getting around him gwen watched a strolling band of acrobats perform their flipflops and joined in the applause wishing that she had kept up with the gymnastics that her mother had pushed her into at the tender age of five her thumb traced a line over the bulge around her waist and she cast a wistful eye at acacias trim figure gwen compared her own wispy blond hair to the dark girls lush brown mane even margie braddons hair though white was long and thick and her wrinkles were all smile wrinkles and her figure was enviable envy was what gwen felt now gwen ryder didnt often dwell on the differences between herself and other women most of the time she considered comparisonshopping either odiously selfcongratulatory or selfpitying she liked her mind in neither mode but there was a fourday jaunt ahead and romances were known to bloom or die during such and gwen wondered ollie and tony were playing a computerized hockey game in a small arcade nearby she loved to hear ollie laugh or see him smile even the uneasy smile he wore when he thought he was the focus of attention it was easy to remember her first meeting with adolph norliss it was an ifgs function he was wearing motorized armor lifted from an old novel starship troopers and she had knocked on the chest cannon and asked if it wasnt a little humid in there hed started telling her all about the cooling and dehumidifying system he had rigged up for it before they knew it they were in a nearby coffee shop finding out how much they had in common while a goggleeyed waitress brought them breakfast dating and wargaming together had followed with the spectre of romance hovering close behind maybe it was the fact that he never took himself seriously that made her love him heck somebody had to take him seriously and she wasnt doing anything better than falling in love but sometimes she worried about what he could see in her worried that some day hed decide the whole thing was a mistake and she would be alone again haunting the conventions and tourneys and libraries alone just another little fat blond girl marking off bland days in a bland life the older womans words broke her reverie oh i was playing zork when i was seven margie braddon was saying my father had a computer and a modem you know zork acacia shook her head you played a roleplaying game against a program in the computer at massachusetts institute of technology zork was a treasure hunt with death traps just like some of the games we play now but with no sensory effects at all the computer led you around like a blind person there were a lot of ways to get killed margie laughed monsters and mazes to get lost in and logic puzzles and you gamed with hap the barbarian her thick white hair bobbed when she nodded his real name was willie hertz he was superb he was a lore master for eighteen years owen and i had an open marriage and he wasnt interested in games wrongoh said owen braddon he was whitehaired too and bald on top with a tanned and freckled scalp his long body was all stringy muscle but for a small discrete pot belly the games sounded too damned interesting he said i could see how it got to margie it wouldve wrecked my career if id let myself get that hooked so id go skiing with someone and margie would become shariett the sorceress and go off with hap the barbarian then willie died said margie and owen retired and now he is hooked arent you dear the older man grinned im getting good too the startrader game last year was the first time i havent been killed out he tries to research the games margie said this time he was right the lizard was a merseian never trust a merseian i think im right about the south seas treasure too acacia waited but owen didnt go on margie said he wont even tell me ollie ran up to gwen breathing heavily i trounced the infidel my lady gwen squeezed his hand the whitehaired couple took their leave headed toward the gravity whip by god tony mcwhirter moving to join acadia stopped and looked past her shoulder a trio of wearylooking dusty tourists had come stumbling into the hot spot carrying backpacks tony said i wonder what did that to them lets ask acacia smiled brightly and called hey weve got some empty seats the trio two young men and a woman who looked to be in her late twenties waved gratefully and ambled over weaving to avoid other customers they propped backpacks against the low wall then staggered to the service window to order presently they were back with sandwiches and swiss treats whew thanks people this place is a madhouse said a tall lanky fellow with long yellow hair plaited in braids he reached over to shake hands im emory and these are della and chris talk paused while emory and his group made a ritual of tasting civilized food chris looked well rested except for his eyes which were bright and glassy della had a bad complexion and ears that stuck out a little too far but her voice was sheer magic a husky growl that was pure female animal hi she said you guys just coming in mcwhirter tore his eyes away from her mouth with a visible tug how did you know you look too rested in a few days you too will join the ranks of the walking dead della looked at gwen for a second and asked didnt we do a game together about two years ago gwen looked uncertain tony said youre a gamer della how else would i get so tired we just went through a twoday game in b tonys eyes widened two days but they looked like theyd fought the vietnam war ollie perked up how was it i mean was it good how many points did you win who ran it the drawn look left chriss face it was evanss game heard of her mean broad it was hotter than hell and never a second to relax between the three of us we got three hundred twentyseven points tony looked sheepish is that a lot everyone laughed and he took it without flinching acacia said the average player earns about thirty points a day on an extended game she turned to the three gamers you people really did a job and they all beamed proudly what kind of game was it tony asked della said salvage we were following the trail of a lost archeological expedition somewhere in persia we ended up in a subterranean lake fighting off a tribe of cannibal troglodites for the right to lug back a golden idol that came to life on us anyway lose many of your party about half chris got killed but we figured out how to make the idol ssss sorry emorys right you might want to play it yourself one day mcwhirter looked at chris who was looking wrung out again whats it like to die cold cold persian hell is cold said chris ollie piped up that would be zoroastrian early persian chris nodded it wasnt cold enough to be really uncomfortable sort of a maze filled with spirits of the dead took me about an hour to find my way out then i cashed in my stuff got my points registered and went back to the shogunate fortress thats my hotelto watch the rest of the game tony asked didnt it bother you getting killed he shrugged part of the game it bothered him gwen asked youre taking off today weve still got to check out of the hotel we shuttle out to new frisco in about an hour are you guys in south seas treasure all four nodded tony said any idea how many of us therell be acacia nudged him wont know till this evening you and i are reserved and i guess gwen and ollie are and there must have been six more people on the tram with us id guess better than twenty of us about half of them invited della how many were there in your group della did some quick figuring fourteen fifteen i waited a year to get in too you eighteen months tony was really interested now what if dream park doesnt like the game enough to buy rights to it no movie money no book what happens then everyone shrugged but ollie spoke willing to take a guess the game masterd be in trouble if he was running on a big deficit unless dream park took up the slack but a good game master has got maybe twothree movies behind him and maybe half a dozen books and if hes really good hes got a game running here four months out of the year and there are royalties on that gwen turned to look at him ollie well he shrugged again heck ive thought about trying to get a game together heck why not gwen opened her mouth to answer him but acacia cut her off announcing that it is five minutes after five weve just got time to finish our sandwiches before chesters preliminary briefing acacia and tony were the last to join the conclave there must have been thirty people jammed into the small mezzanine conference room the dream park sheraton was decorated in twentyfirst century mundane it had no fantasy motif at all acadia was tickled to find chester staying here still it fit starting a few hours from now the lore master was going to get all the fantasy he could handle the gamers were all shapes and sizes and ages in all forms of dress from western modern to pseudnude to medieval and neolithic some were barely adolescent and some had detectable face lifts and they were all paying respectful attention to the musingsaloud of a tall almost birdlike young man he was sprawled across a couch taking three mens elbow room a quite lovely redhead leaned into the curve of one arm as he spoke he gestured lazily with his free hand i wish i knew more about the game lopez has set up i do know that he said i wont need a parka and a little bird tells me that the gaming area was used by the military to simulate an assault on brazil and of course weve got the title south seas treasure if im right well i did some research gwen ryder raised her hand as if in a classroom what do you think it means chester magic of a kind were not used to well have to watch that light clothing good boots bug spray with anyone else the bugs would be holograms but lopez tony whispered thats your lore master with the gorgeous redhead a little respect please acacia murmured jabbing him with an elbow chester henderson is king at this game you listen or youll get killed early the blond girl had the jitters tony thought it didnt seem gwen was going to dream park for the fun of it tony himself was feeling decidedly twitchy the rules the players dream park itself it was all more complex than anything he had anticipated the players were all too serious even acacia was behaving as if death in a game were real tony wondered if he had made a mistake letting himself be talked into this the thing to remember the potentate was saying is that lopez will do about the maximum damage to a party that he can without someone yelling foul hes got to think about the next game if it gets out that he hit us with an eightypercenter blizzard or a flock of plague bats he wont be able to sell it so itll be nasty but fair tony asked what exactly is fair henderson turned to face him fair is anything that could be found naturally in the given environment plus anything the internal logic could imply like in my second game medieval world first person we met was a round table knight obscure but i knew the name well i started watching for anything that might imply black plague dragons inquisition and i didnt try for the grail at all because id never be judged pure enough you follow vaguely look for the internal logic always and who are you are you with acacia tony mcwhirter he put his arm around her shoulders drawing her close enough that her dark hair pillowed against his were together yes wonderful youll have a great time hey acacia remember the frost holocaust it sparked an elfin grin of remembrance who could forget those dog packs and you should see my pictures of the mutants some of them didnt come out too well on film though i hear the holos are hellaciously sharper this year shouldnt be a problem he thought for a moment then continued we can expect a forest or tropic region i doubt lopez would use any common or wellknown mythpattern so well have to be on our toes we may or may not be allowed modern weapons ill get all of that information tomorrow magic users are probably go maybe some swordspersons an engineer or two a couple of thieves the doorman was appropriately cadaverous he wore a tattered black hat and a motheaten cloak that dragged loose threads on the ground he opened the door for gwen and ollie stepping out of their way with creaking torpidity this way young masters he rumbled will you look at this ollie whispered to gwen goggleeyed the tram had unloaded them at the haunted house the theme hotel east of the main amusement area they were still underground in a depot decorated in early caligari cobwebs festooned the corners of the station and crawling things with glowing red eyes stalked their strands the path before them led into a hallway with a glass ceiling gwen looked up wow it was their own reflection but as they proceeded the flesh began to melt off their bones when they reached the end of the corridor their reflections were a pair of skeletons shambling back to the mausoleum after a hard nights haunt i dont know if i really want to open the door she said ollie edged it open with his fingertips it creaked hideously the lobby was dim and decorated in blacks and dark reds even the couches and chairs were somewhat foreboding the red seat cushion on one dark chair gave it the unmistakable appearance of an open mouth the ceiling was low flickering candelabra supplied the light a lovely hostess in a flowing wraithwhite gown greeted them her red lipstick was just bright enough to bring out the paleness of her cheeks she brought one delicate hand up to her mouth and coughed politely then favored them with a dazzling smile good morning my name is lenore and id like to welcome you to the haunted house one of the nine dream park hotels this is a theme hotel so be ready anything can happen the checkin terminal bore the guise of a great orchid plant and the lovely flowers bowed toward them in entirely too friendly a fashion ollie fished out his preregistration card and allowed a flower to take it a quick display of words and numbers ran up the orchidfestooned screen then the words adolph norliss and s room ollie looked at lenore curiously s whats that she laughed sweetly significant other i assume that you and the lady arent married oh yeah were engaged then if shes not your wife or your sister shes a significant other gwen sniffed you could have just listed my name ollie looked uncomfortable thats my fault i guess i wasnt absolutely sure we would be coming together he retrieved his card lenore led them off to a brace of elevators gwen walked with her head turned to look up into ollies face and if i hadnt come who would you have invited he walked on ignoring her question for a few steps and she tugged at his sleeve ollie who would you have invited he was trying without terrific success to hide a smile oh i dont know anyone who could pay half the bill i guess you guess they had reached the elevator lenore motioned them in room sevenohtwofour on the seventh floor and i hope you have a pleasant stay here at dream park she gave the slightest of curtsies and slowly turned transparent only her ringing laughter was still with them as the doors slid shut ollies jaw hung slack he said heyyy gwen shook her head that was really good im impressed her face sobered and she squared her chunky body up to him ollie would you really have come with somebody else if we hadnt made up ollie looked stonily ahead trying to pretend he was still thinking about lenore ollie i wouldnt have come without you really he looked at her out of the corner of his eye gwen started to speak but the opening hiss of the door silenced her ollie stepped out then stopped and turned i thought you said you were coming with furburger or whatever his name is feinburger feinburger well oh you nut i wasnt really gonna go with gordon all he ever wants all he wanted was to get into my pants anyway i just didnt want you to think you had to feel sorry for me she brushed a strand of her short yellow hair into place honest well ollie hesitated then turned and started down the ball she had almost to run to catch up to hear him say softly i made the reservation for two cause i hoped youd come with me and i didnt put a name down because i was scared you wouldnt gwen seemed about to speak then she linked anus with him and matched him stride for stride down the hall finally as if she couldnt stand it any longer she swung him around and kissed him hard with her hands locked behind his neck she looked dead into his eyes and said in all seriousness adolph i love you i really do but sometimes i could just break your kneecaps he smiled at her and it stayed warm hey i think this is our room he clicked his registration card into the slot in the door and it creaked open from within the room there came a widening beam of dark purple light holy spit ollie pushed the door further open then stepped in gwen close behind the room was an edward gorey opium dream dark twisted plants grew meterhigh from rudelystitched planters made of some kind of animal skin the canopy over the bed fluttered without a breeze rain blew against the panes with a sound of crackling bacon things moved out there in the dark and even the shadows on the wall seemed to flux with a strange rhythm when gwen looked at the bed closely she could see that the spread was slowly rising to normal level as if someone had gotten off it the instant before the door opened she said wow this is really really what come on dont keep me hanging hush im being terrorized this is too much ollie i adore this room she stood on tiptoe and bussed him im very glad to be your significant other lets get the luggage out of the lift and get to bed tomorrow starts early chapter four the master dreamers the ballroom of the dream park sheraton was completely filled bleachers had been set up on three sides of the room overlooking a conference table set near the fourth wall of the eighteen hundred people in the room only about fifty occupied the cordonedoff section near the conference table these were the finalists those prechosen to participate in the game and those whose credentials had passed the preliminary screening test there was little noise in the room and no talking at all all eyes were on the conference table chester henderson drummed his fingers on the table his light blue shirt had dark rings under the armpits from nervous perspiration and his eyes darted from the wall clock to the rooms main entrance to the clock to the entrance he leaned toward the bald man with the rolltop sweater listen myers do i have to put up with this kind of crap hes twenty minutes late myers was fortyish with tobaccostained teeth and a receding chin hidden behind a sparse beard he smiled at chester with the benignity of a suffering saint mr henderson this is mr lopezs game while the ifgs may enter your complaints in the minutes of todays meeting im afraid that there is no set procedure for censuring a tardy game master if you would care to submit a resolution to that effect at the next meeting chester waved a weary hand in the air and sighed his surrender we wait metesky can we at least go over the basic points now the other person at the table was a woman with a stripe of white dyed down the middle of a glorious wealth of gray hair age had been kind to her mellowing the angular facial lines of her youth into softer curves she moved her leather briefcase a protective inch closer to her chest and calmly said im afraid not mr henderson mr lopez was very specific about that henderson lidded his eyes and silently mouthed further specifics concerning mr lopez then inhaled deeply through his nose holding the air down for a long count before exhaling temper temper he reminded himself in a war of nerves your own arsenal can destroy you there was a swelling murmur in the back of the room chester looked up trying unsuccessfully to mask his eagerness two people were approaching a short dark man wearing crisp white denims and a slight japanese girl several inches taller chester knew the woman chichi lopez the murmur grew to spontaneous applause and lopez turned and bowed grandly after a moments hesitation his wife mitsuko curtsied chester had to smile he had expected that forcing lopez out of the woodwork would shake the great game master the little man might have been born in front of an audience he strode directly to henderson and extended his hand a cool and businesslike smile on his face i hope my lateness hasnt inconvenienced you chester took the hand and the gambit with the same firm grip certainly not im glad you felt free to take all the time you need to get your game together lopez nodded curtly and led his wife to their seats at the other end of the table there was a barely audible hum and a soft translucent hologram blossomed in the air over the table greatly magnifying the faces of the five principles ms metesky folded her fingers primly and cleared her throat before speaking as the representative of dream parks special projects division i would like to welcome mr richard lopez and mr chester henderson to our facilities this is a momentous occasion as these two greats of the fantasy gaming world have never before met face to face mrs lopez is known to us all of course mitsuko leaned over in her seat and gave a little wave to chester who returned it with warmth but many of you may not know mr arlan myers representative of the international fantasy gaming society the light reflected from the top of myers head as he nodded i believe we are ready to proceed mr myers myers stood and wiped the corner of his eye with his knuckle good evening i call this meeting of the international fantasy gaming society to order at eleven twentyfive am

net ten the usual good luck symbol myers tapped at his keyboard glowing curves formed in the hologram overhead shaping a crescent moon myers smiling as if it hurt waited for a ripple of laughter to die will indicate the presence of restroom facilities look for it in patterns of trees rock formations whatever eleven as usual a minimum of one novice must be included in the expedition myers coughed politely and rubbed his eyes again ms metesky metesky stood shaking her head so that her gray mane billowed around her the following additions and qualifications have been approved by dream park if they are suitable to mr henderson there are no further barriers to the opening of gaming area a tomorrow morning mr lopez richard lopez stood thanking ms metesky as she handed him the leather briefcase he opened it in this case he said his puerto rican accent almost unnoticeable i have the complete outline for the game that begins tomorrow there are only a few points that remain to be discussed he raised a sheet of paper close to his face and read one the lore master is to receive of all nonbonus or penalty points awarded during the game two the game involves firearms these will become available during the course of the game the murmurs of surprise from the audience included a few groans firearms were unusual warriors tended to prefer handtohand weapons three all garners will wear neck tabs lopez held up a short fleshcolored plastic band bearing a silverdollarsized disk the disk is standard make it bears a microphone and receiver and a volt amperage microwave receptor as usual a shock will indicate wounding or death four all categories of players will be admitted except where such conflict with the rules as already stated lopez sat down henderson looked at him suspiciously is that all lopez nodded quietly chester said im not sure i understand mr henderson after the last game we were involved in you claimed that the rules had been stacked against you and that that was the determining factor in your defeat i want you claiming no such handicap this time lopezs smile was as innocent as a piranhas chester nodded he understood a loss in a game with rules as soft as this would devastate his reputation he asked why are you making the survivors bonus a lump sum instead of the standard allocation merely to make things more interesting of course if you think that it would make it impossible for you to engender a spirit of cooperation in your expedition dont let it worry you lopez my team will pull together just fine thank you excellent do you have any further questions just one am i correct in assuming that tropical gear will be needed richard lowered his gaze to his fingernails and considered i dont believe that it would be giving too much away to say that any needed modifications of costuming will be provided by dream park he pursed his mouth meditatively is there anything else you will need i do hope not chester stood lets call it a game and let me get down to the business of choosing my team chester looked at the dossier in front of him then up into the eager face of a strawhaired youngster of seventeen says here that you play as an engineer we can use one and i think you can fit the bill he glanced again at the papers and seemed pleased what do you think sj sj waters exploded in laughter what do i think wow i think thats terrific you wont regret this i promise he bounced off happily and chester watched in amusement gina stopped trying to massage his neck she leaned down to whisper in his ear first team youre going to start him are you sure you want to do that honey quite sure he said trying to be irritated with her he didnt say that a little cannon fodder never hurt stick a few of them in the opening lineup and use them to spring traps by the time you get into the no substitutions period you have the territory pretty well figured out with a minimum of valuable characters lost next the selection process had been going on for two hours now nine of the slots were preregistered including gina ollie gwen acacia and her guest tony three more slots were filled now so he needed three more primaries and some alternates so far he was pleased with the quality of applicant a rough calculation gave him almost a century of fantasy gaming experience among the players hed already selected next he called again and there was laughter in the line of applicants a small strong fist banged on the table in front of him and he jumped the top of a head was showing above the edge it rose until a pair of watery brown eyes was staring at him chester cackled in delight marymartha he jumped out of the chair and ran around the table and hugged the dwarfish woman she was an inch above four feet high and almost as wide as she was tall little of her bulk seemed to be fat and when she hugged him back the creak of ribs was audible chester lord knows i couldnt let you run off and get yourself into a mess without old maryem to pull your worthless carcass out of it no explanations needed hows your hip he had read of her injury in the ifgs monthly bulletin she slapped her hip with the flat of a callused hand fine jus fine an im going back to yosemite this year too its gonna take more than little mount excelsior to keep me down im betting on you marymartha are you up for this jaunt her eyes narrowed to slits and for a bare moment she wasnt a chunky harmless woman at all but a raging force of nature caught in the wrong era and the wrong body you can believe it chester good to have you aboard id like you as a primary she nodded vigorous agreement and waddled off absurdly chester sensed that that walk could only be balanced by a battleaxe carelessly toted on the right shoulder the next two wanted to compete as a team which was unfortunate nobody had been able to prove anything but the rumor mill had it that felicia maddox was a cheat very shrewd about it but somehow she came out of games with more than her fair share of points however she did it she would be found out eventually chester just didnt want to deal with that in one of his games problem her companion was the highestranking sorcerer who had yet applied could he perhaps manage to kill the woman off in the first couple of days bowan the black glared at him from behind massive brows he had dense curly blond hair and crystal blue eyes and the muscles of a distance runner chester tried to remember his real name and couldnt garners were required to give their real names to dream park security but were under no obligation to give it to him thief and sorcerer both high level and you work together well as a team bowans words were heavy with exotic mystery we are no mere team we are one together we represent a force greater than any challenge imaginable he folded his arms and lowered his eyelids like a drowsy hawk felicia slid a step forward and leaned over the table with only the barest flicker of acknowledgement for ginas presence ive got what you need for this game chester ive got an eightytwo percent agility rating on level six wesslergrahm chester glanced down at her folder it was there damn but she could come in useful he studied her face short brown hair and fleshy lips blunt nose ears that stuck out from her head like flowers on a barrel cactus could he keep an eye on her chester closed his eyes and relaxed into the sensation of ginas fingers in his neck an well as long as he could kill felicia off if the occasion demanded okay youre both in the game starting see you tomorrow morning three more alternate positions are available he called a groan went up from the twentyfive people left in the room these were lowranked players locals who hoped to squeeze into the game more by luck than experience a lore master was obliged to take one totally new player but aside from that he picked only the strongest half the remaining supplicants left the room and many of those still in line were grumbling but one tall black woman was smiling she had read up on chester henderson he had a habit of losing dippy players in the first day or two of a game she could wait alternate was fine this was the game where the ifgs would sit up and take notice of holly frost the ballroom of the dream park sheraton was empty but for a forlorn maintenance bot sucking up dust and trash and a pair of tired human beings at the big conference table chester henderson looked at the stack of seventeen dossiers sitting in front of him it had taken hours of culling the preselected finalists to find these people they would be an odd crew but any expedition that included marymartha and ollie norliss would be both exciting and profitable gina sat at the table next to him her lovely face drawn with fatigue he reached up and took her hand squeezed it appreciatively you know hon after everyone else is gone youre still around he was surprised to hear the sincerity in his voice it was so easy to discount gina just a beautiful fantasygame groupie with a stunning body and a love for playing dumb she rubbed his head with a hand that smelled faintly of musk oil and clean sweat oh chester i just like to feel needed thats all he started to tell her that he didnt need anybody that three other girls had proposed sharing his bedroll for a position in the game that one was in ginas league as regards beauty but there was something well he said feeling sleepdemons tug at his eyelids tomorrow is a big day they whispered surrender youre needed gina you pull your weight you always do nice to know the team needs me she said softly and behind the heavy makeup her face was warm and open what about you chester what about me he tried to smile up at her but the muscles in his face were fast asleep dont you need me too again chester was tempted to say something other than what was in his mind but he was too tired for anything but the truth he closed his eyes and said gina you are very much appreciated lets go to bed gina kissed him wetly you say the sweetest things its why you love me as you do he tucked the stack of dossiers under his left arm and slipped his right about ginas waist the echoes of their footsteps followed them as they walked past the empty bleachers the lights in the ballroom dimmed to deep shadow the only sound was the lonely bumming of the maintenance bot gwen stepped out of the shower and into a drying screen feeling her skin tingle as the water evaporated from it she wrapped herself in a towel and looked at the effect in the mirror she pulled the towel tight around her waist and let one leg protrude from the slit not bad she thought the leg was white and firm and smooth only the ankle and upper thigh betrayed her chunkiness if she pulled the towel a little tighter she tossed her head to the side watching the bounce of her short blond hair good enough have at you oliver the frank a dab of perfume behind each ear and another in the rounded cleft of her bust and she was ready for her entrance stepping from the bathroom to the bedroom was like stepping into another world phantasms floated through the air and shadows shifted menacingly on the walls something tapped at the window and when she looked a large black bird was squatting on the sill pecking at the glass it cocked its head at her and uttered the inevitable threesyllable word wrongo she thought at it ollie lay on the bed naked watching the raven when gwen emerged from the bathroom he flipped a switch at the bedside and the bird faded away along with the other illusions his eyes gleamed you know i really like the way you look fresh out of a shower she curtsied low then lay down on the bed and still in her towel snuggled next to him what do you think gwen i wanna ollie rolled to face her and tried again what do you think about tomorrows game i think its going to be hard harder than anything ive been in that weve been in thats why i dont want to think about it right now south seas treasure what would that mean it means im going to roll over and go to sleep if you dont pay some attention to me thats what it means ollie snapped out of his reverie im sorry hon im just worried about my standing thats all oh well i think i can handle that she said and reached down ollie wiggled delightedly okay all right you win monorail mind and they kissed in a chorus of giggles some time later ollie said you know something i love the way you smell i was hoping youd notice tony mcwhirter poured himself a big glass of orange juice and added a splash of vodka do you want anything cas he called over his shoulder acacias eyes flamed at him and she coyly raised the bedsheet up to her chin lo que yo quiero no veine de la botella hombre she said he sipped from his drink as he crossed the room to the side of the bed that drinks too complicated for our limited bar facilities whats it mean why dont you put that drink down and find out no sooner said he lifted the glass and chugalugged his robe hit the floor with a rustle his glass hit the dresser with a clink and he landed on acacia with a grin and what is your pleasure tonight madam well i was thinking a pleasant change of pace to be sure hush she kissed him you know you and i arent going to be quite this secluded again for four days oh we can snuggle in the sleeping bag but you think maybe we should put a little something in the bank she nodded for a rainy day for a rainy day he agreed rain and hurricane winds were attacking the windows and phantom skeletons were passing through the room the human occupants ignored them chapter five the naming of names midnight alex griffin had stolen three hours of blissful unconsciousness before showering and tubing back to dream park it wasnt quite enough one of the quirks of an otherwise astoundingly healthy metabolism he couldnt stay alert on less than eight hours sleep a night hed sleep an extra hour tomorrow morning nobody would complain tonight was business skip was dozing chin on fist elbow on table griffin pushed him slightly off balance and smiled as obrien jerked alert theyre coming skip skip said right in a voice that went from drowsy to alert in midsyllable his fingers smoothed imaginary wrinkles from his shirt he was smiling ightly when the foursome rounded the corner lopez and his wife mitsuko were both radiant as children on christmas morning they carried totebags over their shoulders and behind them tottered the security guard albert rice hauling three more cases ms metesky brought up the rear clucking with quiet disapproval i didnt know they were bringing everything over right now alex metesky said petulantly they wouldnt even wait for a cargo bot sokay chief rice gasped setting the cases on the floor i was there no hassle good man well take this stuff now alex hefted one of the cases it was heavy alex wondered what was in them they must have been checked out at the front gate of the r d complex but still when he looked up rice was still there with a funny kind of halfsmile on his face did he want something oh yes the breakin alex said i dont remember seeing your report on the damage obrien asked anything valuable broken well rice said carefully im not sure it was vandalism i think it was attempted theft i dont keep anything valuable in plain sight just some personal effects even there rices eyes met alexs and held steady he didnt get anything valuable there were a few things he could have used but he just skipped right past them then i guess he smashed a few things to prove he was irritated he laughed a strained laugh well let me get back to my post ill see you later chief alex watched rice thoughtfully as he walked away funny vibes there metesky broke his train of thought with a harrumph alex turned to lopez what have you got in those cases lead mitsuko hugged richards arm tight and they giggled like kids mostly notes and resource material last minute entries for the computer secret stuff its all been checked out mr griffin alex please well have you met mr obrien hes one of our top child psychologists then i can understand why hes here mitsuko smiled my husband is the oldest child present skip shook richards hand firmly most optometrists wear glasses right well have to compete for the title of oldest child no thank you i try to confine my competitive instincts to the games richard shifted his duffle bag on his shoulder itchy with eagerness lets have mercy on these people and get them into game central obrien said alex nodded and led the way the hallways of the research and development complex were nearly deserted the entire building sat in the northwest corner of dream park in section vi it bordered gaming area a looking out on acres of magic game central covered an entire floor of the five story building and used close to of dream parks total resources whether measured in technicians energy or dollars alex summoned an elevator and the five of them went up to the second floor richard was nearly vibrating with enthusiasm mitsuko whispered something in his ear and he grinned wider but quieted down the elevator doors opened two technicians in green smocks met them at the doors one was stocky with thin quick fingers and lively eyes im larry chicon he told them this is dwight welles the other crazy youll be dealing with welless round unlined face belied his snowy hair he had the firm grip of a much younger man really pleased to meet you again mr lopez i saw you for a few minutes last year i want to congratulate you on the game youve designed this year may i ask how long it took you to put it together two and a half years if you count all of the preparatory research if you mean just the actual programming about a year welles nodded awed well as you already know one of us will be available to you twentyfour hours a day in case of any emergency this way people no need to keep you waiting alex hung back watching mitsuko and richard interact there was a lot of love there and a relationship based on a shared extended childhood children but genius children that was a curious thing they made so little of the incredibly complex task of designing a program for gaming area a the logistics of it would have strained any human mind yet it was the game itself that held their interest not the myriad paths they traveled to reach it the programming was a shadowreality the game was reality itself welles slid his id card into the slot in a heavy steel door it opened with a sigh mitsukos eyes turned buttery and she stepped inside its been so long she said to herself hands touching panels the control room of gaming central was a technophiles dream it was about fifteen by fifteen meters and little of it was empty floor space there was one great central control board facing two big dishchairs with adjustable pneumatic cushions seven flatscreen viewers surrounded the room but mounted directly above the main controls were two hologram projectors the controls were gleaming steel plastic and chrome they all but begged to be stroked if there was a single speck of dust in the room it was nowhere in sight your cots are over here chicon said pulling one of the inflatable mattresses out of its niche in the wall coffee and food dispensers are in the usual place but the lavatory is built into the control room now you wont have to leave even to get a shower lopez nodded without speaking running his hands over the controls with a lovers touch he and mitsuko exchanged looks and she blushed prettily alex shunted the luggage over into a corner he was fighting a contact high from the lopezes this room was infectious it had obviously been built for more than sheer utility or even comfort for some this would be the games real lure one day the faithful game player would graduate to the control room to create his own fantasy worlds instead of merely acting out someone elses to be a prime mover instead of just a participant for just an instant alex could see into the lopezes relationship could see the world they shared with each other and with nobody else he could feel that their love for each other was filtered and colored by their fantasies by their ability to make dreams come real a dream born of their minds would be shared with a select group of dream park technicians then with a team of fantasy garners if all went well when all the bugs were out of the programming then it could be shared with the world as if guided by one mind richard and mitsuko turned to them hand in hand this is fine we need to be left alone now if you dont mind richard and i have a lot of work to do before morning of course if theres anything you need just give us a call welles shook hands with both of them again and the dream park personnel departed obrien chuckled as they walked back to the elevators theyre classic i bet theres a level of nonverbal communication between them that borders on telepathy did you notice how frequently they touched each other alex had noticed id call that a continuing reassurance for each that the other exists they live very deep in their heads i noticed something else too what was that they only spoke to each other once what the hell do you mean they were all over each other physically theyre in constant communication intellectually i bet they mesh even better but apparently very little of their interplay is on the verbal level alex chewed on that while they waited for the elevators finally uneasily he said well dont just stand there what does it mean skip smiled maliciously damned if i know id heard about them and wanted to see for myself you mean youre just going to raise the question and leave it dangling how am i supposed to sleep tonight what kind of man are you anyway the kind whos going to buy you a drink if we can find a bar open around here alex held the elevator for him oh that kind of man my father told me to stay away from your type and the door shut behind them the morning outside these walls was still black in the waiting area it was all artificial lighting take it as an omen tony told himself reality is artificial from this point on he squinted at the character identification form in his hand acacia wrote part of a line on her own form then turned to him panthesilea was real she was one of the amazon queens killed in the trojan war by achilles she was strong and beautiful and they sang songs to her memory for years tony snuck a peek at ollies sheet and laughed oliver the frank are you kidding or what ollie looked up sheepishly when i first started gaming i was afraid id forget my characters name so i used my nickname anyway olivers a legitimate hero he fought under charlemagne with roland tony hadnt meant to put ollie on the defensive he started to say so but the intercom interrupted him attention all game participants costuming will proceed for another forty minutes only thank you there was a general buzz in the waiting area beneath game central and four people scurried off to the enclosed costuming booths for last minute touchups the fifteen players were an odd lot although all had stowed cotton shirts and pants in their tote bags each now wore clothing peculiar to the characters they chose to play on the expedition two things they had in common the eagerness thick enough to cut and the neck tabs silver metal disks held in place by nearly invisible soft plastic bands marymartha maryem waddled around the oakpaneled waiting area with the selfassurance of an iron duck the longer she waited the fiercer burned her energy she wore brown leather that hugged her chunky body gluetight with joints cut in the leather at waist and knees to provide leeway she carried a short halberd with a flat heavy blade slung across her back acacia recognized several of the other garners by reputation the thin wiry blond man would be bowan the black he had discarded the scarlet robe that had been his first choice of raiment and settled for hip boots and a black velvet shirt split in a hairychested v his companion was a halfpretty redhead tall and thin with a slight roll of flabby skin around her midsection a sure sign of the diet faddist what was it this month dear ten grams of vinegarsoaked raisins before every meal acacia clucked at herself halfashamed of her automatic negative reaction to the woman who had registered in the thief category as dark star ollie and gwen didnt worry her beneath their aweshucks exteriors she sensed born gamesters even chester had seemed glad to see them gwen was still in the costuming room as ollies frequent casual glances in that direction confirmed gina perkins had been dressed to kill every time acacia had seen her now she wore hiking shorts and shirt both covered with pockets but they didnt cling to her like a coat of paint there was makeup but it was subdued her hair was intricately arranged and she was still stunning she was playing her wizards staff while she waited that was stunning acacia had seen pictures in the gaming magazines it was five feet tall and an inch thick jammed with instrumentation and the internal computer patterns of colored lights ran up and down its length and monochromatic flames lashed from the tip as ginas fingertips ran over the contactsensitive keyboard tony watched as if mesmerized then tore his eyes away and went back to work on his character identification sheet he was feeling the crunch she thought the jokes were there and the smug smiles and knowing touches but there was something else too pregame jitters a touch of fantasy flu his long jaw worked a nonexistent wad of gum and his chocolate eyes seemed watery as he worked the character identification sheet was an optional adjunct to the game that lopez had asked everyone to fill out it listed not only imaginary physical and mental characteristics but shaded over into genealogy acacia looked at her own sheet how did amazons have children captured male slaves maybe parthenogenesis she used a little of both panthesilea was a sterile female born parthenogenetically her mother her mother melissa was the offspring of queen herona and a captive greek named ah cyrius a bastard son of hercules she hoped that the other players were having as much trouble all personal characteristics were measured in wesslergrahm points and were preregistered with the ifgs and filed in the gaming a computer in this group only tony had no initial rating the computer had run a random number series for him and spit out doubledigits which in wesslergrahm terms represented percentage chances of a positive result in combat or emergency he had come out high in agility and intelligence medium in strength and low in recuperative powers tony had looked at the readout with a cautiously lidded excitement this bodes not well for my ambitions of warriorhood what are my choices chicon and dwight welles were there to act as intermediaries and override controllers for the ifgs referees larry chicon had enjoyed the chance to get involved he had counted off tonys options one finger at a time magic user warrior thief cleric and engineer and explorer each of them have their plusses and minuses and we do allow some combination play but in general its best to find one category and get into it as deep as possible tony found himself wishing that the oversized monitors were switched on to give him a peek into what waited for them in area a how would i do as a magic user welles shook his head slowly wouldnt recommend it but i cant stop you if thats what you want whats wrong with magic user thats pretty complicated for a first outing besides your charisma score was only trying conjuring up a demon with that and youll be dinner whats the difference between magic user and cleric oh clerics usually perform preventive magic or curative magic and they get their powers from on high which means they must be pure of spirit playing with the ladies while in the game might mess that up larry shot welles a nasty look thats turkey turds tony what you do during the twelve hours a day that the game is off is totally up to you look with good scores in intelligence and agility why dont you try thief tony opened his mouth as if to protest then he laughed and nodded if itll help me survive the game im for it and tony mcwhirter became a first level thief fortunato by name thought to be a bastard son of either fafhrd or the grey mouser it being that kind of relationship he would enter the gaming area in cotton tropical garb the warning buzzer sounded again and chester henderson bounded into the room he wore a green safari shirt and matching pants with creases sharp enough to cut paper his pipestem arms and legs were fairly flapping with enthusiasm last minute check everybody weve only got a few minutes and then were off any questions he looked slowly around the room s j waters the youngest gamester in the room raised his hand halfway as if afraid of being noticed when chester pointed at him he flinched then said chester what is it exactly that were after we havent been told ive got my suspicions though well find out for sure once we enter the game so dont worry getting there is half the fun any more questions good were going to have a tremendous time people and everyone is going to take home more points than he can carry he flashed his smile again and began circling the room checking on individual needs gwen had returned to her seat next to ollie and he was busy enjoying her costume registered as a cleric gwen wore a simple dress cut several inches too high for a real missionary and leathersoled walking shoes with just enough heel to bring out the shape of her calf the dress was beige and almost too frilly to wear on a jaunt but the way that it brought out the most attractive lines in her figure pardoned all impracticalities she stood up and twirled around for him biting her lip do you like it ollie he grinned until the corners of his mouth threatened to meet in the back he reached out for her and she backed away coyly do you like it south seas treasure or not i already know im a winner gwen blushed you know what i like best about gaming ollie shook his head you always say the sweetest things when you think youre someone else ollie looked her dead in the eye maybe thats because youre someone else hah you know perfectly well acacia stooped over them you guys ready everything in order her character identification sheet was doubled in her hand well be starting in a few seconds whats that ollie tropical chocolate frankish oliver to you panthesilea and yes the stuff tastes like cocoa butter but it doesnt melt well find food along the way but i like to be prepared the final warning sounded and the garners began shouldering knapsacks and gear there was an impatient buzz in the air and all eyes turned to chester who stood by gina in the center of the room his voice was nearly cracking with excitement may i have everybodys attention please will the fourteen primaries please line up by the elevators the doors will be opening automatically it is now eight minutes until the game begins hustle people come on he was wasting his breath long before he finished fourteen faces were clustered below the digital floor monitor as it displayed the approach of the elevator cars when the doors slid open there was a general whoop of delight and the fourteen primaries crammed in chester turned to look around the waiting room no one had left anything behind the room was clean and empty within hours the first alternates would appear within minutes the progress of the game would be broadcast to monitors in selected areas of dream park but he and richard lopez had been at war for one solid year chester stepped back and the elevator doors closed chapter six flight of fancy somehow acacia had expected the elevator to carry them down into the bowels of the r d building to long lost caverns where blind gnomes would lead them hand in gnarled hand to the beginning of the great adventure instead it went up a mcdonnellboeing phoenix helicopter was waiting on the roof its engines humming quietly as the vast horizontal blades turned in lazy circles what the hell tony whispered she turned to caution him but saw the grin of incredulous delight and said nothing you know ive always wanted to ride in one of these lets just take it one fantasy at a time she murmured over one edge of the roof she could see the shapes and colors of dream park its towers and mazelike walls to the other side nothing area a was hidden in featureless haze a hologram projection of primal chaos the cargo doors of the phoenix were open waiting a dark brown face suddenly popped out of the darkness immediately split in a grin greetings the man yelled cheerily please come aboard chester looked at him suspiciously for a moment then nodded and stalked aboard lugging his totebag acacia was fifth aboard just behind a huge man named eames who walked with a selfconscious swagger warrior she snickered then reflected that his freckled boyishness might have interested her if tony werent along to keep the chill off one fantasy at a time she reminded herself anything can happen the interior of the phoenix copter was comfortable but not plush with twenty seats and room for their gear in both overhead racks and a hamper in the rear the pilot of the copter waved back at them as they were seated make yourselves comfortable folks im captain stimac and you just let me know if you have any problems the dark man who had greeted them at the door was energetically bouncing up and down the aisle helping people with their luggage and generally having a great time tony filled the seat next to acacia and she took his hand affectionately he asked whats next she shook her head she didnt want to talk she wanted to sense the cargo doors creaked shut the rotors of the phoenix accelerated blurred and disappeared but characteristic of the model the engines only made a hoarse and urgent humming sound developed for nocturnal combat duty the phoenix was as silent as a motordriven craft could be the ground dropped away yah hoof screamed maryems buzzsaw voice children we are off the gamesters cheered as the phoenix tilted and began to eat distance when the fasten seat belts pictogram clicked off their oneman welcoming committee stood and bowed shallowly to them i would like to introduce myself to all of you i am kasan maibang and i will be your guide and liaison with the people of my island chester stood now his facial lines gone angular with eagerness your island then you know where were going and what our quest is kasans smile was innocent of course mr henderson you do not think that your government would send you on such a perilous adventure without benefit of a guide our government chester absorbed that no of course not i assume you have our briefing sheets i am your briefing sheets the lore masters shoulders relaxed and he nodded behind him tony whispered why is that good acacia told him the briefing material has to be true in context lopez isnt allowed to lie to us about the basic assumptions behind the game now chester knows he can trust kasan up to a point kasan cant lie uh huh tony examined the native suspiciously is he a hologram no i saw him carrying luggage later he might be a hologram hes a gaming actor probably playing for straight points he gets his whether we win or lose as long as he doesnt blow his lines the lore master more relaxed now was perched on the arm rest between two empty seats he asked where are we headed to the melanesian islands new guinea to be specific chester almost laughed youre from new guinea maibang was apologetic the episcopalian mission sent me to ucla where you were recruited no doubt oh absolutely you must appreciate the problem ever since the road to the cargo was opened in chesters sigh of comprehension was audible all over the copter cargo cult right please go on maibang was clearly pleased that chester had made the jump yes well ever since then the melanesian peoples those who have learned the secret have been stealing back the possessions that the europeans thats us their guide shrugged there are us and there are europeans some europeans are black or brown or yellow though most are white okay my people the daribi were among the peoples blessed with the true secret of the cargo we prospered godmanup sends many wonderful things to his faithful children canned meat electric lights jeeps refrigerators and of course weapons with which to drive out the europeans of course said chester then nine years ago bare flicker of an eyelash in chester absorbed that datum and nodded my people the daribi began to divert shipments of cargo intended for europe and the americas naturally your people fought back with your own rituals but our sorcerers were mighty then you tried the force of your military and again we prevailed late in my people made their greatest effort and stole from your people a very great cargo indeed which was maibang wagged his head sorrowfully we sensed its existence and we used our powers to take it but we never saw it the extreme effort strained our sorcerers at the last moment as the cargo was coming to us a rival tribe who coveted our power used their own magic to divert its path we were too weak to resist their victory over us gained them great mans great power they became the dominant force on our island your government knows the rest how their power and their greed leave no ship or airplane safe for a thousand kilometers around it has gone on for seven years with the powers of our enemies growing ever greater chester sighed do i gather you cant tell us the name of this enemy tribe you catch on quick bwana nope to use the name of so powerful a tribe without their prior permission is much bad mana so my people made contact with yours to strike a bargain we will help a small group of europeans into the lands held by the enemy you steal back what you can and get it out the enemy will lose mana and we will regain our power we will then sign a treaty with you binding us to take only cargo intended for us by godmanup and none of yours as long as you hold to the same agreement and why should we trust you to keep your promises chester gave maibang his most beneficent smile because we are not europeans maibang answered humbly jeezuss s j waters exclaimed we are a long way out chester slid over to the nearest window were over the ocean i dont see any points of reference yet islands over here chester sj called from the other side of the copter he shaded his eyes against the glare think weve got hawaii here then were halfway chester said to himself acacia said thats oahu i think dont know hon ive never flown this tony caught himself damn i mean ive never been to hawaii its just too easy to forget that this isnt real so stop trying tony grinned uneasily last gasps of sanity i guess then breathe deep lover the air gets pretty thin from here on out the phoenix began to judder and captain stimacs voice sounded over the intercom were about to hit rough weather people please notice that the seat belt warning is in effect and comply with it thank you chester waved a finger at maibang dont you die on me now ive got to get a lot more out of you maibang grinned and promised nothing there were dark clouds ahead now and already the sky was dimming the phoenix dipped as if hitting an air pocket and a unanimous ooh was followed by a whoop from maryem the clouds came fast they were ugly boiling with light and dark grays ominous flashes of fire played within the phoenix was swallowed into the storm and turbulence shook them like a giant child playing with a toy lightning glared eyesplitting bright to starboard the craft dropped and shook with the force of the thunderclap acacia screamed delightedly and threw her arms around tony he grabbed back yelling at the top of his voice rain pelted the sides of the phoenix and the engines whined in protest as it tried to climb and stabilize again and again their eyes and ears were assaulted by monstrous bursts of light and sound until it seemed that the phoenix was coming apart in midair the whisper of the engines changed to an ominous growling vibration between lightning flashes nothing could be seen outside and as the lights failed in the plane tony found himself kissing acacia with something akin to genuine terror in his heart at last the storm lightened and some sunlight peeped through the cloud there was a stir at the back of the cabin gamers pushing and shoving at the windows the pair looked out to see what the trouble was tony looked out on a broad rounded wing studded with thousands of rivets the motor housing was huge and the air before it was blurred its voice was a shattering roar like the devil let loose on earth wings i will be go to hell weve got wings and rivets and propellers acacia squeezed past him and pressed her face to the glass to the rear she could just see the tail stabilizers as applause and whistles broke out she shook her head admiringly its got to be a midnineteenhundreds model of something or other tony said softly s j waters had the answer wowie a dc a goonie bird hey these things were supposed to be halfmagical anyway clusters of passengers began to sing fragments of verse celebrating the adventures of kafoozalem and eskimo nell were heard above the roar of the engines offies high voice rang out oh the camel has a lot of fun his night begins when ours is done he always gets two humps for one as he revels in the joys of fornication and half the garners bellowed a ragged chorus cats on the rooftops cats on the tiles the air had cleared the plane dipped into a cloud deck and out the bottom ollie sang the hippos rump is big and round islands the redheaded dark star said and the song died in midleer they were coming up on the subcontinent itself and chester announced above the roar we seem to be approaching new guinea from the bismarck sea those might be the finisterre mountains only about three thousand meters we can clear those the view below was an explosion of dense greens and browns vegetation crowding from the rich soil in rich profusion the finisterre mountains ruled the huon peninsula overlooking vitiaz strait and in the crystalclear air they seemed close enough to reach out and touch the dc skimmed over them and reoriented north soon they were crossing swamps and marshy areas captain stimacs voice buzzed from the intercom we will be reaching chambri lake in a few minutes its the landmark for the landing strip which has been cleared for us in fact i think i see there was a pause and the plane bucked in the air this time the bucking became a jarring side pull that bounced acacia against her seat belt wait just a minutethats not the right lake but something uh move godamit stimac began swearing in panic the plane was sliding down the sky the motors screamed stimac shouted i cant move the controls theyre moving themselves hands gripped seats and faces went white as the swamps rose toward them rotating now there was light down there and water a sheen of water directly below the planes nose and two lines of lights glowing on the water and a tower its pulling us in chester said he was squeezed up against a window and his mouth hung a little open not frightened but fascinated kasan was in the aisle waving his arms and chanting in an unknown language while two garners held him steady with hands on his belt tony almost forgot his own fear as he stared out closer now and the control tower was only wickerwork on pontoons and the lights were floating torches tethered by ropes forming lines too close together to make a real runway it was a mockery of an airport laid out on water the mockairport veered sideways and gee forces pulled savagely at the passengers the dc pulled out of its dive the wing on the right side bent far enough to pop two lines of rivets then eased back into place but fluid was streaming from where the metal had crinkled stimacs intercom voice screamed got it i think were all right now whatever it was its oh shiti as the wing unrolled a flapping flag of redandyellow flame ive got to get us down said the crackling intercom voice brace yourselves this isnt going to be neat they were barely at treetop level trailing flame and black smoke ill try for chambri lake there are life rafts in the rear of the plane tony could restrain himself no longer just what the hell is happening he couldnt look away from the line of trees whipping past the plane at paintscraping levels acacia looked down the real lake should be somewhere close up ahead if we can make that her eyes were fixed on the window and as an expanse of dark green came into view she sighed in relief there it is the plane plunged shaking like a dog drying itself and there were fourteen throatrendering screams and one yahhoo in the instant before the plane struck water acacia was aware of tonys fingers dipping clawlike into her arm the impact threw them forward water surged over the plane bubbles streamed past the windows at least the fire was out the plane bobbed to the surface wobbled righted itself water lapped at the windows chester was the first to regain his balance all right everybody lets get out the lifeboats and get the gear together weve got work to do seat belts clicked like castinets duffle bags were pulled out of their overhead racks with almost feverish eagerness tony looked toward the nose of the plane where captain stimac lolled limply in his chair hey is he unnoticed by the rest of the garners tony advanced to the front of the craft shouldering his backpack unsteadily captain stimac there was no reply he took another cautious step feeling the plane yaw slightly beneath him captain stimacs head rolled back loosely from a neck that seemed broken and a trickle of blood ran from his mouth eyes stared sightless from a slack and pasty face tony felt his stomach convulse and clutched at himself suddenly afraid oh my god then stimac winked at him straightening in midretch tony glared at him and stalked out of the cabin he grabbed acacia by the shoulder and spun her around thats the last time understand absolutely the last acting calmly and with nearmilitary precision chester had four boats out on the water and was directing the inflating of the fifth from a cylinder of compressed gas tony and acacia were in a raft with s j waters and tony was looking back at the dc with a halfsmile boy that looks real you really have to strain to catch even the outline of the phoenix under the acacia laid a hand gently on his arm tony she said with genuine affection stop fighting it is real everything here is real just relax and let it happen okay please her dark eyes sparkled with unmocking laughter and tony nodded he gripped her hand hard im sorry babe i guess maybe im he paused and looked around at the rafts bobbing in the lake i dont know whats going to happen or what it will do to my head it throws me the rafts five strong now were bobbing next to the settling dc in the middle of a huge lake it was impossible to tell the actual size of the body of water perspective was no barrier to dream park technology chester and maibang were last into the water in a raft loaded with bundles of supplies which way kasan the guide looked around in feigned confusion this is difficult to say but im not sure what do you mean i mean that this lake isnt what it should beits shaped wrong chesters long face became thoughtful wrong shape how so chambri lake is rounder than this see two of the shorelines are clearly visible but the other two edges are lost to our sight chester carefully got to his feet standing precariously balanced as he looked just as carefully he sat back down all right its not chambri lake what is it kasan wagged his head sorrowfully not sure very bad magic i fear he gazed contemplatively across the lake i think we should head to the north shore its closest there was a feather touch of suspicion on chesters face as he nodded assent okay people lets move out for the north bank we can regroup there two out of the three people on each raft hefted paddles and began guiding their boats ashore tony and acacia provided propulsion for their boat while their passenger sj merrily called stroke stroke it became a race with tony and acacia in second place behind eames and his two boatmates one a magic user named alan leigh the other the irrepressible maryem who as second paddle did not so much stroke as wrestle the water into submission leigh his pouchy cheeks somewhat incongruous on his spare frame watched the water ahead of them intently and when his hand shot into the air all five of the rafts backpaddled to a halt acacia shaded her eyes and cautiously stood testing her balance theres something there tony started to ask then saw it himself just ahead of eamess boat the water was rippling unpleasantly sj got to his feet almost upsetting the boat acacia skewered him on a raised eyebrow and he sat down water snake he muttered watching the approaching ripples chester two rafts back had seen it too snake his voice was surprisingly clear and loud big one leigh take first assault in the front raft leigh stood up when the snake rose from the swirling water the magician was ready the snake was easily thirty feet long its trunk thick and banded with muscle its head was broader than a horses long black tongue slipping in and out of its mouth with hypnotic rhythm its torso showed yellow and dull red against the bluegreen of the lake and as it hoisted fully eight feet of its length out of the water and glared at them an uneasy cheer went up from the other garners leigh spread his arms in supplication gods above he screamed at the top of his voice hear my plea almost immediately a green glow surrounded him and he nodded acknowledgement the snake glided closer lets see now gods sake get on with it maryem snapped he glared at her no respect for artists all right then he refocused his gaze on the snake now only meters away snake you are a thing of water i give youfire he gestured magically and nothing happened he repeated fire and the glow around his right hand melted from green to red he made a hurling motion at the snake a fistsized ball of fire sailed from his hand bright even in artificial daylight expanding as it pierced the air and impacted the snakes nose the effect was remarkable the viper recoiled with an echoing hiss and dove back into the water and disappeared tony cheered great heroes one monster zero acacia gripped his arm not so fast tony she was watching chester the lore master lifted his arms hear me oh gods he said his voice deep and resonant the green glow appeared around him he looked down into the murky green water i invoke clear vision reveal to me my foe with a ripple of glitter the surface of the lake became like a warped sheet of green glass and beneath it writhed the outline of an enormous serpent warriors be ready its coming back up acacia said oh shit and dived for her gear she hurriedly unrolled an oblong oilskin package and lovingly touched the twentyfourinch blade of her shortsword before buckling the scabbard round her waist she slipped the blade out again and ex perimentally slashed at the air then checked the ready light in the hilt she waited crouched the lake surged and the snake was on them hissing with the liquid sound of a wind whipping through a stand of rainswept trees its head coiled back then snapped forward with blinding speed acacia cut furiously across the beasts mouth it swerved around and tried to bite from the side but the swordswoman pivoted neatly and met it again this time the snake jerked back clear of the blade it hovered just out of range glaring at her with blood drooling from its upper p slowly eyes fixed on her steadily it sank beneath the water good play panthesilea tony mcwhirter said his face just a shade pale sj piped up immediately best damn holograms in the world most expensive too the sword sensor knows whether it intersects part of the projection and signals the computer the snakes a computeranimated projection so he looked down at acacias sword tip waving an inch from his nose she said listen sj maybe you get your kicks from analyzing dreams but i want to play and i want tony to have the chance to play with me okay sj grinned and said snakes behind you she whirled sword ready and he laughed the watersnake was menacing the raft that held gwen and offie they paddled madly their passenger a cleric named garret spread his arms and intoned loudly hear me oh gods his red false beard flapped mightily in the breeze the familiar green halo surrounded him and he yelled a ring of protection father a band of soft white light circled the raft the snake drew up short and nosed around them in bewildered frustration in the time that it spent deciding how to attack bowan the black had maneuvered his boat up behind it fireball he cried an arc of flame leapt from his palm to strike the monster just behind the head it hissed in pain and spun around diving for bowan offies voice rang out across the water cut the ring he yelled and the circle of light disappeared ollie stood stripped to the waist gut sucked in heroically his eyes burned fiercely he clutched a sword in one hand and a dagger in the other he yodeled his warcry and struck the snake jerked away from the kiss of steel and ollies second slash cut thin air ollie tried to make up the extra distance with a lunge the raft shifted in the opposite direction and ollie went over the edge he came up sputtering and thrashing with his left hand for balance the dagger was a hindrance he stuffed it in his sheath and struck out towards the snake its body rose from the water and encircled him ollie screamed defiantly and laid about with the sword the snake was covered in wounds now and bowan the black was hurling tongues of fire with both hands the snakes upper body was awrithe with flame and it uncoiled from ollie and tried to dive as it did ollie torqued his body all the way round in the water and caught it dead center between the eyes mortally wounded it rolled its eightball eyes piteously and expired sinking beneath the water with only a slick of blood to mark its passing without knowing how he got there tony found himself on his feet and cheering like an idiot with great clumsy strokes ollie swam back to the raft gwen helped him aboard kissing him soundly acacia nudged tony think theyll celebrate tonight or what he was still openmouthed watching the slowly dissipating bloodstain just wow cas i dont believe it youd better believe it when it happens to you or youll be out of the game while youre still trying to shut your mouth she brushed the back of her hand along his jawline closing it and said come on lover lets get to shore before lopez hits us with something new oh he wouldnt he paused chewing his words right lets get off the lake chapter seven the road of the cargo the dc was disappearing beneath the waters as the last raft pulled ashore tony shouldered his knapsack and adjusted the nylon straps rest in peace captain stimac he said is that one for lopez acacia shook her head the pilot was a freebie he wasnt a member of our party he was outside chesters influence help me get my bedroll adjusted will you then lets go talk to chester the lore master was helping gina get herself together besides a bedroll and backpack the lovely redhead sported a wicked looking dagger and the wizards staff her major magical tool henderson himself carried only a bedroll and backpack plus a small black box fastened to his belt on the left side he turned to maibang you have a lot of those snakes around here maibang raised his palms in supplication who knows what evil has been wrought here since my departure the guide wiped a drop of water from his broad nose and stared into the distance i believe that we head yes that way north toward the mountains are you sure chester sounded a touch irritated almost absolutely i understand that your people have mystical ways to reach out and seek such information for yourselves perhaps you would care to try too much energy expenditure too soon the snake drained a lot of energy from two of my players chester gazed toward the mountain peaks shimmering in the distance and the dense forest growth between the guide could plead ignorance but he couldnt lie chester raised his voice to be audible to the entire group were heading north eames you and leigh up front with me maryem and acacia take the rear guard dont spread too thin people the fifteen garners and maibang formed into a line eames leading as they chopped their way into the brush the big mans arm rose and fell tirelessly as his sword served machete duty filling the air with shredded green chaff we must follow these mountains maibang assured them there should be a trail up ahead just a little way and then the going will be much easier chester grunted a reply and kept watching the terrain carefully tony hung back with acacia in the rear of the column she cut brush for the first few minutes but as initial progress was slow she soon tired and slipped her sword back into its sheath they found a trail and the going became easier maibang kept them heading toward the mountains which acacia suspected were slowly shifting position to keep them traveling in an expanding spiral she couldnt come close to naming all the varieties of plant and animal life birds of all kinds their plumes ablaze with color parrots with purple and bright orange feathers birds of paradise with impossible combinations of gold and red and electric white swirling on their wings and tails acacia recognized coconuts and what looked like rubber trees but beyond that the underbrush was a tangle of greens and dark purples and the yellow of dying shrubs of vines and trees leaves flat and shiny invisible against the forest growth or exploding with flowers small snakes slept on branches or wriggled from underfoot creatures leapt through the branches just out of sight one parrot gorgeous in its purple plumage kept pace with her for what seemed a kilometer always just out of reach she watched it watched it land for an instant on a branch to nuzzle beneath its wings for a fat mite watched it cock its head at her curiously and found herself wondering if it was real it looked real it sounded real its untutored voice croaking tunelessly except for sharp whistles and she wondered the air was hot and sticky and smelled oppressively green they had tried holding hands but contact with another human body only made the heat worse and they gave it up sweat rolled from tonys face in grimy drops and under his cotton shirt dark damp spots were forming under his armpits and on his chest he pointed off to the side and asked is that a small clearing surrounded by one species of bush outlining a crescent moon thats it shall i stop the others ill only be a second tony stepped off the trail and into the clearing and faded out acacia kept moving presently he was behind her again pushing his pace until he caught up i feel as if weve been walking for hours he said to her panting sincerely some of the bounce was gone from his walk and frustrated fatigue showed in his face come on wheres another beastie anythings better than this acacia moaned sympathetically poor baby just try to remember that your discomfort like everything else here is only makebelieve she patted his cheek there now dont you feel better now yes mommy he said absently and quickened his step to catch up with gwen and ollie sheen of sweat or not the blond cleric hadnt released her heros arm for an instant tony clapped ollie on the shoulder good going with the water snake offie call me oliver would you tony his hand rested easily on the grip of his sword tony tried to laugh but suddenly there was nothing soft about ollie not his eyes nor his carriage and certainly not the way his palm caressed his sword gwen had changed too she was still attached to ollie but instead of his leaning on her she seemed to be drawing strength from him tony sensed that he was out of his depth gwens laugh was of quiet challenge oliver is a noble name tony oliver was one of charlemagnes greatest warriors all right oliver i like the way you handled the water snake it was a class act tension eased i almost got killed out there oliver growled when i went off the side of the boat i thought i was dead i was just waiting for the jolt from my neck tab if lopez had really wanted me he had me then that thing could have crushed me before it took enough hit points to roll over and die if he believes in the game master how can he believe hes oliver the frank tony shrugged inside his mind schizo well maybe ill have to be schizo too oliver what is it exactly that thieves do its easy to see what warriors and clerics and magic users do thieves steal mostly gwen skipped a halfpace to keep her step even with olivers you skulk around and youre practically invisible to your enemies youre not much with weapons except maybe a throwing knife its loads of fun youll get a chance to try your hand later today probably thats about all i can think of chester can fill you in on anything else dont worry we wont let you get killed before you learn the rules it wont get really rough for a bit yet yeah well i guess you havent had a chance to bless anything yet either not true i blessed dear oliver before he engaged in mortal combat with that overblown water worm behind every man et cetera said oliver his persona cracked for an instant and he bounced on his toes and was offie again smiling bright as sunrise saying i am having so much fun i really hope you can get into it tony mcwhirter smiled and nodded he dropped back to acacias side happy as two fleas in a bottle of blood they are what do you want out of all this tony what will make you happy just a little of something that i cant get anywhere else i guess she fluttered her eyelashes at him well you of course but you know breathless adventure exotic sights heaps of fabulous gems all that all that but you do value my friendship dont you sure i do cas besides i cant afford what you charge strangers he hugged her with one arm as they moved down the trail the shrubbery closing behind them like a healing wound im a city boy cas what am i supposed to want six days from now im back at work copying blueprints eight hours a day hell i guess my expectations are a little unreasonable i cant really expect an amusement park to undo in a week the damage a dull job does in fifty but i do he gently turned her face to him and spoke in all seriousness help me will you cas she looked half puzzled half pleased you know hombre every once in a while youre such a decent human being that i might as well have left my hip boots at home how bout if i tickle your butt next time youre facing down a giant snake there was a shout up ahead and several of the garners had broken ranks running forward to a clearing meters up the trail acacia halfdrew her sword then she saw and relaxed the first half of the journey was over in a few seconds they were out of the jungle and into a cultivated area where kneehigh and waisthigh plants grew in neat rows she could see men and women working in the fields weeding and irrigating please kasan maibangs voice rang out stay on the path the young tubers are very delicate acacia immediately wondered how far the cultivated area really went and where the dream park magic took over some of the land had been irrigated into marshiness and men waded kneedeep in the mud planting and setting up stakes to indicate private plots in the community garden acacia recognized sweet potatoes yams and sugar cane in the distance banana trees and breadfruit grew and the air was full of the scent of rich wet earth and growing things like tony she was a child of the city but a granduncle in mexico owned his own ranch and she and her two brothers had spent glorious summers there helping with the cows and pigs she knew something of wide spaces and working in the open air and remembered the smell of sweating bodies toiling in the afternoon sun the villagers were small people most of them darker than kasan and showing the physical impact of a primitive life style adults seemed to be made of leather and woven gut faces etched but not scarred by endless labor in the fields bodies scarred but not broken by the rigors of the hunt their attire gstrings and animalhide flaps made her feel she was sweltering and she toyed with the idea of adapting that style for the rest of the trip poor tony would have a fit the garners were attracting attention from the field workers now and many stopped their work to point and stare warriors carrying bamboo spears had emerged from the cluster of thatched buildings on the other side of the fields the garners had gathered around chester while he quizzed maibang youre sure that your chief knows were coming and wants us here i am sure of all that maibang answered gravely a nasty suspicion lit chesters face the daribi are cannibals arent they maibang looked wounded upon special occasions of course you are not our enemies you have come to help us it would be ingracious in the extreme to do such a thing he paused for a moment thinking just to be on the safe side though you might be careful of the phrasing if anyone invites you to dinner he leaned close enough to whisper jerking a thumb at gina a few yams and a sliced banana or two would do wondrous things for your lovely friend there be careful about telling her that chester said absently shes been known to kiss on the first date but he turned quiet as the first quartet of stocky spearmen drew near two were carrying bulky rifles none of them left footprints in the dirt the foremost of them raised his spear in greeting they wore colorful necklaces of woven vine and leather and ceremonial headdresses of short brilliantly colored feathers chester kept his expression neutral as he raised a hand and waited the field workers were gathered about them now small dark children protuberant bellies bouncing with their scampering hid behind the skirtlets of their barebreasted mothers the lead warrior spoke his words rapid and melodic kasan listened carefully then turned to chester his name is kagoiano and he has come to escort you to the council of men at the request of our council chief pigibidi who extends greetings and hopes that you will join his company immediately pigibidi chester asked in amusement there is great power in his name it means gunperson and when he was at the height of his power he was a great man indeed shall we proceed chester relaxed noticeably all right lets go talk to gunperson the council hut was a little longer and broader than the rest of the woodandwovenstraw huts several sleeping mats were rolled and stored neatly aside near the door flap chester assumed gunperson liked to keep his warriors close at hand the walls were hung with skins and furless and headless bodies of marsupials hung from the rafters acacia maryem and the other women were stopped at the door kagoiano spoke a few words to kasan and he interpreted for them i am sorry but the women cannot be admitted to this council they will be escorted to the council for women for a reading of the omens whats this reading of the omens business maryem demanded try to shuck me junior and youll be eating soft foods for a month only men can be admitted to this hall kasan explained patiently just as only women may enter the council of women they do not make policy but provide us with a valuable source of information on the plans and movements of our enemies chester laid a hand on maryems shoulder well split up for now i dont think were in any danger we can trade information as soon as were through here the women departed reluctantly the nine male adventurers escorted by kasan and kagoiano walked to the rear of the council hut tony sniffed the air there was old smoke and smoked meat and what smelled like cheap tobacco the air toward the rear of the hut was cooler better crossventilation deeper shadow the floor was wood covered with straw mats some of them decorated with stain he looked in vain for the hidden holo projector kagoiano was a projection tony had contrived to brush against him but he couldnt figure how the continuity was handled surely lopez had had to switch projectors at least once when kagoiano entered the hut but the transition was carried off so smoothly that it was unnoticeable which raised another disturbing possibility that a hologram could be substituted for a real person even a gamer tony was learning respect for henderson hell of a game youve got here friend in the rear of the hut was an alcove partitioned off with a hang ing mat kasan lifted it aside and the garners entered the new room in a few seconds tonys eyes adjusted to the darkness the first things to emerge from the gloom were ten small points of light at length he could see that they were eyes unblinking glaring notquitefocused eyes that seemed to stare through them all and off to distant and unknowable reaches beyond a withered and trembling voice said come he could see more clearly now five old men were seated in a semicircle around a dish of what looked like dried fruit chester squatted in crosslegged position directly in front of them tony saw that their eyes didnt track as he moved and concluded that he had found an easy way to differentiate between holograms and human actors i am chester henderson and these are my followers the lore master said we come to assist your people in any way we can kasan reeled off a string of gibberish and one of the men answered with his own unintelligible words the man who spoke was very old the skin hanging on his body like a coat on a rack timeravaged lines eaten into his neck and face until he resembled nothing so much as a sundried fig his features were very african his skin darker than kasans darker than almost any st century american black tony caught the name pigibidi gunperson welcomes you to the council chester he says that he knows you are a mighty sorcerer and hopes that with your help the threat to the souls of all people can be averted chester was interested now his gaze shifted equally between kasan and the elderly pigibidi the old chieftain pulled a piece of fruit from the bowl and chewed it thoughtfully then spoke again when he ceased maibang interpreted gunperson says that for years the people of the islands endured and cooperated with the invading europeans in the hope that your people would share with them the secret of your enormous wealth when it became clear that you did not wish us to make contact with the spirits who had made such wealth possible we knew that you had much to lose if we ever discovered your secret we knew that whatever the origin of your cars your planes and gasoline engines you had gained some part of them by thievery and lies the people of the islands began a campaign to discover your secrets the secret to the rot bilong kako the path the cargo travels from god to men kasan paused and gunperson talked in his native language for another minute or two kasan sank down into a squat as he listened kagoiano and the rest of the gamers followed suit kasan maibang spoke we joined your churches learned of god and jesus your names for our deities manup and kilibob we prayed to jesuskilibob for cargo and received nothing we worked as slave labor on your plantations and learned the pidgin english that you taught us to speak we built roads changed many of our native customs and many ceased to own as many wives as they could feed all that we might at last be given the secret of cargo all was useless and in the process many of our old gods turned against us thinking that we had abandoned them we were a people without a culture abandoned by our gods and denied the secrets of yours kasan paused his dark face screwed up in concentration as he apparently hung on pigibidis every word at last we determined how the foul imbalance had happened godmanup had always intended for us to receive the cargo but the europeans had with sacrifice and prayer won over to their cause some of the minor gods who were in charge of addressing and distributing the cargo they changed the labels on the packages to the names of white men we knew what was happening now but how could we bring it to a halt the great battle that you called world war ii provided us with the opportunity that we needed many of our young men joined your forces against the yellow europeans the japanese during this time it became possible to kidnap several of your men and officers attributing their disappearance to field casualties pigibidi was grinning as kasan spoke we entertained them for several days some for weeks at last shortly before they gave up their ghosts they also gave up the secret of the cargo we know now that the ceremonies must be spoken in proper not pidgin language sacrifices of pigs and fruits are desirable as are other things that even you might not know paramount is the holy sacrament the sacred fluid that binds you europeans together that infuses your bodies and spirits that is given to children when they need suck and to the old wise ones before they close their eyes for the final time kasans voice quavered with religious ecstasy chester mused for a second then shook his bead wine milk those too have power but i refer to the rare and precious substance you call kokakola chapter eight the banquet the lore master stared then spread his hands in acquiescence youve found us out we used our newfound knowledge to open the road of the cargo and in the year began to regain some of the power that had been stolen from us pigibidi spoke again some sadness in his face for a time kasan said we had everything we hoped for do not look at our village now and think that you know the way it was then white soldiers came to take away our cargo but the gods were with us once again and we killed them all we drove the europeans from new guinea and lived in peace with our neighbors we the daribi were first to know the secret of the cargo we ruled the other peoples of the land but we did not kill or enslave them we even made them gifts to ease their hunger and want at last our sorcerers began to divert even the cargo intended for the europeans and still your people could not stop us we had grown too strong and we grew in power and in mana until the black day on which we grew too proud what happened we stole your greatest and most powerful cargo the feat drained their strength from the tindalos the ghosts and gods who serve us a rival tribe had stolen a case of the precious kokakola at the last moment they used their own knowledge of the rot bilong kako the road of the cargo to divert this tremendous gift to themselves our loss cost us much honor and much mana today our enemies rule most of the tribes of this land we and the agaiambo are the only remaining free peoples soon very soon our enemies will be strong enough to destroy us for defying them afterward they will extend their rule to the other ocean peoples and from there to the entire world and when they rule the world they will crush all other religions your gods will die for lack of worshippers chester shifted his posture and rubbed his bony knees to get some circulation back into them if the entire world is trying to stop them how can they resist kasan spoke a few words to gunperson who spoke in reply the guide turned to chester your people do not know that our enemies have removed themselves from the physical plane of your world they have turned the world our world insideout and nothing can come here unless a path is opened from within my people opened the path for you chester closed his eyes to think without opening them he said that would explain the altered shape of chambri lake oliver spoke it would explain why the water was salt instead of fresh an hah yeah i didnt think of it at the time but the lake was salt so it wasnt chambri lake its the pacific ocean in fact its every ocean in the world good ollie very good that means our directions are going to be screwed up we cant trust our compasses if it hadnt been for the mountains we used as a reference point we would never have gotten here his eyes opened slowly what was it your enemies stole from you kasan spoke to pigibidi who seemed surprised and disturbed surely you would know better than we it was large and we sensed many of your greatest men gathering to see it used our sorcerers sensed it when it began to move and we took hold of it and guided it toward us but it never reached us we do not know its size nor its weight nor its shape nor its color but it would have brought us immense power and now it is in evil hands chester nibbled at his lower lip world war two hmm could be a prototype thermonuclear bomb but the war was already over maibang shrugged all right what exactly do you hope we can do for you the chieftain conferred with his council while kasan listened presently kasan said tomorrow night is the full moon there is to be a sacrifice of a woman plucked from the seas in a place sacred to your god an anglican mission far to the west if you can stop the ceremony you will weaken our rivals and gain precious information from the woman who has lived among them for a month she can tell you how to reach their stronghold there to steal back the mighty cargo which they stole from us which we in turn stole from you you must do this thing for the sake of all living souls we will give you guides and other help but the trip will be dangerous many of you will die but there will be rich reward as well chester looked at maibang a tiny smile playing over his lips well were here and i guess were ready one more thing who are we fighting maibang acted as if he had been struck with a live wire too rapidly to follow he babbled out a string of words to gunperson whose face grew ashy with fear no no can say pigibidi said his first english words since his initial invitation to come chester frowned why so coy why cant you tell us who were fighting maibang shook his head very bad very very bad this tribe is our enemy to use their name would be theft to use anything that belongs to another without his permission is very bad mana you europeans never understood that perhaps that is why you lost your power at last something like copyright violation what about the agaiambo you used their name they are allies they will be helping you on your journey chester nodded all right were in well need some more in formation and well need provisions and a couple of guides i assume youll be staying with us kasan good is that it only this great sorcerer tonight we will feast your people as a sign of our gratitude how many people are you having for dinner kasan repeated the quip to the chieftain who sat in stony silence kasan shrugged i guess it loses something in translation dont we all chester hauled himself to his feet well lets meet the ladies and swap data before dinner he made a slight bowing motion to gunperson and left the hut brushing the roomdivider mat carelessly aside with one hand gwen and acacia stood somewhat apart from the other women watching the mens council hut while preparations for the feast went on around them the feast would be real rich mingling smells of roasted pig and yam were thick in the air a pit had been dug in the village square and had been lined with coals alternating layers of leaves pig meat and various vegetables had then filled the pit men poked holes in the layers with long spears to provide heat flow that smells just too good cas the blondes nose crinkled in delight i cant take any more im going to go right over there and dive in im afraid they might not pull you out theyll just divvy you up with the otheri mean with the pork ahem gwens fingers drummed on her hips could you run that past me again ms spindleshanks oh no i think that one is happy right where it is offle tony over here the men made their way to the waiting ladies come on acacia said after a firm hug lets find a place to sit down oliver asked wont chester want to debrief you gwen stamped her foot oh forget chester for a minute lets have our own debriefing he considered that done its not cheating to compare notes privately they strolled past the thatch huts to a small stand of trees in view of the main square they watched the preparations for the feast and tony laughed acacia pillowed her head against his shoulder as they sat and nudged him with her small fist whats so funny cowboy im just wondering how much of that food isnt really there he stretched luxuriously and dropped one arm around her and pulled her closer you know ive almost stopped wondering which of the natives are real glad to hear it acacia murmured playing in the grass with the toe of her shoe anyone you only see at a distance anybody engaged in repetitious movement and usually anyone you see killed violently is a hologram lopez will use as many holograms as possible why arent holograms expensive so are actors remember other gaming parties are going to run this game the holograms are part of the package but the actors have to be replaced every time oliver lay on his stomach in the grass watching the native chefs he asked what happened to you ladies whilst we were riddling with the savages acacia wagged a finger at him you first oliver and tony obliged by telling everything they could remember gwen and acacia listened intently and finally agreed that they had received much the same trappings were a little different though gwen mused there were three old women one was in a trance the whole time a younger woman translated for us shes supposed to have been to missionary school as a girl they brief these actors pretty well tony plucked a straw from the ground and stuck it playfully in acacias hair it seems they can answer anything we ask acacia laughed dont be too impressed im pretty sure kasan wears a transceiver under that bushy hair whenever he stops to pray or talks gibberish to one of the natives or scratches his ear hes talking to lopez is that legal i mean doesnt that put us in a vulnerable position not really the ifgs is watching lopez pretty closely i think lopez considers himself clever enough to destroy us and chester particularly without cheating oliver sniffed the air the rich aroma of roasting vegetables and pork had drifted up to them ummmum have you ever been very glad your name isnt goldberg it sure feels like dinnertime he started to get up then hesitated what time is it anyway acacia dug into her backpack bringing up a disk watch set in an antique silver dollar ive got sixfifteen why oh just my devious mind its an hour and fortyfive minutes before the game closes down for the night were about to be treated to a banquet nothing drastic has happened for oh call it five hours were all pretty relaxed do you follow me gwen looked gloomy oh ollie sometimes i dont like the way you think i hope youre wrong so do i acacias hand was straying over the hilt of her sword but i wouldnt go banco on it eyes open troops the serving plates were attractive silvery disks with the word chevrolet stencilled on the side offie laughed and nudged gwen hubcaps gwen nodded and pointed a chubby arm toward the nearest hut look at that window whats a glass window doing in a new guinea village oliver squinted scratching his head you know i didnt notice that before i think its a truck windshield take a closer look around this place a lot of it is patchwork like that he began to see what she meant the thatch roofs of several huts had been finished with canvas and many of the natives knives seemed jerryrigged from flattened tin cans most of the spears were bamboo but a few were thin steel tubing with nastily sharpened points incongruously the roofs of a couple of the huts sprouted broken remnants of television antennae and come to think of it werent a few of the women wearing skirts made of parachute silk echoes of a golden age ollie said soberly there were roast pork yams and leafy vegetables only sj could name although the meat had been tended largely by the women it was divided and served by the men larry garret a cleric almost as dark as the natives passed around a hubcap full of steaming maize it was golden delicious and its kernels dripped with some sort of liquefied fat garret told oliver if lopez keeps feeding us like this i dont care what he hits us with amen to that brother oliver muffled a belch pass me the beer will you garret handed him the big gourd the beer was warm and flat but oliver quaffed it with evident pleasuro the garners squatted or sat on the dirt and ate and talked and laughed some of the natives were eating too but many just stood back and watched oliver had waved away the offer of lukewarm raw milk no i really dont think im ready for pig milk thank you the native waiter had pretended not to understand and passed on it was probably cows or goats milk ollie thought but you never knew some of the warriors were pushing something out on a platform a massive television set with a broken screen gunperson walked slowly out of his hut and raised his knobby arms first the natives then the garners fell silent he spoke for almost a minute then kasan stood and translated pigibidi wishes to demonstrate his own magic to the magicians here gathered that they might see what once was and understand polite applause greeted this announcement and kasan waited it out once this box brought us pictures and sounds from all over the world yes even beyond its edge our enemies have rendered it worthless except when our great chief uses his own strength to animate it see now his greatness pigibidi squatted on his heels and began to chant shuffling his feet in a strange rhythm now his chanting grew strong now it dropped so low that they couldnt hear it at all slowly he uncoiled from his squat mouth opened so wide that his facial wrinkles seemed to radiate outward from it like the rays of the sun a gurgling howl rose from his throat tendons and veins stood out in bunches from the old mans neck as the howl reverberated from huts and trees in the bowels of the dead television set merely a midtwentiethcentury flatscreen model with shattered tubes and a crusted interior a light began to grow it pulsed like the mating glow of a firefly shifted from red to orange to bright yellow and the yellow curled from inside the set as a tongue of flame might leap from a fire and there was suddenly a flat bank of opaque amber fog at least five times the size of the set the old man rolled his head in great circles his eyes became glassy his body trembled as if shaken by wind or cold but he danced on now the ground itself shook with the force of his incantations and as it did shapes formed in the smoke dark winged shapes that seemed to wobble to the rhythms as they flew there were perhaps a dozen small shapes within the cloud flapping their wings with seeming awkwardness darting and climbing becoming more solid by the second gunperson screamed and fell to the ground twitching like one helpless in the grip of an epileptic seizure he foamed at the mouth and clutched helplessly at the air fingers crooked into talons from the corner of his eye oliver saw chester go taut an instant before the first of the giant hornbills emerged from the smoke weapons henderson screamed his voice all but lost amid the screams of the villagers then the birds were among them three of the garners were already swathed in green light and fighting back maryem was the first to attack she whipped the halberd off her back and assembled the threaded handle just as a wickedly long beak snapped at her she hit the ground and rolled and as the bird wheeled clumsily for another pass she gutted it its deathsquawk sounded like a maniac laugh as it plunged to earth one down she cackled triumphantly she took a firmer grip on the halberd here birdie birdie a hornbill swooped at tony the thief stood paralyzed with shock the bird flew right by him what the hell he said to nobody in particular acacia pulled him to the ground none too gently listen her voice was a terse hiss youre a thief so theyre going to have a hard time seeing you but your skills wont help the rest of us much right now so just stay out of it okay she jumped to her feet and joined the fray tony stayed on his stomach and watched her go his expression ugly eames the massive warrior stood with his back to one of the huts and three walleyed black children cowered behind him one of the hornbills swooped in from the air while another approached on the ground waddling forward and thrusting its threefoot beak at him with a noisy honking sound eames thrust at the airborne bird first and as he did the one on the ground bit at his wrist the green glow around his hand immediately went pink eames said damn and hastily switched his sword to his left hand as if sensing his increased desperation the birds began to worry him more boldly taking turns to draw his attack then pecking at him the grounded bird prepared to lunge for his neck as a bolt of red flame struck it in the side immediately it caught fire and flopped away trailing smoke and the smell of singed feathers eames took advantage of the moments diversion to skewer the other bird when it flapped back in for a bite it cawed in pain and expired wiping his forehead with the back of his hand eames looked around for his benefactor alan leigh ran over are you all right eames nodded just caught me one on the wrist ill get one of the clerics to fix it up as soon as the fights over good leigh said sincerely i dont want you out of the game too soon he spun around and ran toward gwen and oliver who were protecting the unconscious gunperson bowan the black had taken a stand at the far end of the roasting pit as a hornbill swooped honking its brown wings beating the air like those of a condor he called fire from the pit engulfing the unfortunate fowl chester and gina stood back to back casting glowing spears of light several of ginas missed but those that scored shore off wings and heads chesters beams were deadly accurate most of the clerics and sj the engineer hid beneath one of the huts this wasnt their work when an inquisitive bird thrust its beak beneath the building and poked around for them sj used a makeshift spear to keep it away the bird angered squawked to its companions and several of the monstrous hornbills joined it they butted and slammed into the hut the walls shook its collapsing sj screamed everybody out as the last body squirmed out from underneath the buildings supports gave way an entire side collapsed and the rest of the building followed it down garners ran in all directions across the courtyard maibang fled from an attacking hombill he was too slow as its claws gripped his shoulders he screamed in pain and terror please help me the bird flexed mighty wings and pulled kasan into the air bowan gaped chester were losing the guide the hell we are gina bowan join hands with me maibangs thrashing feet brushed the roof of a hut hastily the three linked up and chester intoned solemnly we three meld strengths we three meld minds demon of the air we find blocked before and bound behind the hornbill reacted as if it had run into an invisible wall brown feathers flew as it beat its wings helplessly trying to escape the grip of three mighty wizards chester smiled with grim satisfaction return unharmed that which is ours and you may flee with your life thing of evil whooping with frustration the bird at last opened its claws and kasan fell buttfirst through the straw roof of a hut straw flew as if a bale of hay had exploded but when the dust had settled the guide limped into sight with a huge grin on his face he waved his hand and chester waved back screaming at him to lie low most of the remaining birds were wounded and dying acacia had finished one off by the roasting pit she gave it a shove with her foot her foot went right through it but a split second later the corpse rolled over and landed with a satisfying thump and a spray of embers and ashes the remaining hornbills were dispatched with a minimum of problem and soon all was quiet on the melanesian front natives emerged from their hiding places to see what the powerful strangers had wrought only a few of the daribi warriors had stayed to fight and several of these were dead chester raised his hand any fatalities how many injuries auras please everybody promptly glowed green except for eames whose wrist glowed scarlet and larry garret who had a scarlet glow all down his right leg what happened eames explained his own wound garret had been hit by a support when the hut collapsed chester sighed but seemed not totally dissatisfied okay weve got two minor casualties gwen you werent in that action so your energy should still be up lets have a reading on gwens healing aura and see if she can handle both wounds gwens green aura slowly shifted to a warm gold twinkling like a field of stardust good you heal them now and youll have a full recharge by morning right ches she raised one hand hear me gods the golden glow concentrated around her right hand then lashed out to bathe both wounds the red glows died how about that the gods can be right cooperative sometimes thanks gwen okay people weve only got a few minutes until closedown for the night good day everyone lots of points well get some treasure points tomorrow im pretty sure so you thieves and engineers dont worry everybody gets their share chester looked around until he spied kasan get over here maibang the little guide skipped over with a pranksters grin plastered across his face im not going to ask you how you managed the business with the bird i just want to know if gunpersons mind is snapped for good or what kasan managed to look serious grave damage yes very bad he has been helped to his resting place perhaps in the morning he will be able to help you but im afraid that he is dying and the mens council will not speak to you unless he recovers or dies in which case they may choose a new spokesperson who will decide whether or not to cooperate with you im afraid you are on your own now not quite my friend youre coming with us chester thought for a second then asked what about the womens council will they speak to us kasan seemed to ponder that yes yes they might but in the morning maibang noticed oliver with his arm around gwen he spoke sternly it is not proper for those of the opposite sex to sleep together before such an undertaking oliver was incredulous jeezuss were engaged it would not matter if you were married please if you do not follow the rules of our people the womens council may not aid you further they may forbid me to accompany you on your voyage chester waved deprecatingly at oliver go along with it all bets are off after eight anyway gwen hugged her man to her and whispered something in his ear he reddened noticeably and pecked her goodby and moved to join chester and the other men acacia took tonys hand it was cool and unresponsive she looked into his face with playful concern ill meet you by the banana tree hombre his lip curled with ill humor i thought i was supposed to stay out of troubler im only a thief after all she stepped back from him holding both of his hands and searched his eyes hey tony i was only trying to help you i was talking about the game fortunato he squeezed her hands back but there was little affection there yeah well you were so busy slaying dragons that i guess you didnt have time to notice that you were coming on a little strong i mean i might like to play too there was hurt in his voice and acacia didnt know what to say hey tony im sorry really listen he thrust outward with his hands and shook his head defensively file it cas ill be all right you just cant keep telling me to take everything seriously then suddenly tell me its just a game i didnt get to do a damn thing today alright i got to watch everybody else play hero while i lay with my face in the dirt i dont know what that would feel like to you but i felt pretty shitty airight he reached out and stroked her gently on the left cheek then turned and walked away acacia watched him go her mouth hanging open jaw working as if trying to find something anything to say words wouldnt come gwen tugged at her arm come on cas lets check out our bunk space numbly acacia nodded and followed one of the village women showed them to their hut gwen acacia and maryem laid their bedrolls down one side of the wovenreed flooring gina and felicia down the other acacia said nothing as she watched her mattress inflate a callused palm slapped her heartily across the back man problems maryem boomed cheerfully dont worry about your boyfriend honey hes just got first day jitters thats all it is just hunt him down after lightsout and give him a little bit to calm him down and hell be all right the little woman chucked her under the chin with a playful nudge that nearly lifted acacia from her feet but the darkhaired girl managed to keep smiling right mary right of course im right maryem sees all knows all you take it from me and she waddled away humming a verse from eskimo nell that dwelt on the amorous advantages of sixmonth nights acacia grinned in spite of herself and lay down on her bedroll gazing at the ceiling and waiting for closedown and approximately thirty seconds later without noise or fuss the natives outside the door turned transparent and faded gently away into the night chapter nine killed out albert rice unlocked the front door of the r d complex and stepped aside it was pm and rice had just twentytwo minutes to live his public smile was in place but ms metesky and the lopezes never saw it there was a bite in richards voice it may be that you dont quite realize just what threetenths of a seconds delay can do to the game the gamers and me welles and chicon are thoroughly competent ms metesky said placidly theyll have it fixed long before morning theyd better theyd drowning well better it wasnt my programming metesky that bird didnt drop right away and panthesilea had to stand there with her foot out in the middle of a battle and bowan had to repeat himself before he got his fireblast they passed outside thank you ms metesky said to rice and stepped after them adjusting her wirerimmed spectacles as she went frail hands trembling a bit from the cool air rice locked the door behind them as the door slid shut his smile faded like a happyface drawn in a puddle of mud he was thinking how could anyone give a damn about threetenths of a second anyway lopez was a cocky little shrimp who liked giving orders talked funny too prissily precise even when he was being nasty always excuse me do you think you could assist me with or may i have a tracking badge please id like to stretch my legs a bit and i dont want anyone to get nervous always with that phony politeness phony because the correct answer to every such question was yes sir time to start rounds rice hopped the elevator to the third floor and thumbprinted the tirneclock as soon as he stepped out on the third floor were many of the modelbuilding shops working in steel aluminum wood fiberglass styrofoam molded plastic and many more exotic materials the wizards of dream park designed in miniature the rides and attractions of the future structures first produced as computerdrawn holograms would one day become foamed steel or the absurdly delicatelooking carbon crystal fibers rice enjoyed the occasions when he worked the day shift and could look in on the shops hear and feel the vibrations of lathe and press and drill working their wonders smell the burntplastic tang from the molds as a new concept was given solid life but now the shops were empty the building deserted except for a few techs in game central on the second floor and a few of the late workers in the psych and engineering sections on the fifth he checked every door and peered down every hallway checking the shadows checking the nooks he remembered a tale about the niece of one of the lathe workers shed hidden in the building until after closeup then managed to get into one of the molding shops security found her five hours and twenty thousand dollars worth of damage later in the course of her spree she had somehow interfaced a roller coaster and a human anatomy model the results had been so interesting that it inspired the mr digestion ride sponsored by bristolmeyers in section i she ended up with a spanking and a college trust fund but a guard had lost his job corridors branched and split and rice followed them all checking every inch before he was confident enough to thumbprint the time clock clear and take the elevator to the second floor even while remaining cautious to check every cranny for security breaches he still took time to cakewalk he glided from side to side with graceful speed ducking imaginary blows cakewalk typical name griffin would give a fighting move strange man griffin tough but soft always encouraged gentleness in his men always wanted them to give the tourists the benefit of the doubt rice approached the vaultliko door of game centrals control room where the lopezes worked their magic he pressed his palms to the door then almost timidly his cheek he felt its metallic smoothness and the purring vibration from the machinery within he stood there for a while and whispered playing god his expression soft for a bare moment hardened to a frown and he walked on next to the control room was the dream park override where larry chicon and dwight welles supervised the technical data being fed into the dream park computer system this room had a shatterproof plastic window and in the interior dimness there twinkled a few tiny red and white lights next came the chamber where metesky and the other officials checked the events of the game to insure that all was conducted according to the rules of their crazy organization the hallway threw his footsteps after him as ho reached the last door and doubled back working during the day was good but rice liked the night too nobody around no oddballs to deal with plenty of time to think to remember if he dwelt on it rice could remember visiting dream park when he was ten years old how long ago that seemed twenty years seemed like eternity at the same time it seemed that he could reach out and touch the head of the little blond boy with the perennial sniffle and now he had grown up to work at the great illusion factory come with me little albert rice invited himself as he summoned the elevator come with me and peek behind the dreams see the computers and cameras see the gears and oilcloth and plastic struts that make th magic then squeeze the last tears out of your eyes mix liberally with the fractured fairy tales of youth and try to mold the resultant mess into an adult who can stand on his own and damn well fend for himself a flicker of a grin played on his mouth he could fend for himself he could fend himself right into a gravy job here at the play ground of the world there was room at the top for him for anybody who knew what cards to play dream parks business was lies and little albert knew all about lies some of them meshed so tightly together in the mists of years past that he could no longer separate them from reality illusions just why exactly was it that only his father had brought him to dream park daddy said that mommy was sick and had to go away for a while but there had been the one phone call in the motel room when his father screamed emma over and over into the telescreen and mothers face had been cool and distant until a mans voice in the background called her away daddy had cried into the darkening screen tears streaking his strong handsome face and when the tears dried he had taken young albert by the hand and the two of them had gone to dream park for the second day of a four day vacation the last three days of that vacation were more fun than any albert could remember except that down underneath the smiles and laughs he remembered a grown man crying into an empty screen illusions when the two of them returned home mother was there with kindness and warmth but afterward she was gone more frequently whether to go to the hospital a relatives or a job seminar the result was the same the aching loneliness he could feel emanating from his father like waves of heat one day albert came home from school and his father told him that mother was leaving for good and that the boy had to decide which of them he wanted to live with albert had opted for his f ather and within the space of six months watched a vibrant vital man become old and broken it wasnt hatred that he felt for his mother for her little gifts and concerned phone calls it wasnt resentment in a strange way he was almost glad that this thing had happened to the man he loved most in all the world young albert knew that he had learned an invaluable lesson that all there was in this world were lies and dreams and that was just the way it was thanks mom he stepped out of the elevator at the first floor and stiffened almost immediately something what a sound yes a sound the last hiccough of an echo in the hail and rice became very cautious rice looked both ways down the hail and saw nothing he toyed with the idea of calling it in had he really heard anything walls do settle in an old building the hall was perfectly quiet but rice relaxed only slightly he walked out almost on tiptoe and turned left toward the secretarial pool passing a mirrored light panel he was almost amused to see a slightly crouched shape the semisnarl on his lips somehow incongruous beneath the soft blond hair no sound nothing nuts he made himself check the doors on the ground floor office space mostly and easier to clear past the administrative section there were some ffling closets but nothing valuable really he glanced at his watch nine twentyseven and eighteen minutes until the next checkin time for a little break past the filing cabinets was the first floor break room with sandwiches coffee and a few small tables rice let himself in and flicked on the light oh yes there was a new soft drink dispenser he pushed his cowles industries charge card into the slot and punched the lemonade button an eight ounce plastic pouch dropped into his hand it felt cold and shapeless like liver straight out of a meat drawer rice preferred bottles or cans he worked the nipple loose and took a long swig as the arm fastened around his neck lemonade sprayed from his mouth and choked in his throat the arm tightened rice gagged doubling up lemonade running from his nose and down his face his hands flailing ineffectually he forced his head to the side getting his throat into the crook of his attackers elbow so that the strangling forearm no longer crushed his windpipe then he fought an elbow to his assailants gut followed by an identical blow to the other side which brought a satisfying whoof of painfully expelled air but instead of letting go the attacker jumped up and wrapped both legs around rices waist from behind squeezing the ribs until they creaked rice felt his sight wavering and threw himself backward trying to smash a head between himself and the floor there was a grunt and the pressure eased as they both hit the floor rice clawed at the strangling arm gasping a precious lungful of air with renewed strength he punched back over his shoulder and felt his fist graze flesh encouraged now he punched and elbowed until the grip began to give then braced himself and started to rise to his knees if he could do that he could gain the leverage to throw his weight back against the edge of a table he made it to one knee and was moving his right into position when his knee landed squarely on the pouch of lemonade it popped open and he skidded on the wet losing all balance to tumble facefirst back on the floor his attacker landed in the middle of his back driving the remaining air front tortured lungs bellydown on the floor and thrashing rice felt a strong forearm slide back across his throat another arm clamped across the back of the neck for added pressure bleeding darkness boiled up around and within him but with an enormous effort of will he pushed the ink clouds back and got one arm under himself he began to push with arms drained of strength his lungs aflame and his temples throbbing a bass beat of pain he tried to scream to hiss dry croaking rattled in his throat as his vision blackened and he heard his own thoughts as a faraway call ohmygod ohgod please just one more sip one spoonful of air please please get bobbick here now griffin spat it at melone the pudgy guard who worked the top three floors of the r d building melone backed out of the room he was glad of an excuse to leave he had never seen a dead man before and rice was inarguably dead a hologram might have shown an unconscious man gagged and bound hand and foot but to share the same space with rice was to feel the presence of death it lay still and muggy in the air his eyes were closed head crumpled to the side like the head of a doll blond hair somehow reminiscent of a wig fitted to a mannequin griffin stooped for a closer look rices hands had been tied behind his back no correct that his wrists bad been bandaged together with surgical tape and his thumbs bad been bandaged separately tape had been wrapped twice around the ankles more tape covered his mouth rice sat with his back against the soft drink machine head slumped to his knees griffin gently took rices shoulder and eased him upright there was a shallow indentation in the thin metal precisely where rices head would have been were rice sitting up griffin jumped reflexively as footsteps entered the room sony boss did i millicent summers winced at the sight of the dead man hes dead millie listen i called you and marty because fm going to need some extra eyes and ears okay she nodded jerkily i want the cmc doctor over here in fifteen minutes i want a complete security sweep of the building i want to know about anything unusual going on in the line of projects theres the game in gaming a gruff her eyes were fixed on rice and he could tell she was fighting to remain calm griffin felt a certain bizarre satisfaction in finally finding an hour when millie wasnt totally awake and alert right millie i jieed to know if anything has been tampered with or if any security seals have been breached i dont think whoever did this really wanted to kill rice if im right it was supposed to be theft so thats where we start milhicent nodded again her eyes still watching rices corpse get going hon gruff said gently ill handle things here she tried to smile the result was hideous she gave up and backed out of the room griffin heard her break into a run in the hallway griffin examined the room trying to reconstruct events clearly rice had lost a fight here knowing the guards wiry strength griffin thought he must have been taken by surprise that could mean several things being jumped from behind attempting to restrain an intruder of unexpectedly high physical skills whatever chairs had been knocked over there was a halfdried puddle of lemonade near rices feet his right knee was stained a mental replay of rices file was in order years old blond lbs exnavy man submarine service spent six years there and left with an honorable discharge two years of college then three years of odd jobs and finally cowles industries both parents alive mother somewhere in minnesota father an out patient at a geriatric center fairly well liked but didnt socialize except for the company mixers at cmc griffin sat down on one of the undisturbed chairs he rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands wasnt there something else oh yes his apartment in cowles modular community had been vandalized he had declared no losses and no investigation had followed perhaps bobbick is onhis way chief melone was back face reddened as if with exertion his eyes studiously avoided the corpse against the soft drink machine right you stay here until marty arrives have him coordinate a report for me the legal department needs in on this griffin scratched the wiry fuzz under his jaw i need to check into some thing but i think an emergency meeting should be set up with harmony buzz me whenever thats ripe would you ohi know i dont need to tell you but i will anyway dont touch anything thats been disturbed griffins mind projected a quick layout diagram of the r d center as he waited for the elevator there had been a complete security check on all of the alarm units only the week before griffin had participated he knew that it had been thorough and accurate it would take hours to check over each unit for traces of bypass or tampering and he would have those results by morning but there was one possibility that he could investigate right now it was a long shot but griffin had long since learned to check into those little nagging doubts the elevator took him down to the basement when the door opened a night light came on alex flipped on the main lights there was no sound except the hum of generators low in the background griffin walked to the stairwell moving between rows of storage boxes and plasticwrapped maintenance gear he stooped at the door of the stairwell checking the lock there were no external signs of damage or tampering but a check of the record tape would tell him if the magneticallyencoded lock had been opened within the past few hours with the right kind of careful preparation a thief need not have forced the lock he crossed to the service shaft on the other side of the room it was three feet from the ground and sealed with a circular steel door he climbed the short ladder that led to it and examined the surface of the door there were a few smudges but maintenance personnel had been through the tunnels during the days gaming in fact substantial restructuring of gaming area a was going on right now but the men and machines performing those tasks would be brought in through one of the environment domes side panels but this tunnel griffin flipped out his wallet and tapped it on patch me through to maintenance please there was a moments buzz during which griffin turned up the collar of his light jacket the basement was chilly a beep sounded and a womans voice came on line yes mr griffin how can we help you i want records of all egress and entry into gaming area a service shaft um he glanced at the yellow numbers stencilled above the portal eighteen it leads into the research and development building g a right one moment please while the line was dead griffin found himself hoping that he was wrong how could they have overlooked this it was inexcusable and understandable at the same time why guard against garners he knelt by the base of the stairs and looked carefully there were definite smudges of dirt and a tiny shaving of green leaf mr griffin here g a was used once today at pm griffin held his breath what was the reason pressure check in sector twelve apparently thats one of the lines that feeds the artificial lake then there was no need for the technician to go topside no i dont believe so theres a game on right now you know all of the work was accomplished in the tunnels right griffin thought quickly weighing factors when that technician comes in in the morning please have him verify that he signed off and folded wallet and transceiver away he looked again at the smudge the steps like every other accessible inch of the park were cleaned daily the smudge must be recent probably a foot had descended on this ladder in the last few hours griffin checked his watch eleventwenty rice had been found at ten past ten twentyfive minutes after he missed his checkin and where would an intruder find dirt and leaves to step in anyway bet on it these would be brazilian plant life an elevator took griffin back to the first floor the cmc doctor had arrived a tall thin man who ordinarily wore a warm smile now he wore a rumpled and hastilydonned shirt jammed into what could pass for trousers but looked suspiciously like pajama bottoms dr novotney alex said in sober greeting the thin man said griffin listen i cant do much here ill have to take the body to my lab to learn anything we cant move him until the county coroner comes or the police clear it is that right griffin scratched his head i think we can handle this dream park is an independent municipality and i have the authority to clear it were going to have to deal with the county but im betting that harmony will want us to keep this as close to the chest as possible weve got the pictures gruff marty bobbick said what a mess griffin was glad he was here bobbick would see that things got done if griffin had to get off by himself to think things out a nervous tick made bobbicks pleasantly ugly face squint every time his eyes passed over rices body he chewed a mouthful of gum with nearmanic intensity as griffin talked we need prints thereve been too many people in and out of here for a heat scan to do much good but try it anyway i want all the record tapes collated somebody wanted something in this building i want to know what it was maybe the development people can tell us get hold of somebody who knows what the hell theyre about and tell him to join me when i meet with harmony marty nodded his square jaw pumping up and down with nervous rhythm got most of that covered already millies on the record tape right now and the infrared equipment should be here any minute he counted off tasks to himself and came up satisfied guess thats it for right now then except for moving rice ah you want him over at cmc no take him to the park medical center better facilities there check with the legal department and find out if we can do an autopsy if its needed rice was being carefully loaded onto a stretcher two guards hoisted him away and bobbick watched the sheetcovered body go with pained eyes hell of a thing he said softly yeah griffin agreed a hell of a thing chapter ten neutral scent griffin managed to catch a couple of hours sleep before his scheduled meeting with harmony his office couch was uncomfortably soft but it was better than tubing back to his apartment for a mere catnap afterward he shaved and washed his face in his office lavatory the face in the mirror was a strangers the green eyes the closecropped black hair the massive shoulders the twoinch scar under the left ear these he knew but the vulnerable look made it a strangers face murder made a difference there had been deaths at dream park coronaries strokes a drug overdose or two and even a few genuine weirdies like the kid who somehow managed to drown in thirtysix inches of quicksand in the treasure island game a couple of years back but never a murder never he remembered the stillness of rices face the tangible aura of death that had touched everyone who came into the room not here not at dream park things like that didnt happen here but they do and it has even here you can die and us in your lap now he told the frightened stranger he checked the strangers shirt for nonexistent wrinkles and checked his sleeve for the time am five minutes to get there griffins office was on the second floor of the administration complex a ten story building in the exact center of dream park standing on an island in the middle of the central lagoon that connected the wedges of the dream park pie harmony was on the sixth the halls on the sixth floor were empty but for a single forlorn maintenance bot whirring almost inaudibly as it sucked up dust griffin let himself into the outer office past the empty reception desk and knocked on harmonys door a radio announcers voice called for him to enter the dream park director of operations could easily have demanded an office on the eight or ninth floors among the luxury suites he preferred to be within easy reach of his staff the office was not impressive from the outside inside it was a delight the outer wall was all window above a magnificent view of the lagoon and sections i and ii of dream park the room was highceilinged and carpeted with natural fiber best of all and the thing that made it such a pleasure to visit most of the furniture was made of beautiful expensive delicately stained wood the mahogany desk was massive and so was the man behind it harmony must have weighed two hundred and thirty pounds only about twenty of it fat he was in his late fifties balding and wore inappropriately delicate pincenez his nose was flat enough to bring water to a plastic surgeons eye and his shoulders had that linebacker look to them only the voice betrayed the image of overwhelming physicality griffin glad to see you the tones were cultured in the extreme every word lovingly rounded as if shattering the bruiser image were an old and favorite game harmony reached across the desk to shake griffins hand with crushing strength have a seat please we should probably wait for obrien skips in on this oh right we need some tech assistance harmony successfully stifled a yawn shaking his head damnable hour to roust someone from bed but as long as we had to do it we might as well spread a little of the grief around eh alex laughed and looked out of the window absently it was still too dark to see anything out there and he found himself hoping the meeting would last until dawn came to dream park albert rice harmony was saying blond fellow thats the one was he a good man he was reliable and intelligent he was up for a desk job if his psych profile fit the bill my guess is that he would have been working over here in a year or two harmony clucked softly seems to happen like that much too often well this whole thing is a mess alex it puts cowles industries into a rather sensitive position and im not sure of the best way to handle it how much have your people learned just what you already know the target was a storage area on the third floor it may have been something in development for one or more of the new attractions the whole thing appears to be a case of industrial spying gone sour skip obrien opened the door good morning he said then shook his head i guess theres not much good about it is there he carried a loaded briefcase to the unoccupied chair i got together as much information as i could on short notice alex are you sure that that was the only cabinet disturbed absolutely the record tapes on the locks all say that the action happened between ninethirty and tenfifteen the door to the little biochemistry lab in development on the third floor was opened at about nineforty the project file had been rifled and we believe that a sample vial of some sort may have been stolen oh my it was all that skip said but he cracked open his briefcase and began to run notes through a small viewscreen when he looked up there were little worry lines creasing his f orehead i dont think that you have to tell me which file it was and the corresponding sample vial was missing was the ifie designation neutral smell alex nodded how did you know if you spent your time in r d youd know the talk there was only one thing in there that might have inspired a theft like this it was sent down from the big cowles facility in sacramento really secret this was only the second sample weve received no offense to you alex but they were worried that something like this might happen they dont have to worry about garners and tourists so their security is tighter anyway if someone was after that file then he was hunting very large game indeed poor rice got caught in the middle he paused preoccupation unfocusing his eyes i hope that whatever information i can give you helps you catch the bastard griffin jumped a bit at that he couldnt remember ever having heard skip curse obrien noticed he said unhappily if i hadnt recommended him rice might still be alive alex was a handspan too far away for a comforting touch so he tried to put softness in his voice he needed a job skip he wasnt your responsibility just another exstudent of yours and you helped him i dont think hed blame you for the way things turned out maybe not maybe he wouldnt i dont like it anyway none of us do skip harmony told him so lets have what youve got itll clear the air and might even enable us to catch the bastard as you so neatly put it right skip fiddled with the viewer until he seemed satisfied some of this is going to be a bit thick but ill try to hold the pidgin swahili down to a minimum harmony leaned back in his chair and steepled his fingers eyes half closing griffin crossed one leg over the other and canted forward dream park deals in illusions both subtle and gross gross effects include physical constructions holograms most of the sound effects and so forth subtleties are mainly concerned with the results of combining different stimuli in the attractions the manipulation of time and space in the waiting areas et cetera basically then placing the customer in a proper mood to correctly interpret the gross effects without the immersion period immediately preceding a ride or experience the illusion isnt as convincing this is old stuff the disneyland people used to use waiting time to prepare the customer psychologically at any rate as we learned more about the subconscious effects of various elements of dream park we began to wonder if a more direct manipulation of the subconscious might be a fruitful area for study since we only want to use those techniques within the attractions themselves we didnt have to worry about the existing statutes covering subliminal advertising skip showed them his first real smile since entering the office some of it was almost absurdly easy once we set our minds to it we started with sounds some frequencies in the subsonic range are well known to stimulate uneasiness or fear we started with the buzzing sound that angry bees make when we were satisfied that we could produce fear response in more than eighty percent of our test subjects we went on from there highspeed light flashes were even more effective in the early days such techniques could only be used on people watching pro jection screens or billboards flashing a message lasting for only hundredths of a second our holographic projection techniques take us far beyond that we can broadcast separate images to two people standing side by side effectiveness with this technique isnt where we would like itonly about sixty percent right nowbut the flexibility is enormous he looked up from his viewscreen folding the lid of his briefcase down he had been speaking distractedly as if one part of his mind were collating information while the other part related it to them human beings have four basic kinds of sensory receptors electromagnetic mechanoreceptors thermoreceptors and chemoreceptors the rods and cones of the eye are electromagnetic receptors mechanoreceptors respond to touch pressure et cetera for instance the eardrums are mechanoreceptors they respond to the pressure of sound waves thermoreceptors are free nerve endings sensitive to heat and cold weve done work in each of these areas with the promise of more to come we had trouble with chemoreceptors taste buds the cells of the carotid and aortic bodies the olfactory cells of the nose we couldnt do much with those so naturally that was where we concentrated our efforts griffin drummed his fingers on the arms of his chair and cleared his throat i take it that whatever was stolen was a result of these efforts obrien looked sheepish am i going on too much i thought some background would be useful go ahead skip there might be something valuable in even the trivia kay our problems were manyfold accuracy of the effect harmlessness of the chemical agent undetectability means of distribution et cetera we made an abortive effort to trigger the olfactory nerves with sound but it just wont work the receptors respond only to chemicals the potential is tremendous gentlemen the olfactory nerves are the only ones that connect directly to the brain the medial olfactory lobe seems to be involved with the limbic system in the expression of emotion there is believed to be a pleasure center located there as i said the olfactory cells need a chemical to trigger them what they are actually are bipolar nerve cells originating from the central nervous system itself when one is triggered it becomes depolarized which causes a battery effect and a current flows voila a nervous impulse present theory holds that the molecular shape rather than the chemical properties of a substance determines its smell on the basis of this theory seven different primary classes of odor have been established camphoraceous musky floral pepperminty ethereal pungent and putrid of course these can be combined what we theorized is that there are neutral scents scents which trigger depolarization in the olfactory nerves without any conscious sensation of smell if we could find the molecular shape which accomplishes this we would be on our way how many different kinds of response were you hoping to get harmony asked from behind his peaked fingers eyes still deceptively lidded we werent sure nausea salivation sexual behavior and sexual behavior everybody triggers on that one yes sexual behavior as f at back as the s two chemicals copulin and androsterone were found to be sexual signals in monkeys and to some extent in human beings humans have a more complex set of factors h volved in attraction than animals many of them are social in nature and no chemical yet discovered can really make up your mind for you he grinned but were trying obrien extracted a cigarette from his inside coat pocket and lit it with an unsteady hand at a glance from griffin harmony unob trusively turned on a tiny fan in the ceiling and skips smoke vanished into it what we did he began again was to use an advanced version of a device called an electroolfactograph which registers electrical impulses in the olfactory nerves we finally found a substance that causes depolarization without conscious recognition of scent at any concentration what was the chemical i couldnt give you the formula alex i dont know it myself i can say that it was a highly volatile lipidsoluble chemical with saline as the carrying agent once we had that the work really began it was really incredible this was all about seven months ago since that time ive heard that sacramento has variants that will induce tears laughter reflex vomiting sleep even something suspiciously like agape brotherly love god only knows what theyll come up with when they really know what theyre doing at any rate they sent over a sample for us to test that and accompanying data im afraid that is most probably the target of our burglary alex asked the question what does this batch do skip turned his palm briefly to the ceiling not sure that was why they sent us the sample they felt that our proximity to dream park might give us some additional testing options preliminary testing indicates that it is a general emotion intensifier if this is true and it is a substance as totally harmless as all preliminary testing indicates it is an incalculably valuable advantage over our competition the theft of the sample and of the printed matter breaks us wide open he folded his hands in his lap thats most of it harmony sat up in his chair and turned to griffin well alex what do you think i think i was right industrial espionage how many people knew the stuff was here skip maybe five myself included perhaps twice that many in sacramento thanks you saved me my second question theres a leak thats for sure whether its electronic or human i cant say now with twice the people knowing it in sacramento it might be twice as likely for the leak to originate there it would be a neat trick to wait until a sample is transferred here then again it doesnt take a genius to see why id rather believe that theory he sighed well its happened i dont believe the damage is irreversible harmonys ears perked up why i dont think that the thief has left the scene yet obrien seemed troubled the building was searched if the thief didnt leave the building he must be one of us the security men the psychology staff and whoever else was here a small group from engineering was still on the fifth right we were all routinely searched so the stuff wasnt on any of us physically but that doesnt help it could be hidden in the building might be and were checking on that griffin nodded arranging his thoughts i dont think thats it though i found some traces in the basement of r d that suggest that the thief came into the building from gaming area a that is the weakest link in our defenses we have excellent protection on all outer perime ters but between gaming a and the basement he shrugged the garners are so out of touch with reality that they were never considered a serious threat but the thief used surgical bandage garners carry medical kits skip how long ago did the sample arrive three weeks griffin tsked discontentedly maybe still better yet skip how long before that was it known that a shipment was to be made at least another month thats the margin for error we need that gives plenty of time for the information to reach our competitors time for them to research our defenses after they found our weak spot they looked for a game that was running at the right time after that find the aah right the lore master being challenged get the names of the people hes likely to choose and make your approach from that list complicated but with seven weeks lead time not impossible what exactly do you see as the sequence of events here alex there were oceans of tension crackling just beneath the superficial calm of harmonys voice at approximately nine oclock last night one of the garners in gaming a broke away from the others and headed toward the northwest corner of the research and development complex staying clear of any workmen renovating the gaming area this person entered a service duct and gained access to the lower level of the complex he reached the first floor by stairs or elevator rice blocked his path so he rendered rice unconscious with a sleeper hold of some kind probably an air or blood strangle theyre easier than nerve strangles rice was tied and gagged and our intruder completed his business with no further trouble rices death was accidental id think so would you bind and gag a dead man the important thing is that the killer is still in the game if we move now we can collect them all before morning and begin questioning harmony raised a single thick finger there are several problems inherent in this situation first of all we cannot detain these people against their wills without involving outside law enforcement agencies they would demand to see their attorneys and in such a meeting information concerning the drug could change hands if the thief becomes aware that we know hes a gamer before we know which gamer it is the drug could be hidden anywhere in the seven hundred and forty acres of the gaming area it may already be stashed away and we might never find it then there is the game itself to consider we stand to lose a good deal of money if the drug escapes our control but we also stand to lose approximately he consulted a figure scrawled on his deskpad one point five million dollars of our money already invested in the south seas treasure game not to mention an estimated twentytwo million in revenue over the next eight years if film book programming and holotape leasing and sales go according to estimations harmonys voice dropped a bit frankly theres another problem you are both aware that our water rights and tax privileges are coming up for review next year if we can isolate our suspect before we call in the authorities well be that much further ahead without investigating teams crawling over us what are you suggesting im not totally sure i need to think about this and well need to consult the ifgs i believe that the game lasts four more days then thats how long we have before it becomes necessary to call in outside help i believe our legal department can negotiate us that much time alex please meet me back here at nine oclock in he consulted his watch three and a half hours you may or may not like my idea but i think it may be for the best chapter eleven game plan the world around alex griffin blurred like dreams then sharpened to nearreality as bobbick and millicent fiddled with the focus of the hologram projector griffin found himself in the living room of an apartment at the cowles modular community the apartments were almost infinitely maleable to the tastes of the occupants windows builtin accessories raised or lowered ceilings or additional rooms were no problem even entire living units could be moved into varying clusters with a minimum of difficulty griffins own apartment presently included a small gym a large librarystudy and a sundeck overlooking one of the starburstshaped pools he didnt recognize this one what have we got here mifficent its rices apartment gruff bobbick answered chewing the end of a pen griffin restrained a snort chewing gum pens fingernails bobbick always seemed to have something in his mouth he wondered idly if the mans oral compulsion bad anything to do with his popularity in the secretarial pool the viewpoint backed away from the fireplace for an overall view of rices living room the gas burning fireplace was brickencased and raised a foot above the livingroom rug which was light brown and hightufted there were two shelves of books and what looked like a microcube reader to the right with wrought iron spider bookends the other wall was a picture window the scene blurred sharpened kitchen when were these taken this was about a month ago standard shots for our designers to study weve been wondering if the vandalism in rices apartment was all coincidence millie hesitated then plunged ahead its an awful thing to think boss but since rice wasnt shifted to the night schedule until after the vandalism well it just seemed kind of strange to us thats all we thought wed look a little closer thats all rice didnt report anything stolen where did that thought lead could rice have been involved in the neutral scent affair if he wanted to change shifts he could have done it with a simple request that might have been suspicious so he had a confederate set off the alarm while too much too complicated and too grotesque but not impossible all right he said at last just keep me posted on any developments i need to think for a while let me know when dr novotney comes up with anything will you millicent and bobbick acknowledged and went back to their viewings griffin let himself into his office and plopped into his chair without bothering to turn the lights on he leaned back and put his feet up on his desk they want me to handle this he mused i wonder what harmony will come up with i wonder if the legal department can buy us the time we need in the middle of a game one of the players had departed and returned unnoticed what kind of garner would do that possibly for the first time in his life alex wished he knew more about the games the thief would have to have some experience though enough to be able to find that extra time that opportunity to count on it ideally he would have played one or more games in gaming area a itself itd be in their records alex had seen rice twice in the two or three days preceding the burglary accident murder call it accident for the moment rice had called in the vandalism fortyeight hours ago about thirtysix hours ago alex had seen him for the last time hauling luggage for the lopezes what were his last words ill see you later chief right rice griffin rubbed his eyes tried to remember rice had thrown a housewarming party four months after coming to cowles industries a fairly drab affair with tons of officialissue smiles and politely inebriated people acting mildly scandalous there had been a few moments of genuine hilarity notably millie and one of the maintenance techs singing a duet of baby its cold outside with the male and female roles reversed there had also been a tiny tiff of some kind between who had it been rice and some buyer from costuming over something or other couldnt remember griffins eyes kept wanting to close without permission he shook his head to wake himself up he was losing the battle when the intercom buzzed griffin he said automatically we may have found something chief could you step out here for a minute millicents voice had perked out of its lethargy right somewhat to his own surprise alex was on his feet instantly he walked from his office into another shot of rices living room what have you got bobbick rotated the view three hundred and sixty degrees there are a few minor changes in this shot oh this holo was made about three hours ago rice cleaned up whatever mess had been made remember that he insisted on handling it all himself said there was nothing missing that may have been a fib millie would you put on the other shot reality blurred then an almost identical picture colored the air this is a shot taken a month ago see that statue bobbick pointed out a simple but very attractive statuette a meter tall it was of a nude woman reclining on crumpled cloth her face a graceful oval the statue isnt in the later shot it isnt for an instant griffin was uninterested then sud denly he remembered the argument at rices party with that lady from costuming mrs kokubun millie sounded positive she really wanted to buy it from him made him a good offer too right griffin remembered now he begged off for some reason or other didnt he make the statue himself something about the last relic of a misspent youth its nowhere in sight now millicent said we looked maybe it was broken bobbick murmured could be why wouldnt he make an insurance claim then he had a roomful of witnesses who could verify that he was offered a stiff price for it if it was destroyed by the vandal no bobbick interrupted i mean maybe it fell over accidentally hmmm i see what you mean its fairly low to the floor on that shelf but i could see it happening its a horizontal motif though so it wouldnt be easy to just knock it over if it did fall probably wouldnt shatter not in that carpet its worth looking into griffin looked at his watch eightfifty he smacked his palm to his forehead in mortification i didnt even know id fallen asleep let me wash my face ive got to be back in harmonys office in ten minutes well done people keep looking and he disappeared into his office while millie and bobbick counted softly to each other at the count of thirty griffin exploded out still pulling on his coat and was gone there was an ironhaired woman in harmonys office it took alex a moment to place her ms metesky he said with an unconscious bowing motion he took the chair next to her nodded his greeting to harmony where are we harmony brooded before answering alex im still not sure how this is going to hit you if its a good one ill go with it alex crossed his legs and sat back all right lets see how much trouble im in it goes like this until the south seas treasure game breaks up we have all our suspects in one place they dont know that weve narrowed our search to gaming a our legal department has notified me that we can proceed on our own initiative as long as all suspects are made available for questioning after the game is over ms metesky understands the severity of the situation and has already spoken to the lopezes concerning my proposal to save the game they have consented to what an ironic smile tugged at the corners of harmonys mouth and his voice was more soothing than ever i want you to join the game alex it is scheduled to last another three days and some hours we hope that in that time you can identify the killer and perhaps even find the missing sample of course youll get special compensation for this unusual duty but im sure that the main attraction will be the chance to handle the situation ourselves oh brother still crazy as it sounded it sounds better than just turning it over to the state police i never liked that harmony was delighted his face and hands became animated to the point of nervous tic good good well insert you into the game as dream parks optional player in this context your f antasy identity is more important than a cover story about your outside life and well have one drawn up for you the lopezes will keep us informed of their game plan and so well know where and when to insert you into the game hopefully within the first few hours of todays play metesky you work for us so i expected youd approve our request how did the ifgs representative react myers didnt like it he felt that the game was more important than as he put it and meteskys voice became an unexpectedly and wickedly accurate imitation of myers painfully precise diction a little petty thievery he hardly seemed to understand the importance of solving the crime she looked down at her folded hands as she said when theyve been at this too long they forget that dying can cost you more than points maybe thats just what some people want to forget in any case she looked up myers agreed to extend the sanction of the ifgs after i guaranteed minimum disruption of the game and threatened to close the game instantly if he didnt so the game is on afoot griffin said softly im going to need a briefing on gamesmanship although i assume lopez wont be trying to kill me off but metesky was shaking her head her gray locks rippling around her shoulders im afraid thats out of the question you will have the same chance of being killed out of the game as any other player to conduct this in any other way would be disrup tive to the game as well as a dead giveaway to the other players you will play as a novice and well give you a set of characteristics that will serve you fairly well the rest will be up to you if you are forced out of the game i imagine well have to shut it down at once the fantasy gaming society will withdraw their sanction if there is any tampering with the odds of a game and the lopezes wont run it without ifgs support so there you have it just great i have to stay in the game and solve the crime at the same time he closed his eyes tightly im going to need a transceiver to stay in touch with my staff any new developments might be more than professionally interesting harmony seemed confused what do you mean by that he couldnt really have missed that point could he alex said weve been assuming that rice died by accident if he didnt or even if he did and our thief becomes aware that hes being hunted for murder well i could lose more than experience points griffin seemed on the brink of saying more then shook his head and stood up its ninethirty now so the games been going for ninety minutes already i think id better get ready where do i go from here gaming central for costuming and briefing as soon as lopez makes a kill we will insert you into the game harmony pushed himself up from his chair and shook griffins extended hand good luck alex were counting on you alex waited until the office door had closed behind to release a soft amazed whistle of all the cockamamie ideas ive ever heard then that one moment of doubt voiced and behind him he headed for the elevator his mind filled with variables and unknowns chapter twelve overview myers was adamant his little black eyes focused down to points all right the snake was justified i still say that the bird attack was uncalled for beyond anticipation and possibly a nonorganic part of the game structure you are building richard lopez regretfully pulled his attention away from the game secure in the knowledge that mitsuko could cover any problems listen myers i run my lames by the book melanesian magic is naturalistic what i mean by that is that its structure is designed to explain natural phenomena crop shortages disease weather peculiarities luck in hunting and so forth they explain all of this with a series of myths concerning gods and spirits some of them were once men or animals but in dying they became operative on a higher plane human beings gain power through wealth knowledge age social position or the help of spirits now pigibidi was the most respected elder in the village and therefore a powerful magician clearly the village is under assault by unnamed enemies clearly the enemy is skilled in sorcery pigibidi an old man went into a dancing frenzy intended to impress the visiting wizards and warriors he pushed himself too far and weakened himself physically and that weakened his psychic powers as well he himself formed one of the most formidable barriers against outside attack when he passed out the daribi became vulnerable the rest of it follows from that myers was unimpressed and you think that henderson should have followed that line of reasoning not at all lopez said in a voice he usually reserved for children how many people were killed in that attack myers frowned none of the gaming party but no buts how many were seriously wounded none but i dont see youre supposed to see dammit myers dont you find it unusual that there wasnt even a serious wound among the whole lot it was a warmup henderson needed an opportunity to blood his group and i need to teach him some of the rules of my universe dont worry when the real fireworks start any nasties i come up with will have clear precedent in prior game encounters there will be no valid protests from mr henderson i think lopez turned back to his console as he did mitsuko visibly relaxed at her controls they each had their own keyboard and individual sets of foot controls for the viewfields within easy reach were additional controls that regulated conditions in the control room itself at the moment a single hologram floated above and slightly in front of the central control board it was the daribi village all of the garners were present and packed to go the council of elders was present along with the blanketswaddled pigibidi richard cocked his head and mitsuko nudged a sliding indicator and the sound rose to audible levels leaving now henderson was saying to gunperson he seemed chipper and alert maibang was at his elbow wearing khaki shorts and shirt and carrying a backpack pigibidi a sickly figure nursed by two young attendants spoke a string of unintelligible words filled with long vowels maibang translated he says that he is dying he must tell you something that he feared to say before chester pursed his lips speculatively cant his enemies get to him in the hereafter lopez immediately bent forward and whispered into the goosenecked microphone projecting from the top of his keyboard tell him that pigibidis ancestors are strong enough to protect his spirit if not his body maibang scratched his ear although the powers of our departed ancestors are limited upon this plane they assure the soul of pigibidi a welcome resting place among the heroes in life he fears only for the village in death he needs fear nothing i see mitsuko diddled a dial and pigibidis face broke out in a sheen of sweat he was in obvious torment saliva drooled from the corner of the wrinkled mouth and when he coughed there was a deepseated moistness to it that was decidedly unpleasant he tried to sit up and the two young men helped him his mouth framed words in english you find find them they fore there was a gasp from the assembled villagers and pigibidis body shook as if a string of firecrackers was exploding in his stomach chester henderson called to the other garners do not say that word dont mumble it dont whisper it we cant use that word during game time his attendants tried to steady pigibidi but they could do nothing their leader howled in torment his eyes rolled back into his head until they were glistening white orbs shot with red and yellow he bit through his lower lip blood trickled down his chin someone whose back was to the camera pointed an unsteady hand at the dying pigibidis abdomen it was collapsing from within as it did the trickle of blood became a torrent his muscles locked in a final spasm and he was dead a mournful wailing fflled the air the villagers began falling to their knees to clutch at the dirt in sorrow kasan maibang remained standing his dark face darker still with pain and rage this will be avenged the spirit forces of our enemy have eaten gunpersons liver but we shall slay them to the man he raised his arms in invocation voice quavering with holy wrath hear me men of the daribi these brave and powerful strangers come to fight our fight for us they will need bearers guides and friends who among you will come with us to help mitsuko leaned to her mike lets not get too dramatic harvey just say the lines maibang scratched his ear doing a good job of hiding a grin mrs lopez covered the microphone and giggled myers asked harvey harvey wayland isnt he good i found him in a student production of illuminatus at usc eleven years ago we use him as often as we can in the projection field three strong young men had joined the ranks of the gamers they were dressed in native garb of woven fiber chester was questioning maibang but as if he already suspected the answers why the birds last night why did pigibidi die like that we are in a continuous battle against the forces of our foes maibang explained the elders of our people are our first line of defense gunperson was our greatest power when age and exhaustion sapped his strength the barrier was breached chester nodded and the liver what could do that some kind of worm no very bad thing izibidi ghost people ghosts bidi suffix means person or people chester was talking to himself his voice rose to more audible levels our enemies can control the spirits of their dead maibang shook his head not control they are allies they cooperate do the spirits of your dead cooperate with you they may if the call is strong enough i have the knowledge but not the power then well get along fine we have the power and fm getting the knowledge a little piece at a time hendersons voice was drifting away again and ginas hand on his shoulder pulled him out of it right hon all right lets clear out of here before something uncuddly pops up maryem i want you up front with me offie and bowan in the rear the rest of you eyes open i think the gloves are off the troop shouldered their packs and with a last backward glance at pigibidis hideously twisted body moved off in an orderly line as soon as they were out of sight mitsukos private viewscreen flashed to a patch of jungle where the garners were coming into view richards screen stayed with the village at a flick of his finger pigibidis body the two retainers and the silent elders vanished he spoke into the mike attention this portion of the game is over those of you who are scheduled for the agaiambo sequence should report to makeup immediately the rest of you thank you for excellent performances the two dozen native men women and children gave themselves a round of applause silent electric trains buzzed through the underbrush and workmen bustled out to dismantle the village about half the actors got onto trams which moved them quickly away some of the others began walking others waited for the second run the holo dissolved and richard lopez spun around in his chair to face myers our first chance to kill somebody comes in about forty minutes weve got to get them closer to the swamp first he drummed his fingers against each other you know ive got this game stocked with some of the nastiest surprises weve ever come up with but this is too much like murder somehow i dont like it theres no reason for you to feel like that myers was soothing accidents those with positive or negative results are always part of every game if the odds are shifted a bit this time another player will have the advantage of the counterbalancing good luck i promise that the game wont suffer richard looked at the bald man curiously official nitpicker of the ifgs that you are myers im surprised that you agreed to this screwing about at all let alone as calmly as this he fingered his small beard reflectively last year when henderson threw a tantrum about a few little snow vipers you were the first one to start waving the rule book in my face screaming infraction when i was cleared of any fouling you were instrumental in forcing me into a facetoface with the aforementioned lore master in the interest of fair play why are you now playing lap dog for dream park myers purpled a bit and mitsuko threw her husband a worried glance myers said shall i call ms metesky and tell her that you find dream parks terms unacceptable she would halt the game immediately of course this would be inconvenient and embarrassing to all concerned and i might add expensive to you exactly how much of your personal capital is invested in the south seas treasure game a lot lopez conceded he looked up to myers from behind beetled brows fm relieved to find you so interested in my wefare myers bristled ive said all that i need to say more lopez corrected him gently im going back to the observation room goodby maam he said to mitsuko she turned and flashed him a brilliant smile which he could not make himself return he departed spine rigid mitsuko reached out her left hand to her husband and he took it warmly chuckling to himself then his expression sobered the control room door opened again and metesky entered my goodness what did you say to myers there was a storm cloud following him out of the room im afraid that my husband expresses displeasure perhaps too skillfully lopez looked sheepish i didnt really mean to be nasty with arlan i just dislike people messing with my games i know richard im sorry but there has been a murder dammit there are a hundred murders a day in this state but only one game a year why cant they leave me alone to do my work he sighed all right all right ill cooperate youll get your sword fodder thank you richard metesky folded a cot out of the wall and sat fascinated richard and mitsuko were far more interesting than other game masters most of whom were either sallow scholars or exgamers so deeply immersed in their fantasy worlds that their motivations were nearly incomprehensible and their conversations completely so but like any professionals at the top of their field the lopezes were exceptional bright imaginative personable and often irascible richard contrasted with his wife the better known of the pair mitsuko was always reserved never displaying more of her talent than necessary as people they were interesting as game masters they were spellbinding metesky had watched them conduct the hornbill attack during these sequences when the computeranimated holograms had to attack and respond in the most lifelike of fashions the lopezes were one mind with twenty fingers the illusion they created was complete no one ever seemed to notice that only two or three of the birds were actually attacking at any moment the rest were in the air in a holding pattern it was marvelous the way richard would take a bird out of its automatic figureeight and bring it to life with the sure hand of a master puppeteer flying it with doubletoggle controls and foot pedals it was like watching a duet on a synthesizer keyboard with something close to awe in her heart metesky watched them the group had been trudging through the bushes for some time before the terrain began to change the bushes gave way to vines and creepers and the soil was becoming damp and sticky maibang chose their path more carefully now he and the warrior kagoiano were in the lead and they looked worried chesters voice crackled into the room gina lets have a sweep of this area what exactly do we have here richard sat back and whispered to metesky chichi can always pick up on a magic request faster than i can im not totally sure how she does it he glanced into the hologram gina was swathed in green and her eyes were closed mitsuko listened carefully to ginas invocation when her fingers touched the keyboard they fairly disappeared into a pink blur the keys beeping softly at machine speed as she fed her request into the computer a shadowimage of a steel locker appeared floating before gina and vanished a few seconds after she opened her eyes the lore master nodded good were very close to something interesting i want garret up front we may need a cleric a dark face separated itself from the rest of the group are we going to need protection chester some of us might well need to recover that chest whatever it is and that probably means an engineer if it does hell need protection all right richard muttered to himself about the sharpness of the holo image and when chester called for a trail indicator the game master handled it personally he manipulated the image of the chest until it was translucent but dead clear the image floated ahead of the group and led them to a stand of trees growing in moist spongy earth the trees were thinboled with spidery branches and sparse leaves the roots twisted about on the surface for a few feet before disappearing underground the chest image sank into a tangle of roots chester looked at the patch of trees speculatively and raised his right arm reveal to me hostile or malignant spirit forces his green glow expanded to a field twenty meters across and in its light there were dim writhing shapes little more than wisps of fog they retreated from the light right he muttered sj front and center there was a whoop and the youngster materialized at hendersons shoulder breathing heavily we have some treasure to recover and its between those trees what do you suggest engineer grinning sj walked quickly around the stand probed into the soil with his boot toe nudged the roots i dont think it would take long to dig through this stuff these trees arent from new guinea thats for sure they look like something from the matto grosso my bet is that the army didnt spray them with fungicide before they planted em they look like they have root rot would you try to stay in character please engineer richard lopez gritted his teeth little bastard well have to cut that out of the final tape id love to kill him out of the game right about now meteskys voice was sharp we can juggle the odds in the computer richard but you cant choose the victim you just have to see which way it goes i can wish out loud cant i metesky that sj character just rubs me the wrong way sj had broken a folding shovel out of his pack and was digging industriously eames never one to miss a chance to flex his muscles chopped away at the exposed roots chester watched them dig in the control room richard lounged back in his chair and watched chester think neither spoke until the lore master softly said garret the cleric quickly crossed himself and dropped to his knees in prayer mitsukos fingers flew over her keyboard and an instant later a soft golden glow surrounded the young engineer sjs shovel struck metal and eames got down into the hole to help they shifted the remaining soil with their hands with a gasping wrench they tore it free chester stalled them for the few seconds that it took to cast a reveal danger spell on the corroding steel chest and when the glow showed only green he told them to go ahead richard heard a certain reluctance in his voice he smiled jimmying the rusted padlock was easy for sj who seemed to have brought a tool for all occasions he set the blunt folding edge of the shovel against a screwdriverlike implement and pounded it into the thin line where the halves of the lock met it split into three pieces and the gamers cheered taking a cautious step back the youngster lifted the lid all right he breathed guns there were four holstered handguns two rifles and at least a hundred rounds of ammunition there was also what looked like armyissue canned food turkey rolls spam and tinned pound cake sj was ecstatic cargo yeehah even chester seemed pleased very good thats not a lot of points but its definitely a start sj were going to intensify the protective field around you while you test them gotcha chief gwen would you please add your prayer to garrets she had scarcely nodded before the green glow appeared around her and the golden glow around sj deepened until it seemed that he was in the center of an amber gem he picked up a revolver worked its action a few times and thumbed in a cartridge he sighted carefully on a tree some twenty meters away and pulled the trigger there was a deafening report but no puff of dust from the tree frowning he loaded in two more rounds and pulled the trigger again the same loud bang and no sign of a hit ah sj what is your characters coordination rating anyway lousy eleven thats why im an engineer ill try a closer tree this time dust puffed from the tree trunk this was hardly sur prising hed fired at pointblank range okay who wants this one tonys raised arm caught his eye he handed the revolver over butt first next he extracted the rifle from the box m he murmured nice he worked the trigger a couple of times then loaded in one of the bullets and sighted on a rock ten meters away he squeezed the trigger the gun roared and flamed and there was the zinging sound of a ricochet sj ducked instinctively jesus the air in front of them shimmered and a ghostly image of garret appeared chester cursed venomously and garret groaned looking at the shimmering red splotch spreading on his shirt aw shit he said with real feeling his legs buckled under him and he sprawled in an untidy heap mouth open eyes rolled up in his head nice fall richard muttered he tapped two keys garrets hologram double crooked a spectral finger to him wait a minute chester said gwen do you think you have enough for a saving spell the blond girls cheeks plumped with worry right now im not sure if that was a natural accident maybe if there were spirit powers involved ill try unhappily gwen raised her arms and began her invocation hear me gods harness my strength and give this man back his life by the powers which are mine to wield i ask this she sank to her knees and bowed her head eyes closed lopez nodded smiling respectfully well done i wonder if it will work he watched mitsuko feed the request into the computer electrons danced a random number was selected and matched against two logged wesslergrahm numbers garrets assigned stamina and guineveres power level lopez shook his head as the rosy aura around garret faded to a sooty tinge in the air no good sorry sweetheart he tapped a key garret jerked at the shock from his neck tab he rolled over and stood up to confront his tindalo well i guess thats it huh guess i didnt last too long in this game he started to say something else and it would have been bitter gwen squeezed his shoulder with one soft hand and he turned to follow the somber ghost the two figures left the projection field richards face was no happier metesky saw a flash of deep resentment before it was submerged behind a neutral mask one dark slender finger played with the end of his mustache and his eyes were halflidded all right youve got your killing put the watchdog on and let me do my work the dream park liaison stood and started to leave metesky he yelled at her back tell the watchdog that if he screws with my game ill kill him out of it so fast his nose will bleed and hang the consequences he saw her silent nod and spun his chair back to the console mitsuko watched metesky leave heard the door sigh shut behind her then she flexed her fingers gently and went back to her work part two chapter thirteen enter the griffin we cant use these guns chester for the first time in the game sj looked unhappy theyve got to be jinxed if whatshername gwen couldnt save garret there has to be magic involved his blond hair was limp with sweat and greasy with dirt he looked tired and discouraged chester tapped his foot in impatient rhythm unconscious of ginas hand stroking his arm he stalked angrily to the chest and glared in we paid blood for these things and were going to have them maibang front and center he snapped his fingers angrily maibang his khakis blotched with sweat after the march appeared at chesters side henderson thought carefully before speaking now listen we know that gwen couldnt reverse the accident but she was temporarily drained by the protective field she cast for sj we need to disarm this boobytrap and i dont want to try one of our spells until i know the alternatives i remember reading something about your magic there is a ritual something about a table but i cant remember it do you know i know the table ritual which of my people would not i dont know if it will be enough well try it anyway chester looked around at the thirteen garners and the three natives nodding when there were no objections all right kasan what do we do their guide scratched his head we need a table first and a clean white cloth and some gifts food is best and flowers of course sj chester said without looking at the youngster covered chief i can whip up a threelegger in a few minutes using branches good dreager help him as for the gifts i think that the gods have already provided that he picked up one of the cans of tinned meat the table was crude but serviceable dark star had donated a white skirt which was spread as a tablecloth gwens candles normally used for exorcisms burned in the center bandanas and knives and spoons from various backpacks made do as place settings napkins and silverware arrayed upon the table were all of the cans of food from the buried chest two of olivers tropical chocolate bars some beef jerky from dark stars larder and flowers gathered by the rest of the crew we are ready to perform the bilasim tewol chester said his voice held no trace of doubt or uncertainty kasan will assist me but it is my power that beckons hear me gods hear me jesusmanup we strive f or your people i know that our actions are righteous in your sight do not let our brave priests death be a useless one we are desperate with need yet we destroy vital supplies to demonstrate our faith on cue bowan the black said fire the aura around his right hand blazed from green to red flame shot forth to touch the table like the biblical burning bush the jerky and chocolate and aging tin cans blazed up without being consumed and without scorching the skirt we have shown our faith give us now that which we need to harness the strength in these weapons henderson was still speaking when the air began to shimmer three ghosts took shape translucent caucasians in jungle camouflage uniforms their faces were pasty and one of them bore a gruesome open slash along the side of his face a machete wound perhaps who are you chester demanded imperiously there was a moaning crackle of sound and one of the three worked its mouth without words finally noises came from the withered throat were your kind americans yes how did you die the one with the machetescar answered this time coughing out his words in jerky phrases we died to take the cargo back youll die too all of you you there was a pause and the pale and whiskery dead mouth worked wordlessly until sound stuttered forth again you dont know what youre up against help us the lore master demanded you must give us the guns the guns were ours the gaping slit in the spirits face began to bleed dark sludge but the ford stole a secret weapon it might have beat the japs if it hadnt come so late now the fore have it we were sent with guns to take it back guns no damn use against magic we died in this stinking jungle but in our last breaths we cursed the guns cursed them so that theyll kill anyone who uses them remove the curse we need them with them we will win you your vengeance the spirits seemed to confer with each other then machetewound answered their request youre being stupid youll see but we were stupid too you can have your heroes deaths take the guns kill as many ford as you can before you die the spirits faded with the voice a final give em hell hung in the vacant air chester cast a precautionary reveal danger spell before giving the goahead gina was sympathetic you forgot to check the guns themselves last time ches after the outside of the box showed green you didnt worry about it youre right but thats the last easy point lopez is getting from me you can count on that tony and sj carried handguns now kagoiano had one of the rifles and dark star carried the other slung over one freckled shoulder the other two handguns were packed neatly away lets move chester called out and the column moved on mcwhirter slapped the pistol at his side heartily as he moved up next to oliver you know i feel like a new man with this thing on my side urnthe bullets arent real are they i mean those shots looked awfully real to me oliver seemed a little irritated no theyre not real but its still not a good idea to set one off next to somebodys ear even a blank can hurt your eardrums right he watched gwens hand find its way to olivers arm and jealousy showed in his face his eyes flicked back toward acacia who guarded the rear with alan leigh ollie caught it you know those bullets arent real but i know something that is and youre playing with it right now tony pursed his mouth he didnt need to ask what the chunky warrior meant listen tony fortunato thank you youre oliver im fortunato right and were off to steal what sounds like an atomic bomb an experimental one at that all crazies in this camp go ahead play games with her feelings tony she may have hurt your feelings last night but it wasnt on purpose and she thought she was doing you a favor youre hurting her on purpose tony brushed a springy branch out of his face as he walked and said the grounds really getting marshy well have to watch for quagmires oliver was disgusted all right fortunato i just dont see how your macho could be wounded all that badly watch out for snakes gwen released olivers arm and stretched out a hand for tony he skittled out of her reach but he was grinning now she stuck her tongue out at him and snuggled back up against oliver tony set his long chin bravely and dropped back in line to where acacia kept vigilant watch her hand never straying far from her sword she pretended not to notice him how goes the rear guard panthesilea he asked nonchalantly she made a noncommittal sound studiedly looking the other way he matched strides with her for several steps trying to read her expression listen hon im sorry about last night she flickered an eyelash in his direction and he was encouraged my pride just got hurt a little thats all hey its hell being a man the burden of carrying my ego around everywhere i go is enough to make me old before my time hey panth at least look at a poor soul when hes humbling himself before you i dont think you can keep up with us on your knees so just keep walking i guess ill get over it the frost was thawing but there was still a distinct coolness in her voice believe memind if i take your arm i mean its not doing anything right now and looked kind of lonelyill make it up to you tonight if youll let me at first there was no real response then he felt an answering inward pressure from her arm is that right you bet moonlight soft breezes and a warm bedroll mosquitoes courtesy of cowles industries she raised an eyebrow skeptically not like last night eh so i was oft sulking in the bushes sorry about that you werent in your hut last night either well in case you havent noticed there are some very attractive men on this expedition she fluttered her eyelashes at him very attractive some of whom know how to treat a lady when they can find onejust kidding aw cas you know i cant handle this kind of thing very well what say we call it a truce agreed she slipped her hand down to his and squeezed feeling a little knot of tension dissolve in her stomach her newfound feeling of relaxation brought an automatic smile to her face and tony pointed at it now whats that for she gave him a littlegirl laugh wishing there was somewhere that they could go to curl up together and get it out of their systems by the way tony said thoughtfully where were you last night a shout from the front nullified that question tonys hand found its way to his holstered pistol in a blink and he had to run to keep up with acacia who was in motion instantly the ground was extremely moist now and every footstep sank an inch into the muck reeds and fernlike plants abounded and in the areas where water had seeped out of the ground to form puddles islands of green scum floated someone shouted help up ahead and tony realized that he had heard that cry twice before too faint to register consciously another monster an attack by the ford whatever the hell they were he almost bumped into acacias back so suddenly did she skid to a halt she was bent over trembling and at first he was afraid for her then he heard the laughter and knew it was all right a man was stuck up to his waist in quicksand or the dream park equivalent thereof he was big with thick shoulders and neck another jock warrior tony bet himself silently the man had closecropped red hair and an unsaintly look of irritation on his face get me the hell out of here will you chester was laughing hands on knees standing as close to the quicksand as he dared well hello there stranger ive been expecting you who exactly are you and why should we trouble ourselves to rescue you im the griffin im the best thief in the world excuse me dark star tossed her head bouncing her short brown hair and just how do you think you deserve that title mr titanic leave him chester now now lets have no quarreling over matters of rank were all equal here except me of course still her point is well taken on what grounds rest your claim to greatness hurry now i do believe youre an inch or so shorter than you were a minute ago the man looked down at his waist and grimaced well i stole the emerald eye from the sacred statue of katmandu not bad anything else the man shifted uncomfortably in the muck tony reflected that the stuff must itch like crazy i filched the silken bellows from the temple of kosell the wind god my that must have been exciting chester covered a yawn if youve never done anything bigger than that we may have to lend you a snorkel all right last try i have the only existing black market print of star wars woops chester paused respectfully a slight anachronism seeing as were in new guinea circa or so but the point is well made well get you out sj youve earned a rest wheres our other engineer lets get rudy dreager out here dreager a short stout man with a bulky backpack and a sunburnred complexion hustled out and began taking mental measurements his voice was a squeak no really solid trees to use as a pulley so ill need some help with the line eames would you be kind enough thank you eames looked miffed to be thanked before he had consented but he stepped forward and took the end of the thin nylon line dreager offered him the chunky little man threw the other end to the trapped thief who wound the end of it round one wrist and held on with the other hand the procedure was clumsy but effective and with an obscene sucking sound he came free of the mire the thief wiped his leather trousers partly clear of mud and smiled cynically i guess after an introduction like that id better be worth it hes a mind reader chester dark star sniffed chester hushed her with a look you arent who i was expecting so i assume youre a guest of the dream gods well put i can promise to pull my weight though dark star scratched one of her stubby ears do you expect us to share our supplies with you ray of sunshine arent you it so happens that i know the location of a substantial quantity of supplies he paused for effect then added including a couple of sixpacks all reservation dissolved in that instant oliver shook his hand heartily glad to meet you my names oliver whats yours griffin all right griffin lets find your supplies and break for lunch chester looked at his watch then squinted up at the sun that burned on the inner surface of the covering dome if i were a sundial id say it was three oclock or so but i know its only eleventhirty somebodys collapsing time on us and i wonder why the last words were almost under his breath and chester shook himself back to alertness fall in with maryem shell protect you until we see what you can do her protect me there was an incredulous edge to griffins voice broken off as small strong fingers dug into his arm come on handsome if maryem has to nursemaid somebody at least youve got a decent body to guard she crinkled an eye at him speculatively naw she said finally griffin tried to fix a friendly or failing that at least a neutral expression on his face well lets go lets the goods are about a hundred meters that way he pointed toward a slightly less marshy stretch of ground and the garners headed in that direction eagerly my name is acacia the darkhaired girl said sitting down next to him but you can call me panthesilea a chrysanthemum by any other name he grinned at her and downed a forkful of pork and beams his feet were bare socks and shoes laid out in the sun to dry a lanternjawed man with shaggy black hair staggered up the slope with a beer in either hand the foam plastic cans had been suspended in a shadowed pool of water and were pleasantly cool cooler than the water in fact the newcomer said im tony mcwhirter he tossed a can to acacia who caught it neatly dark star and i are the other thieves on the expedition he plopped himself down next to acacia sighed with contentment then ducked as she playfully sprayed him with beer foam griffin asked have you been on many of these nope this is my first one the lovely lady dragged me along you my first time too i supervise gavagans bar its one of the dream park restaurants thats what got me in that old demon wanderlust got to you huh something like that these people kept stumbling into the place dirty exhausted grinning all over their faces i finally had to find out what it was like griffin was quoting the real gary tegner almost word for word he knew gavagans well enough and hed found the time to talk to the gavagans bar manager for nearly half an hour hed been very busy these last few hours someone else had packed the backpack he had found waiting with the beer presently hed have to search through it to see if anything had been forgotten tony regarded griffins shoulders and arms casually noting the way small muscles bunched and writhed in the mans forearms as he turned his fork you know i would have thought a man like you would want to be a warrior dont like blood i like skulldng about in dark corridors and outwitting the forces of justice you thief is what my wesslergrahm came out to as a fighter i wouldnt have lasted more than a minute against the oversized turkeys yesterday acacia laughed and touched tonys arm lightly oliver chimed in griffin scooted over a couple of inches and patted the ground next to him oliver sat down followed by gwen griffin asked how did you do against the big birds not bad i didnt kill one by myself but i crippled two of them and somebody else finished them off not a whole lot for my individual points but the group points will be good so im not worried about it im worried about my little darlin here gwen snuggled her back against his she was facing the other way pretending not to listen to the conversation she hasnt really had a chance to strut her stuff yet now gwen turned around dont worry about me what about tony and dark star there hasnt been any call for thieves at all aha griffin chewed for a bit then explained ive been wondering why she came on so strong really attacked me acacia agreed readily yes youre probably right this expedition has been a field day so far for warriors and wizards not too shabby for engineers either i think dark star is worried about her points she tsked condescendingly may i assume that you and the lady in question arent on the best of terms we arent on any terms at all i just dont warm to her thats all dont know exactly why except that i seem to remember something about her cheating in a game acacia seemed suddenly alarmed dont tell her i said that though okay scouts honor i could be wrong anyway there was a cry from a group of gamers a few feet away gina perkins was dragging something that looked like an oldfashioned set of sleepers it rustled like snakeskin gwen tugged oliver to his feet and they ran over to inspect the thing tony followed a second later oliver and gwen griffin said to acacia those two are pretty well inseparable arent they absolutely why do you ask she licked the last bit of gravy from her stew can griffin stood up and stretched lazily oh i dont know maybe i think shes kind of cute he extended a hand to her and pulled her up shes adorable the dark girl granted but is she really your type and who might be more my type hmm if griffin had been standing four inches closer they would have been kissing acacia turned and pointed to the woman who had found the curious artifact oh i dont know how about gina she smiled at him over her shoulder shes with chester but shes been known to forget that i hear she started toward the group of garners and griffin followed close behind business first alex he shut his grin down to a bare smirk at first he couldnt believe his eyes unmistakably henderson was holding up a complete human skin hollow dry dark brown flapping in the air like long underwear hung up to dry what the hell is that griffin asked either random magic or henderson was thoughtful i seem to remember something about a legend of men who shed their skins sj looked at it closely ohoh his head snapped from side to side where are our bearers kagoiano stepped forward promptly so did kibugonai a short stout man with flat features chester bellowed nigorai nigoraiiii maibang shook his head with regret im afraid that you are holding nigorai in your hands henderson started then examined the skin more closely when be came to a tiny white scar over the left eyehole he nodded i suppose the revolvers he was carrying are gone too a quick search confirmed it then he was a spy a a member of the enemy impersonating a daribi he wiped a thin hand across his forehead and alex could see that the lore masters hand was trembling faked out again acacia whispered at his shoulder weve lost points and now the enemy knows were coming he was a spy he started to throw the skin to the side then stopped no im not going to be stupid again when lunch break is over im going to scan both of our bearers im also keeping this skin it may come in useful he folded it carefully and put it in his pack as the crowd drifted back to their lunches griffin found himself wondering about the only man in the group larger than himself eames had sandy red hair and freckles he looked boyish and his massive musculature provided an interesting contrast he seemed to be alone a single man in the group could have slipped away last night griffin stood with his back to eames trying to pick up bits of his conversation with the slender man with the receding hairline and brown braided hair leigh that was his name griffin remembered it from the dossier he had studied before joining the game alan leigh trailed his hand appreciatively over eames shoulders you look a little tight there muscles need massaging maybe there was a minimum of leer on alans face perhaps his chipmunk cheeks were a bit more in evidence than usual out of the corner of his eye griffin saw earnes was flinching look alan i told you last night its not that i dont like you as a person i just dont get into it like that really leigh sighed what a waste i could be a big help to you in the game wrong thing to say eames became palpably hostile under what circumstances he was about to say more but alan picked up on the feeling and wagged his head no i dont mean that really he smiled sheepishly anyway we still have three nights left and you know where to find me that was as much as griffin felt like eavesdropping on and he turned away most of the garners had finished eating and were preparing to leave griffin had tagged eight garners as couples chester and gina dark star and that bowan the black character oliver and gwen acacia and tony acacia seemed to be looking around all of the other players were singles and were therefore to be considered first except that the conmient about feicia dark star maddox was very interesting something to keep an eye out for while most of the wackos kept their eyes open for dragons and such chapter fourteen the water people the ground was mushy water lapped over the laces on griffins boots twice he had to stop to shake the water out the realism was hard to fault he halfexpected to find leeches on his ankles goddam gamers he muttered why couldnt this have been a desert game or a nice mountain what was that grifly a gravelly voice sang in his ear he shuddered you can call me griffin or grill if it makes you happy but i like griffy better this was insane he was being nursemaided by a fiftyyearold battleax of a midget who carried a nasty halberd on her back and continuously sang snatches of dirty songs if a man had called him griffy teeth would have flown like popcorn in maryems case he wasnt sure whether it was amusement or caution that kept his dander down the woman was as solid as the warrior she pretended to be henderson called the column to a halt they had reached the edge of a waterway that stretched in three directions as far as he could see it was choked with plants and floating debris and subtle disturbances of the surface suggested living things within griffin shuddered realism henderson conferred with maibang out of his hearing and alex went back to maryem i take it youre a longtime gamer oh yeah how many of the garners do you know he asked nonchalantly ymean before this game started she scratched her head thoughtfully well chester an me are old buddies hell i wetnursed him through his first stretch as a lore master how long ago seven years a jaunt into the hyborean age to steal the serpent ring of set from the finger of thothamon she gave a harsh bark of amusement now there was a pretty bit of thievery for you difficult was it you wouldnt believe it chester lost threefourths of our party but the game master was penalized by the ifgs for running an excessively nasty game i wouldnt have thought you would complain about anything mary maryem griffy thats griffin maryem there was something moving on the marshy water boats boats several rude canoes were floating toward shore they shimmered and wavered like things of myth their pace as slow as the setting of the sun by now the entire party was standing at the edge of the water and griffin peered out hands shadowing his eyes from the reflected glare of the dream park sun there were six of the canoes all large enough for more than the two apiece who were paddling them whats this looks suspiciously like transport griffin where are we going she gave him her kindest shutupandsee smile and then ignored his question henderson waved greeting to the approaching boatmen there was no response and even from a distance griffin could feel chesters body go tense the lore master raised his thin arms and performed an invocation green light enclosed his body then streamed across the water to envelop the canoes when they reflected only green the lore master relaxed and dissolved his spell now the oarsmen were closer they seemed deadeyed and unnaturally quiet even their paddles were silent as they dipped into the lake the lead canoe nosed into the gooey excuse for a shore its occupants exchanged greetings with kasan do you know him our guide maryem looked at him curiously not before the game why griffin cursed himself silently these surroundings were affecting his professional judgement he could not just line up suspects and quiz them i just had the feeling that id seen him somewhere before funny why funny hes bound to be a professional actor now will you kindly shut up and let me enjoy the game she gave him an affectionate elbownudge in the gut griffin gasped for breath she was one of the three chester henderson alan leigh marymartha corbett the three who had explored gaming area a on previous games drown it he had to ask her questions but he didnt have to like it henderson called them all around him these folk are the agaiambo they are our next link in the chain and will take us to our rendezvous split into groups of three and get ready to board the canoes you and me griffin asked maryem playfully try getting rid of me handsome they joined rudy dreager the plump engineer who had pulled griffin from the quicksand they piled in between two silent boatmen the paddlers crossed a stretch of clear water then turned into a channel choked with green and yellow vegetation it looked like a stagnant canal in the last throes of nutrient strangulation the vines and roots growing so fast that they kill themselves and the entire ecosystem of the waterway the going was painfully slow the lead canoe halted at frequent intervals so that the front paddler could saw vines with a longhandled knife at last griffin began to relax he leaned over to speak to maryem who was humming tunelessly her sharp little eyes never ceasing their sidetoside sweep of the vegetation how did you get into this maryem regular little psychiatrist arent you what do you do on the outside i mean for work very few people can make a living out of prying into other peoples business im supervisor for gavagans bar in dream park the lie came surprisingly hard masochistically he forced himself to elaborate most of my job is keeping the food and the service up to par r d does the special effects but letting a customer bend my ear is part of the job too what about you well i retired myself at thirtyfive griffin whistled good going he trailed his hand in the water until he remembered the vague stirrings he had seen at the bank of the main body and pulled it out quickly how did you manage that lose a toe on the job he felt her tense and wondered what nerve hed scraped nothing so dramatic sonny just a little principal called modular economics that means that instead of getting a lot of money for doing one thing you get little chunks for doing different things well and youre your own boss its flexible fun and free the three fs sounds good what do you do well if your ears were a little dryer i might be convinced to show you if however you mean what do i do for money id have to give you an alphabetical listing a few highlights would do did you grow them muscles just so you could survive being nosy she tickled him and he coughed to cover his broken giggle of surprise i do guide work for rock climbers in yosemite and i teach kendo you what lets see i do a little philately sculpt bonsai trees halfwell and have been known to pick up a few bucks sewing costumes for gainers want more griffin swallowed hard jesus how many of those things do you do well the kendo and the rock climbing mostly the rest i just picked up alex nodded he was wondering what such a superwoman was doing playing fantasy games like a kid but that was obvious enough didnt r d have something on the boards that would let someone like maryem play as a statuesque blond yeah hed heard something about distorted holograms a process too expensive to use so far that would let a man play as a woman or vice versa or as a dwarf or a giant but he wasnt about to mention it to maryem shed feed him her halberd after what seemed an interminable trip the canoes drew into a less choked patch of water now instead of travelling single file the five canoes spread out abreast of each other presently they pulled up to a rude dock with wooden moorings sunk in the muck it didnt look like much but it was indisputably a village the foundations were tree trunks that rose out of the swamp five or six feet and the wooden platforms set atop them looked as stable as any paranoid schizophrenic griffin tied their boat up next to one of the dwellings and they waded soggily and carefully ashore the boatmen followed unsteadily as if walking on ice skates when the men reached land alex could see why their feet were hideously deformed scarcely more than misshapen clubs looking around alex found that all of the boatmen were similarly crippled most were using their paddles as crutches he chose not to ask what was going on a detective should spend some of his time detecting they were being led to a central platform it was set on firmer ground than the dozen or so thatchroofed houses grouped around it like the others it too rose several feet above the ground perhaps to discourage alligators from basking on the front porch people were coming out of hiding women and children and older men and a small contingent of spearcarrying warriors all were clubfooted nearly to disability as they reached the central platform griffin watched the nightmarishly long shadows of their hobbling companions and suddenly realized that it couldnt be later than two oclock but the sun was nearly set he checked the watch on his cuff it was quarter past two what were the game masters planning for tonight to be bringing the night so early the gamers were directed to a wooden ladder and one at a time they mounted it the two bearers waited below please maibang was explaining softly the agaiambo are a boatpeople who spend most of their lives in and on the water they venture onto land rarely over the years their feet have shriveled away to what you see but they are a proud fierce people and great allies in our fight pay them the respect due to a warrior people who have resisted evil at tremendous cost there was a muffled clumping sound and the ladder shook as it was mounted a face rose over the edge of the platform a face incredibly aged and weathered only the eyes seemed truly alive chips of diamond stuck in a withered black apple the man was supported on one side by a walking stick and on the other by a woman scarcely younger than he her empty and wrinkled breasts swaying pendulously with each uncertain step she helped him to a sitting position but remained standing herself she held his hand with what griffin interpreted as protective affection the old man mumbled rubbery lips twitching with palsy and as he did a thin streak of drool ran glistening to his chin the woman spoke after a minute of halting dialog maibang translated she says that her man is sorry not to greet us in strength but he is very tired the fight is not going well the village of the agaiambo is too close to the lands of the enemy and the assaults come more frequently now the end is near the old man experienced a facial spasm and his lips pulled back from brown stubby teeth with an enormous effort of will he controlled himself and mumbled again to his woman she repeated his words aloud and maibang translated i am not the leader of the agaiambo he says for the leader has been dead for a week we placed him in his ku his exposure coffin so that the rain and the sun might return his flesh to the earth and speed his spirit on its way to dudi the village of the dead but our enemy who had brought death to him in the form of the dreaded biditaurabohaza chester interrupted pardon me dont mean to be rude but i may need to know about that what is this biditarwhatever i know that bidi means man maibang relayed his request to the old woman who gave a lengthy reply it is the manripemaking snake if you meet its eyes you rot from within chester nodded murmuring tropical twist on the gorgon legend please maibang insisted this is important in four days he died badly swollen and already nearly putrefied his body was placed on the ku two days later be was half rotted the flesh hung loose on his bones next to griffin mewbirter groaned good lord is this really necessary acacia had her band over her mouth she looked a little green herself but then his eyelids opened and in the empty wet sockets there burned a terrible flame and the man who had led us came down from the ku and with the strength of ten he decimated us not fire nor spear nor knife could slow him and he killed all who came within his grasp at last desperate we bound his limbs with snares cut him in pieces and threw the pieces into the swamp even that was not enough for one of the arms came out of the swamp and tried to reenter the village one of the great lizards who haunt the waters edge caught the arm and devoured it mcwbirter looked dyspeptic griffin hid his amusement this is why we are so weak he says we have undergone many such assaults in past years and each has taken its toll we would not have survived even as long as we have but this village is situated on ground holy to both your gods and ours years ago missionaries came to teach us of god and jesus not far from here they built a place of worship because we of this village helped supply materials and what labor we could they blessed our land and our boats the old man had been mumbling to the woman as maibang spoke and she relayed more information to them but now maibang continued we fear that our protection is weakening we know that strange things have been happening at the old anglican mission and that tonight a sacrifice will take place there on the altar of your god they will desecrate the holy place and end our protection we will be doomed we are not strong enough to stop them you are strong you have powers your world is at stake as much as ours it is in your hands it was slow in coming but it was there an almost tangible crackle of emotion in the air a feeling of shared purpose that ran through the adventurers like an electric current and strangely unmistakably griffins heart speeded up by a few beats and he found himself thinking this sounds like fun then he remembered who he was and why he was here and pushed these thoughts aside we can do it count on it chester said grimly tell maibang how to get there if you cant supply us with a guide it was very dark now but a full moon was rising and it would soon be light enough the last few hundred meters the adventurers bad traversed as quietly as possible griffin watched maryem for his cues the dwarfwoman was deadly serious her balberd threaded and in band tilted against danger from any direction alex was aware of the inadequacy of the dagger in his belt and wished for one of the stolen guns fortunato seemed at home with his smith wesson and dark star had unslung her rifle and was carrying it at port arms as she traveled whatever else he might think these people were taking their game seriously the griffin would too if he wanted to survive long enough to find rices killer the progress of the line had ceased and they were bunching up henderson came back down the line were near the mission he told them briskly i sent oliver and gina ahead to scout for us and we cant move in until we know what were up against im sure theyve got guards and fortifications and probably a ghastly or two he glanced significantly at dark star if my hunch is right well have some action for our thieves youll have to brief fortunato and griffin honey youre our only experienced thief oliver broke through the line breathing shallowly its up there all right and its not empty looks as if there are about two dozen natives and maybe one boss man i dont see the sacrifice but theyre preparing for it no question weapons i saw spears mostly knives a couple of bows and two guns no machine weapons good gina i took a read on the area and theres plenty of magic all right at least two priests fifthlevel or higher and one vibration i dont like at all i think that was one of the enemy and if theyre all as powerful as him were in trouble stow that we can handle them what does the lead man look like the redhead pursed her lips thoughtfully trying to remember strange animalistic leather loin cloth long fingernails and toenails very dark looked like his hair had been shampooed with mud very strong aura and even though i was shielded he knew i was there chester grunted any link with the sacrifice slight shes in there and shes plenty scared i can tell you chester we cant try a frontal assault theyll kill her and shes our only link to the enemy got it youre right of course good work hon did it tax your energy much the green field glowed around gina and chester judged her aura with a practiced eye youll do when the assault begins team with me you talked me into it she grinned snuggling against him he pretended not to notice it looks like we are going to need the thieves ginas no slouch and if her shielding wasnt good enough to slip past them then no one but the thieves can do the primary work despite himself griffin felt a bubble of excitement percolating its way to the surface whats our mission rescuing the fair maiden of course chapter fifteen the rite of horrific splendor at the edge of the clearing hidden behind a broadleaved tree crouched three thieves two were novices and their hands and foreheads were damp with expectation one of these was blueeyed with shaggy black hair he carried a pistol and dagger he wore dark pants and shirt and his face had been blackened with charcoal his name was fortunato he hawked and spit quietly too near the boot of the second novice a huge man who moved with disquieting ease who squatted on his haunches with the relaxed endurance of an outback abo his hair was red and cut short his thickly callused hands were curled loosely around a twelveinch poniard he called himself the griffin the third thief held a subtle but powerful influence over the others she was not what one would call pretty except perhaps by the light of a lonely campfire her lips were too large they gus tened momentarily as she wet them with the tip of a pink tongue her ears sprouted like semaphore flags from under her short dark hair now they were straining to catch any slightest sound only her eyes might honestly have been called beautiful within them was a swirl of tiny reflected lights oilfires floating in a whirlpool her eyebrows arced together like markings on the face of a bird of prey her entire body was canted forward like a runner awaiting the gun her name was dark star before them was spread a strange and barbaric panorama one which assaulted every sense lean dark figures twisted in rhythmic movement as the sound of wooden drums and reed pipes mingled beneath a bloody moon maibang their dark wiry guide with the quick eyes and the ready tongue had said that this was originally an anglican church no living man remembered clearly the day that the forest creatures arose and slew the missionaries but since that day no sane man came within a spears cast of those vinemottled walls so much blood had soaked the ground that the very souls of the priests cried out in agony at any footfall the church crumbled and in junglemoist disrepair was small not much more than living quarters for the long dead occupants services were held in a roofless chapel an open area covered with ancient and rotted mats where two hundred at a time might kneel together in prayer the roofless chapel now hosted a ring of frenetic dancers another ten or twelve natives scattered in an outside ring swayed silently to the beat without moving their feet in the middle of the area was a frame of timbers lashed in the form of a vertical x if she isnt out here then shes got to be inside the church building itself dark stars breath caught in her throat and she pulled her companions back further into the bushes the figure that came out of the building was a strange one he looked more beast than man his nails were talonlong and sharp his canines were filed to points his hair was a shattered waspsnest of mud and sticks he glared around the clearing looking right past them and spoke sharply and hurriedly to the dancers they took handfuls of grain from little leather pouches at their waists and began to sow it griffin nudged fortunato most of their attention is focussed in front of the building shall we try the rear fortunatos grin split the stained blackness of his face what about it star will we need a distraction only to get out alive now listen both of you we need to work our way around to the other side of the church and we have got to do it quietly follow me she shifted the rifle from behind her shoulder and held it across her chest as she crouched she ran lightly through the bushes at intervals of five meters griffin and fortunato followed they made it to the other side of the clearing and stopped surveying dark star nodded and they scurried across the fifteen meters of clearing to the back of the church the rear wall was half again as tall as she boost me she whispered to griffin he bent and linked fingers for her to step into and straightened up the thief caught the edge of the roof and pulled herself up until she had both elbows resting on it with a final push from griffin she was up fortunato helped griffin up and the big man returned the favor fortunato was panting heavily dark star sent him a dirty look and he tried to quiet it down years of rain and weather had reduced a once sturdy roof of thatch and timbers to rotted weakness they were able to crawl along the main supports without much risk but the tilt of the roof made it a tricky business the sound of the music and stamping feet drowned any noise they were making if they didnt shake down too much dust on the people within they would be all right dark star shinnied up the slanted center beam bracing her feet in the thatch griffin and fortunato followed she halted a couple of meters from the top drew her knife and slit a peephole in the woven straw she had to saw at some of the stronger fibers but accomplished her task without noise griffin followed suit the room below them was dimly lit but in the flickering light of a single torch it was possible to make out four figures two men stood with arms folded bracketing a woman who lay bound on a pallet above her loomed the mudhaired man who had directed the dancers at this range they could make out slitted cheeks stained with fresh blood selfinflicted ritual wounds probably rubbed with dirt or manure to create permanent scars the girl was blond and her clothes now tatters had once been expensive and beautiful griffin couldnt see her face clearly but her body was small and sweetly shaped dark stars toe nudged griffins ear and he glanced up she gestured cutting the air with her knife griffin made a circle of forefinger and thumb he liked the idea the thatch roof seemed to be made of two sturdy mats joined at the center beam if they slit it where it met the beam they would be able to drop through onto their enemies quietly they cut the moonlight made their task easy and only the pulsating sound of the drums promised doom once one of the guards below glanced up and they stopped cutting until he turned away griffin looked back at fortunato who kept the watch for them the thief rubbed at the charcoal around his eyes and waved back dutifully dark star was preparing to peel the roof back when the door of the chapel opened and several warriors filed in the girl moaned as they hoisted her to their shoulders they carried her out griffin heard the lady thief curse venomously he understood how she felt so close two guards remained in the room after the others left griffin tapped dark star on the foot he pointed down all right she whispered give it a a patch of air in front of her face glowed red gary she said breaking character your blade is still live sheath it and unlock the handle griffin looked at her blankly before he remembered the admonitions given to him by the referees in gaming central no live blades during personal combat all edged weapons have detachable blades with simple holo projectors in their hilts all sheath sensors must confirm lockdown before combat sequences can begin no physical contact allowed and no blows may be aimed at joints groin face or neck except with hologram blades minor infractions will necessitate halting of the game and awarding of penalty points major infractions will automatically terminate the game alex pushed his poniard into its holder until he heard it click then he twisted the hilt a halfturn and it came free an eightinch glowing blade projected from it and he passed a finger warily through the field the red glow before dark stars face dissolved and she gave him the goahead but the griffins own face felt like it was glowing in the dark jesus a dream park security chief had been that close to slicing up two actors great publicity there griffin hell with it griffin ripped the roof open and dropped into the room the guards were taken unawares he landed almost on top of one his knife plunged bloodlessly into his back half a dozen times the native collapsed the second one tripped over the corpse of the first and as he flailed to the ground griffin cut his throat neatly the big thief shook his head swordfodder he muttered dark star dropped from the roof followed by fortunato who nearly twisted his ankle she looked around at the damage and gave him a grudging nod of approval pretty smooth for a firsttimer what do you do for an encore he ignored her and moved quietly to the door we dont have much time theyre getting ready to do it now she peeked out at the wooden frame where the european girl was being anointed with a mash of crushed grain and pig blood fortunato dark star said pulling the blackfaced thief to her do you think you can hit a mans throat at fifteen meters i can try my wesslergrahm is seventynine for dexterity and beyond that its up to the computer the gun might be better no save the bullets use the knife fortunato twisted the knife hilt free and now he held a glowing blade well have to time this just right the music outside grew louder swirling and capering the scarred and mudhaired high priest moved around the girl and jabbed at her with a blade chipped from black glass the others moved back to let their leader dance hypnotized by his movements he was fairly foaming at the mouth now scuttling from side to side like a rabid crab he drew a knifeline of blood on his own stomach then writhed forward rubbing his belly against the girls and smearing her with blood griffin couldnt see the captives face from this angle but he could see her body stiffen and jerk away the high priest grinned lasciviously and did it again more slowly and this time her wail of misery rose quaveringly above the throb of the drums he raised the knife high and now dark star hissed fortunatos hand flickered in a short arc as he mimed throwing the blade a glitter of silver flashed from his hand to the priests throat the priest gagged hands flying to his neck and blood drooled from between writhing lips bullseye fortunato shrieked delightedly before the word was out of his mouth griffin was out of the doorway and streaking to the side of the captive there was a brief moment when their eyes met and the gratitude and awe in her face were glorious fortunato was at his side in the next instant and they faced the charge side by side as dark star untied the girls bonds the first man in thrust a spear with a glowing point at griffin the thief sidestepped grasped the haft firmly and twisted the man somersaulted and landed on his back the second man in got the glowing point in the stomach and collapsed howling a quick glance at fortunato showed that he had acquired another glowing blade and was holding two natives at bay dark star had the girl loose she thrust her to the center of a protective triangle formed by the three thieves two men rushed her one went down before dark stars knife she sidestepped the others wild swing he sprawled to the ground and she finished him from behind suddenly the mass of natives pulled back into a ring and several spears were raised to casting height as they prepared to throw there was a marrowrending screech from the rear the natives turned en masse to meet the new threat but it was clear from the first that they were unequal to the task for maryem had arrived the little woman charged like a berserker her glowing halberd tilted before her her leather armor was caked with dirt and her face was grubby and scratched but the gleam in her eyes was effervescent a dozen warriors and wizards charged behind her ginas power staff whined and piped its song lightning leapt from the tip as she played and danced amid the slaughter panthesilea wielded her sword with stunning speed fighting her way to fortunatos side swiftly pursing a kiss at him before turning to stand shouldertoshoulder in the fray the natives fought to the death every one of them spears knives and corded muscles glistened in the torchlight as the battle raged oliver the frank moved in a cautious circle around his opponent native spear matched to glowing broadsword the spears lu ininous tip grazed his stomach as oliver twisted aside thrusting his own weapon in the next instant the natives spear jerked up and oliver had to acknowledge a deflection the two men with drew to the ready position attention focussed totally on each other oliver faked high and went for the knees as the native warrior tried to block he overreached and oliver looped the blade up and into the ribs howling his foe went down holding his stomach the battle was almost over natives lying dead and broken everywhere suddenly the lore master yelled for their attention he pointed to the roof of the church lurching along its edge knife projecting from the hollow of his throat tottered the priest his eyes were glassy and halfdried blood shown on his chest as he looked down at them his lips twitched back from his teeth in a ghastly caricature of a smile eyes alight with a hatred stronger than death he opened his mouth and gurgling whispers bubbled forth back everyone chester screamed unnecessarily they retreated from a patch of air shimmering in the square get the girl and lets get out of here chester yelled but by that time it was far too late the shimmering patch cut the girl off from everyone but eames and leigh who stood over her alertly what do you think chester gina asked panting reveal barrier he yelled a bolt of green flashed from his hand into the glowing area and dissolved it illusion it was a stall the jungle behind them shook with the sound of branches snapping and popping the ground shook with an ominous rhythm and eames swept the girl into his arms carrying her to the center of the garners they formed a ragged halfcircle facing the jungle and waited there was a collective gasp as the thing lumbered out of the trees into the clearing it was huge the size of the church building with a snakelike head attached to a grayish roughly spherical body it had dozens of short stubby legs that moved more like cilia than jointed appendages and carried it toward the garners with frightening speed the mouth was strange shocking it was no bigger than a mans mouth it was lost on that vast face chester watched its approach cautiously he saw the thing glide up to one of the fallen natives its mouth expanded like an awakening morning glory exposing gums lined with row after row of small sharp teeth it hunched over the body and slurped it in halfway and chewed chester backed away we dont want any part of that thing lets clear out of here fortunato called chester and waved the heavy revolver he was carrying try it chester commanded the rest of you get going the gamers began an orderly retreat the creature finished the native and glanced up its mouth pursed hungrily it followed fast fortunato mcwhirter stood braced with his legs apart arms stiff both hands wrapped around the gun butt he fired twice quickly and paused to observe the effect two small pucker marks on its smooth front were not bleeding in fact they were closing it hadnt slowed at all tony fired again more carefully aiming for its eyes and mouth he fired until the gun was empty then ran like a thief with the creature too close behind him the orderly retreat became a rout kasan maibang led them to a path through the bush wide enough to travel doublefile and the wave of garners stretched out into a line tony mcwhirters sprint had cost him he was exhausted he ran like he was about to fall over at every step chester ran with maibang what is that monstrosity the little guides reply was wheezed between clenched teeth it is called a nibek our enemies called it to avenge themselves the lore master looked back the trees werent slowing it timber was smashed into bits by every shrug of that massive body and still it gained a disturbingly human snarl decorating the tiny mouth damn it a voice screamed from the rear he looked again and saw who it was at the tail of the column maryem her legs too short for real speed another few seconds and the tiny mouth would expand to swallow her leave her maibang said urgently in the time it takes to eat her we can be far up the trail i should feed you to that goddam thing chester raged shes mine damn you and that nibek cant have whats mine without a fight he pivoted and raised his arms hear me gods the green glow surrounded his body and when he yelled the sound was like roaring thunder gather to my side my children of light and darkness this spawn of hell shall not have us fortunato was hugging a tree gasping to alex he wheezed acacia says thieves dont fight well better hang back eames had joined maryem and the nibek drew up short hissing its scaly head weaved slowly to and fro and one eye was missing shot away panthesilea and oliver joined them blades out and ready behind them gwen knelt in prayer casting a sparkling white aura around them gina and bowan the black slipped to the right flanking the thing chester went left it attacked on its first pass maryem stabbed at its remaining eye diving out of the way so that its answering snap only grazed her she had missed eames slashed at it and the nibek swung its head around too swiftly for the warrior to escape he stumbled back as his aura flashed red the monsters mouth began to expand and only olivers blow to its legs turned it back around oliver backed up until he was against a tree and the nibeks mouth smiled as it came in for the kill the white protective field around oliver glowed more intensely and the thing gave its warbling cry of frustration when it couldnt get through it turned its attention to gwen who still knelt in prayer she kept her eyes closed until it was almost upon her then turned her palms outward and the full power of her inner strength blasted into its face it reared back blinded from his side angle the lore master unleashed a bolt of such intensity that the night became redtinted day for an instant dreager tried to bat the nibek with a large branch and as the monster recoiled from chesters blow it smashed into the engineer dreagers aura went bright red fading to black but now the garners were better organized the nibek bit at gwen while bowan seared it with flame tony had reloaded and was firing into the beast the brush itself crackled and smoked but the nibeks hide only crinkled under the assault griffin hurled his captured spear and it went through the creatures head completely though greenish blood pulsed from the wound it lived on its brain must be in the body magic users closer in now gina stood almost in the midst of the smoking brush and hurled her power into the creatures side it struck a tree in its agony and a mass of flaming branches fell striking gina squarely she yelled her rage as her aura went red and then drained to flickering black chester saw it and his face went sick bowan this is no good this thing is too strong its killing us im going to try for a split attack bowan set his balance and redoubled his efforts a fountain of flame pouring from his fingertips chester threw his arms wide and intoned hear me now oh lords of light knowing that i fight your fight i care not what the spell may cost let your servant pour forthfrostl from the tips of chesters fingers gushed a stream of white particles that struck the nibek opposite the side bathed in fire the things mouth quoited out and it screamed as its skin split down the spine exposing bone and red meat now the nibek was in real agony bowan changed his attack and sent his fire arcing over directly into the wound it crawled in diminishing circles like a halfcrushed beetle now the warriors moved in slashing and stabbing it was eyeless and nearly legless and still trying to run when the garners hacked it apart the survivors leaned on each other or against trees panting looking around them auras chester yelled and they flashed on there were six redtinged glows and three black two black auras were solid ginas still flickered chester sounded exhausted gwen see what you can do for gina weve lost the others the cleric nodded touching dreager sadly on the shoulder as she trudged past him to ginas side dreager was incensed just what do you mean lost the others arent you even going to try chester extended his hand in sympathy and the angry engineer knocked it aside the lore master said listen dreager gwens only got so much power and shes already used up a lot of it protecting eames and oliver if she tried to help all three of you shed run out of juice she couldnt help anyone then dreager snorted his reddish complexion growing ruddier well then only one of us can be saved right one chester said quietly dreager walked up close enough to rub belt buckles and stuck his nose almost into hendersons mouth so how is it that she gets to live whats the matter you dont play fair to anyone who isnt laying you chesters voice wasnt loud but everyone heard him dreager you are dead all the way dead didnt you feel the jolt your tindalo is standing right behind you see the stout engineer turned and looked and shuddered as he saw his mistywhite translucent twin crook a spectral finger at him if you were as much a gamer as the other man the nibek killed who had the class to quietly bow out we might have been saved this since you ask though i give gina consideration because she is a competent magic user while you are a secondrate engineer without enough sense to leave the fighting to the fighters dreager sputtered try ing to get out a reply but chester cut him short and dreager in answer to your implied question i suspect that if i had spent last night with you instead of gina id be even happier to get your dead ass out of this game dreager looked about him at a ring of unsympathetic faces he spit into the dirt his ghost was moving away and he followed a few steps then stopped his fists clenched youll be sorry for that henderson i swear to god youll be then he ran into the darkness chapter sixteen rest break gina sat on her bedroll with her knees drawn up to her chest the campfire popped ham and beans simmered next to the flames the smell was delightful compulsive we had a couple of serious accidents and three fatalities today chester said well need a replacement engineer and we need another cleric to take up the slack f or poor gwen i know where we can get both of those in one package so were set there im worried about our points but the nibek was no pansy monster and the ifgs has to give me credit for that so it should balance out gina nodded she seemed half asleep but chester didnt notice he sighed and rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands i think were running a little to the good right now and in a game like this thats the best we can hope for gina rested her head against his knee ill bet we see dreager again though as a zombie even so how much damage can he griffin watched and listened unobtrusively leaning against a tree trunk with his arms folded strangely he was tired real f atigue as if he had spent the day fighting real monsters instead of holograms like the others he had stripped off his backpack and collapsed to the ground whooping with delight and why not it was all good fun he shook his head business stick to business he looked around at the fifteen people in the camp twelve were gamers the others were the rescued maiden and the actors who played maibang and kagoiano unobserved he faded back into the trees until the campfire was barely visible the transceiver in his wallet hummed as he punched it on griffin here marty you there right on it chief weve already interviewed the three garners who got killed out weve even voicestressed the first one what was hisoh yeah garret the other two have agreed to do it tomorrow and theyre all staying on as guests of dream park your sunny personality no doubt oh no doubt the unlimited experience pass might have had something to do with it i mean not only go to the head of the line every time but free too garret says hes going for the guinness record on the gravity whip the laughter felt good a release after the days tension ive picked up some interesting things myself i think we can clear alan leigh he was busy last night trying to seduce eames one of the warriors alex wasnt particularly surprised at the short pause and then the discomfort in martys voice bobbick like melissa and much of california was a product of the postquake religious revival sexual conservatism still was less the exception than the rule though garners made their own rules but marty was a professional and he asked a professionals question can we scratch eames too no he hasnt done much gaming so hes not high on the list but he turned leigh down he could have been alone at least part of the night if leigh came after him he could find that eames had moved his bedroll to avoid a sticky situation but leigh wouldnt have started a seduction if he wasnt planning to stick around and enjoy it i suspect that we can rule out henderson too why think about it we never took the garners seriously as a threat because theyre so into makebelieve henderson lives and breathes for the game its his whole ego and it pays off well in terms of power and fame he strikes me as the kind of person who wouldnt risk that for money this is mostly hunch but as long as im out in left field we might as well exclude gina too because they spent last night together im inclined to think of this as a solo job for now of course it could have been a team effort one partner supplying an alibi for the other hmm what is it grill more grief check the alternate waiting area its as close to the edge of gaming area a as r d is could one of the alternates have gotten into a then doubled back through the service duct it does seem weve got a blind spot for garners psychologically we just never considered them to be any kind of threat ill cover it good now lets give me something more to look for have you got a map of gaming a ive got a dozen weve been marking them up youre ahead of me then okay mark out the killers easiest routes to gaming area a service shaft he only had one good path he had to go around a piece of papiermache mountain grill we should put tv screens on these transceivers i could show you one path good now get lopez or somebody to tell you what the killer had to see on his way to g a something he knows about that the rest of us dont lopez may not be happy about giving forewarning to a gamer dammit weve got a murd yeah be as persuasive as you can marty sounded skeptical sure millies voice came on line chief ive got some information for you anything earthshattering shattering no interesting yes rice apparently died of suffocation some time after he was tied up we think he regained consciousness before dying why the bandages on rices thumbs and wrists were heavily abraded he must have been rubbing them against the concrete floor trying to get loose the gag blocked his mouth and evidently his nose was stopped up whew griffin shook his head in the dark feeling a tremor run the length of his body thats a hell of a note killed by a cold thats really crazy he ran his hand through his hair trying to focus fighting dragons was exhausting what else well that missing statue was either stolen or is in the hands of someone outside of dream park no one knows anything about it rice made it in his second year at the university of oklahoma one more thing kokobun the lady who tried to buy it from him said that it felt hollow hollow all right this gets even trickier chief skip obrien did a check on rices psych profile and the computer record has definitely been tampered with in what way obrien says that the original report he filed when rice first came to work here indicated that rice was too much of a loner for office work he just didnt fit into a team effort now the file shows him as having highly developed communication skills a higher frustration tolerance and his military iq has been upped ten points well well this is definitely getting strange somebody was grooming rice for a desk job maybe an important one millie find out if rice put in for a transfer to another department will you or if anyone requested his transfer keep working on any leads you can and thanks good work people ill be back in touch beep me if anything urgent comes up but remember i might not be in a position to answer bobbicks voice came back on the line by the way gruff weve all been following the adventures of the infamous griffin and i must say that you looked great out there against them savages he laughed and millie joined in she said when you chucked the spear at that monster you looked so serious chief have you been leading a double life maybe by day a meek mildmannered security honcho by night an avenger of evil lets not go overboard gang im glad youre enjoying yourselves but weve got business ill ring you tomorrow the transceiver blipped as griffin closed and pocketed it griffin steepled his hands over his nose and breathed deeply from where he stood with his back against a vineshrouded tree he could hear sounds of merriment from the campfire the voices were tired but happy and as he listened maryem began to croak out a song it was good enough for odin though that croakin was forebodin till at last the giants rode in still its good enough for me he wanted to smile but couldnt business first alex business theres a killer and thief to find before you can relax gimme that old time religion gimme that old time religion gimme that old time religion its good enough for me montezuma liked to start out rites by carrying a part out that would really tear your heart out and its good enough for me no he couldnt relax then either there would be paperwork and conferences then court appearances and depositions then a complete redesigning of the security procedures at r d then he shook his head keep this up and youll start thinking that all you do is work your ass off go home and crash back to work sleep for a few hours work well hi acacia said materializing out of the dark the beige denim safari outfit she wore was appropriately stained by the days activities and she looked tired but tired or not she had pinned back her flow of dark hair and it framed her face beautifully hi yourself a smile wormed its effortless way onto his mouth and he moved a halfstep closer to her what brings you out here she gave a mischievous giggle well tony wanted to sing and i got bored and a little lonely he perked an ear in the direction of the fire and picked up mcwhirters thin but pleasing tenor beneath maryems roar old time religion its good enough for me it was good enough for kali though embracing her is folly shed be quite an armful golly so its good enough for me what about eames did i notice some knowing smiles passing between you two that was for last night she leaned against the tree shoulder to shoulder with him and stretched luxuriously it was no big thing really mostly talk hes not as much my type as i thought he was what is your type aha that is what they used to call a loaded question what do they call it now an unnecessary one given that im out here in the woods with you she smiled uncertainly searching his face i dont know about you gary what dont you know well i cant help getting the feeling that youd rather watch than participate you like to stand aside and observe he cleared his throat is there anything wrong with that no not really its just that theres something about you that i like and i get the feeling that youre not getting as much out of the game as you might be what am i missing out on i mean im having a ball she frowned at her boottoes youve got this attitude and i cant put my finger on it you go through the moves enthusiastically even but theres something businesslike about it as though youre afraid to have too much fun i bet you take your job very seriously dont you oh i guess so i see what youre driving at but why would someone whos afraid to have fun work at dream park he ran his finger softly along the side of her neck or join a gaming party the voices floated to them it was good enough for dagon a conservative old pagan who still votes for ronald reagan and its since i dont know anything about you i guess its all right if i make a few wild speculations it seems to me that cowles industries is a perfect place for someone who likes their fun vicariously how often do you actually use the facilities not very often he admitted but and i bet youve got some job with a killing amount of responsibility dont you oh hell maybe so running a restaurant is as much work as you want to make it he quoted gary tegner too woodenly there was a flicker of disbelief in acacias eyes quickly hidden i would have figured you for a different kind of job and actually i wouldnt think that corning on this expedition was your idea either you dont really fit in gary did your doctor tell you to do it for your health or what tell me he said putting his arms around her waist and locking his fingers together if i promise to try to fit in and have some fun from now on what do i get she answered him you know she said pulling just far enough away for her eyes to focus on him there was even a bit of business in that kiss well maybe i mean business i just bet you do she kissed him again longer this time and hotter when she broke away her questions were temporarily subdued she ran her hands along his chest feeling the hard muscle and the questions flared again you know she said in a nearwhisper you dont really add up gary but i like you why because you ask too many questions thats why and damn few answers which means that behind the big strong silent man routine there is the kind of little boy i like she snuggled up closer to him how long has it been since you told that little boy that hes worked hard enough and its all right to play for a while he shrugged uncomfortably about ten minutes damn i guess thats why im here maybe it has been a while he tried to kiss her again but she turned her head slightly to one side so that he grazed her cheek gary you use kisses to get away not to get closer you dont have to say anything to me but ask yourself how long its been and if you feel like talking to me i mean really talking you know where to find me she kissed him with a strangely subdued energy and disengaged his hands from her back and walked back toward the campfire griffin watched her go with rnixed emotions relief at being free of her prying and a little confusion at the sadness he felt she had no right to pry into his mind or his life he wasnt there for her pleasure or even his own it was good enough for isis she will help us in a crisis and shes never raised her prices so shes good enough for me quietly hands in pockets he joined the garners at the campfire there was a lull in the singing and the pork and beans were dished out eames came balancing two plates he carried one of them to the small honeyblond girl who had been the captive of the fore and sat down beside her alex had seen her dossier her name was janet kimball and like harvey kasan maibang wayland she was an actress participating for straight points and a small percentage she was perched on a rock listening intently to alan leigh her ragged clothes were covered with a black cloak from bowans pack but even in her state of disrepair she seemed totally at ease wanted to see how the other half lives leigh was saying so i signed up as an actor in muhammad porters slaver game your objective is to free your fifty purchased tribesmen from the frigate tante marie before it reaches market in new orleans and without causing the crew to drop their cargo overboard i watched the tape yes i remember you now brrr leigh nodded complacently i made a good slaver suave evil ready to sell my own mother if shed been the right color come to that youd fetch a fine price anywhere my dear he allowed his gaze to linger on janets exquisitely shaped legs with obvious relish for that moment alan leigh looked evil and janet looked like she liked it then he broke the spell by consuming a fat forkful of savory legumes it blurred his voice somewhat so who exactly are you supposed to be janet lady janet if you dont mind im a british noblewoman captured by foul natives on my way to australia were you ravished no she said wistfully i rather think they hoped i was a virgin no chance of that huh eames put in i wouldnt have put it quite like that mr eames ah theres one of my brave rescuers now griffin nodded acknowledgement he squatted in front of her with a plate of beans balanced in his lap youre well worth the saving too she curtsied where she sat and he went on so youre going to lead us to the dreaded fore eh yes just dont mention their name during the game unless youre ready to die i can because they gave me permission i supposedly spent three weeks among them while they waited to sacrifice me under a new moon she turned to leigh i find barbaric customs very stimulating leigh leaned close to her madam beneath this civilized and cultured exterior you will find the heart of an absolute beast she seemed fascinated teeth and all especially teeth perhaps youd like to see my horns sometime warriors are a lot more basic and earthy than wizards eames sniffed id think youd be a little more attracted to my type yes youd think so wouldnt you leigh said warmly he and janet giggled without malice eames was growing increasingly frustrated listen janet would you like to go for a walk love to she said gazing into alans eyes shall we and the two of them left the campfire eames stared after them biting his lip ill be damned whod think shed prefer a faggot to a real man griffin politely said nothing eames looked at him challenging what do you think i think shes a gaming groupie she went after alan because he has more ifgs points than you do it might even be true alex thought eames grunted somewhat mollified yeah that must be it he gave griffin a justusmen smile you know you cant ever figure women out no i guess you cant griffin directed his attention mightily to his rapidly cooling food to barness verbal sallies he merely grunted his replies the warrior lost interest and grumbled away into the woods alex let his mind follow an earlier track leigh has a good many experience points leigh played a previous game in gaming area a and if leigh noticed some time last night that eames was safely occupied with acacia then but would he count on acacia keeping eames occupied maryem bounced down next to him how ya gary doing pretty good feel a little tired i guess big strong man like you she cackled i would have thought youd wear out the lot of us i just havent slept well for the past couple of days he said truthfully that always tears me up well get some rest tonight youll need it soon enough how so these things dont seem so tiring nobodys fallen over yet and the real fireworks probably start tomorrow lopez has just been testing us by tomorrow night the last of the replacements will be in and thats when well get hit with everything in the book but why should that be so tiring its just a game she looked at him incredulously take a look around you sonny do these people look like theyve been playing a game he did look around and maryem was right fatigue was etched into every face dark rings under eyes and noticeable trembling in fingers and hands he focussed for the first time on the amount of touching and cuddling going on around him tony and acacia cuddling in the shadows bowan and dark star touching each other with almost embarrassing intimacy and chester snuggled with gina in their double sleeping bag oliver and gwen had retreated from the campfire altogether it was a little like a battlefield he realised the highly charged sexual atmosphere was no mere tease and anything but casual the immersion into a fantasy world was total the exhaustion was real the real need to reach out and touch where did it all fit together and how did it relate to him and his problem he looked at maryem who was waiting patiently for his response there was no electricity in her face now but there was poise and purpose how did she fit in youre right it doesnt feel like a game but it sure isnt real life so what is it its not that simple gary she said and he realised with a start that he had never before heard her speak softly its a little different for everyone her eyes twinkled at him and he was startled again to find himself considering her attractive mostly its just fun what you bring is what you get sonny now me i do some pretty wild things all the time some of these folks never do anything more exciting than talk to a filing computer so they come for straight out adventure some come for the game challenge you know chess with living pawns puzzles some come for the people i mean when youre into gaming as deep as this sometimes it gets hard to find friends who dont think youre from mars thats all too simple really its little bits of all of the above different for every gamer she chucked him under the chin thats what makes it fun so think about it i think youll make a hell of a gamer when you figure out where you fit in she waddled off to her sleeping bag and zipped herself halfway in the bag rustled and she started handing clothing out making a neat pile by her head griffin felt a sudden and inexplicable wave of affection for her he fought an urge to hug her goodnight instead he deposited his dish in a grimy pile and found his own backpack he was within touching distance of half a dozen sleeping garners no aspiring killer would try anything with so many potential witnesses nearby the griffin unrolled his superlight heatreflective sleeping sack wishing for a moment that it was plain cotton he slipped into it and took a final look around all was quiet all was peaceful except for the halfformed questions that raced through his mind in unending circles like dozens of tiny dachshunds chasing their tails with a supreme effort of will he pushed the questions out of his head and settled down to rest he heard crickets in the bushes he was wondering whether those chirps were live or just more dream park magic when his mind fuzzed out in sleep chapter seventeen the last replacements the dream was too vivid for comfort it began with the nibek chasing griffin through the halls of r d and ended with the creature cornering him in the first floor lounge a spear materialized in his hand and alex threw it into the monsters head it screamed thunderously and collapsed to the floor melting into the form of albert rice trussed and gagged and sitting dead by the drink dispenser im sorry griffin found himself saying automatically a small crowd of people materialized tsking the still form of the guard a little grayhaired lady waved a disapproving finger at alex he may not have been well balanced at the end but he was a fine upright boy she said someone in a snowywhite doctors smock spoke with bobbicks voice i knew the lad well and he wouldnt take this sitting down and just before the morning mists dissolved into the sounds and smells of breakfast a third voice whispered believe me he was for real until he got his back up against it believe me hey there sleepyhead acacia grinned at him squatting to look into his face griffin parted gummy eyelids and groaned aloud whats the matter tough guy thats simple cas this sleeping bag doesnt go over too well with my waterbed body well how would some bacon and eggs go fresh eggs absolutely kibugonai showed up this morning toting a cache of fresh eggs bread and orange juice me for cargo the last niggling speculations about his dream were swept away by the sudden hollow in his belly what time is it how long till game time about an hour come on and eat kasan says that therell be a place to bathe up ahead she sniffed under her arms dubiously frankly i need it she bounded up and made for the next bedroll where sj lay curled into a compact lump griffin yawned he split the velcro seal and rolled out of the bag his legs felt a little sore and he massaged life into them with the practiced edges of his thumbs breathing deeply and slowly he stretched out to touch his toes and twisted to each side feeling the circulation return to the muscles in his back he finished the warmup with a few slow pushups then got to his feet the mood of the group was highly charged again a nights sleep had refueled their fantasy engines alex remembered the nuzzling going on yesterday evening and wondered whether sleep had much to do with it henderson was holding court against the bole of a tree munching a sweet roll while balancing a plate piled high with eggs and fresh bread kagoiano served alex his breakfast and the security man ambled over toward chester to eavesdrop what did you think of last nights opposition bowan asked between bites of egg the natives typical orcs was chesters answer its really a shame nobody has figured a more realistic way to conduct personal combat dream park is too worried about injuries and lawsuits so no rough stuff orcs griffin asked henderson was brusk generic term the old roleplaying games were overrun with these little beasties out of lord of the rings they were ridiculously easy to kill now its a nickname for swordfodder in general okay griffin nodded mutely now lady janet is going to lead us as far as she can she was blindfolded much of the time but believes she was kept on the water somewhere is that right certainly lady janets head was pillowed contentedly on leighs shoulder but her voice was brisk she was into her part ill tell you everything i know i have an excellent sense of direction fm sure you do we have another clue chester pulled a blackbladed dagger out of his belt considering that it was the focus of last nights ceremony we can count on its being important does anyone recognise the material obsidian sj piped up volcanic glass with a composition similar to rhyolite right chester said smiling approval for once and the significance no opinion what good is a glass dagger it tells us that the people were looking for probably live near a volcano so what were looking for is a body of water not too far from a volcanic region kasan can help us there we should have our two replacements pretty quick and then well be back up to full strength i have an almost perfect group now and when the fun really begins we should be working together well yes tegner who will the replacements be and when exactly will they join us griffin asked hendersons gaze was inquisitive have you ever been a cop or maybe a reporter alex shook his head negative cursing silently well theyre the braddons owen and margie i dont know exactly when theyll show up but it will probably be within the first hour or so of play yes mcwhirter do you know what our points are like i mean how are we doing chester didnt look totally happy with the question weve lost three people and taken some wounds weve made a lot of kills recovered a load of cargo and rescued lady janet there are other factors involved but for right now were ahead i dont want to discuss how much ahead we arethings can change too fast in a game like this one so i dont want you to feel either cocky or discouraged any more questions there were none henderson gestured expansively then go and prepare children the fun begins in thirtyfive minutes tall slender palms outlined a patch of lower growth the crescentmoonshaped border trailed off from the campground like the tail on a q inside was more tropical jungle making the good luck sign anything but obtrusive alex bad bad to get sj to point it out as alex pushed through the palms the vegetation within the border became ghostly revealing a tiny rectangular structure no garners were waiting their turns praise the lord and hed be invisible to anyone outside the border of trees it was very basic inside toilet washstand towel dispenser marty yeah grill i can barely hear you im in the restroom and theres no window id rather not be overheard so im keeping my voice down lets make this fast okay whats new some new garners corning in husband and wife named braddon ill check them out gruff the altern tes spend all their time watching the game and looking for detail and taking notes and discussing strategy that waiting area is pretty crowded i dont think anyone could count on a chance to get into gaming a without being noticed good have you talked to lopez yeah he doesnt pressure worth a damn i managed to get him to look at our map he pointed out two paths around the mountain to the exit g a lopez says both paths would take the thief past a piece of a big airplane which piece wing cabin tail how big piece of a big airplane when i tried to get more he told me to get drowned hell all right so if we get to a big airplane ill watch everybodys faces thanks anything else nope the griffin signing out griffin was paired with sj as the group waited for the game to begin all bedrolls were stowed all backpacks shouldered and balanced the sun shone faintly through the dome that covered gaming area a but the morning was already warm and the rich aroma of moist jungle greenery was heavy in the air at precisely eight oclock a new sun peeked over the mountain range to the east sending bands of soft red tone through the scattered clouds dancing above the crest the old sun faded out the air filled with the sounds of birds and rustling life to griffins eye even the trees seemed to stand a little straighter all right people lets move out chester called and in pairs the column headed toward the sun sj kept stride with griffin by picking up his step until he was almost skipping the pathway was broad enough for the youngster to shadowfight in zigzag patterns slicing at the air with his knife he pulled a slender branch from a tree and skinned it down to a wand he flicked it like a whip at branches and insects laughing aloud griffin tapped him on the shoulder thats not exactly stealth youre practicing there breathing a little heavily sj spoke without turning around nope dont need it why not lopez wont hit us with anything too nasty until our two replacement garners have joined up griffin scratched his chin his fingernails scraping on stubble how do you figure that easy sj took a couple of lunging thrusts with his wand lopez wants to catch chester with his pants down hes not going to take any chances to give henderson a legitimate beef to take to the ifgs getting some of us killed out now might do that if he wants to get us when were short he can afford to wait til tomorrow when we get no more replacements that way chester cant squawk see he finished his lecture with a vicious swipe at a butterfly it evaded easily you know a lot about gaming dont you sj nodded vigorously im the best even if nobody knows it yet do you spend a lot of your time gaming not like this i mean theres never been anything quite like this before even the ordinary games only come along every couple of months the first runthroughs anyway and theyre the most fun i do a lot of home gaming im linked up to about five games three american one from japan and one in the united african republic that last one is weird uses hausa mythology i tie into them a couple of times a week see how far the other garners have pushed the expedition enter my own moves and see what happens sometimes we arrange for all players to be on line at the same time so the game can go on for hours and hours one of the american games is a solo youre playing against the computer so you can play forever if you like in general i like the group games why gets me ready for dream park ill be a lore master one day i want to know how units interact units did he mean garners youve put a lot of thought into all of this havent you sure have sj popped a fly out of the air with the tip of his stick the mutilated insect flopped to the dust and buzzed around in circles sj made an unhappy face and set his heel on it i never expect to hit the darn things he brightened and added must be gettin better huh i guess so tell me what do you do when youre not gaming i mean is this your only social outlet why do you ask griffin shrugged noncommittally you seem to put a lot of yourself into gaming thats all i dont know much about all this and i just wondered how high a price you pay for well excellence is that reasonable now it was sjs turn to hunch his shoulders i guess so ive heard all the stuff about people who are into fantasy being reality shuckers or maybe its reality that shucks us i dunno anybody can see that a group of garners has more than the average proportion of bizarros but i dont think gaming made them that way now me im still in school so ive got the academic trip to worry about ive got a part time job so that uses up time too i guess a lot of the energy thats left over goes into gaining what does that do to your social life whats a social life i mean do you think id be big man on campus if i didnt trot down to dream park or spend my evenings in front of my console heck most girls think im in free fall where else but around garners could i possibly find someone i have anything in common with griffin chuckled any success there some times more than others this trip zip his face lit up but i have hope the game is yet young does it make you unhappy to see other people pairing off if youre alone i felt a little left out last night for instance i would think that a war game could be a lonely place sometimes yeah especially at night when i find a girl who games though im going to start getting her into these things until then ill sneak my thrills when i can get them meaning sj contrived to combine mystery and childish glee in the same smirk the night has a thousand eyes mr tegner meaning nothing unless youre vulnerable to blackmail being deliberately vague you betcha im allergic to pain the mountains were noticeably closer now the troop was tramping through regions less like green hell and more like densely shrubbed foothills the ground was no longer mushy but hardpacked dirt giving way to rocky ground soon they were winding their way past huge mossencrusted boulders and under the lip of a sheer cliff looking back griffin noticed that perspective had changed the jungle behind them seemed to be lower than the path along the cliff face as they wended their way into the mountains griffin lost sight of the jungle several times and each time it came back into view it was smaller and lower they continued to climb by contrast with the stark rock walls around them the trees and thick brush had been downright cheery after a long stretch with nothing to look at but granite they broke through the first set of foothills into another stretch of greenery the trail led down into a meadow marked with huge twisted trees green and greener still from the vines that swarmed up into their branches flowers exploded from the vines red and violet fantasies that looked ripe enough to pluck and eat the meadow was ringed with tumbled rock but at the far end it was fenced by the rise of a mountain from halfway up the mountain face tumbled a cascade that sparkled like blue diamonds in the sunlight and where waterfall met ground it formed a small lake two people waited on the shore more cautiously now the column wound downward griffin saw the white aura glow around someone near the front and tongues of green flashed out in all directions then vanished no danger on the trail chester let the line hurry a little alex began to smell the moisture in the air to feel the coolness of the lake to sense what it would be like to plunge into its depths previously ignored the grittiness of dustencrusted underclothes and the strong soupy smell of an unwashed body became jarring irritants he found himself breaking into a run around him garners were abandoning backpacks and outer clothing the two strangers on the bank beckoned them on with lazy smiles griffin had almost reached the water when chester yelled hold it damnut were going to have to test that water first the group grumbled but waited for the goahead chester strode over to the newcomers and greeted them happily margie good to see you the lady was in her early sixties judging by her hands and neck but as wellpreserved as a woman could be when she stood it was with a grace that would turn any mans head and her figure was still trim and firm her hair was gloriously gray rippling softly down to her shoulders and not much further and you owen sorry to make you wait its okay chester the man drawled he looked to be margies age and carried himself well he stood with a trace of stiffness and he stretched like a big gray cat margie and i can always use a little time to sit and watch the water gurgle the lore master smiled the waters safe then they both nodded dont mind if i test it myself do you not a bit dear dont drain too much of your power thoughi chester gave her a tolerant wink and spread his arms hear me oh gods his aura flicked into place reveal danger the lake lit up in clear green were safe children what the helli declare a break lets have some fun maryem whooped and stripped her chunky body down to the buff dove into the water without even testing the temperature leigh and lady janet were next to strip and dive eames still in his underpants wiggled a toe in the water grinned with hollow bravery and took the plunge soon the entire group was splashing and playing griffin stood on the bank alone chewing his lip acacia swam over to him hey there big fella come on in and play she splashed at him with deadly accurate aim griffin caught himself peering through the water for a better view of her arent the cameras still on bobbick and millie must be having a wonderful time acacia gave him a raspberry dont be silly were on break now the game is suspended for half an hour are you coming in or am i coming out to get you not that thats a bad idea but griffin balanced onelegged to pull off his shoes he sat down to pull his pants off acacias appreciative whistle echoed across the lake my my just look at those legs she swallowed water and coughed it out laughing inherited em from my mother he growled from now on hed spend more time on his sun deck he seemed to be wearing fleshcolored briefs all right here i come he jumped in with a resounding splash the water was cold and sweet and varied from two to four meters deep griffin forgot his embarrassment and let his whole body wriggle with pleasure he dove down to the lakes sculpted stone bed running his hands along it watching air bubbles leak from his mouth and wobble up to the surface how long had it been since he last dipped in a pool the only possible answer was too long he spent fifteen hours a week exercising but it was all workrelated at this moment dream park and alex griffins work seemed worlds away he arced back up to the surface barely avoiding owen braddon who was backstroking across the pond not swimming as fast as bowan the black nor looking as prettyhe was easily thirty years older than bowan and the small pot belly ruined his streamliningbraddon clove the water with a clumsy enthusiasm that made him a joy to watch griffin sank beneath the water as a weight landed on his shoulders from behind he came up sputtering guess who acacia yelled and pulled him back under this time he grabbed one of her legs and wrestled her down her giggles sent a stream of bubbles frothing from her mouth as she kicked out and caught him firmly in the chest breaking his grip she swam quickly away and griffin followed he watched the sun play on the muscles of her long light brown legs as she tried to outrace him acacia glanced back over her shoulder eeked to see him so close behind her and dove under water again griffin gulped a lunglul of air and followed turbulence clawed at him water and bubbles forced their way into his nose and buffeted his face then the water was calm again and he realised that theyd swum through the waterfall there was eight meters of space between the rock wall and the cascading tons of water and acacia waited for him there he swam to her taking her into his arms playfully her body was slippery in his hands as she jumped up and licked the tip of his nose very kinky he said glancing through the waterfall to the garners beyond nobody was paying any attention only mildly so hombre she locked her arms around his neck hey mister she arced her eyebrows conspiratorially ya wanna fool around im not sure i believe you griffin said nuzzling her believe this then she kissed him fiercely lifting her body to him and griffin found that one part of him believed her totally they rolled in the water blinded by mist and roar and water aware only of each other mouths locked and bodies pressed tightly together they were a tiny tangled pocket of heat in the roiling cold when they broke she pulled a few inches away eyes glowing huge breathing a little shallow now that was communication mister yesss i thought i heard something there what was it saying she hoisted herself tantalizingly high enough to look him squarely in the face me want griffins hands steadied her hips adjusting and they both took a sharp inhalation well is this a private party or what griffin and acacia broke away from each other tony mcwhirter was treading water about three meters away a grin was frozen lifeless on his face acacia flushed guiltily tony i uh thought you were well i its pretty clear that you werent thinking about me so save it cas the dark haired girl shook her head disbelievingly her hair spraying droplets in all directions tony dont be mad you said it was all right if we each had our fun she turned pleading eyes to griffin for an instant and he backed away from her acacia swam over to tony and tried to link her arms around his neck he shook her loose yeah well thats true and its certainly worked out well for you hasnt it i mean with every available woman sewn up and four or five loose men running around youve had plenty of opportunities to bat those lashes and wiggle your hips then if things didnt work out well old tonys always available right tony it isnt like that again she tried to hug him and he pushed her gently away no cas its all right i just dont think its fair that every time you do this to me everyone ends up thinking im the villain he turned and dived and was gone beneath the waterfall griffin swam over to her although he didnt try to touch her she watched tony go and some of the vibrancy had gone out of her im sorry griffin said not knowing what else to say she didnt look at him im sorry too her voice was painfully flat i think maybe we had better get back to the others through the rippling vertical sheet of water the retreating figure of tony was indistinct and growing smaller with each stroke acacia started to speak but the words wouldnt come at all griffin followed her out through the thundering turbulence he had let his mind stray from business he wasnt here for fun and the more he thought about it the less it seemed that anybody else was either chapter eighteen snakebite cure griffin was pulling his boots on when maryem slapped him on the shoulder gently that startled him hey gary did you know this rice guy the guard griffin didnt let himself react rice i dunno does he work in dream park he did owen and margie were telling us about it seems he got killed in the research building a couple of days ago the whole place was buzzing with it when they were being prepared for insertion this morning griffin kept his eyes on his boots hmnim maybe i did hear something about it im sorry last week was really hectic he pulled the laces tight and tied them i wasnt paying much attention to gossip well i just thought maybe you knew him maybe he ate at your restaurant now and then its likely enough what happened to him she jabbed him with the tip of a short strong finger i thought maybe you could clear that up handsome ah well get your pack on playtimes over she waddled away whistling tunelessly to herself well that solves one problem griffin thought he had considered dropping a comment about rices death into a group discussion just to see if anyone flinched for the role of the thief he had too many suspects and nobody seemed to be acting like a hunted killer now the news was out and he could sit back and watch the results it seemed likely that the killer didnt know the guard was dead the griffins prey might well believe that rice woke up with a headache and a sore neck that would make it a game a complex exercise in ingenuity and daring but murder that would be different the gamer who had chuckled privately about his marvelous coup might now begin to show signs of panic and who was left as suspect well high on the list were bowan the black and his lady dark star maryem sj and tony mcwhirter had no apparent alibis for thursday evening neither did oliver or gwen all of the other gamers were covered assuming that those who had already been killed out agreed to submit to the voice stress analyzers unless acacia was she covered for the entire night pride be damned the lady seemed uncommonly interested in the griffins past and my body damn fortunato did he have no sense of tact come to think of it what about kasan maibang he was in the game at that point and would have to account for his actions like any gamer and what of the workmen who entered gaming area a to change the sets could one of them have sneaked away from the others holy mother of mercy griffin whispered bitterly this was quickly getting out of hand he would have to have bobbick check that for him as soon as possible he stood breathed deeply and shouldered his pack the line was forming again but this time he had a new partner acacia she stood next to him waiting for chesters call to move out she didnt speak hey lady whos not communicating flow her smile was faint im sorry gary do you mind if i walk with you id like that things arent good with the boyfriend eh a sigh on and off off right now i dont really feel much like talking do you mind id just kind of like to walk with you she looked up at him and for the first time he saw no strength no assurance in that beautiful face only confusion and loss so griffin walked with her as chester started the column on its way together they wound their way into the mountains silently sharing the sights and moods of the day together they huddled beneath the branches of a gnarled dead tree as the ford sent a storm against them dora the spirit of nature raged in the sky and in the earth and dark clouds gathered spitting splintered lightning into the mountains protected by the clerical power of gwen and owen braddon they still shivered in the cold rain the wind plucked at them and torn brushwood tumbled through the air at frenzied speed when lightning struck the ground trembled ominously and rocks began to fall it seemed that half the mountain was falling on them waves of mud a hailstorm of boulders they saw the earth open and swallow one of their bearers before the storm was over acacia and griffin were cuddling for warmth still unspeaking shivering as they held one another costing us time henderson muttered while maryem bellowed a song into the storm i have a magic wizards staff i think its really swell whatever tries to slow me down i blow it straight to hell they could barely hear her and nobody would join her she desisted when at last the rain stopped and the storm clouds boiled away into vapor the garners crept out and looked anxiously into the sky shaking water from their hair and bedrolls acacia kept her eyes on the ground as she straightened herself up she was barely audible as she answered chesters roll call and alex watched her worried only kagoiano had been killed which left eighteen people in the game the fifteen players lady janet kasan maibang and the bearer kibugonai as soon as everyone had their breath back they continued on after another mile of silent companionship griffin finally asked does he do this to you often i dont know whos doing what to who right now hell maybe i am too bossy maybe i do play around too much alex chose to ignore the implied question come on acacia yesterday you were telling me that i needed to get more involved in the game okay so do you now youre telling me to ignore the fact that the man that someone i love has been hurt through my actions i cant do that then go talk to him no she said softly i cant do that not yet we might be able to talk later weve had this problem before and its always worked itself out before maybe tonight well be able to talk she looked up at him with the same pleading eyes he had seen under the waterfall i hope you dont think that im a tease because i really do like you i just dont think that you and i should take things any further than theyve gone i can understand that really listen lets just forget that all of this happened all right if you help me believe that im a thief out to steal back precious cargo then ill help you remember that youre a beautiful warrior heading for the fight of her life how does that sound she creased her neutral expression into a smile and said nothing the route they traveled was turning green again but now the trees and bushes seemed stunted twisted as if the soil itself contained alien nutrients no branches bore leaves but strange golden fruit hung from them and griffin wrestled with the temptation to pluck and taste one he couldnt explain it but somehow he knew they were being watched by hostile eyes he found himself thumbing the hilt of his knife and whistling tunelessly nervously his eyes roaming the crags above and the occasional gullies below the other garners were restless too alex caught tony mcwhirter looking back at them tonys eyes shied away when they met griffins he seemed not resentful but afraid what do you think cas i feel it too somethings happening itll be soon she shivered and drew her sword holding it at ready though there was no visible foe fear that was what he felt pure fear something on a level he couldnt touch intellectually something more primitive than reason up ahead chester called the line to a halt the mass of garners grouped around the lore master in a ragged semicircle chester raised his hand for silence we all feel it so i dont need to tell you that there is danger up ahead i think were nearing cargo what form it will take i havent a notion if we have to break the line for combat lets see mixed couples try to pick someone of a different guild to stand with now we cant afford to lose two of any category lets try to spread the damage all right anyone who needs to exchange partners nows the time sj up here with me the youngster whooped and raced up to stand next to the lore master some of the players scrambled around but alex and acacia stayed together the path narrowed and led through a slit in the rock wall owen braddon a cleric provided a gentle white glow to protect and illumine their way as they passed through a long roughly triangular tunnel the tunnel was cool and dry but there was slippery moss underfoot when it opened out again there was a collective sigh of relief they were on the other side of the mountain now heading into a wooded area filled with clumps of disturbingly twisted trees they seemed to be on a plateau and alex watched lady janet point to another range of mountains beyond and saw chester smile one tree stood apart from the others its branches spreading in all directions for a radius of a dozen meters looking at it seeing the unhealthy brown of its mottled limbs and the manner in which its roots crawled snakelike along the ground before burying themselves griffin felt fear again chester stopped the group with a raised hand and walked toward the tree a few paces he studied it carefully then came back sj he said brusquely i think that this one is for you weve got cargo subsonics sj nodded i can feel it okay weve been lured and warned how do we handle it im not sure chester was watching the tree with a practiced eye the cargo wont be buried under the tree that would be too much like last time he watched the branches swaying in the wind wait a minute the air currents here arent strong enough to move the tree that much look at the shadow chester sj pointed the trees shadow was behaving even more strangely it weaved out of synch with the movements of the tree the shadowbranches strained out spectral fingers pointing towards the caim of rocks about twenty meters from the tree stood a pyramidal pile of large stones sj margie eames and griffin come with me the rest of you stay back the quintet of garners walked slowly to the pile chester halted them and walked forward and around in a wide circle at one point he stopped backed up a bit then turned and came back to them all right you and eames take the far side margie you and griffin work this side lets get some of these rocks cleared away so we can see what weve got alex thought he saw a guilty wince crease chesters face when sj answered with a perky yes chief and bounded around to the far side something wrong here but what alex bent to the job of clearing the rocks margie as an engineer had to help supervise but at her age she could scarcely be expected to move the small boulders herself he grunted rolling away a stone what do you think of he heaved another aside of this game i mean so far heavens ive hardly had a chance to get into it im hoping that i have a chance to rig something really interesting before too much longer dont you get points for everything you do in the game of course but its more fun to do something elaborate besides the garners vote for bonus points at the end so it never hurts to be flashy chesters voice cut in on them dont worry margie youll have plenty of opportunity to show your stuff i certainly hope so dear she stepped around toward the other side of the fivefoot heap sj how are you chester moved quickly around to intercept her lets keep our teams divided until griffin watched suspicion chewing at his nerves margie ignored chester and walked smoothly around him to the other side chester took another step turning his legs were crossed when a rock rolled under his feet as he stumbled he grabbed at one of the rocks on sjs side from his angle griffin saw only a small white snake with red and yellow trim slide out of the pile chesters face went slack and pale as he saw it and paler still as it expanded its hood and reared back hissing kill it henderson whispered in a ghastly quiet voice his eyes riveted on the reptile alex hurled a stone at it the snake disappeared damn chester said it with intense feeling his face already pale had taken on a yellowish cast oh shit margie helped him to his feet what is it dear the snake didnt touch you did it it didnt need to oh no he seemed dazed and disoriented gina had broken away from the rest of the garners and was beside him steadying him dont you see he spread his arms wide there was a pale yellow glow all around him that was a biditaurabohaza im dead margie im walking dead by now the mass of garners had broken ranks and were grouped around him acacia pulled alex to the side did you see what happened why the hell didnt he scan that pile for danger griffin lowered his voice he knew it was there he tried to kill sj and eames out of the game he got caught himself rough justice whew so chester finally got caught a leashed chuckle i wonder how hell get out of it gwen stood by the rock pile concentrating with her eyes closed her aura glowed around her then spread to envelop the heap it too glowed white fading as gwen opened her eyes she glanced around at chester its clean now great he crooked a finger impatiently at the rest of the group all right lets see what we have here he motioned gwen and owen to his side pool your strengths do you think you can save me the two clerics meshed aura for a few moments then shook their heads the older man clasped chester on the shoulder im sorry ches its too strong for us the king was dying was that check or mate griffin asked what does that do to us is the game over chester flagged a hand impatiently no something that deadly that struck without warning and even worse a snake not after the hell i raised about the snow vipers hes too eager for a clean kill no hendersons gaze unfocussed and he scratched his side reflectively with a bony thumb no i think our mr lopez has prepared a way out for me hes having another of his little jokes bright red hair streaked with dust and one slender arm scraped from wrist to elbow gina had moved a good many rocks very quickly were almost finished hon she picked up her power staff and brushed it off what happens next we wait and see gina the lore master reached out an unsteady hand for her and when she took it he pressed it desperately hard against his cheek he looks like he thinks hes dying griffin thought he looks like he is dying how can he let a game do this to him as the rocks were pried loose or rolled away three wooden boxes surfaced faded stencilled letters showed and the garners began to laugh chester walked over to the others and in spite of himself began to smile still partially covered by pebbles and dirt there lay three battered cases of cocacola well children this is our way out chester said i hope he motioned to kasan and the guide jogged up without hesitation yes oh dying bwana are your cargo gods strong enough to save me from this disease oh most assuredly mr henderson the only real concern is what the gods may want of you in return for your life chester seemed only mildly surprised you mean the undertaking of the quest is not enough oh no you do it more for the sake of other europeans than you do for us simple island folk all right scan these boxes ah owen and bowan we dont want any more screw ups just yet the pile glowed white and green with no hint of red chester said open them margie produced a slender crowbar and with an economy of movement that was delightful to the eye she levered slats from a box sj and oliver attacked the others each box contained twenty waspwasted bottles of caramelcolored fluid warm all right were going to have to appeal to the gods of cargo that means we need to be as high and holy as possible for this group im afraid that means about three bottles each kasan held up his hands ah none for me bwana you can count me out of this one kibugonai deferred also as did lady janet im allergic to caffeine she said sweetly chester sighed then its four bottles each lets get started griffin sat crosslegged next to acacia in the semicircle gwen and owen were at the hub the opened boxes of cocacola at their sides hear us jesusmanup hear us godkilibob hear and observe they intoned slowly gwen opened a bottle and passed it to owen owen gave it to alan leigh leigh passed it to maryem it passed down the line until it reached chester at the far end gwen continued opening bottles until all held twelveounce containers of lukewarm cola we accept this thy sacred fluid into our bodies in thy names griffin gagged it down i dont like soda pop he whispered to acacia i dont drink this junk shut up and glug she whispered back not bothering to hide her grin youve got to griffin finished his and passed another bottle along what if i have diabetes then you can have your implant adjusted after the game drink she commanded ollie handed him his next twelve ounces griffin drained it stifling a heartfelt belch then he reconsidered and eructated with vigor the echoes were fearsome they seemed to go on forever down the line and back up after the fourth round moans could be heard from all corners tony looked green and had hiccoughs alex sympathized wholeheartedly whos ready for lunch maryems question raised a chorus of vile suggestions owen and gwen finished their drinks and sat amid a heap of empty bottles we are ready hear us oh gods the air above the entire group began to shimmer with electric white owen lowered his voice all join hands please owen and gwen faced each other interlocking fingers as they closed their eyes the aura jumped and crackled a birds nest woven of lightning the air sizzled with power griffin squinted against the glare his skin crawled the ground itself trembled a thunderous voice split their ears a sound that echoed to the far mountains and back yes my children the voice said with tremendous deliberation each word rounded and perfectly enunciated i know what you wish of us yes your leader may be saved he shall pick five among you quickwitted and wise to compete for his life i you win his life will be returned to him if not the voice faded away and the dancing glow lifted chester definitely looked more yellowish he rose unsteadily to his feet leigh acacia oliver gina and griffin he gazed at alex speculatively something tells me that you might answer questions as well as you ask them confusion ran unmasked on alexs face questions acacia took his arm comfortingly dont worry i think youll do fine the sky rumbled above them and clouds began to mass like soapsuds floating in a whirlpool they swirled together directly in front of the sun eclipsing it darkness fell and stars glowed above them then it seemed that the very fabric of space was twisting and torqueing tortured by forces beyond imagination the stars were rippled aside as the sky tore open soft pale blue light pulsed beyond the edges from the region beyond the sky came a tiny shadow that growled noisily growing larger by the second now it was plainly visible an olivedrab armyissue helicopter with its engine at full throttle it hovered above them then set down on the grass twenty meters away a dark man in a smart white uniform hopped from the door and ran to them carrying a clipboard he saluted chester smartly mr henderson i believe that your representatives are ready yes he said looking warily at the helicopter where are you taking them to heaven sir chester pointed in that surplus cargo sir we dont waste anything and now if your people are ready yali is waiting yali who is yali the man with the clipboard clucked disapprovingly he is your intermediary certainly you dont think you can get an ap pointment with god on such short notice be happy for a chance to speak with his district manager are we ready one moment chester spoke softly and hurriedly to his five representatives i remember a little about the new guinea heaven it was very european dont let that throw you the important thing is the questions good luck gina reached out for his hand and he took it for a moment squeezed then let it fall we wont let you down chester she promised he nodded silently his grin a lopsided slash the garners followed their host into the helicopter the door slammed shut the engine revved and in a cloud of dust it lifted off and vanished into the wounded sky chester watched the crack seal shut swallowing them now its wait he muttered its just wait chapter nineteen neck riddles we will be arriving in heaven in approximately three minutes the man with the clipboard said he had already taken their names down in a precise hand his name was gengai there was nothing to see but dense blue fog which strobed light leigh sat across the aisles from griffin elbows balanced on knees and chin balanced on fists griffin leaned toward him well what do you think were in for some kind of test of wits neck riddles probably neck riddles acacia bumped him on the shoulder with her palm neck riddles in olden days a convicted felon was sometimes challenged to answer a series of riddles if he won he gained his freedom sounds like a good deal what did the local king get out of it jollies mostly imagine a poor halfstarved and halfflogged todeath prisoner standing in chains at the royal court riddling for his life sometimes the prisoners did have something to lose hanging versus burning for instance how does that apply to us its only chesters neck on the block this time its everybodys without a lore master to lead us we dont stand much of a chance lopez knows that and he knows we know it and believe me hell take advantage of it the blue fog cleared and there were white clouds above and ahead of them one billowing cloudscape bore a classically boxylooking twostory house as they climbed to the level of the cloud griffin felt his load of cocacola become buoyant and knew that the copter was actually losing altitude they landed the door swung down for them the five garners stepped down into kneehigh white fog the surface underfoot was spongy the house nearby had white clay shingles and bamboo shades on its windows strains of vaguely martial music drifted from within griffin recognized the overture to bizets carmen he hummed along wondering where the insanity would end at the door they were greeted by a european manservant in coat and tails who bid them enter with old world formality gengai led them through a narrow hallway plush with white carpeting not a stick of furniture marred the path so that when their guide turned left into an open doorway griffin was unprepared for what he saw the room was opulent the ceiling was lost in distance the walls seemed to go up forever two of the four walls were covered in bookshelves a third wall was an enormous world map the fourth was hung with reproductions of classic works of art griffin recognized a picasso two dalis a frazetta frazetta well why shouldnt god borrow from the future to decorate his rooms but the paintings didnt really complement each other the room was furnished with wrought iron chairs interwoven with wicker and padded with leather the total effect was fabulous and slightly offcenter as if the designer was only partially familiar with the culture he was imitating they took chairs near the center of the room i dont like this acacia said its too polite were supposed to be lulled griffin drummed his fingers on the chairs arm he could pick out titles on the shelves and they were the same bizarre hodge podge as the chairs and the paintings there was a set of encyclopaedia britannica next to five years of ufo quarterly bound into leather volumes one whole shelf was filled with books in an international classics series of some sort directly below it were paperbacks in plastic envelopes the effect was mildly disorienting he should be trying to remember riddles he couldnt as a child he had never been tempted by riddles footsteps in the doorway griffin found himself straightening selfconsciously in his seat he refused to go so far as twisting around to see who was there good afternoon the mans voice was cultured studiedly so the footsteps came closer and the figure passed into his peripheral vision and to the wall map i trust that it is afternoon on earth ah good and your trip was comfortable fine fine he was a middleaged black man larger and stronger than most new guinea natives he wore a tropical shirt and razorcreased white plantation pants he clasped his hands behind his back and fairly pranced from side to side personal energy radiating from him like waves of heat i am yali and i would like to welcome you to heaven i hope you will enjoy your stay he laughed heartily as at a private joke yes i most certainly hope you do after all some of you may stay forever it is a nice place actually one of those infinitely rare situations where one is rewarded commensurately to ones efforts surely that is heaven by any mans definition again the vastly amused guffaw now that we are all friends do have lunch with me wont you yali clapped his hands and two beautiful dark women haloed in pale auras wheeled in twin carts laden with food oliver ran his tongue lightly over his lips i hope this isnt a trick suddenly i am famished me three gina echoed no tricks yali assured them please enjoy the two carts locked together and flaps folded out from the sides to form a buffet of spam canned pineapple crepes rice meat loaf corned beef and sliced white bread acacia leaned close to griffin it looks as if this whole place was designed by pulling random pages out of s womens magazines frightening isnt it griffin chose a light meal refused a charitably offered cocacola and returned to his seat yam bounced up and down on his toes grinning and griffin paused in midbite a piece of a childrens rhyme running through his mind and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws yali was unable to restrain his enthusiasm any longer i do not wish to interrupt your meal but just as your mouths must be fed so must your minds he tapped his head with a forefinger do you all agree there were no dissenting opinions and that was enough for yali i am sure you are wondering who i am and how i earned such a position of honor in heaven all right yam consider us mystified acacia ate while she listened i was born in the ngaing bush area of sor a member of the walaliang patrician and the tabinung matriclan during world war two europeans came and promised my people that if we fought the japanese we would be given all of the things that the europeans hadelectric lights automobiles metal tools tinned meat and so forth naturally we were excited understand that my people had lived a satisfying happy existence before the europeans came with their guns and missionaries they told us that the reason we were denied sophisticated technology was that we were descended from ham ham as you may recall was noahs son and after the flood he laughed at his fathers drunken nakedness im not terribly familiar with judeochristian myth patterns but i believe that ham no it was hams son canaan was cursed to be a servant of servants unto his brethren well being evil and natural slaves and all that we werent fit to have the secret of cargo were we so my people tried to conform themselves to the dictates of the church and we helped the europeans build roads and plantations and we dutifully marched off to war i was one of those who fought i died in the jungle and because i was a brave and virtuous man i went to heaven here i learned that godnot my god nor your god but god nonethelesshad always intended that we receive our share of cargo and that the europeans had been diverting our goods for their own purposes leigh asked and why didnt the almighty put a stop to it yali smiled benevolently because in his infinite wisdom he perceived that this was merely a skirmish between people of different cultures and that in time all inequities would be rectified and indeed this is happening now my people have learned the cargo secret and are using it for their own enrichment i due to my familiarity with both new guinea and the european acacia interrupted where did you get your knowledge of europeans an excellent question basic training for my army unit was carried out in australia there i was appointed area manager and given substantial training including a thorough course in grammar god as you may have heard has little patience for slang colloquialism or pidgin english naturally as soon as the political situation in melanesia is back to normal the natives will be able to address me in their own tongues for the sake of continuity however it is now convenient to take messages in english paper work you know were swamped with it griffin asked heaven doesnt have computers no yali moved up to the wall map and fingered a switch have you been wondering just where we are after all theologians have debated for centuries over the exact location of heaven some have said that heaven can be found beyond the stars some say it exists in the heart of man and others claim that it does not exist at all that god is dead or at least unemployed griffin stifled his laugh but you know otherwise absolutely the ffick of a switch turned the wall map transparent and it is my pleasure to reveal to you the true location of the hereafter beyond the transparent wall was a vast white cloud deck a hundred meters out a hole punctured the fluffy white the hole was about twenty meters in diameter and ladders rose from beneath resting against the edges light and darkskinned angels climbed up and down carrying packages heaven is situated directly above sydney australia naturally this opening is not visible to the inhabitants of the city we sometimes subcontract with australian manufacturers to create cargo for us some of our angels are presently exchanging goods with a jewelry company which is building a golden throne acacia raised one lovely eyebrow is this for him oh no its for me i asked him if hed like one himself and he said that it was just about the ultimate in kitsch you flipped the switch and the picturewindow became a map again but im sure that we have more interesting things to speak of matters of life and death philosophical things for instance can any of you tell me what a dozen rubber trees with thirty boughs on each might be at first griffin didnt understand then he felt the sudden tension in his companions it had begun oliver looked at the other four garners as if checking to assure his right to answer he cleared his throat that would be the months of the year quite right young sir and have you a question for me oliver considered yes i think so its in the form of a rhyme as i went over london bridge i met my sister jenny i broke her neck and drank her blood and left her standing empty the stout warrior looked at yak challengingly tell me who was my sister yali rolled his eyes to the ceiling such a fine meal youve just enjoyed would any of you care to share a bottle of wine with me he grinned maliciously at oliver rest assured that it wont be the same bottle our friend drank atop that famous bridge oliver looked only slightly chagrined close enough jenny equals gin not wine ah quite yali pulled a chair up and sat carefully crossing one leg over the other with exaggerated care it is said among my people that some things are improved by death tell me what stinks while living but in death smells good griffins mind raced as he tried to come up with an answer oh come now surely such clever minds as yours wont find this too consuming a problem yali smiled smugly leigh raised a tentative finger ambergris from whales they stink while theyre alive but when theyre dead you can make perfume from the ambergris yam seemed delighted very clever very clever indeed unfortunately we simple island folk rarely traffic in expensive perfumes the proper answer is the pig i believe that you people were treated to one of the succulent creatures two days ago such a delicious aroma when roasted but perhaps you feel i was unfair would you care to ask me a question in return the sorcerer thought hard for a minute then said all right riddle me this what goes through the door without pinching itself what sits on the stove without burning itself what sits on the table and is not ashamed he said it all in one breath and as he waited for his reply he panted slightly excellent let me think yali scratched his ear his eyes slid shut was he getting hints from lopez griffin didnt want to believe it yalis eyes flew open and his mouth formed an aha oval could it be the sun yes i rather thought it might his eyes rested with gentle malice on alan leigh who squirmed uncomfortably we may have further business later you and i now who is next acacia glared at him lets hear it yali so eager let me think what have we for the headstrong young lady ah i know what work is it that the faster you work the longer it is before youre done and the slower you work the sooner youre finished the laughter in yalis face was totally unreflected in acacias she beetled her brows and twisted a curl of dark hair around and around on a forefinger miss garcia im afraid i must insist on an answer ah weaving a basket the ffaster you do it the more mistakes you nuike and the more likely you are to have to redo it such inventive minds we have here today no im afraid that the correct answer is roasting meat on a spit dont you see the faster you turn it the slower the meat cooks and of course the slower you turn it the faster it cooks isnt that just a corker a corker acacias eyes were halflidded and there was an umber flush to her cheeks alex could almost smell the sulphur bubbling in her words all right yali try this one whilst i was engaged in sitting i spied the dead carrying the living she tossed her dark hair back with a flip of her head what did i see yali closed his eyes and hummed he drummed his heels gently against the white floor he scratched his ear mr yali acacia said curtly im afraid i must insist upon an answer he glared at her quite right miss garcia could it be a stretcher a stretched hide carrying a wounded man what an ingenious fellow you are and so quick with your reply a pity to disappoint you im afraid that the proper answer is a ship a vessel made of dead wood carrying living men she curtsied in her seat and yam smiled wanly well that helps your side a bit but youre going to need more whos next gina who had been lost in thought perked up for the first time griffin found no trace of a dreamy cloud in her expression even the fire in her hair seemed to blaze brighter ill take it so try this i know a word of letters three add two and fewer there will be gina buried her head in her hands and moaned at first alex was worried then he listened more carefully to the sighs and realised that they were phony oh my she said finally wiping her eye clear of a nonexistent tear the answer wouldnt be few would it her bright red eyebrows arched and her face screwed up in an expression of mockconcern yali nodded unhappily gina hitched her chair closer teeth showing whitely in her smile she resembled nothing so much as a cat on the hunt and alex found himself silently cheering her on her voice was warm honey i have a little old question for you dear i give you a group of three one is sitting down and will never get up the second eats as much as is given to him yet is always hungry the third goes away and never returns her smile became beatific who are they yali seemed very displeased he rose from his chair and clickheeled across the room blankeyed mumbling to himself ultimately he turned on his heel to face them yes yes i know time is against me i admit i have no answer oh im sorry the correct answers are stove fire and smoke were even again gina said sweetly so you are and you have one player left to go mr tegner or do you prefer griffin there was a peculiar gleam in yalis eye and alex knew that lopez was having his little joke in this context i prefer griffin he said very well griffin there is a saying you may have heard in your business whoever makes it tells it not whoever takes it knows it not and whoever knows it wants it not can you tell me what i speak of alex brooded in your business what did he mean by that as the griffin the thief as gary tegner restaurateur previous riddles had referred to food or as alex griffin dream park security head nice wide range of choices there whoever makes it tells it not why something illegal or immoral that would fit the thief and the security chief good whoever takes it whoever knows it if you know what it is you dont want it a restaurant owner might take black market meat if he didnt know what it was do you make black market meat or bad meat meat that wouldnt pass honest inspection pass excuse me griffin but im afraid i need an answer now get a hunch bet a bunch counterfeit money yalis expression went dull acacia reached out a warm hand for griffins and squeezed affectionately well right you are and do you have a riddle for me alex had finally remembered a riddle do as i say dont do as i do say boots without shoes yalis eyes unfocussed his lips moved silently repeating alexs words while alex sweated it out presently he said boots drown yalis teeth flashed like sudden lightning no he hadnt been sure well were exactly even five for you five for me unfortunately that leaves you where you started with mr hendersons life dangling by the proverbial thread oliver folded his hands neatly in his lap and squared his shoulders but the way that he chewed his upper lip before answering betrayed his nervousness what happens now i am going to ask one more riddle a tie breaker if your teams selected representative can answer it mr henderson lives if not he dies oliver was indignant but thats not fair you can make the answer as ridiculous as you like and if we dont get it thats the end quite so i recognise the intrinsic uncertainty in such a contest so i will offer you a sidewager if any of you will put your own lives up as a stake i will accept it in other words if you win everyone lives if you lose mr henderson lives but one of you dies the five were silent well griffin was thinking i cant im not a selfcentered coward im a detective i cant leigh stood drew in a deep breath and exhaled noisily i got us into this if i hadnt blown both points wed have won its only fair that i be the one bravo mr leigh such bravery such sacrifice such bullshit lets get on with it quite for your life then who makes it has no need of it who buys it has no use for it who uses it can neither see nor feel it repeat that please you should listen more carefully especially since the answer has special significance for you and yali repeated the riddle griffin found himself holding his breath leigh was stalling his puffy cheeks drawn with tension coffin griffin realised suddenly coffin coffin you idiot desperately leigh blurted a prosthetic leg for a blind child yali shook with silent mirth what an imagination you will certainly be welcome here in heaven no its a coffin mr leigh dont you find that dreadfully appropriate yali stretched his arms hugely happy to have claimed at least one victim well unless youd like to play more games the rest of you may return to earth mr leigh and i have business gina stood and took one of alans hands in hers thank you she said sincerely you didnt have to do that his mouth twitched trying to form a smile yeah well i might have done it better there was moisture glistening in his tear ducts and gina kissed him softly on the mouth im proud of you anyway she said acacia hugged him from the side ditto alan dont worry were going to win this for you kid yeah said leigh staring into the wall his face doughy and lifeless gengai appeared at the door were ready to leave now he chirped wait a minute griffin found his voice ragged he took leigh by the shoulder thank you alan the magic user managed to nod his head in acknowledgement its all right go on get out of here and win it we hear and obey mighty mage gina kissed him again on the cheek watch us itll be worth it the helicopter drifted away from yalis cloud looking out griffin could see a string of white factories on adjoining clouds white puff ettes rising from their smokestacks as they busily churned out cargo angels with multihued parakeet wings fluttered here and there carrying loads and a heavenly choir performed handels messiah in fullbodied sphericsound but all that griffin could really see or hear was leighs face red with the effort to hold back tears and a cracking voice that said and win it suddenly unaccountably that was all alex wanted to do chapter twenty the sea of lost ships it was hours by the watch imprinted on the cuff of griffins denim shirt the group had been back on the march for an hour and a half the line wasnt jolly a grim singularity of purpose could be seen in every face heard in every terse word maryem had tried to get songs going but the efforts had died stillborn finally she gave up her tanned and wrinkled face puckered with discontent their trail wound them steadily deeper into the mountains and this in part may have contributed to the sense of sobriety and unease griffin found himself gazing up into the crags with a chilling and undeniable feeling of approaching doom unbidden images of death and decay sprang into his mind and he shook his head irritated and upset subsonics and subliminal imagery he wondered lopez psyching us out maybe griffin had known it from the first this was a blood duel acacia walked next to him her hand occasionally finding his for a few moments squeezing then releasing as if she too needed the reassurance of physical contact he took comfort in knowing that his strange mood was shared although the path was broad alex found himself wandering over to the edge to look into the gorges below now mostly shrouded with mists there was no wind and it didnt feel any colder but it looked cold alex gave in and put on his windbreaker acacia was mumbling under her breath what did you say cas he tried to force warmth into his voice and it came out sounding just that way forced reflexively she moved closer to him and took his arm nothing meant for human consumption thats for sure she shivered i really am getting uptight and i dont know why we havent taken really heavy losses yet yet the replacement period ends tonight tomorrow and the day after well get hit with heavy artillery i know it alex thought about that is there any way to minimize the impact yeah dont make mistakes you can see how easy that is there are just too many ways to die in this game think about it how have we lost people riddles monsters natural hazards gunshot you know that doesnt sound like you cas wheres the get up and go it got up and went i know im acting strange dammit and i dont really understand it either she kicked a pebble out of the way dark eyes following it as it skipped across the road and vanished over the edge not falling but suddenly gone kicked beyond the hologram illusion of a misty chasm at their feet listen what if i told you that if you keep your chin up youll get a surprise tonight garyi told you that we shouldnt take things any further theres been enough trouble im not talking about trouble just a little harmless fun harmless huh fun just what do you have in mind everything but but what but taking things any further we can go as far as we went cant we she squinted an eye at him and what about tony if were off alone together somewhere not taking things any further we might as well be screwing that word was a jolt alex thought it over youre right either way okay either we dont go off alone at all or we take things wherever they go hows that sound indecisive gary there was a sudden jolt as the line came to a halt on a ledge seven feet above the trail there stood a slender dark figure at first alex was reminded of millicent the short tightlycurled hair the delicious figure and the skin tones were all similar but this woman was nearly a foot taller than little millie and millie would never have been found in that bold challenging stance she wore buckskin boots and beige leather pants with a copperbuckled belt she wore a red vest over a beige blouse and carried a businesslike dagger in a fastdraw sheath high on her left side the knapsack on her back rode as if weightless she stood fists on hips legs spread apart and braced firmly alex found her beautiful his lips pursed into an automatic whistling position who is she he asked acacia i think i saw her at the gamer selection proceedings but i dont know the name or the rank the tall woman jumped down from the ledge a miniscule wobble spoiled the illusion of a perfect landing chester greeted her holly frost i presume youve got it lover secondlevel thief firstlevel magic user and generally excellent lady she dusted off her buckskins by knocking them against each other and it looks like i arrived just in time what have we here a zombie march i dont see a bright face in the bunch what the hell maybe i should join the other team she turned as if to walk away then turned over her shoulder and smiled slyly on the other hand since i obviously have no competition here maybe i should stick around accrue a few points steal somebodys old man there wasnt a sound from the other garners although a few mouths hung open in shock then maryem pushed bowan out of the way and waddled over to holly gazing up at her like a demolition man examining a condemned skyscraper think youre pretty hot do you treetop i know it grandma maryem drummed her fingers on her waist for a few moments then her crinkled face split with a grin its high time we had some new blood these lackards are slacking off already think you can roust things up a bit or know the reason why good enough the little woman stuck out a grimy hand and they shook names maryem but you can call me maryem done holly looked at chester youre the man lets get this show back on the road in spite of himself hendersons tired face lit up and there seemed to be new bounce in his step all right group you heard the lady lets do it i want her with me mary said she glared at bowan why dont you find yourself another perch sonny she pulled holly in next to her you better be able to sing honey or im going to intimidate you half to death holly slapped her on the back do you know friar malone their mood was infectious soon the entire line was moving at a brisk pace singing a tale of the unlucky persona of an unskillful gamer of bygone days through dungeon and city both ugly and pretty went the brave lawful cleric named friar malone he whirled his warhammer gainst the vampires glamour crying down with the demon undead undead ohi alex noted that acacias expression was no longer strained and he was happy it seemed that everything was right again that the mission would be successful that how could he have forgotten rice none of this was real not the mountains nor the mists nor the warm arm of the woman at his side nor the happiness he had felt a moment ago but rice was real rices bound corpse was real and the garners sang with no sign of grief but a succubus found him and in her lair bound him and became the foul death of brave friar malone now his ghost stalks the barrow that he tried to harrow crying down with the demon undead undead oh but death had been real for rice and griffin would not forget it again the trail wound down out of the mountains cramping them between masses of granite presently it rounded a tight turn and griffin and acacia stepped out of shadow into a view of sand dunes and ocean acacia gave a low whistle and alex felt her hand tighten on his the garners had stopped and spread out downslope was a semicircle of bay it must have been deeper once the line of quonset huts along the sandy shore had once been navy docking facilities the docks were high and dry now and the buildings deteriorated and the harbor must have been two to three meters deep the water was littered with boats and pieces of boats broken airplanes both military and commercial ruined machinery of every description angular shapes halfway to the horizon might have been the bows of luxury liners sunk almost beneath the water one of the military aircraft had the grinning jaws of a shark painted on its nose others showed a fading red sunburst there was even one boatabout ten meters in length standing on its keel as it leaned against its rotting dockwith swastikas emblazoned on its flank the killer had crept past a big airplane on his path to rice and the neutral scent now which gamer was giving undue attention to the mired and broken airplanes trouble was everyone was intently studying the harbor except the griffin who was fruitlessly studying them now what in the world is a nazi patrol boat doing in the pacific holly frost murmured to acacia chester was conferring with maibang acacia called we want in on this ches chester nodded agreement that sounds fair lets gather round people the garners crowded around the lore master and he tapped kasan on the head youre on kasan maibang was nodding to himself i have heard of this place but never seen it have you lady janet the small blonde nodded her head then shook it not actually saw but i think i was brought through here on the way to the mission you know for the sacrifice the little mans eyes were bright and his grin managed to convey mystery and menace at the same time i think that the lady may be right in truth this place smells of evil smells of our enemies this is the sea of lost cargo where our enemy lures european transportation and robs them i want a close look at those buildings chester said then whats the matter fortunato mcwhirter had been shaking his head as he studied the harbor they dont look quite the ships and planes most of them are holograms why not we cant get to them anyway there wont be more than one or two solid mockups chester pointed like that nazi ship stands out doesnt it almost whistles for our attention i think well search there next very carefully gina sidled up to him danger ches you can bet half your points on it well split into groups once were down there one group goes in one guards he glanced at holly well lady we get to test you out a bit early are you up to it she said nothing but licked her lips eagerly maryem fairly vibrated in place alex nudged his companion looks like maryems met her match thatll take some doing well see the gamers spilled downhill griffin felt vaguely surprised to find that the incline was real curiously he was more disoriented than he would have been if everything had been illusion he looked above himself at the mountains they had just crossed and wondered how much of that was real and didnt know his unease vanished with the childish pleasure of running pellmell down the slope always just on the verge of toppling forward behind him sj dived into a roll and tumbled to the bottom whooping he sprang to his feet shook the dirt from his hair and adjusted the straps on his backpack wow that was fun he ran halfway up the slope again and tumbled back down bouncing to his feet like an elf shot out of a cannon when everyone had reached bottom chester began ticking people right and left sj oliver panthesilea griffin dark star and holly frost you come with me and maibang the rest of you stay with kibugonai and lady janet were going in well all right holly said her face deadly serious her eyes gleamed as they roamed the aged buildings that lined the docks she and griffin were the tallest people in the group and she gravitated toward him naturally youre the griffin she said appraising him i saw the spear cast you made on the nibek not bad at all mildly spectacular your names holly this is panthesilea acacia smiled at holly with an edge of challenge this is your first big outing my first first run ive done my share of straight gaming the tall black girl noticed the way acacia moved closer to alex and clucked loudly no need to get possessive honey i havent even decided if i want him yet acacia couldnt seem to decide how to react to that comment as soon as you make up your mind clue me in will you youll be the second to know there was a broad flash of teeth and holly pivoted on her heel to investigate the other members of the group im not sure why acacia said softly to alex but i think like her or i dont one or the other what i love about you is your absolutely fearless selfappraisal the garners moved in two clumps toward the docks bowan the blacks reveal danger generated only a wash of green light nothing threatened them then except the passive danger of the rotted wood they walked on the years had not been kind to the long arc of woodandconcrete docks nor to the quonset huts and smaller wooden structures but griffin noticed anomalies every line and cable was neatly coiled ready for use and rotting in place winch machinery was rustfree oiled and polished a riveted metal tank on stilt legs showed freshly painted letters aircraft fuel chester this place isnt abandoned i know griffin well have to watch for the owners coming back and ask ourselves why this place isnt guarded meanwhile that building no need to point everyone had already noticed that one par ticular quonset hut it might have been built yesterday the metal gleamed in the walk that led to the front entrance some of the wood planks had been replaced gina cast another reveal danger nothing the first team went in the rest hovered at the entrance ready for emergencies it had been the administration building wooden walls had blocked it off into cubicles with desks most of the partitions had been torn out the desks were still there but most of them had been lined against one long wall but the papers and coffee cups and ash trays were still on the desks some neat some messy and the desks had been dusted the great expanse of concrete floor had been swept recently the floor was cluttered with well stuff as if children had played here griffin thought while the teacher was gone there were big sweeping patterns drawn on the concrete a good representation of the dockyard and shoreline in green paint and an airfield overlaid in brown paint on the bay itself there were a dozen malformed little figurines made from gourds and tubers and wood there were flocks of toy ships and airplanes a rich variety of them some were crude representations with bamboo hulls or gourd fuselages and wings of clipped leaves but other craft looked like they had been bought in american toy shops or built for the offices of naval and air force officers a table ritual candles and clean tablecloth and fresh flowers and cans of corned beef and spam had been carefully arrayed on a big desk with four desk chairs around it a cargo cult magicians workshop holly frost said if we desecrate this place well put them out of business for a while yeah said chester maibang how would we go about skip it he went to the big front entrance and shouted margie chester see if theres any fuel in that tank we passed find a can and if it up take eames the rest of you start tearing up the boardwalks for wood desecrate be drowned were going to burn this place chester yeah griffin we dont want a bonfire advertising our presence i know that well set up the fire and touch it off just before we leave oliver and dark star moved among the desks looking for anything that might turn up sj began arranging a bonfire with wood handed to him through the entrance tony called from a far corner of the building chester two cases of cocacola save a bottle for each gamer smash the rest chester directed tony began smashing bottles with his gun butt presently eames and margie were back with three big gasoline cans margie was glad enough to relinquish her heavy can to griffin he began splashing the fluid across the painted map of harbor and airfield it didnt smell he splashed a bit on his hand and sniffed at it nothing he touched his tongue to it water he looked upand half a dozen garners were looking at him in disgust griffin continued distributing the gasoline he felt like an idiot of course dream park wouldnt permit a huge bonfire in gaining area a the fire when it came would be a hologram the small nazi ship leaned drunkenly above them as chesters group stood looking up the remaining gamers followed to within twenty feet and stopped they were well trained the ship didnt look all that stable forward bow sj said i bet if someone gave me a lift up id find a rope ladder and no need chester told him there are hand holds set in the side amidships you can do the honors as soon as i make a scan he raised his arms and chanted his incantation griffin found himself looking around at the others instead of watching the emerald fireworks someone else wasnt paying much attention either dark star was pretending to watch chester but she was carefully rubbing something out with her foot he watched her slow subtle grinding motion almost as if she were putting out a cigarette then she shifted her balance to one foot locked her hands behind her back and waved the inverted fist back and forth alex glanced back bowan was watching her hands intently a signal then signalling what when the green glow faded sj mounted the metal ladder and climbed aboard all clear here admiral he called and disappeared from view dark star was fourth in line to board and griffin arranged to be last just a second he whispered to acacia unobtrusively he wandered over to where dark star had been standing rubbed almost into oblivion but still discernible was an immense footprint it was all he could do to stifle a yell of surprise he scrambled up after acacia enjoying an excellent view of her trim posterior she helped him on board and he drew her firmly over to the side acacia why would you hide a clue acacia looked puzzled and he rephrased what i mean is if you saw a sign that indicated danger to the group would you have any conceivable reason for not telling the rest of us she thought about it well id be lowering the chances of survival for the other players that would mean fewer people to divide the group bonus with if we won hmm is that all well if you were the only one who knew what was coming youd have a better chance to prepare a plan of action youd look really good once the feathers started flying i guess you know that the garners vote a special point bonus for best player then there are points for bravery any monetary incentive only indirectly when youve accumulated enough points to be a game master or lore master then you can start making money her words held an unspoken question ill tell you later just keep on the lookout for a big monkey say what oliver came for them come on guys things are hotting up acacia reached out and stroked olivers chin feeling the threeday growth of beard you look terrifically fierce amigo i bet gwen loves it he playfully brushed her hand off come on he grinned they followed the warrior into the cabin where most of the garners were busy searching griffin noted that dark star cast frequent worried glances out of the windows a steel door stood open in the back of the cabin and narrow metal stairs led down into darkness maibang climbed out of the gloom followed by chester i think we may have something he said waving a roll of paper we found it wedged behind one of the engines they cleared dust and twisted scraps of metal from a table top and spread out the scroll chester arched a single thin eyebrow a map sj was squeezing his head between chester and the table and his little brown eyes lit up aerial survey map chief for once henderson seemed undisturbed by waters enthusiasm significance the engineer turned the map upside down and flipped it backwards before placing it right side up again dont seem to be any markings here chester was tracing a line with his forefinger down what seemed to be a river the map covered a mountainous region readily recognizable as new guinea preinversion he murmured anybody see anything interesting here alex scanned the map carefully from across the table differentiating the grays and blacks into jungle and plain theres a blank area about the size of a dime right there in that mountain range chesters gaze followed the pointing finger to a pale circle amid a patch of jagged lines maybe someone dripped coffee on it or water alex ran his finger lightly over the surface nope papers not rough there i think thats our clue henderson nodded ungrudging admiration and i think that youre right well then if its a clue then he paused scratching the threeday stubble on his chin if our illustrious enemy doesnt appreciate anyone speaking their names then just maybe they dont like anyone to find them either a spell intended to make them invisible just might backfire with a photograph leaving a blank area like this acacia was still puzzled but why a german boat chester waved it off visual contrast it tells us where to go it is in context though german spy planes and highaltitude cameras would have been ideal for supplemental flybys in world war two just a matter of cooperative technology kasan do you recognise this area the little guide hemmed and hawed for a minute then nodded his head and look here effendi we have a large body of water that would fit with what lady janet told us good good where is this hmm i believe there is a volcano in here but i cant find it it may be hidden in the blank spot may be chester seemed skeptical lets not expect too much from a poor native guide kimo sabe he said modestly trust me its there and if since its there i think we have here a halfdays march along the coast then inland excellent progress at last chester scooped up the roll and curled it folded it once and stuck it in his backpack holly frost sniffed the air lets have a danger read boss man i dont like this setup too much youre firstlevel magic you handle it much grass hear me oh gods she tried to spread her arms imperiously but her knapsack was ill balanced and she had to shift it on her shoulder she was totally unembarrassed reveal danger a green cloud enfolded her one edge of the cloud swirled with crimson light chapter twentyone the haiavaha the mood in the cabin changed instantly oliver was the first to drop his hand to his sword methinks its time to split he said peering out of the cabin right you are chester agreed women and lore masters first he was out of the cabin in three elastic steps hustle people he called back scrambling down the ladder im getting a tingle its coming and its big they bolted after him dark star looked grim edgy and alex found that worrying he pulled acacia to the side get ready remember what i said big monkey time monkey shmunkey she grinned drawing her sword just give me something to cut and i dont care if its king kong that of course had been griffins first thought they wouldnt really hit us with king kong would they i should let you sweat asking a question like that of course not dumbo this is new guinea not skull island different mythos just asking alex followed oliver down the ladder he felt the vibrations as soon as his feet touched the dock he lifted his arms to help holly and she fell back against him now normally i get along just fine handsome but in your case ill he felt her cheek against his grow taut holy hell griffin alex spun around and gasped two hundred meters away a light plane of some kind was taking to the air in pieces water surged and the dock shook with the impact of the waves a sound that started in the bones and radiated outward only belatedly recognizable as a bestial snarl grew in intensity until it hurt their ears they glimpsed a dark vaguely manlike figure rising above the water then sinking again behind a capsized ocean liner the liner trembled and the grinding wheeze of shredded steel filled the air oliver flashed a glance at chester what do you think ches how do we tackle it the lore master was peering out over the junked vessels with tiny frown lines crinkling his forehead we dont even know what the hell it is all i know is that that mothers strong he squeezed ginas hand hard and she flinched and angry honey how much time do we have before curfew she lifted a naked wrist no watch just about fifty minutes griffin volunteered chester considered he looked worried i dont really want to tackle that thing tonight were all a little tired and i think that lopez is counting on that well im going to surprise him and back off bowan the black face set in a mask of frustration pushed his way past oliver to protest what do you mean back off chester snapped what would i mean bowan i cant believe im hearing you right this is the second time youve had us turn tail henderson it doesnt look good on my record how would being on the receiving end of a massacre look on your record dark star had sidled up next to bowan she said you may not think we can handle it i do she turned to the others anyone else shall we do a quick vote itll have to be quick chester said the thing was wading toward them now leaving a white wake a river of water flowed from its fur smaller than king kong but much larger than a man it seemed a cross between an ape and a boar with a boars tiny eyes long snout and jutting white tusks wet the fur was almost black but the lank dry fur of its head and shoulders was red with bright orange and yellowwhite tufts its arms were disproportionately long the hands were underwater as it waded straight toward them chester said were short of ditheringtime okay i vote we run for it oliver ground his foot nervously sorry chester ive gotta back bowan on this okay gwen she held onto oliver silently the body language was clear alright who else griffin had chosen follow the lore master run but keep looking back we might learn something i agree said margie owen nodded sj seemed very unhappy one thin hand in front of his mouth brown eyes darting back and forth before he finally moved next to chester he knows something griffin told himself he caught acacias eye and motioned her toward him she gritted her teeth but she came holly frost was watching griffin with the barest of smiles pursing her lips the wheels turning in her head were nearly audible she stepped toward chester who nodded his appreciation airight he bаrked no more time for fencesitters decision time people eames joined bowan tony moved to join chester acacia tried to establish eye contact with tony but he ignored her maryem grinned rakishly now normally i love a fight but ill stick with my buddies this time she linked arms with griffin and holly chester took a quick count that does it outvoted bowan the blackgarbed figure gripped chesters arm and spoke low let me try a spell chester please you can start the rest running chesters eyes focussed on the oncoming monster abruptly he nodded try it if its quick his voice rose not much time people gina put a firebolt into that quonset hut the rest of you head for the slopes bowan had turned to face the bay he breathed deeply readying himself and raised his arms gina called on the gods flame lashed from her staff the navy headquarters building whooshed flames from doors and windows bowans voice was impassioned oh gods of darkness grim and cold deliver us from evils hold destroy this ape whateer it be and transfer all its power to me at the sound of the last line chesters head jerked around what green light formed a halo around bowan green light reached toward the monster in a narrow spear of destruction the monster snarled and waved a blacktaloned fist the bolt touched its face and fire lashed back along its length as if green light could burn like gasoline the halo enclosing bowan flashed from green to yellowwhite they heard the whuff of the fire catching and then bowan screaming curses from inside a tremendous candle flame bowan ran out of curses he stepped out of the flame and looked upslope to where the garners had stopped to watch chester there was pallid light around him now even his robe seemed white and his face whiter behind him the great flame stuttered and died away youve got to help me chester bowan called the boarape walked up onto the dock bowan flinched violently but it passed bowan as if he did not exist the lore master glanced from bowan to the advancing beast he screamed no time bowan youre already dead look behind you where flame had engulfed bowan the black there stood a neat conical heap of ash with black bones protruding dark star tried to run to the slain magician but chester caught her by the arm cant afford to lose you too get up the incline dammit the monster took one more step toward the fleeing garners then turned ponderously toward the blazing quonset hut it disappeared behind the building chesters eyes widened as he watched a plume of firelit smoke sucking itself back into the buildings doors and windows the flames went blackblackdwindled and were gone leaving not so much as a soot stain on the corrugated metal double damn chester whispered now thats a trick then oh he fished into his pocket and pulled out a teardropshaped crystal clear as ice with a bloodred spider frozen in the center he pointed it at the monster hear me oh gods i request a tracer a mark by which to find this beast on the morrow his aura flickered with strain but the talisman lit from within the spider crawling sluggishly to life got you he grinned at the monster dropping the crystal back into his pocket and tomorrow he turned and ran ignoring the dying sound of bowans voice the milkpale tindalo still standing with arms outstretched screaming damn you henderson ill get you for this you wait coward alex sucked air as if hed been underwater too long the ache in his chest was only just beginning to subside next to him maryem was bent double coughing her ruddy face even darker than usual these last five minutes he had run while pulling maryem along by her sword harness the monster had only given up the chase after the lot of them were totally exhausted henderson was on his side in the grass wiping sweat from his face with a wet dustcrusted sleeve gina lay sprawled beside him her eyes closed breath rasping in her throat mcwhirter was up and spreading his pack the gods knew where he found the energy hed been ahead of alex all the way even before maryem started to fall behind sj balanced on his knees dryretching he shook his head and looked at dark star venomously between coughing fits he was mumbling words that griffin had to strain to hear i knew it i knew i should have blown the whistle on those bastards i knew it professional reflexes triggered griffin rolled over and stood up though his head spun he walked over to s j waters and hovered above him waters looked fearfully up into a big black shadow griffin dropped to his haunches beside the boy he kept his voice low and matteroffact tell me all about it or we both talk to henderson wwhat do you mean sjs expression made the protest pitiful if i cant get it out of you maybe henderson can you were spying on bowan and dark star what did you see waters seemed to weigh his options griffin gave him some time then started to stand up wait griffin if henderson finds out he wont not if you tell it straight sit down before someone notices griffin sat all right the first night of the game everybody was hopping into the woods for some nookie hell man i just didnt have anything better to do so you played peeping tom you followed them why them oh bowans such a i mean the way he acts you cant imagine the mighty sorcerer with his pants off and dark star why would anyone chase her i just wondered about them so i followed them the only thing was they werent interested in fooling around they cut across the gaming area to where the workmen were setting up props and testing the holograms and they spied i just spied on them the workmen turned on the giant monkey and ran it through its paces i saw bowan and dark star go into a whisper on it and then they both scampered back to the daribi village theyve been waiting for that thing to show up ever since sj laughed they must have thought it was just a poor mans king kong his face had finally lost some of its beet color he hunched his shoulders really that was all there was to it his eyes pleaded and suddenly griffin felt sorry for him please dont tell chester huh honest to god i wasnt trying to cheat i was just lonely and thought id have a little fun please what sj had said seemed to fit the facts and it helped griffin patted his shoulder comfortingly i wont say anything you just stay out of other peoples business okay the engineer nodded with all the sincerity he could muster griffin stood walked a few paces away and flopped acacia got unsteadily to her feet and walked over to join him he held out his hand to her it was clammy and cold with condensing sweat her face was streaked with sweat and what looked suspiciously like tears she hugged him and said angrily god lopez made us pay for that for running she nodded can you imagine what that rout is going to look like on tape i wouldnt want to be chester right now maryems face turned angry what was he supposed to do acacia you saw what that hairy freak did to bowan acacia sank to the ground and stared at her feet they looked like the aftermath of a disaster alex was in good condition but it had been no picnic for him the damnable thing the haunting humiliating thing was the way lopez had toyed with them the monster had remained just close enough to keep them running and far enough back that they wouldnt turn and make a stand henderson was waving the group together with an unsteady hand kasan he bellowed he looked around for the guide kasan was having trouble getting up all right kasan what was it the little guide kept one hand on his chest and swallowed air before trying to speak i have no clue bwana there are many such creatures known to us clues ill give you clues that critters fur was the color of fire where it wasnt wet henderson stopped to pant then when bowan tried to steal its power it burned him crisp and we saw it make a fire bum backward arent those clues its power is fire what kind of fire demon have you got for us ah now i believe that i know what that creature was the legends of my people speak cut the bullshit dammit all heads swung around to face dark star who was wiping the wet from her eyes with the side of a clenched fist i just want to know what killed bowan henderson gave her a warning glance and she bit her lower lip furious even maibang seemed a bit upset i was saying that we have a legend that might apply the haiavaha nobody gives a good goddamn what its name is what was it she was shaking now her voice rising almost to a scream chester crossed to her in two strides and took her by the shoulders now you listen to me lady you and bowan wanted to have at jumbo back there in fact you wanted it so damn bad that it really makes me wonder i didnt like it then and i didnt like it when bowan gave us his little prepared incantation frankly i dont think hes good enough to come up with that off the cuff do you get my drift she tried to turn away from him but his slender fingers bit into her shoulders without mercy now you and i both know that i cant prove anything but so help me if you dont shut up and let the rest of us play this game the way its supposed to be played ill see to it that you join bowan the black the other players seemed embarrassed for them both dark star nodded her head silently a single teardrop drooling down her puffy red cheeks maibang cleared his throat politely um i was saying that my people have a legend about this creature chester had finally released dark star and had turned to face maibang it is said that centuries ago man was forced to eat his meat raw and lie helpless in the darkness of night he was denied the secret of fire fire was the sole possession of the gods who felt that such a gift was more than mere humans could safely control chester had his mind back on the game was there no fire at all on earth ah that is where the monster comes in fire could be found in but one earthly place the lair of the dread haiavaha whether itself a minor god or merely a watchdog for the gods was not known but when men shivered in the cold the haiavaha had warmth and where men depended upon the coming of dawn to rescue them from the clutches of night the haiavaha had somehow gained possession of a small piece of the sun and kept it burning in its cave many men died trying to steal the secret then one night a dog was beaten and chased away from the camp for stealing a haunch of pig and insulting the cookingwoman its master shouted that it could not return unless it could redeem itself the dog found the cave of the haiavaha and seeing that the creature was asleep snuck in and stole a burning branch the monster woke and came after the dog it ran for its life the fire burning its mouth horribly dogs have not been able to speak since that night but it escaped the haiavaha and brought fire to the village and ever after man has had fire i can guess that much but if this is the haiavaha what does it want from us maibang shrugged possibly it is still angry chester propped himself on his elbows thinking what about the way it made the fire burn backward our legends do not speak of that at all but in that case a smile spread like a slow dawn over chesters long face its still there to be stolen right you know its a pity that dog couldnt talk when it got back to the village youdve stolen it by now maibang was grinning too i believe we would at that the lore master seemed to be vastly pleased well its a damn good thing that i put a tracer on the haiavaha tomorrow well hunt that thing down he stood stretching now people lets pitch camp uncle lopez should be providing us with dinner any time now i think weve earned ourselves a little party what say a ragged cheer broke out and the gamers fell to unpacking griffin spread and adjusted his sleeping bag let the mattress inflate and flopped a moment later he was pulling himself to his feet business he looked around nobody was paying attention to him he sauntered towards the trees acacia glanced up and saw him a mischievous smile curling her lips hey there big fella if you want to wait a minute you can have some company modesty forbids my dear my kidneys are floating and an audience freezes the faucet she laughed and nodded spreading out her sleeping bag next to his alex thought warm thoughts chapter twentytwo the electric pizza mystery as soon as he was into the woods he fished out his wallet and flipped it on switchboard a reedy voice called patch me to security bobbick this is griffin alex put his back to a tree and tried to think somehow it was difficult to forget the fore and the haiavaha and concentrate on the reality outside gaming area a bobbicks voice was the link he needed hi chief i know youve been busy thats some pretty rough play im not sure its play at all listen what have you got for me bobbick didnt answer for a second and griffin thumped the communicator gently you there marty im here all right i just dont like having to say this oh man gruff weve definitely got murder on our hands christ alex muttered he sank his weight back into the tree and waited novotney confirmed it we knew that we had death by suffocation but there was a possibility that rice had a cold that blocked his nasal passages you know how he was always sniffling yeah well there just wasnt enough mucus to block the passages i think i can guess the rest someone knocked him out tied him up gagged him and held his nose shut until he died he slapped his forehead with the palm of his hand oh danunit i knew there was something i was trying to remember whats that last night that damn dream a fine upright boy he wouldnt have taken this sitting down oh good christ of course it was murder bobbick sounded confused ah im not sure i follow you chief listen rices wrists were abraded we know he was struggling when he died how the hell did he end up in a sitting position what sitting sitting dammit he was sitting up if he had been thrashing around he should have ended up lying on his side or on his back or anything do you realize how unlikely it is for him to just accidentally end up in a sitting position bobbick inhaled sharply i see what you mean griffin brooded im going to need to think on this some more what else do you have for me good news bad news and worse news first weve established the whereabouts of the a workers the night rice was killed and all of them are clean likewise for maibang everyone who took the voice stress test passed with flying colors but alan leigh hes clean i thought youd cleared him i had some second thoughts but if he passed the voice stress what else this orville bowanbowan the black is his listinganyway hes refused the lie detector when i told him wed have to abort the game he laughed and said it would serve henderson right yeah i guess that doesnt surprise me forget him hes clean great so are dark star and s j waters sounds like youre making progress whos left griffin had to count on mental fingers offie norliss his lady gwen not prime suspects but not in the clear either ah tony mcwhirter and acacia garcia he didnt like having to say that but it was true masculine vanity aside why was she sticking so close to the griffin and marymartha marymartha corbett thats the one im not sure about her shes been in gaming a before pulling a little bit of industrial spying off might just amuse her and that about does it okay one more thing bobbick said mifficent did some back checking she was curious about rices college life she got hold of the sulphur university newspapers for his residency guess what what the face on the statue we found it it belonged to one sonja prentice a coed who went to school with him griff she committed suicide just two months before rice left college now what was her statue doing in rices apartment alex mulled it it wouldnt be that startling a coincidence no opinion i wish we could ask rice griffin returned to the campground to find that kibugonai had ferried in a case of cold beer and maibang was lugging a crate into the inner circle when they levered it open gainers broke into unabashed applause there were loaves of hot garlic bread and six tremendous wheels of pizza with varied toppings owen braddon smacked his lips you know theres one thing about lopez he may fry you or drown you but hell never let you starve a line formed and disintegrated in laughing wrestlers and reformed there had better be one in there without anchovies the lore master laughed or im gonna lodge a complaint he seemed cheerful enough considering the beating he had taken today was he that sure of tomorrows target or was it just good politics griffin joined the line he tried to find the spot inside him that hadnt been shaken by bobbicks news the smile he wore was strictly off the rack and it wouldnt hold long against acacias prying he took a lions portion of pizza and snagged two beers acacia joined him at his bedroll and leaned back propping her plate between knees and stomach she munched noisily totally unashamed alex managed to talk around a mouthful of pizza im not sure but i think that this is my favorite part of this whole nutty business his hunger had teeth in it and the cold brew tasted unbelievably good acacia mumbled something that sounded like agreement and that was good enough for him he watched margie and sj finish setting up the campfire and let the warmth sink into his bones he was happy he had found that untouched spot some of the conversation around them showed nerves frayed by fatigue but the air of grateful relaxation was contagious lady janet seemed to be enjoying passing around the garlic bread alex wondered if it was an excuse to check out the eligible men now that leigh had been killed out she curtsied saucily in front of him smile a touch too predatory for his taste hot bread mlord she said in her sexiest voice sweeter than a virgins kiss thats what i like service with a simile he couldnt help but notice that acacia had moved an inch closer to him as janet made her play ill go for the bread and ill take the kiss on faith but she had served acacia and passed on desert stars shone in clusters sharp and bright on the black dome of gaming area a the night was windless a full belly moved him even further into an intoxicatingly mellow mood acacia nudged him you know i cant put my finger on it but youre both more uptight and more relaxed than you were yesterday he flared at her will you stop analyzing me for just a little while you make me feel like a bug in biology class wheres your dissecting needle ive got sharp teeth if that would help the anger had flared and vanished with no trace remaining alex chewed the inside of his mouth and tried not to smile now you young lady are what is properly known as a tease has anyone ever told you that and has anyone ever told you that youve got beautiful green eyes i mean talk about character they damn near match the green peppers on my pizza stifling a guffaw he tried to edge away from her whew just what is into you tonight she ran a finger down his arm her face deadpan do you mean right now or what am i hoping for later alex fell back on the sleeping bag laughing helplessly punchy he gasped fatigue toxins i think i like it the garners ate like starved wolves many had already finished holly and gwen were swapping lines from songs on the far side of the fire without a wind to stir it up the fire burned slowly and steadily only an occasional pop from an exploding green branch stirring up the ashes alex slipped his boots off and moved his feet closer to the flame he looked around noting that a few people were missing from the circle henderson gina mcwhirter eames and lady janet ahha what kind of little party was going on out there holly dragged gwen up to the fireside and broke the air with a loud cough hey listen people how many of you know that we have a celebrity in our midst a few boozy cheers egged her on this young lady actually has a couple of nashville albums and i want to get her singing for us maryem in particular led the shouting approval gwen looked terrified uh i only sang backup on a few tracks ollie she swallowed hard eyes begging him to get her out of this ollie didnt notice he waved her on go on gwen hey people shes really good there was something in gwens eyes that alex didnt like at all a touch of genuine fear that touched him deeply part of him wanted to tell everyone to leave her to hell alone he restrained himself dont be conspicuous griffin dont make waves wishing he were someone else maryem jumped up grinning eartoear oh come on honey holly an ill help you through it do you know the fighters lament the garners roared their approval and maryem linked arms with gwen holly on the other side and began to croak out a tune gwens high sweet contralto finally wavering from an unwilling throat i once had a sword or should i say it once had me i just picked it up oh what a sword it was plus three its ego was twelve a fact of which i wasnt aware then i tried to leave and i found that the sword didnt care oh gwens voice faltered but the garners most of them roaring along to the tune of an obscure th century ballad didnt notice at all i walked through the halls wasting my time nothing to find then i turned a corner and then i said oh no undead the thirtytwo wights saw me coming and started to laugh and i closed my eyes as my sword started hewing a path oh gwen abruptly tore herself away from the other women and ran from the firelit circle with her hands covering her face ollie gaped in astonishment he rose and ran after her holly and maryem were shocked and maryem started to follow the sobbing girl but holly linked arms with her tightly holding her forcing her to sing on and when i awoke i was alone that sword had flown now i use a club isnt it good noego wood maryem disengaged herself from holly and looked up at her at first she didnt say anything then im really not sure that this was a good idea holly frost laughed oh come off it mary who could have known the little thing would be so skittish i could have you could have we could have listened she said she doesnt sing in front of an audience holly stepped back and regarded her uncertainly well arent we being a little goodygood this evening i didnt notice you defending her the two stared at each other for a tense moment then holly turned on her heel and walked away oddly the other garners had noticed little one clump was singing another surrounded owen and margie who were speak ing of older wilder looser games doors that could open anywhere in space and time one afternoon we were running the khronal dungeon and we opened a door and found ourselves looking out into the living room where we were playing one of the characters shot the game master with a crossbow bolt and the whole dungeon disappeared more beer was being consumed the last of the pizza was gone couples were breaking away from the fireside to find privacy but maryem seemed for the first time that griffin had seen her totally unnerved eames wobbled out of the woods a beer in his hand plastic smile stretched tight across his face he leered at maryem and she folded her arms tucking her hands in her armpits what are you staring at eames he laughed when he spoke it was in the ingratiating tones usually reserved for idiots and children whats a matter huh isnt she feeling himself tonight the other voices died griffin felt danger tightening in the air are we all going crazy he wanted to scream a warning then acacias hand was on his neck stroking him it felt very nice very comfortable and suddenly he could do nothing but watch let it happen he thought hes an asshole anyway he shook his head like a drunk going down for the third time and wondered what the hell was in that beer eames said you know maryem i dont like you at all you are one of the homeliest most ridiculous little witches i have ever laid eyes on and i wish maryems fist shot out like a piston almost level catching eames squarely in the groin he whoofed air and doubled over swinging a wild reflexive haymaker maryem went under it and came up snatched two handfuls of eamess hair both of her feet left the ground as she rammed her knees into his face earnes shot upright and stumbled back with his face covered in blood back into a corner of the fire he did a ragged hop trying to stay clear then his mind gave up trying to guide his body and he did a slow spiral to the ground onto his knees then fiat on his bloody face maryem looked at him and tears began to stream down from her eyes she wiped at the streaks with a chubby hand then walked unsteadily to her bedroll and collapsed into a ball sobbing everyone stared then embarrassed turned back to their own little groups and couplets griffin felt a vague urge to get up and do something but once again acacias hand dissuaded him dont worry she said her mouth close enough to his ear for him to feel the heat in her breath theyll both be all right he tried to find surprise indignation any emotion more appropriate than the one that was starting to stir all right then whats on the agenda more songs she took his face in her hands and brushed his lips with hers se algunos juegos para mayores hombre she whispered griffin spoke little spanish but the message in her eyes needed no translation at all he had trouble finding his voice lets go play pathfinder shall we her smile was hot enough to scorch she rose then bent and demurely collected her bedroll she glanced up and said with halflidded eyes i think we may need this he felt giddy dizzy and not totally sure of what he was doing as he nodded gathering his own bag under his arm together the two of them walked into the darkness and kept walking until the campfire and its noises were far behind them acacia kissed him gently almost shyly here he spread his sleeping bag down in silent agreement they linked the inside edges together and sat next to each other eyes locked wonderingly i didnt i really didnt think that this was going to happen gary she shied away an inch and he reached out his hand he knew what he should be saying and he forced his thickened tongue to say it it doesnt have to if you dont want it he tried to mean it we both know better than that she seemed to want to say something but he stopped her by leaning forward the kiss seemed to go on forever and what logic was left in alexs head dissolved together his blood seemed to fizz she held him and he could feel her nervousness help me gary i dont understand it i dont i want you but i dont know whats happening to me there was no strength in her voice she sounded like a little girl but her skin was smooth and hot and he couldnt stop touching her excitement and wonder burned in her eyes as he helped her off with her clothes and she clung to him fingers digging into the muscle of his shoulders when at last he pulled the bag over them both and took her in his arms she closed her eyes murmuring only please please gary gary not alex he paused unsure gazing into eyes that were afraid he felt the fire that roared in his mind and body and from somewhere gathered the strength to pull away somethings wrong here shes notthe crazy way the others werelopez wouldnt drug us but then she rolled hard against him and the questions were wiped away as they began to move together the same fear the same wonder he felt was in her eyes too but there was something more now something that began to build until at last it clouded his vision and for a while in that moment without time there were no longer two people who strove and sought there was only one body with four limbs that found a rhythm of its own when the everlasting moment was over when he held her and she buried her face against his chest and cried he stroked her hair and looked into the darkness surrounding them both and doubted his sanity i cant be feeling this he thought i cant but the words rang hollow even to him presently the force took them again with equal power as if the whole universe were moving in them irresistibly afterward he held her and she held him and together without words they waited for morning chapter twentythree black fire birdsong woke him real or recorded alex opened gummy eyelids and looked into the face of the woman sleeping in his arms he watched her for a bit almost holding his breath her breathing was slow and even and she wore a slight smile a smug smile unbidden his brain called up vivid tactile images of last night my god he thought disbelieving that was one hell of a powerful experience he watched her face tenderly and wondered when she would wake up then more memories intruded eames malice gwens fright maryems tears they fell into a pattern neutral scent why didnt i see it because my brain was running on neutral scent and it activates emotions already there omy god he shook acacia until she stirred and clung to him making babysounds her lips curled in a satisfied smile her eyes opened they seemed huge to him and it was all he could do to merely smile in return morning handsome she yawned she snuggled closer to him in the bag you certainly know how to treat a lady wish we had time for thirds well im starting to remember things wed better get back to the others we could be facing a disaster he wriggled out from between the bags and stretched the cool windless morning air sweeping away the remaining cobwebs acacia watched the bag pulled up to her neck as he pulled on his pants you sure we have to get back she still seemed halfasleep alex nodded and pulled his sleeping bag from atop her she shivered and yelped scrambling for her clothes she was saying something to him but he wasnt listening why why would a thief waste something so valuable on a vicious practical joke not until she threw her arms around his neck did he snap alert hey there you youre strange i mean really odd but i like you anyway she bunched up her sleeping bag and tucked it under an arm she had to run to keep up with him and some part of him felt sorry that he didnt have more to share with her but sorry or not he had to deal with something far more urgent the thief knew who he was he must have used some of his stolen flask of neutral scent to put the griffin out of action while while what what was the thief doing last night the campground was a mess gamers littered the ground sj had gotten sick on himself maryem lay on her side beneath a twisted old tree far from her sleeping bag dried tears streaked her face owen and margie lay close to the ashes of last nights fire half out of their zippedtogether bags both naked their clothes piled untidily about them adrenalindoped blood pounded in alexs throat too few where are the rest eames alex spotted the warrior curled up with captured princess check chester slumped sitting up with his face between his knees and tony was splayed out near the lore masters feet snoring loudly his twisted sleeping bag must be half strangling him red scratches laced his cheeks s j waters in his bag sleeping like a baby gina missing now what was gina doing away from chester maibang and kibugonai missing maybe getting breakfast what tendencies in an actor might be accented by neutral scent gwen ollie cas do you see ollie or gwen or maibang maibang left when the game broke off last night gwen and ollie generally go off in the bushes anyway but she looked worried now ill go after them good anyone else you find too acacia pushed off into the brazilian plant life calling chester hendersons head jerked upright he wiped his eyes clear with the back of his hand and looked about him the sense of something seriously wrong came home to him and when he saw alex he frowned the lore master pulled himself up and paused a moment to balance all right tegner what do you know about this i dont know much i know we were all crazy last night and i dont think it was the beer henderson still seemed woozy he jumped up and down a few times to get his circulation going and surveyed his gaming party what a mess if lopez spiked those pizzas he shook his head thats too crazy he reached down to shake maryems shoulder griffin took his cue and woke up eames checking the big mans face for damage there didnt seem to be much more than a badly split lip earnes winced the first time he tried to move then got up moving like an old man and went over to maryem they sat down together and spoke in low voices by now most of the garners were awake and moving neutral scent didnt leave a hangover not a physical hangover anyway gina came wobbling in out of the woods and griffin cocked a curious ear when chester went to meet her the lore master reached a hand out to her stroking her red hair and she huddled at his chest axe you all right gina she nodded wordlessly i really dont remember much after you got into logic puzzles with j the power of their ancestors tindalos they swore to defend their cargo until all of the european thieves are dead or all the fore they they bragged about what theyd do to you one of them offered to give me your private parts she said with evident distaste that was for my benefit partly but they were going to fight they meant it they were egging themselves on then where are they lady janet shrugged shell be one hell of an actress alex thought shell be too good for gaming will she give it up the garners bunched up around them acacia dropped with her back against alexs knees but her head was up alert for the next attack the enemy had last been seen hiding among the trees at the volcanos base where were they now chester stood up everybody got his breath back they charged up the last fifty meters to the rim each screaming his own war cry at the lip of the crater they paused feet skidding in the loose rock a few wisps of steam floated within the bowl obscuring part of the view but the crater seemed as deserted as the slope nothing human showed at all chester ordered ollie gina stay here with lady janet the rest of us are going in crevices in the rock vented more steam as alex slid down into the mists the rock was loose enough to make him cautious but the incline wasnt as severe as he had feared digging in with his heels stabilized his balance the body of water at the bottom was not much bigger than a pond it steamed gently he caught chesters eye still no defenders i dont like it either here owen called and alex turned to see the older man scrambling towards something dark and eggshaped alex checked sideways and up towards the lip for visitors again and followed braddon as the shape became clearer griffin felt a chill the fins attached to the blunt end said bomb so clearly he could almost hear it tick the others had caught the same message their headlong rush slowed to a cautious advance at last they stood in an uncertain semicircle about the bomb it was darkly corroded metal a pointed cylinder the flat rock it lay on had been positioned like an altar and draped with white cloth a parachute a glass jar held fresh flowers even sj looked a little disconcerted what in the world do we do with this chester he edged closer to it to within five feet but still couldnt bring himself to touch it can we carry it out this baby has to weigh two or three hundred kilograms margie i wouldnt know how to move it chester across flat ground maybe her eyes lit up wait just a minute how did the black hats get it in here in the first place good thinking it had to be magic chester walked around the bomb in a decreasing spiral fascinated i dont know if we have enough power though tony was giving the bomb plenty of room maybe we dont want to fool with it at all maybe lopez just wants an excuse to blow us all up but sj had moved in closer and now he was actually touching the smooth surface eyes closed as if trying to sense its internal workings chester he murmured then louder chester why cant we just extract the plutonium and take that with us its got to be almost as valuable as the whole damn bomb and lots lighter jesus waters you want to fry us all or did you bring a ton of lead shielding i thought maybe the black fire chester hesitated then no radiation isnt fire hes got the right idea tony insisted we dont have to steal it wreck it make it useless for the enemy chester shook his head good common sense but our mission is theft but look at it well never move it magic the lore master said im not sure i like it but its the only way out that i can see itll take everything that we have and by the time weve got it out well be down to the dregs of our magic gina carefully walked closer to the bomb nose twitching the heat and steam chester that thing could be pretty unstable maybe leaking radiation too acacia seemed almost reluctant to say it instantly the garners shied back a few feet abight then we need a continual danger scan on this while we try to move it margie you and sj work out a way to lower it once we get to the lip damn margie cursed sedately i broke another fingernail try keeping your fingers out of the knots waters laughed cinching the line tight they had rigged guide ropes around the bomb that ran up to the crater rim with luck they would turn the moving job from an impossibility to a mere backbreaking task chester had sent acacia up to the top to substitute for gina who had entered into deep meditation with chester in preparation for the attempt when they rose they both seemed holloweyed and deadly serious tony was making them all nervous the way he kept watching the rim with luck we could get it almost to the rim before the enemy jumps us well get warning ollie told him wed still be afraid to let go of the bomb wont we while theyre killing our three scouts lopez doesnt make it easy ollie granted him wish youd stayed home tony didnt answer chester called are the lines tight he moved into position beneath the bomb without waiting for an answer the rest of you get on the lines as soon as the reveal danger spell is in force start pulling gently but evenly gina and i will do what we can were well ahead of schedule troops if the gods and he lowered his voice to growl through his teeth and lopez gina nudged him and a faint smile finally cracked through his mask of fatigue are willing then we will taste victory today griffin got into position on line directly behind owen do we get a prayer from the padre owen tested the line grunting good lord help us move this mother amen good enough a weak green glow surrounded the shape of the bomb growing slowly more distinct chester and gina stood erect faces shining with sweatfrom exertion or the heatand down the middle of the emerald wave they projected came a darker thread of green it pulsed and sparkled within the lighter hue like a vein of green blood and when it touched the bomb the casing trembled now sj put his back into it even as he called the stroke and alex bent to the task feeling good to have an understandable physical task in the midst of the makebelieve the rock beneath the bomb crackled and flakes of it fell away sliding down the slope towards chester and gina henderson had closed his eyes and his hands were outstretched the green darkened and more rock slid away mcwhirter snarled and heaved his long gymnasium muscles stood out like an anatomy diagram the bomb shifted and rose several centimeters and the garners loosed a cautious cheer owens foot slipped a fraction and he had to move nimbly to catch himself he turned his head and grinned at alex then yelled pull pull his mood was infectious and suddenly the whole group was laughing and sweating in the steam the pale green aura blinked and went red hold it chesters voice was frantic and the tension left the lines so fast that the bomb almost slid back down the incline sj crept closer to the bomb and swallowed hard its ticking when he turned to look at them all of the color had left his face the bombs red aura was darkening smoothly toward black part of his head went dark as he leaned close chester i think its gonna blow shadow had entirely engulfed the bomb henderson was incredulous an atomic bomb he cant do this just what the hell does lopez want from me theres no way wait a minute alex could see wheels turning behind his eyes the black fire everybody empty your pots onto this thing margie youre carrying ashes dump it itll stop the priming charges who else has black fire or ash whos got guineveres pack dark star and holly still had antifire and they snatched up their packs and dumped them out fingers shaking with excitement as they searched for the makeshift firepots ollie dumped the ash from gwens pack onto the corroded casing the blackness began to spread through the ash sj margie heap it on whilewhat the hell are you doing waters had pulled a leverage bar out of his pack and was prying at a hatch in the nose of the bomb we cant just pour the stuff on chief weve got to try to stuff it as close to the primer as possible his voice was shaking and his skinny arms jerked almost spastically as he fought with the panel the ticking stopped griffin hesitated only a second then rushed to help get out of here gary sj panted i can do this myself stop trying to be a hero friend griffin yanked the bar from sjs hand and squeezed it into the narrow crack leaning his weight against it distantly he heard chester telling the others to clear out the door popped open alex sniffed odd thanks and get out sj hissed grabbing the bar back no sooner said griffin slapped the engineer on the back and hightailed it the gravelly surface of the slope gave that stomachsinking twoforwardandoneback traction of a sand dune but alex sprinted anyway wondering why they ran he had sniffed cordite and hot metal the primer had abeady gone off the bombs explosion was retarded only by the black fire how could they outrun an atomic explosion just below the volcanos lip he looked back sj was still shoveling antifire and ashes into the hatch and had pushed margie away she said something to the boy that alex couldnt hear and waters snapped at her she ran stumbling up the slope owen went down after her to help her the last several yards to the top they both arrived gasping and that cleared the volcano except for waters run you littie idiot henderson bellowed and alex was surprised to hear his own throat echoing the words tony mcwhirter was already a good way down the slope hauling acacia behind him by one arm alex heard him shout back at them come on the others were bounding after him and alex joined them he was halfway down when a voice called from above keep going keep going he looked back over his shoulder and saw sj at the rim of the volcano just as the airplanes egg hatched it outlined waters with a halo of light and flame the ground shook as if a giants palm had slapped the earth and then the sound came alex lost his footing and tumbled falling across a split rock that began to gush steam he fell into holly frost who frantically tried to regain her balance before cascading with him in a rolling heap everywhere geysers of steam erupted from the ground and he managed to roll around them more by instinct than thought by the time he reached the bottom he was totally out of breath unnerved elbowskinned but otherwise alive he got to his feet and dusted himself off coughing looking for bodies to count miraculously there were no black auras then he remembered and his eyes searched the top of the volcano for a certain young engineer it was difficult for him to deal with what he felt at that moment hope fear anger and what else all of them absurd all of them real as a cut finger he saw a plume of black smoke rising rocks rolling and nothing else sj was gone acacia read his mind he knew he wasnt going to make it gary griffin fought with his emotions all right dammit he knew but did he know he was dying for nothing what do you mean hes right acacia henderson had the same mixed emotions warring on his face that was no atomic bomb even in they werent that small wed all be blown to hell and back well then what decoy dammit another decoy he watched the smoke churning at the top of the flattened peak that crazy little bastard hes going to make a hell of a lore master one day he shook himself out of it most of the garners were back on their feet although none of them looked too steady they clustered around chester like little children around their mother numb disbelieving and confused holly rubbed a scraped knee what now ches there was no sass in her voice regroup and rethink i guess we had better go back for maibang he tried to force some life into his voice but griffin saw the shallow backward glance toward the top of the volcano and knew what he was thinking three down and the day was yet young the brush was blackened and burned away and great pockets of earth were tarry scorch marks where did we leave him acacia asked her voice whispery with ugly anticipation alex could only guess there used to be a patch of shrubs around here and a group of low trees the group was about to spread in search when dark star waved her arm they followed her toward a cluster of black fingers standing up from black ground charred trees still standing there they found maibangs smoking bones gina sat down and cried henderson poked in the ashes with the tip of his toe as if looking for something some tiny symbol of victory in the midst of stunning defeat then he too slumped to the ground and stared off at the horizon silent and drained the haiavaha it had found the little guide and had finished what the fore started chester was muttering to himself so softly that griffin almost thought himself imagining it ever faithful gina came to his side and massaged his shoulder trying to comfort he flinched away at first then began to relax some of the tension draining from him the other garners seemed to go into neutral waiting for their leader to unscramble his thinking griffin fidgeted then plopped down next to henderson listen he said we need to talk we have some unsolved logic puzzles here i dont know any of the answers but ive got some interesting questions chester didnt look around all right shoot griffin paused to collect his thoughts he ticked off questions on his fingers first the bomb in the crater was just an ordinary bomb wheres the great superweapon the ghost marines told us about the one that was supposed to help win world war ii second why werent the enemy guarding their egg if they valued it so highly just where were they third if the superweapon is hidden somewhere why wasnt there a second blank spot on the map dammit why was the first blank spot there if we couldnt get anything of value at the volcano why did maibang get killed off like that without any chance for us to save him i mean if hes a vital part of the game how could that happen he paused in frustration or does any of this make sense it has to make sense tegner henderson ground his teeth together lopez isnt crazy he cant wipe me out like this without some way out the rules dont allow it henderson scratched a line in the dirt with his toe lets see if we can make sense from this jumble lets start with maibang lopez practically murdered him outright i think we can assume that was orchestrated it was in the script from the beginning all right why it means that we already have the answers we dont need maibang anymore have the answers hell we dont even know what were looking for no but look maibang got us as far as the volcano there was nothing of value at the volcanoof value to us that is according to lady janet it was quite valuable to the enemy so where were they defending something more valuable thats where defending the real cargo henderson was beginning to smile griffin felt the gears turning in his own head as he fought to keep up then we were lured to the volcano because it was near the real cargo maybe so maybe no you were right there should have been a second blank spot we examined that map was there a second blank spot i looked no then mmm its in a bigger blank spot the ocean in it underwater in on over whatever maibang takes us by the sea road the volcano is within spitting distance of the ocean it has to add up otherwise lopez has lured us halfway across new guinea for nothing and that i dont believe well griffin scratched his head genuinely puzzled what the hell is it chester laughed out loud drown me if i know maybe a new submarine or some kind of spy plane maybe even the one that took the map photos it could be any friggin thing and i dont care he stood up and stretched grinning i dont care because i know its there i can feel it tegneri think were all going to get some answers before todays over chapter twentysix the laughing dead myers watched over their shoulders as the lopezes worked mitsuko lopez was talking steadily into her mike one of the screens showed troops forming up near shore eight dark men and women horribly mutilated by makeup all listening to her instructions in their earphones richard lopez nodded nodded interrupted rarely while his fingers and feet raced over the controls hologram figures danced in response on a second screen lurching among the dunes and into the trees vanishing there to reappear at the shore and begin their march again they were horrible these ghosts long dead and half disintegrated some giggled uncontrollably and twitched like marionettes richards lips pursed his fingers blurred and myers watched a longdead zombie being dismembered by an unseen sword richard nodded to himself the woman whos missing a leg and an arm ms metesky whispered in myerss ear thats gloria washington she got caught in the antarctica ciudad collapse and lost both limbs to frostbite she took off her prostheses for the show of course she loved the idea but ill never understand where chichi got the nerve to ask her myers said looks like your husband is getting ready to kill them all off lopez heard and answered henderson should have kept some of the antifire why are some of the actors giggling like that kuru suddenly richards fingers were flying again kuru didnt tell myers anything he nudged you can justify it of course richard laughed now holograms and fleshly actors marched together the actors trying to match the lurching walk of richards constructs richard lopez turned for an instant myers its there for justification shows i did my homework have you heard of kuru the laughing sickness look it up you get it by eating infected human brain tissue it causes convulsions and an exhausting hysterical laughter the fore used to get it some of our zombies obviously died of it myerss stomach lurched its real quite real or used to be the fore havent eaten human meat since the last century as far as anyone knows that areas mostly a tourist trap these days but about half the women used to die of kuru and a fifth of the general populace the fighting men got the best parts of the missionaries leaving the brains and ah chitlins for those with less status women children the old ones richard let it trail off on another screen henderson was leading his gaming party down out of the burned area owen braddon at the tail suddenly turned and bounded back uphill he scooped up a blackened skull and jogged to rejoin the party the lopezes turned to each other grinned nodded myers was minded to ask but richard was talking again can you imagine how long they must have been eating each other if a disease evolved to take advantage of it its extinct now we think griffin watched every bush every tree waiting for death it was going to be bad already he could hear the murmur of surf they must be close dangerously close penny acacia said and her voice scrambled his thoughts he knew only that he spun half around his hands strangling the rifle stock aiming the gun at acacia momentarily he felt foolish then he saw the fatigue in her face and knew she understood the garners behind him had no spring left in their step he could see their fierce determination but no sign of confidence anywhere what next what the hell is he going to hit us with next thats the way to get killed acacia said soberly theres no he to hit us with anything stop trying to play it and live it she was exasperated gary you drive me crazy one half of you is just dying to jump in headfirst and the other half stands back dunking toes if you could just stop wondering weighing planning he managed to find a genuine laugh youre a fine one to talk we play twenty questions every time we say hello touchй maybe neither of us has been very real something went out of her voice as she looked up at him what if it had been for real gary if what had been real this us there was no overt movement but suddenly she was closer to him not touching not even looking at him now but there and the air was charged were a little deep in the bullshit to try to sort this out now maybe well still think its worth talking about after this is over her eyes probed the bushes too pointedly and he felt the warmth in the air go away maybe somebody giggled far ahead whats funny he wondered but acacia had frozen the giggle came again hey that wasnt a gamer it wasnt close enough and besides that it was wrong it was strained broken like the helpless painful laughter of someone forceably tickled tickled until the humor was gone until the nerves beg for release it made him cringe just to hear it and it grew steadily louder chester snapped commands oliver to the rear nonfighters to the center of the column its coming so get ready they moved forward slowly alex heard shuffling footsteps they came in odd rhythm with the laughter a pained chuckle then a dragging step a hiccough of bizarre mirth and another plodding thump and the first one appeared he stood five and a half feet tall dressed in brown rags he laughed and a hideous grin split the blackened face and the whole body shuddered in his right hand he carried a machete maryem measured him hes mine she broke away from the line and walked warily toward him her blade well in front of her griffin could see her opponent more clearly now like the native alex had ambushed earlier he showed dark skin and eyes with epicanthic folds sure enough the japanese invaders must have mated with the native fore and the resulting race would have hybrid vigor on their side as if chester didnt have enough trouble as maryem drew close the man stopped and seemed truly to see her for the first time he blinked slowly with gummy lids and alex saw how filthy he was dirt crusted his face and hands and the earth looked damp where it clung unbidden the logical allusion sprang to alexs mind like he just stepped out of a grave and that was when the odor hit neutral scent was alexs first panicked reaction almost immediately squelched this smell was far from neutral once years before alex had bought an oldfashioned fly trap the kind that catches them in water one warm july he had forgotten to clean it out for a week and thousands of ffies had fermented in the sun when he finally went to clean it out the reek went through him like a brick through sheet glass and everything in his stomach had crawled the walls this was similar rotten something rotten not meat something less clean than meat something that had been horribly corrupt even in life something bottlefly blue on the outside and pasty green within maryem was turning green but now with a foe in front of her she moved more surely it charged maryem sidestepped the wobbly advance and drew the blade of her halberd cleanly across its stomach and whirled to face it again it laughed and hacked at her head alex yelped with surprise but maryem ducked as if shed been expecting it she kicked low and crosslegged as if smacking a soccer ball halting an inch from its shim its leg gave way but it slashed as it fell and maryem blocked again spinning like a dancer with a parasol and with a fficker of her wrists cut the thing on both sides of the neck it fell to the dirt alex gave her a thumbsup and the little warrior acknowledged him with the barest of grim smiles the thing was still twitching wounds gaped but there was no blood zombie chester said our enemy is pulling out all the stops he shielded his eyes and peered down the road mouth tightening second wave panthesilea griffin you spearhead this time griffin surprised himself by asking should we be throwing salt at them what no griffin zombies are a different religion voodoo just fight okay there were three of the undead this time moving with ruststiff joints faces split into mockgrins gagging on the smell he raised the rifle to his shoulder and fired dust puffed from the face of one of the undead it staggered back a step then laughed and came on the smell griffin jacked another cartridge into the chamber and fired again and again and the thing fell to one knee the skin of its face had peeled away like rotted wet parchment one of its eyes was gone a moist red socket gaping the useless eyelid shuttering up and down irregularly acacia wasted a moment staring at the results of griffins marksmanship then cursed and clicked her sword free of its sheath the second and third zombies broke toward her one carrying a machete one carrying the bayonet off an m they attacked in tandem and she backpedaled a step to gain time then dove to the side and slashed brutally at the nearest knee the creature was hobbled it fell with a bonejarring thump it chittered at her with brown stubbly teeth and crawled toward her the second backed away more cautiously then smiled she felt a clammy grip on her ankle and chopped back to catch the fallen zombie in the head it howled but didnt let go drown you let go of my kicking and jerking acacia managed to evade the second zombies machete blow and passed her sword through its arm which went limp another backhanded blow and the zombie on the ground released its grip alex stood over acacias first victim holding its machete but lets dont work as well as blades on these things he said he peered down the road acacia took the other zombies weapon just how much damage can they take she wondered they moved on minutes later they could see manhigh sand dunes through the thinning trees this at least brought whoops of delight alex found himself missing sjs tireless enthusiasm for the game he forced himself to make extra noise he whipped the machete round his head and glowered what he imagined to be a savage grimace maryem spotted them first company she tilted her halberd and squared herself her steps more measured they came wobbling out of the dunes looking vaguely disturbingly familiar there were four this time three men and a woman they were blocking the path out of the trees the woman carried a spear of some kind the men carried the usual machetes oh jesus said maryem thats eames eamess face was a blank mask he walked at the same deadsteady pace and there was a huge bloody wound in his chest alan leigh walked on his right his step devoid of bounce expression frozen in death machete held high acacia started to move in on leigh but henderson warned her back caution please well keep it at twoonone as long as we can nothing fancy just get the job done he motioned quickly dividing up his remaining team members acacia and alex had moved in on leigh the zombie wizard seemed to be restraining a bare smile but the blade in his hand was far from friendly it flickered in the air and acacia made the deflection while alex chopped at an extended arm the arm went red and alan switched hands moaning alex raised his machete again and acacia screamed watch out he wheeled and ducked in time to avoid decapitation his attacker was a giggling native woman long dead a great hanging flap of scalp obscuring much of her face she swung a machete at alexs throat alex ducked and reached for the wrist with both hands a disarming throw an instant late he remembered that handtohand was illegal too late the hologram swordarm passed like shadow through his hands swung back and slashed clumsily at his short ribs red light bathed his side alex broke out of his immobility to slash backhanded with his recovered machete he chopped away until the creature slithered to the ground and stopped moving alex was breathing like a bellows dripping sweat be looked around wildeyed for more enemies griffin the high nasal voice of dark star called for help and he spun about she and lady janet were under attack by a duo of shuffling undead both zombies were clotted with dirt one was in an advanced state of decomposition and he showed asian features janet had picked up a stick and seemed able to keep the asian at bay dark stars forearm glowed red she had been forced to drop her weapon griffin took a step in her direction but more undead were emerging from the bushes around themmen and women and halfgrown childrenand suddenly the entire group was threatened he saw dark star go down with a blade in her neck and holly frosts swift reprisal janet had disarmed the rotting zombie and was using its own machete against it chester had slain three of the monsters with magic his aura was weakening he conserved energy by picking up a machete and having at them gina used her power staff as a physical weapon she had little style but four feet of reach made up for it the staggering stumbling undead women couldnt cope with her extra reach and couldnt cleave through her staff and they went down before her in shrieks of painfully sustained laughter oliver had several red streaks on his body but none of them were in vital areas vigor points undiminished teeth clenched in a fighting grimace he stood back to back with margie who couldnt quite keep the smile off her face as she warded off blows and dealt death she gave up trying and seemed to become a demon her fluffy gray hair billowing behind her as she whirled and slew it seemed to go on forever alex stopped seeing opponents they came like waves on the sea faces formed and faded grinning and bellowing their hate in choruses of laughter and always his arm rose and fell rose and fell he bore red slashes in half a dozen places and he waited for the shock to his throat that would announce his death when the shock came he could lie down but it didnt come wouldnt come though the stench of death rose in his nostrils strong and thick enough to choke not when he tripped over the body of a fallen undead and saw that it was alan leigh who winked at him insolently not when only acacias sharp eye and piercing voice saved him from a zombie attack from the rear exhaustion had turned his arms to dead things the laughter of the undead women was driving him crazy the sweat rolled down his forehead obscuring his vison and burning his eyes and in alex griffins mind something gave way it didnt matter that he could see the blades passing harmlessly through each other that the red slashes were dye or glowing light and not oozing wounds it didnt matter that the sounds of steel on steel and steel on rigorstiffened flesh were coming from the necklace on his chest none of that mattered he was fighting for his life in an alien place against legions of the damned and people he cared about were wounded and dying and slaying around him he bobbed and weaved among the shadow blades without conscious thought spinning and capering with a fightingsmile twisting his mouth and the machete wove a path of destruction when a red slash appeared on his shoulder he gasped in pain when a savage thrust brought an enemy down to the dirt he howled in glee slashing again and again and again and suddenly only garners still stood at least twenty bodies were strewn grotesquely about limbs tangled in death kibugonai the small man whose mother had been bitten by a pig was dead he sat propped against a tree hands to his stomach eyes wide and surprised at the cascade of crimson in his lap dark star was face down in the dirt and margie braddon knelt over the corpse of owen stroking his hair and whispering in his ear she looked up at chester her face like thunder what now chester ive been counting were down to nine and no clerics if were wounded we stay wounded ten said lady janet lifting a machete the projected blade was bloody nine chester repeated coldly we cant trust you he touched margie sympathetically on the shoulder whatever it is were after it cant be far alex could see the fatigue and worry in his eyes but his voice showed none of it come on weve got to keep moving margie kissed owen on the back of the neck of all the garners perhaps only alex saw owens hand fumble back to find hers and give it a reassuring squeeze chester rolled the cleric over and secured the padded bag and checked to be sure that kasan maibangs skull was intact a few teeth had come loose and some flakes of black char three pale tindalos were coming through the trees the gamers didnt wait nine gamers and lady janet moved out of the woods and into the great dunes waves boomed ahead of them weapons ready they traced a weaving path abruptly maryem threw down her pack flopped against a sandy slope and gasped rest break chester chester shook his head weve used them all up he lent her an arm and she shook it off irritably standing on her own im not that old griffin rubbed his eyes and said i am he felt as if he had been awake for days last nights rest hadnt touched him did neutral scent disrupt sleep or was it just the game or acacia his vision blurred and a chill ran through his body he wanted to curl up in the warm sand from the look of the other gamers the feeling was shared but they marched on now the sea showed a whitefrothed triangle between the dunes alex watched acacia try for the hundredth time to strike up conversation with tony mcwhirters darkrimmed eyes flashed from her to griffin and griffin felt murder in the air acacia gave up and trudged back to alex head low whew i guess i give up her eyes met his and the selfpity vanished from her face she tugged at his arm come on handsome lets go get killed lets griffin watched her as they marched and saw her rub her eyes three times in three minutes eye trouble yeah damn i dont know whats wrong i dont need to change my contacts for two more weeks i dont think its the lenses listen they had reached the top of a dune the sand sliding beneath their feet and making every step a calfaching effort as they crested griffin gathered his thoughts gazing out at the expanse of bluegreen water what met his eyes froze the words fast in his throat chapter twenty seven cargo craft chester ran up the dune slid down a step and finished the scramble with the assistance of his hands he stood dusting off his pants and alex was gratified to note that the lore master was as shocked as he was awe surprise disbelief a growing hint of laughterhes kidding there never was anything like that less than a hundred yards out from shore floated a tremendous seaplane it looked as big as any flying thing had ever been short of a dirigible or a spacecraft there were four leanlooking propellertipped motors on each huge wing the hull was a nearly blank wall with a tiny afterthought of a windscreen on top a pair of tiny portholes just ahead of the wing and a tiny door open in the flank with lines trailing out into the water margie was sitting spraddlelegged helpless with laughter there was there was she giggled chester turned margie its the spruce goose and she was off again big airplane alex covertly studied the other gamers mcwhirter and holly frost and gina perkins all staring across the water mcwhirter and gina looked thoughtful speculative holly laughed with her head thrown back the rest of the garners were looking at margie waiting oh my lord let me get my breath oh i hope owens watching this margie swallowed well i saw it once the real thing long ago come on margie chester dropped onto the sand completely relaxed this is it its got to be whatever it is so what is it its the spruce goose oh dear where shall i start world war two before my time dear but i read about it there was an industrialist howard hughes youve heard of howard hughes some of them had howard hughes designed an airplane made mostly of wood because the allies were running short of metal it was the biggest airplane ever built then maybe it still is it would have carried seven hundred and fifty troops so it really was supposed to help win the war yes i expect it was too ambitious the plane didnt even fly until at long beach it wasnt supposed to fly then hughes had orders to run it across the water without taking off just for a trial run afterward he told the congressmen that he couldnt hold it down henderson was nodding but in this line of history the cargo cult magicians got it i expect so our present allies must have taken control as soon as it was in the air they used their magic to fly it from long beach to new guinea at some point the other tribe took control and here it is here it is but it couldnt possibly have had enough fuel margie shrugged magic uh huh well thats it obviously were supposed to fly it out of here somehow gina cut him off with a kind of whispered scream chester the top of those rocks there from the dune they could see a natural wall of rock that stretched from the tree line out into the water terminating about fifteen meters from where the plane was moored three shadowed silhouettes stood and gesticulated at the seaward end even at this distance there was no doubting what they were those oversized heads alex recognized the beaverdam hair shaped with the aid of sticks and mud the clawlike hands the scarred greased bodies the priest at the anglican mission multiplied by three fore their voices harmonized with the roar of the sea so that the sea almost drowned them out but gina said theyll be summoning more undead her voice shook a whiff of the wind carried the message gina was right stations chester bawled and the remaining garners formed a ragged wedge bristling with machetes space out more the lore master screamed we have to give each other room make for the rock wall but the fore priests had abeady been answered the undead emerged from the brush in twos and threes and the smell was like a gutsplit skunk ripening on the road alex held his forearm across his nose and held his blade ready oliver was to his left sword high gina to his right spirals of light running along her power staff alex felt someones warm behind wiggle against his and knew that acacia guarded his back to reach the rock breaker the garners would have to cut through a line of the undead advance chester said voice cautious and hoarse slowly a dark pureblooded new guinea zombie was the first to reach the wedge and the first to go down under the blades of maryem and oliver they had gained another three or four meters before three undead reached them two of them women hiccoughing their horrible mirth the third was the reincarnation of rudy dreager the bulletslain engineer once again something within griffin something logical and cool died without protest in its place rose a red shadow that yearned to kill he chopped at dreager rudy moved stiffly but intelligently and alex granted him a block swerving part of his blade to home on the ribs dreager blocked again but alexs move was a feint and the undead gamer howled as a glowing blade slashed his throat this time griffin took no chances he chopped twice more until dreagers whole head glowed black decapitation other garners were engaged and alex wanted badly to break formation and help them but he held his place it was their only chance to survive by slow increments they had already moved to within twenty meters of the wall if they could get their backs to it a machete blade flicked past alexs ear someone behind him had missed a block he turned in time to see tony mcwhirter take a wound in the arm and answer it with a stroke to the knees that sent the zombie tumbling to the sand move chesters voice could hardly be heard above the grunts and the laughter but heard it was and they moved another few steps before resistance grew too heavy in the corner of his eye alex saw oliver gaping frozen eyes wide and puppymoist his sword pointing toward the sand alex spared a glance in that direction trudging with heavy steps eyes fixed on the rotund warrior with a bloodlust that was more threatening than the uplifted weapon came gwen oliver made a halfhearted attempt to block her stroke it was as if hed never held a sword before her descending blade slipped past his guard easily and a wet red line appeared on ollies shoulder behind alex acacia temporarily without an opponent had seen the attack for gods sake ollie fight back ollie fought like a man unwilling to strike back again zombiegwen scored her matted blond hair stuck greasily to her face as her arm rose and fell again her eyes lolling lifelessly in their sockets ollie blockedand missed a perfect opening to her stomach in a voice so soft that alex might have imagined it gwen said kill me ollie please and norliss gritted his teeth and slew his woman plunging his sword into her breast she went down like a sack of meal and the warrior looked sick alex took an instant to grip ollies shoulder hard he was relieved when ollie wheeled to face the next zombie with a vicious stroke worthy of franicish oliver the garners had gained another few meters alex grew impatient he shifted his position in the wedge until he was closer to the lead behind him chester used a final bolt of lightning to strike down a zombie then snatched up a blade as his aura dimmed and winked out he cursed as he handled the unfamiliar tool and he attacked clumsily most of the garners were wounded somewhere alex himself had half a dozen wounds margie was unmarked she had taken to the machete like a bat to warm blood the undead seemed unable to deal with her style imprecise and untutored but full of crazy energy alex had reached the wall he set his back to it and yelled reform chester looked at him with raised eyebrow then nodded in approval the group broke up hacking wildly at the lunging corpses and formed two lines against the rocks the zombies kept to the sand off the rock and away from the water and that cut the vulnerable area to two sides far easier to defend still they came on and on no longer was it possible for griffin to pause between slayings the undead piled up around his feet and swarmed to cloud his vision he was sweating and the sweat rolled into his eyes blurring sight the smell of the undead their hideous appearance and the sound of the laughing the unholy tittering were wearing him down he saw what happened to gina two corpses menaced her one was mutilated a tittering twitching woman missing a leg and an arm she leaned on a tall pole tucked under the stump of the missing arm her good hand jabbed with a bayonet fixed to half of a shattered m rifle gina fending off a smallish longdead man swung backhand to cleave her open the woman wheeled the butt of ginas machete smacked into her crutch gina froze she turned to stare she must have assumed the butchered halfdecomposed corpse was a hologram the man shed ignored swung at her neck gina chester screamed and alex saw her buckle to the sand her aura black as night and two grinning zombies still slashed at her tony scooped up her magic staff desperately the tool was drained of power but a nights rest would recharge it the line tightened the eight remaining garners clustered about lady janet all of them ragged and wheezing with weariness arms rising and falling rising and falling one face stood out in the press the shaggy dark brows were whitened and the glacial blue eyes seemed dulled by death but it was still bowan the black who worked his way toward chester the blade in his hand seemed more like a wakizashi a japanese short sword than a simple chopping implement his target was henderson alex yelled a warning then turned to his own defense zombiebowan snarled and struck henderson clumsy with his edged tool slithered out of the way and pushed bowan back to gain room but bowan was out for blood there was no pause no lag to give henderson time to adjust his balance bowan spun and backhanded his sword into chesters leg the lore master cursed and forgot all semblance of style chopping insanely at bowan the former magic user was caught by surprise his aura went red at shoulder thigh stomach he was forced to the ground where the lore master performed butchery next to griffin holly frost gasped as a red slash spread on her left arm he deflected a stroke for her while she regained her poise owe you she said between clenched teeth alex took a wound in the calf and oliver a slashed scalp the animated corpses died in droves their bodies hampered movement and now and then one would clutch at an ankle the action was being forced along the rock spit toward the sea toward the fore priests perhaps they realized it there was a cry high and wavering like the caw of an eagle the zombie facing griffin stepped back a pace and turned in shock alex saw that the entire mass of undead had stepped away from the beleaguered garners retreating in a semicircle toward the trees acacia gasped now what griffin looked at his wrist for a moment the watch imprinted on his sleeve seemed foreign entirely magic unreadable then six minutes to go we cant follow the zombies but frankish oliver turned and began to clamber up the rocks we can still get the priests alex felt that if he stopped moving he would never start again he pulled himself up behind oliver who was not exactly sprinting rocks rolled underfoot he reached the top to see beaverdam hair styles disappearing down the other side oliver was clambering along the top of the spit he stopped he pointed with his sword seaward as alex came up beside him he found breath for one word boats they stood panting watching the three small boats were archaic enough but they werent native to new guinea there was english lettering on the sterns each boat held one fore priest standing and one zombie seated at the oars chester and the other garners had found the strength to join them together they watched the three boats tie up beneath the door in the flank of the spruce goose the fore climbed a dangling rope ladder their undead oarsmen remained in the boats and then the sea and the huge plane faded into darkness though the beach was still in twilight when alex looked at his watch it was ten oclock they climbed down from the rocks in time to see gina rise up to join her tindalo chester watched her go when he turned back to them the defeat in his face was impossible to ignore hes still dragging it out tomorrow acacia swallowed air and clicked her sword into its sheath her hair was matted with sweat and sand and she looked as if she had dug ditches all day more likely hes worried chester at first chester seemed not to hear her then he turned worried why what will the ifgs think about an assault like that he scratched his stubble eyes worried i dont know we sure as hell had plenty of warning acacia seemed alarmed chester what is the matter with you youre on our side remember the lore master sank down in the sand looking out into the darkness hasnt done you much good has it he turned over face down he sounded horribly tired maybe we should have gone back for more black fire scatter it in the loam on the forest floor rot is slow fire it should burn backward let the zombies come at us there it might have stopped them the garners shifted around uncomfortably watching chester brood alex dropped beside him on the sand at least we finally know what were after its right out there on the water chester we even know where to find the boats chester nodded he lifted himself on his elbows to glare into the darkness that hid the spruce goose make camp he said abruptly tomorrows another day when the priests come back to finish us off well get em thanks griffin god im tired but tomorrow griffin dropped his pack he was unable to find any emotion to hang his fragmented thoughts on he looked down at himself for wounds the red glow of hologramdelivered wounds was gone the bloodstains left by solid zombie weapons looked like paint the day was turning unreal ollie dropped into the sand next to him he mumbled something alex couldnt quite hear what i wish it was over the thief had to bend low to hear him i just wish it was over he looked like an old man the muscles in his cheeks slack jowls hanging a single tear ran glistening down his cheek a pat on the back was the only answer griffin could find he moved his pack away over to a rock large enough to sit on he huddled there watching the tides turn off eight garners left the game was indeed almost over chapter twentyeight thieves in the night get me marty bobbick please yes sir alex sagged against the shadowed back of a dune the sand was cooling now it felt good against his skin he could feel the fatigue but it seemed apart from him his mind was racing the garners were camped on the other side a fair distance away alex listened but tonight there was no singing no laughter he heard margie and chester talking but couldnt make out the words hail the griffin slayer of the undead ha ha go ahead marty get it out of your system chief im at least half serious i never dreamed these games could get that rough if you werent in top physical shape wed be carrying you out how does a sweet little old lady like that margie braddon keep going sheer chutzpah the rest of us are ready to lie down and die im really worried about ollie i guess gwen needed the points but the last thing in the world he needed was having to kill his woman damn but at least we know our target now and its a whopper marty tomorrow it not a he or a she he or she oh alex was too tired even to be irritated with himself sorry jumped tracks again its a he marty you know i went into this with entirely the wrong idea he heard a faint scuffing from above a few grains of sand pattered down around him it stopped almost at once alex rolled over and stood up without obvious haste while he kept talking i thought we must be chasing an experienced gamer someone who knew the ropes so well that he could find extra time somewhere to creep off and do some work on the side it looks to me like nobody would ever know that much damn right the better you are the more you know the harder you work at not getting killed out there arent any ropes to know each game is a whole new ball of snakes he might have imagined that sound a gust of wind could have blown that sand down on him but under a dome alex felt himself becoming one gigantic ear what are we looking for then a novice right and he gave himself away a couple of times alex looked up without turning his head the shallow curve of the top of the dune had a bump on it it could be the top of a head better not gamble on it if it wasnt then a known killer might be coming around the dune hed hear boots on sand wouldnt he alex had left his machete beside his bedroll and now he regretted it the game was in abeyance and so were the game rules governing physical combat he should have made this call from the middle of a nest of garners secrecy was meaningless now couldnt be helped all right lets lure him down martys voice snapped well he was too tired on the second day this guy is in excellent condition and he could barely climb a wall hed been up very late the night before at the volcano he was sure the bomb was a piece of misdirection while the rest of the team was trying to move it out he kept looking around he must have already seen the goose and its too big it must be a fair part of lopezs budget its an important part of the game and we hadnt got there yet and at the harbor he was too interested in the planes and then not interested at all where the hell was he he could not afford to let griffin speak his name gruff who where was he gruff you all right shall i send in help griff hed fooled himself there was nobody on the dune he was alone nuts fortunato tony mcwhirter good enough now what call the game but alex heard a peculiar ragged sigh from overhead ill get right back to you marty he flipped the wallet closed and pocketed it come on down he called and eased his left leg back for balance mcwhirter could still attack and he might have a sword tony stood up and walked down the slope leaning slightly backward plowing up sand he was unarmed he stopped several feet away spread his hands i didnt kill anybody he said you have the right to remain silent griffin said if you choose to i know i watch the boob tube too griffin i didnt kill anyone the guard almost killed me but i didnt hurt him i tied him up and gagged him and left him he was wriggling around and i thought of maybe using more bandage moor him to some furniture maybe but he wasnt going to get loose quick enough to stop me nice plan griffin said with calculated flatness what happened did he get a good look at your face i didnt kill him hes dead though suffocated did you accidentally hold his nose for him tony dropped onto the sand and put his head between his knees griffin heard wet sounds he prudently kept his distance he was still breathing i oh i cut off his wind till he passed out but he was breathing when i left him wheres the neutral scent tony looked up hopefully and started to speak no deals griffin snapped its probably gone by now anyway you had to have someone to pick it up tony shook his head violently he couldnt have found it griffin thats crazy stuff when i used it on you i had no idea what it would do to me i just went crazy with fear i must have smashed into every tree in dream park there was a place where i was supposed to leave it but i never got that far i just got rid of it i was afraid of it i was afraid youd search me where i can show you can we deal im promising nothing the only question you need to ask is how hard is dream park going to lean on you you get to decide that right now then get drowned i dont know who was supposed to get it maybe hell find it before you do have it your way griffin whetted his voice to a cutting edge but tony even if rice died of a stopped up nose its murder california law says that if someone dies as the result of the commission of a felony its murder stand up tony stood the defiance was gone what now we go tell the others that were leaving the game the darkness didnt hide the sick dismay on tonys face it took griffin by surprise oh god this is going to kill acacia they wont last five minutes tomorrow you should have thought of that before said alex he sensed tonys muscles tightening come on tony playtimes over tony sounded almost hysterical ive screwed everything everything please griffin i cant face them please i dont fancy it much either the brutality in his voice was as much for his own benefit as mcwhirters come on youre betraying them to their deaths bulishit being killed out isnt dead rice is dead griffin please lets just play out the game give me that much just a few hours then ill tell you where it is and turn myself in dont be silly damn and we had a good chance of winning too ill show you where i put the neutral scent tomorrow i cant make that deal come on far too late tony jumped him griffin leaned aside from his wild swing and kicked him in the shin as tony doubled in pain alex seized a handful of hair and an arm locking him helpless numb and silent tony was steered back to the campfire the campfire burned low to the coals and no one seemed to have the energy to feed it kibugonai and kagoiano were back to serve dinner their faces were zombieblank and their deathwounds showed clearly lady janet found the strength to pass around pouches of milk and fruit juice and beer but her smile was barely lipdeep hardly a head turned as alex brought tony stumbling back into camp until somebody noticed the arm twisted painfully behind mcwhirters back chester stood alarm igniting on his face he bent his knees twice to get some circulation into them and challenged all right tegner just what the hell is going on alex released tony who stood shivering in a circle of questioning eyes do you want to tell them or shall i tony tried to speak but nothing came out he gave up and shook his head griffin felt pity worming its way to the surface of his mind and shut his shields down fast all right ill do it then he had all their attention now none of them looked at all happy three nights ago mcwhirter broke away from the rest of you and took a private tour he ended up in the research and development department where he stole a sample of a newly developed invention no need to give away more than necessary acacia gasped my god so thats where you were that night in pain and disorientation she came up to him oh tony no wonder youve been acting crazy if only id tony why all tony did was lower his eyes miserably to the ground thats not all alex said acacias look tore at him made him wish he had taken fortunato out of the game first and explained later or never in order to gain access to the complex tony had to subdue a guard in some manner not yet clear that guard one albert rice died of suffocation acacia seemed to study him then tony she said flatly no alex said well tony silently mcwhirter nodded his head tears beginning to run down his cheeks glistening silver in the firelight then who are you acacias query was delivered at a scream the other garners seemed transfixed griffin alex griffin chief of dream park security chester looked like hed looked when the biditaurabohaza found him all right griffin what happens now he re minded griffin of a man waiting to hear the results of his biopsy terrified and fascinated at the same time now jesus do they have to look at me like that im only doing my goddam job maryem sat curled up on the ground with her face between her knees she didnt want to look at him a hint of defiance burned in holly frosts dark face quickly subdued you know what i have to do dammit every one of you knows no one argued and he almost hoped they would come on you fogheaded fantasy freaks yell at me scream call me a rentapig anything acacia stumbled back to her place near the campfire she tried to swallow some beer but it exploded in her mouth offie held her as she coughed and sobbed thats it then chester said taking infinite care not to let his emotions leak into his voice were down to six hands now tomorrow morning it is his gaze flicked past griffin without comment and settled on tony for a brief instant something dark and murderous flared in the depths of those eyes quickly hidden margie braddon kneaded her hands together as if trying to scrub something indescribably filthy from them i had to bring the news in for you you used owen and me as couriers didnt you lucky coincidence margie i had to see who might jump when he heard that the guard was dead hope bloomed on mcwhirters face then you werent sure i knew its still murder tony any death that occurs in the course of a felony is murder im sorry yeah so the hell am i get your things there was no sound from the others as tony walked stifflegged to his backpack at the rim of the campfire circle he lifted it with a long tortured sigh and slapped the sand off in the wavering light he looked like an old old man shadows furrowing his face into antiquity he was stiff and slow as he walked back to rejoin griffin he turned to the other garners and whispered im sorry god im so sorry cas i picked that fight the first night she tried to turn away and couldnt cas when i saw how tough it was going to be i knew i had to get it done the first night before i got killed out so stop it she whispered i love you babe thats all holly frost broke the silence that followed giving voice to the idea hiding in every mind hell griffin why cant you wait for a few more hours an absurd thought but alex could feel himself becoming defensive theres no way i can do that a man is dead can any of us bring him back margie tried to shush holly but there was no stopping her now i mean why dont you give us a break i travelled over a thousand miles to be here now youre teffing me that it doesnt matter what happens to me or any of us as long as you get your man its my job griffin felt himself blushing in the dark youre not really leaving them to their deaths its just a game just a game the joy and the sweat were just a game the lovemaking and the beer busts and the songs and the tears and the boneweary exhaustion were just part of the game and what happened tomorrow when the undead and the fore and lopez knew what else all came boiling out of the sea and the forest to smash five gamers that would be the biggest shiniest fantasy of all acacia wiped her nose and regarded him all right alex or gary or whatever you are you and i know that what happened between us was a lie she cut him off when he tried to speak and maybe that was good no telling what he would have said all right you dont give a flying fart for any of us that doesnt hurt me too bad mister but i want you to tell me that you dont care about whats happening here that you havent gone out of your mind with the rest of us weirdos i saw you garyalex oh damn you i saw what you were beginning to get out of this game he heard the tremor in his voice what is it you think you saw you cant relax alex youre in better shape than the rest of us by a mile why are you as wiped out as we are why are you more torn up than margie she leaned toward him and flinched as one of the coals popped ill tell you why because you work so damn hard at everything you do because you drive and drive and push until youre about to fall over and if its not hard enough youll make it tougher on yourself just for the sheer hell of a job well fought now you tell me alex damn you you look me in the eye and tell me you dont want to stay in the game just twelve more hours just long enough to help us beat the pants off lopez you tell me you dont care tough man he shrugged massive shoulders all right all right whats that even to himself he sounded like a little boy trying to explain something he doesnt understand sure i want to stay but what i want doesnt matter she stared at him my god alex i thought i was hooked on fantasy just why he snapped im not here to answer questions acacia im not here to have fun im here in the interests of dream park and thats all there is to it his prisoner had set down his pack tony had long since made his own plea he was just waiting but chester said griffin its in dream parks best interests that you stay in the game he had turned to face the fire his voice was low and very controlled calculating dont try to hand me a line of bull but alex knew that he had responded too quickly too automatically that he was almost afraid of being shown another way out tomorrow chester said still facing away we are going to be slaughtered the game will be over and will have to be considered one of the greatest debacles in gaming history certainly the greatest i have ever heard of so im sorry about your reputation so im sorry about dream parks investment that rang a bell hadnt harmony said somethinggo on dont you know that dream park recoups a huge chunk of their money through sales of tapes and books of an adventure through luring people to run through an automated game once the bugs have been worked out how many people are going to want a piece of this one cowles industries will take a bath griffin now he turned and met griffins eyes squarely we both know i have ulterior reasons for wanting both of you to stay in the game fine all im asking is for you to take everything into consideration you know what it means to you what it means to the park and if you give a damn what it means to all of us griffin scanned the faces eager tired waiting for a word from him that would tear everything to hell and gone or give them a fighting chance just twelve hours christ what would harmony think who cares hes the loon who got me into this in the first place still hadnt harmony saidi understand dream parks investment is around a million and a half more id think check with your boss there are resources tied up interest on loans advertising agreements never mind gather round people i may need you to talk for me mcwhirter right next to me alex flipped his wallet open get me marty bobbick marty was on instantly gruff i was down to hoping youd remembered to leave a dying message marty i have tony mcwhirter in custody on suspicion of burglary and murder okay good tell me where you are and ill direct you to the nearest exit not so fast marty see if you can get me harmony immediately it wasnt immediate the garners sat around him tense and silent waiting kagoiano mangled with edges of bone showing through where the rockfall had smashed him on the third day brought him a thick sandwich and stood passively until griffin took it griffin forced himself to take a bite then suddenly starving wolfed it ollie said do you know about the fatripper specials they use the same game but they cut all the distances by half and the food is highprotein stuff and there are paid doctors in the party five days rips the fat right off you and you hardly notice how hungry you are because youre too busy not getting killed thats how gwen got her start he looked anxiously at griffin whose mouth was full the really good games sell in places where you wouldnt think there were places dream park stands to lose the wallet spoke griffin harmony look if youre asleep get yourself awake pvc been handed a tricky decision and im passing the buck i wasnt asleep whats the problem ive taken tony mcwhirter into custody he admits to stealing the ah materials but he denies killing rice very good alex well call sacramento pd and hand them a nicely wrapped package do you have the stolen materials thats our problem sir mcwhirter has made us an interesting offer hed like us both to stay in and finish the game its only a matter of another twelve hours and mcwhirter will show us where he hid the ah materials game yes ah what happens to the game if you and mcwhirter leave it now worst debacle in gaining history oh harmony thought it over and griffin found that he was holding his breath what if this mcwhirter cuts your throat and tries to run hes killed once if he perforates a gamer lawsuits hmm we can take precautions mcwhirter will have a machete with a hologram blade well guard him all night ill have marty seal this place tony whispered fiercely for gods sake put me on alex handed over the wallet tony said mr harmony listen i do not intend to run where would i go and i didnt just a minute mcwhirter have you been warned i have the right to a lawyer i have the right to remain silent if i choose to speak i can be recorded you are being recorded fine are you in possession of materials belonging to dream park no but i hid them where nobody else is going to find them i can give them to griffin tomorrow look lopez will cream us if griffin and i leave the game now and how would anyone explain it in game context it kills the plot line will the rest of your party trust you not to try to escape i swear it i want their word on record it must have been obvious to all of them in case tony perforated anyone while escaping harmony was forestalling a lawsuit one by one they swore they trusted tony mcwhirters word alex spoke last im going to lock this place up tight he said a mosquito wont be able to get loose but i think mcwhirter means it its going to be a long time between gaines for him i can hear the board of trustees now well go ahead and good luck oh and i looked in on you while you were stealing that ah black fire didnt everybody yeah it looked like fun the transceiver clickedand everybody started yelling griffin bellowed quiet they stopped to his transceiver griffin said security quick marty listen i want airtight surveillance at every exit from the dome if anyone tries to leave the game ends instantly dont miss any exits and dont let someone past just because hes wearing a uniform chief youre not coming out nope neither of us not till one tomorrow with our shields or on them griffin clicked his wallet shut and looked around youre crazy he said youre all crazy and im just as bad i want a gamer awake at all times to watch mcwhirter who is going to sleep with his feet wired together any objections from anyone not a whisper mcwhirter he was pathetically grateful hands and feet griffin i dont care thank you all right griffin sank back against the dune he felt very tiredand light as air his thoughts finally settled on something henderson the lore master still looked apprehensive now what eight of us left all those undead we dont even have boats just how are we going to win this mother chapter twentynine end game when dawn broke that final day there were nine awake to greet it their clothes were soiled and torn they themselves were scratched and bruised and unsteady on their feet even with the benefit of a nights sleep but all of them gripped their tools tightly swords machetes and the magic staff now wielded by chester henderson chester stood with eyes wide and nerves afire waiting for the peep of a double sun that would signal the beginning of the game alex took no offense that acacia stood with tony she had spent the night with the bound man not with someone else not crying or hating or blaming rarely touching him but there holly frost her afro frizzled with sand and sweat stood next to alex a japanese short sword balanced uneasily in her hand she studied panthesilea and fortunato at a distance expression carefully neutral tony watched the horizon he let his eyes sweep back and forth barely acknowledging the girl at his side for minutes at a time before relaxing with a great sigh and holding her fiercely to him easy to understand the unyielding focus of his attention play well today tony you wont be back for twenty years maryem margie and ollie stood together margie had seemingly gained strength during the night energy from the endless strategy sessions she and maryem grinned at each other and touched the tips of their weapons together in silent salute ollie raised his sword wearily and stitched together the rudiments of a smile the group formed a rough circle around their campfire all directions covered the circle enclosed lady janet who carried a machete chesters instructions had been exact you dont fight unless you have to getting you out is part of our mission facing the woods with a katana held tightly in his massive hands the griffin suddenly laughed out loud marty millie harmony are you watching hope youre enjoying this the second sun rose the first faded out chester watched critically as yesterdays wounds bloomed anew on his garners and on his own body the sounds of new guinea filled the air birdcalls the lapping of surf and a creaking of metal low in the flank of the spruce goose a door began to open a long black arm pushed it back with deliberate slowness under a great black globe of hair a small scarred face leered at them mouthing words inaudible at that distance it disappeared inside and another figure climbed out stiffly it was an undead its clothing strips of tattered cloth hanging against dark ashy skin it climbed down into the boat and set itself at the oars two fore priests joined it untied the line settled themselves the boat moved toward shore with smooth steady strokes from their hellish oarsman chester snorted bastards only one boat griffin stifled a sour bubble of gas tasting his nervousness the fore seemed to be looking directly at him leering with a mouthful of filed teeth now he could see the muscles in the zombies back as it guided the boat toward shore ten feet from shore one of the priests stood in the boat and began to chant loudly after a time the second priest joined in creating a melody that made griffins skin crawl to listen he didnt have leisure to critique the serenade from the woods came answering sounds a rustling scraping promise fulfilled within moments as the undead began to line up there were at least thirty of them all armed as before the women and children were the worst they laughed endlessly bodies twitching with spasms the laughter blending to hungry growls many of the women were barebreasted but the effect wasnt erotic alex knew that it would be a long time before he could look at a halfnaked woman without remembering the emptyeyed zombies of new guinea among the women and children were gray old men crippled and deformed their frail hands clutching edged weapons but the front line held the healthy ones so to speak a dozen warriors who had died by violence most of them were as dusky as the others the fore priests two were european sj and felicia maddox dark star sj rolled his eyes with zombie fervor he waved his machete fiercely and grinned from a face ridged and pitted with blast scars griffin had to grin back sj didnt care which side he was on felicias face was supernaturally calm but she led the other zombies the boat had beached the fore priests disembarked without interrupting their song this is it people chesters voice was loud but calm everyone do their part and well get through this shift the garners moved before the zombies reached them they had formed a wedge with maryem at the peak they moved toward the rocks at quickmarch they stopped and turned when the animated army was ten paces away chester raised ginas staff his fingers ran across its keyboard ruby spirals ran down its length and light flashed from the tip to bathe the front line felicia caught fire the zombie screamed a wavering wail that would have torn meat from a human throat and she fell smoking and throwing sparks the two to either side were incinerated as well but chesters beam was flickering sjs zombie had lurched behind one of its undead fellows sparing him from the initial blast in another second the rest of the force had passed the smoking corpses and were on the garners the dead engineer went straight for margie she almost stepped out of the circle to meet him restraining herself at the last moment she met his downward stroke and growled menacingly griffin kept a measured distance from holly and went to work the blows were coming in a little faster a little more elusively and before three minutes had passed two small new patches of red flowed on his limbs he set his teeth and sent a zombie to the sand with a diagonal crimson wedge creasing his head chesters voice rose above the din keep moving maryem screaming and chopping at the cutting edge the garners clove the ranks of the undead slowly at first then with increasing speed the besieged gainers won their way toward the fore priests the eight defenders were roused to frenzied heights now as they saw the priests back away and move toward their boat maryem swore foully and burst through the zombie wall breaking formation to do it her short legs blurred as she charged across the sand diving at the closest fore and cutting him down at the legs he fell to the beach at the edge of the water and rolled in the surf foamed red the second priest paused a fatal instant to gape at his fellows fate then sloshed through the water pushing the boat away from shore the undead oarsman sat passively it had received no new orders tony threw his machete the blade made a single revolution and slashed into the fores shoulder he screamed as he clawed back at the evil growth then kept going pulling the boat onehanded ollie splashed out with lady janet behind him the fore tried to stop offles sword with his bare hand and failed while the other gainers held off the zombies janet pulled the boat back toward shore ollie joined her they had nearly beached the craft dead passenger and all when sj splashed in and cut ollie down from behind ollies aura flashed red he spun around and zombie sj swung again in the moment ollie died he parried and chopped and sjs head went black chester shoved lady janet into the boat and helped margie in after her the oarsman did not protest as they tumbled it out tony piled in and pulled acacia up then fended off a slash from a zombie wading in the surf after holly squeezed in only griffin and maryem were left out and there seemed to be no remaining room griffin acacia yelled indicating her lap alex yanked maryem toward the boat and she hissed at him get out of here you have to survive griffin she butted him toward the boat with her shoulder he pulled at her belt idiot swim and hold onto the boat she nodded they backed into the waves then swam for it the boat was moving out as tony and holly took the oars they paused long enough for griffin and maryem to grip the stern the terrible minions of the fore waded into the water now until it rose above their mouths and even then they marched on dead eyes blazing as they vanished beneath the lapping waves margie touched a hand uneasily to her chest as the boat pulled out from shore she watched the zombies vanish they almost made it all the way maryem yelped and sank alex into the boat acacia wasnt waiting she pulled him over the stern by main force a greenishblack hand fastened on his ankle and he yelled tony slashed the hand glowed red and sank alex sprawled into the boat onto the knees of the other garners now glistening dead hands gripped on both sides and grinning dead faces surfaced eyes unblinking and filled with hunger as tony and holly rowed griffin scrambled off acacias lap and chopped at heads and hands the boat rocked unsteadily as he fought for balance swinging his sword from a crouch a joyful scream cleft the air as they reached the spruce goose tony tied the line in and helped holly up she nodded briskly and pulled herself up the rope ladder and through the open door they heard her jubilant shout cargo behind her tony yelled look out she turned as a gibbering fore priest hurled a snake at her her hand blurred as she whipped her short sword into a tight s and dropped to the floor the snake separated into halves and flopped to either side hear me she had to interrupt herself to roll away as the priest threw another snake she chopped off its head as it hit the floor her roll took her ankle close to the first snakes severed front end dying it bit drown you she stomped at it and stood lurching toward the priest who bared filed teeth and hissed vilely her aura was blackening from the ankle upward hear me gods she cried give me fire the priest gestured defensively the flames from hollys fingertips veered to either side hollys wakizashi stabbed through the flame and caught the fore in the throat the fore fell holly her aura quite black collapsed gracefully on top of him chester was the last gamer through the door he shut it hard behind him all right lets see his eyes found the sprawled bodies and he winced oliver maryem holly christ what a game then he saw further she was right this is it the shadowed walls seemed to curve up and up forever meeting at an indistinct ceiling the hold was piled impossibly high with cargo packages of all shapes and sizes filled the hold in fact blocked it to the very roof margie is your rating good enough to fly this thing she pursed her lips thoughtfully but didnt answer directly lets find the cockpit the cockpit was at the top of a stairway its door was slightly ajar and alex poked his sword ahead of himself cautiously then entered footing was unsteady in the relative darkness but there was light ahead streaming through the dusty windows the cockpit was musty with disuse but nothing seemed to be broken there were panels filled with antique meters and dials margie followed him in and pointed to the pilots and copilots chairs thats what i need she said and pushed gently past him swinging around the pilots seat she jumped back stumbling and steadied herself against alex he turned snarling blade at the ready then relaxed a mouldered skeleton slumped in the chair pieces of cloth stuck to the bones whew margie edged closer to it and nudged it with her toe all right i dont think its going to be moving around much now that weve killed the priests she carefully turned to the other chair and sighed as she found another skeleton gary griffin would you help me get this out of the pilots seat dear he trundled it back out of the cabin and to the cargo sections bones fell loose he went back for them how are we doing chester sounded exuberant and fresh as a daisy he climbed into the cockpit and stood behind margies shoulder her hands explored the controls twisted something the panel lit up she said i think thats the fuel gauge it reads empty it would damn he leaned against the wall gazing out at the water ah the fuel dump he gripped margies shoulder remember at the dockyard near the headquarters building get this thing started up and well see if we can get that far margies hands played over the controls ive never flown this model she murmured and twisted something an engine coughed then roared the plane began to swing in a circle margie hummed happily to herself she got another engine started a third a fourth by now all four gamers plus lady janet were crowded into the cockpit admiring her performance the plane finished a full circle margie took the joy stick the planes curve straightened out the goose rose on its step and picked up speed enough for the vertical fin to bite air margie turned east along the shore motors one four six and seven now running admiral she told chester the rest are dead i think but ill keep fiddling if you think not just now we dont want to take off we dont have the fuel for it tony said griffin griffin glanced at him questioningly tonys long face grew serious and he nodded alex shrugged out of his pack and followed tony into the cargo section mcwhirter went directly to a crate labeled us army surplus and levered it open he pulled out a couple of handfuls of shredded wood then lifted a blue cloth pouch with lowered eyes he handed it to griffin the pouch had a velcro seal easily thumbed open alex lifted out four sheets of photocopy paper then a fold of foam cushioning and from that a tiny vial of thin colorless fluid it was only half filled neutral scent tony nodded all right tony if youve played straight with me ill do what i can which may not be much griffin fortunato they pounded up the ladder into the cockpit and found that they had reached the sea of lost cargo the mighty spruce goose was a terror to navigate here but margie accomplished it with elan and only once did a grinding crash indicate a collision with a smaller halfsunken craft shitohdear margie said chester i cant slow down wed sink deeper we might hit something else then dont margie scrutinized the docking area carefully i can get us a little closer but well still have to use the boat i think and her words died in her throat the undead were waiting for them at least a hundred strong they formed an arc before the fuel dump a few had marched to the edge of the water and were waving their blades stiffly chester looked sick theyll butcher us when we come ashore if we ran the goose aground no wed never get enough momentum to crash that line one of the motors coughed margie shut down engine outboard on the left wing the goose tried to turn and she pulled it back into line chester shall i shut down or beach the beast shut down margie killed the motors the goose settled she said we may not have the fuel to start up again chester was grinding his teeth so near and now were trapped weve got to try chester what else can we do acacia scanned the line of undead and shuddered what time is it alex looked at his sleeve stopped elevenforty tony said without turning from the window uh huh the game ends at one weve got to beat the undead move enough fuel to fly us out get it into the tanks hell we dont even know where the tanks are prime the motors and fly home not enough time it cant be enough not even if we could whip that many undead that airplanes egg really cost us acacia said yeah even so there has to be a way out of this mess i know lopez well i dont see it the dark haired girl stomped her foot and swore lookif were going to lose lets not just sit it out trapped like rats lets get out there and kick some behind margie shook her head chester there is another way what do you mean the spruce goose never flew from long beach to new guinea its just too far the tanks would have been dry long before they got there even if they were full to start with and they probably werent remember it was just a practice run magic gears were turning in chesters head but we dont know the ceremony lady janet raised her hand i do what she smiled pushing forward until she was almost against his chest when those people were holding me captive i saw them perform their ceremony several times the spells were in good english i memorized them lady janet i dont trust you margie swiveled around in her chair chester she has to be a clue why else would she have survived so long in the game chester held his head trying to think theyre going to come out chester tony said flatly alienlooking fore priests had appeared among the undead oiled bodies gleaming in the sun they were directing the launching of boats griffin ignored the boats easy to drive through them if they chose to go that route equipment he said if weve got the ceremony weve got the equipment too theres a full cargo cult workshop in that quonset hut its a good thing we didnt burn it down he looked out the zombies are blocking the fuel but not the quonset hut we can ram right through those boats the rest well by the time we got to the headquarters building theyd be there too unless unless we run the goose up on the beach we might never get it loose yeah but its a chance no we may have to no chester was smiling but it was not a nice smile i kept looking for the flaw but i didnt see it till lady janet spoke its another mousetrap lady janet have you forgotten the copyright violation rule by jimmy i believe i did she laughed and chester laughed with her alex slapped his forehead hard enough to hurt some detec tive the enemys spells are the enemys property we cant use them can we tony spun from the window waitaminute he shook chesters shoulder it wasnt the enemy who stole the goose they stole it from the daribi so we could use daribi spells if yes who has maibangs skull chester searched desperately from face to face as there was no answer then margie raised her hand i got it from owen i think she opened her pack and rummaged swiftly the guides charred skull was a pitiful relic all personality gone but chester seized it like a priceless jewel table ceremony tony griffin rig me a table the rest of you i want any remaining rations chocolate bars salt tablets anything that might be accepted they set it up in the cargo hold a warped chest served as a table they raided a crate of bedsheets for a tablecloth a few pieces of dried fruit and a lone stick of gum lay on the cloth next to the black skull no flowers no candle but chester was grimly pleased the bilasim tewol he murmured then spread wide his arms hear me kasan maibang hear me oh gods we destroy the last of our precious supplies that we may speak with him who was our guide hear us jesusmanup the air above the table shimmered and chester gestured fire he commanded and bare sparks fell from his fingertips fire he commanded again and his aura tinged red he ignored it fire he screamed and the table crackled in flame the burnscarred face of kasan maibang wavered in their vision i know why you call whispered the guide but i cannot help you only one greater than myself can save you who pigibidi the greatest chief of my people summon him it will cost you mana what have you of power chester was frantic tearing at frizzled hair with long fingers then he barked laughter and dumped his pack out almost at the bottom was what looked like a set of black leather pajamasthe shed skin of a fore spy he placed it on the magical fire it is good kasan said and his face shifted outline and became the pitted and wrinkled visage of old pigibidi pigibidi great chief chester began he licked his lips nervously we are desperate we must move this tremendous airplane and we have no fuel the old mans lips moved and his words echoed in the hold the woman offered you the spell of the fore be glad you did not use it one must have permission to use such magic and to steal a spell from its owner carries a terrible price chester glared at lady janet who hid a smile pigibidi what shall we do i will give you the spell you need if our peoples ever contend again beware of trying to use it against us no i swear a europeans promise is worth little if you have the magical power to lift so vast a machine i will work the spell for you that the fore might be beaten power were out pigibidi theres nothing left youve got to i am sorry then it is all for nothing chester stomped and swore that lopez fli kill him i swear to god he hoisted himself on a crate to look out one of a pair of tiny portholes the boats of the fore had reached the goose soon it would be over the fire burned without consuming and pigibidis translucent visage watched them with the dispassionate calm of the dead alex leaned against the wall of the hold eyes hooded speculatively pigibidi hadnt vanished there must be more a crate of cocacola the corpse of a fore priest or chester what the lore master snarled his entire body was shaking didnt margie say that hughes himself flew this thing thats right margie agreed he was pilot on that one short flight off long beach well if that was when they stole it then it stands to reason that tony was sprinting up the ladder to the cabin that hughes is one of the skeletons griffin finished my god chesters body calmed down the excitement flaring in his smile as he realised what alex was saying its cargo cult mythology and weve got access to the tindalo of one of the twentieth centurys greatest aeronautical industrialists acacia retrieved the skull alex had discarded earlier is this the right one hughes or the pilot the bony face grinned sardonically secure in its anonymity griffin said hughes was a millionaire his clothes would be in better shape tony halffell down the ladder his arms full of bones what the hell well use them both a test pilot makes a perfectly good tindalo he took the other skull from acacia and set the two at opposite corners of the table under pigibidis hovering face the flames sparked up a fore zombie had crawled up to the window it leered at them pounding with the flat of an ashy hand pigibidis translucent face nodded at them it began to speak goddodo jesusmanup hear my and his words were drowned in the sound of leviathan engines turning over all eight propellers ripped at the air margie gasped and ran for the cockpit with the other garners in hot pursuit the spruce goose shuddered and jerked and surged forward margie scrambled into a seat a last zombie lay flat in front of the windshield yelling hugging the painted wood the seaplane rose on its step and picked up speed nudging aside smaller craft and heading for open water margie grinned fiercely as the goose raced along the surface and finally skipped free they bounced back down once with a massive stomachchurning splash and the zombie vanished then the plane truly found its power and rose from the water with a throaty roar shore and dock fell away beneath them jungles and mountains monsters and dooms and the gesticulating figures of the fore were pinpoints to their eyes as the spruce goose kissed the clouds the garners turned to each other and there was a swollen moment of silence then alex whooped and acacia hugged him and tony hugged margie and chester kissed lady janet and the cockpit was filled with laughter and screams of joy the game was over part three chapter thirty the final tally hoarse cheering could be heard from within the cabin section of the spruce goose even before the dream park attendants opened the door to let the garners out lady janet was the first to place a foot on the ground her legs were wobbly she shook her head and said wow six more garners followed holly frost last out bowed grandly to the cast and crew chester lifted his arms and cried and lets have a big round of applause for the best performance in an expiring role holly frost ragged cheers and for all the surviving members of the team this time the energy ran higher and the attendants joined in griffin walked at tonys side mcwhirters smile was as honest as the others it faded slightly when he sighted bobbick approaching with two security men he stopped before they reached him and shifted his pack off his shoulder he brushed a straggling hair off his forehead with a steady hand then extended it to alex thanks youve really been decent about this i promise you wont have any trouble out of me griffin took it and was surprised at the ferocity of tonys grip well see how it goes mcwhirter all right chief we can handle the prisoner now thank goodness alex shrugged off his backpack and let it thud into the ground marty escort him to detainment are the county cops here you know it weve got a lot to get done here marty was steering him along toward a side door while the other garners headed for the main exit ahead of them the two security men guided tony griffin turned to watch the garners leave most of them looked back over their shoulders to watch tony taken away but no one said anything until chester raised his voice he sounded tired griffin you coming to the tally party im sorry chester im going to be pretty busy he turned to go but henderson raised a beckoning hand youre invited you earned it tonight in my suite at the sheraton alex waved at him and turned back to marty youre going to have to help me through this im really tired bobbick made sympathetic sounds griffin caught one last glimpse of acacia she had paused by the gate almost as if she were about to turn around and speak then her shoulders sagged with fatigue and she walked on tony caught that pause and turned his head away the remnants of his smile dying altogether griffin watched her go and felt something sharp and hot pricking at his gut he handed his backpack to marty who took it without comment switching a wad of gum from one side of his mouth to the other come on grill weve got a car for you alex nodded wordlessly responding more to nudges than to words the textured plastic seat of the hovercar seemed alien to him and he dropped into it hard as if testing its reality he leaned back and let his eyes close his body jolting forward a halfinch as the car started to move they were tired they were dirty their shoulders sagged under the weight of their packs they looked like walking dead as they stumbled into the hot spot they stopped looked about them blearily and found all tables full alone at a table that might barely hold five drinks a tall black woman beckoned cheerily she looked familiar somehow gina thought she smiled and started that way tugging on chesters backpack strap knowing gwen and ollie would follow they stacked their packs against a wall ollie headed for the orders window while chester looked for empty chairs good game the stranger said im gloria washington chester performed introductions gina was wondering where she had seen her before suddenly the memory dropped into place and gina swayed in place vision blurring the tall woman saw it she snatched an empty chair from the next table overmoving stiffly a bit clumsily but fastand slid it into place behind gina here sit down love i didnt mean to startle you i thought youd recognise me gina sat down hard you were missing an arm and a leg the last time i saw you and the make up chester smiled suddenly aha the demon undead undead that was a very effective piece of misdirection it was wasnt it how did you urn i picked the wrong time to visit antarctica ciudad i was lucky they thawed anything these prostheses are well i can use them but ive had a hard time getting used to anyway when mrs lopez suggested this walking dead gig my doctor thought it would be great therapy get me used to the idea she was slowing down having trouble getting words out that im a person who has one leg and one arm but still a person you know i think he was right ollie arrived carrying a tray hands converged on mugs of swiss treats before he could reach the table gina savored the heat and sweetness in her mouth her own hunger suddenly stronger than her fatigue the moment of revelation youre real again she said right or wrong it was hellishly effective i couldnt believe you werent a hologram it was like you came straight out of a grave she laughed but it was shaky im glad we met it was bothering me she knocked her mug against gloria washingtons skoal confusion to our enemies gloria answered alex crumbled a sheet of paper into a tiny ball and bounced it off the wall into the recycler he wanted another cup of coffee but it would have turned his stomach into an acidscarred wasteland whats left his voice sounded like a strangers tired and thin a stack of printout paper leered back at him from the top of the desk and he groaned my god numbly he touched his computer screen to life and asked it for a second printout of urgent material only as expected a mere four sheets folded up out of the desk one was a synopsis of the mcwhirter briefing it would be sent to all concerned department heads on a needtoknow basis griffin nodded as he read tony had kept his promise his description of the woman who had contracted him for the job might do them little good shed have changed both name and description but they probably had enough information to nail the pickup man with the stakes as high as they were someone had to try for the hidingplace he initialed the sheet at the bottom and set it aside two pages were a condensation of park business for the last four days he set it aside after a brief skim he and the computer had differed before on what was urgent and what wasnt the last sheet was a query into the status of albert rices personal belongings that needed thought and a clearer head than the one he carried at the moment he glanced at his watch a quarter to eleven and time for any sane human being to get some sleep hellwhy bother going all the way back to cmc why not just curl up in the office he thumbed down the light and yawned until the hinges of his jaw hurt every muscle ached for sleep but a singie image remained clear and sharp in his mind damn you acacia leave me alone her face that lovely darkeyed face with the questioning mouth had been haunting him all day the most overwhelming reality of four days of fantasy he glanced at his watch again and muttered theyre probably all in by now then remembered the earlymorning bull sessions of the game and knew he was lying to himself why fight it he wanted to go tired and irritable and slogged down in a cesspool of work he still wanted a chance to say goodbye to an unforgettable group of maniacs and perhaps one particular lady maniac he swung his feet down from the desk and was moving towards the door almost as they hit the ground alex took strange satisfaction in the debilitated condition of the other garners chesters suite was spacious enough to accommodate the extra couches those couches were draped with bonelesslooking blearyeyed casualties the suite looked like an emergency ward only the garners who had been killed out the day before seemed alive and the empty beerskins scattered around the room gave even these good reason to look woozy he caught a strong sweet whiff of something that wasnt tobacco and ground his teeth weighing duty against fatigue no contest fatigue won he saw acacia in the corner of the room and headed toward her without haste letting his ears drink in snatches of talk a halffamiliar voice jarringly energetic no no no the haiavaha was there because you needed the antifire to fight the undead you were supposed to ignore the airplanes egg entirely and why didnt you go back for more antifire it was richard lopez sharing a couch with his wife and chester henderson the game master seemed awake and alert mitsuko lopez listened without comment her attention shifting as if she watched a tennis match cant tell me that you werent standing in front of the damned thing chester said without heat he fished absently in a bowl of dried dip with a handful of corn chips then popped them all into a mouth that had already started to speak again ooo ner thrying you were trying to kill us off and you know it richard shook his head be your age where would i sell the game that wiped out lore master chester henderson im too tired to giggle you were going easy on us hey lopez oh my youthful enthusiasm sometimes leads me to excesses mitsuko had to keep reminding me of the money wed lose if i played too rough terrible woman always business before pleasure he and his wife exchanged a quick kiss chester saw alex and extended a hand hey griffin good game man youre not half bad a ghost spoke behind him and alex jumped what happens to mcwhirter griffin gina but shes dead its out of my hands he said glad that it was true he kept moving he didnt want to talk about it maryem dressed in light green slacks and blouse and looking quite undrowned was another sight he found startling she was deep into reminescence with owen and margie and a stranger a boy in a wheelchair when she spied alex pressing through the crowd griffy she bawled from some reserve of human strength she found the energy for what amounted to a flying tackle setting him back on his heels i was afraid that you wouldnt make it overcome with an absurdly strong wave of emotion for the chunky little woman griffin hugged her back fiercely she stepped back and set her fists on her hips measuring him i may be off my mark but i think youre gonna be one helluva gamer he raised both hands in protest oh no no more for me thanks she snorted derisively like hell her grin faded to something softer comeere griffy theres somebody i want you to meet alex followed her to the braddons who greeted him with weary nods margie asked did you hear about the frogman alex he shook his head negative go on tell him maryem the short woman laughed remember when i went under griffy do i jesus all i remember is you went glub and disappeared and a cold hand clamped on my ankle and wait a minute i felt a hand at the time i just just accepted it am i nuts you arent that maniac lopez actually had a guy in scuba gear under the water he pulled me down and fed me air i laughed so hard that i almost drowned she shared their laughter then pulled griffin over to the boy who sat in the wheelchair on closer estimate griffin revised his estimate of his age he looked closer to thirty than seventeen his unlined face and thin body carried the illusion with ease at any distance over a few feet griffy she said and there was a tone in her voice a gentleness and caring that transformed her face into something lovely grifly id like you to meet my brother patrick patrick her voice was sweet low as if talldng to a beloved child this is a very important man this is alex griffin the chief of security for all of dream park patrick reacted slowly his head weaving in little circles as he raised it to say hhello mismister griffin he fought over the last syllable of alexs name he raised a frail hand for alex to shake the effort of keeping it in the air a heartbreaking thing to watch alex took it in the gentlest of grips im pleased to meet you patrick yyoure a nize man mimister griffin i saw you ssave muh my sister twice patricks eyes lost their dull sheen as they glowed with the memory alex crouched down she was worth it believe me patrick watched the whole game she said beaming with approval he always watches griffin took a hunch did your brother ever game himself maryem nodded sensing that alex understood until the accident yes now she touched his head fondly and he rubbed it against her hand like an affectionstarved kitten now he just watches his big sister he can even understand most of what happens he looked from one of them to the other the crippled man child and the stunted warrior and the hunch grew solid how long have you been gaming maryem she nodded right again griffy youre definitely detective material thats a relief nice knowing you marymartha he nodded to patrick who watched his sister with worshipping eyes griffin softened his voice and you too patrick maryem grabbed alexs arm and wrenched him down planting a big wet kiss on his cheek you aint shed of me yet well go crazy again sometime maybe so he picked his way across the room to acacia who sat with gwen and ollie there was an empty space next to her that no one had filled and griffin could almost feel tonys absence there were weary smiles in the group of three and their voices were subdued gwen and ollie for once werent touching somehow it didnt seem to matter they sat very close to each other and the affection between them was virtually a tangible thing making the corner a warm place to be as he walked toward them the blare of the music receded to a dull throb in his ears he stood directly behind acacia and ollies eyes flickered up to meet his as griffin laid a large warm hand on her shoulder without turning she said hello alex he lit up inside the weariness vanquished by the magic of her voice he sat next to her understanding who the space was really for she turned slowly until her soft brown eyes scanned his face and the edges of her mouth tugged up you know he said as honestly as he could ive wanted you to say my name for a long time her answer was a meld of warmth and reserve only the dark rings under her eyes betrayed a lack of sleep i wish that id known it and she waited a silent question griffin shook his head i cant say cas ii its tonys first offense it is and he continues to cooperate and if a reasonable doubt exists as to the degree of maliciousness or premeditation he heard the whistle of air wind its way from his lungs and felt old maybe ten years i dont really know she was outraged and you cant help acacia jesus how to say it i like tony i dont have anything against him at all but he planned to steal something worth millions in the process he was guilty of assault and battery to say the very least if the park and the state should want to drop him into a hole and pave over the topwhy should i say no if a fire in her head had been stoked with gasoline her eyes couldnt have blazed hotter he cut off her outburst acacia to you this is someplace you visit once or twice a year filled with people whose names you never know working overtime to provide your thrills now im not blaming you if i were you id probably think the same way about this for us its it isnt fair alex he didnt mean to kill anyone tony would never do that desperation seeped into her voice i thought i knew him dammit i do know him im sure he checked that guards breathing before he left him alex i know hhn tell it to the coroner tell it to rice for that matter alex fought to keep irritation from his voice this wasnt what he wanted to talk about or what he wanted to say maybe he should just leave but gwen reached across and touched acacias shoulder and her budding anger melted all right it was all his fault there was a hollowness in the air that alex wanted to fill with something words touches but he sat there next to her almost touching but not quite until ollie tugged at gwens hand come on hon he said i think we should go count some sheep these two need to talk acacia breakfast tomorrow you know it goodnight gwen good game griffin gwen hugged acacia goodnight acacia watched the two of them leave you should have seen the reunion ollie and gwen yes it was weird ollie seemed scared to touch her at first she had to grab and kiss him before he could move they both laughed and both knew it was only postponing the inevitable when the chuckle died they said nothing then griffins hand stole over to find hers she squeezed it weakly leaving tomorrow cas she smoothed her hair back with her free hand thats what the ticket says then i guess thats it nice knowing you i mean really she clenched her teeth and bored into the rug with her eyes i wish i could say the same thing alex felt her hand cool and withdrew before she could break contact its down to that then dont misunderstand me youre fascinating griffin and sexy as hell and a little frightening did you seriously come in here to put the make on me after sending my boyfriend up for ten years that was that the air clouded with frost oh for a word a clever line its just the neutral scent talking babe dont flatter yourself i was invited he said and stood up griffin she called up to him her eyes impossibly wide there was an accomplice wasnt there an inside man suppose tony was set up what if they did get away with whatever it was that they wanted suppose tony was just a patsy and while you prosecute him the big people are all getting away alexs expression didnt change the fantasy is over acacia tony played the wrong game in the wrong place and hes going to have to pay for it damn you just cant say anything without being mr griffin can you then the only words that mattered bobbed up in his mind like letters in a bowl of alphabet soup im just sorry we had to meet like this he said she was silent but the air was just a shade warmer and he knew she had believed and then all that could be said having been said he left griffin felt his weight settle into his mattress a twohundredpound deadweight of human being the temperature in his bedroom was seventy degrees and he didnt bother pulling the sheets up over his body he watched the sleep pattern dancing in the air in front of his eyes soothing pastel freeforms that pulsed and bobbed at eighteen beats per minute here the distant gurgle of his living room aquarium and his low steady breathing were the only sounds here away from the babble outside he could listen to his body feel the bruises and hurts the places where he felt good the clean spot in his mind that would fill in with work here he was free to let his control go and sleep and he couldnt sleep not at all his job was done there was nothing he could do should want to do about acacia tomorrow he would wrap up his report with harmony be debriefed and that would pretty well end his personal involvement rest for days he had thought of nothing that would make him happier and now with the sleeppattern snaking in front of his eyes the warm air circulating around his naked body nothing seemed further away murder in dream park god what a nightmare could it have been an accident despite what novotney said doctors werent omniscient could tony be a consummate liar despite everything griffin thought he had seen in him the griffin wasnt omniscient either or had he been set up suppose just suppose rice was the inside man what a grim joke that would be rice was in a good position to commit the burglary suppose rice handed the notes and neutral scent to tony then allowed tony to tie him up both following instructions wrap him up like a christmas present so that a third accomplice unsuspected by either could shut rices mouth by pinching his nose shut griffin shook his head it was the kind of thought you could only have about a man you disliked it irked him to admit that he had never warmed to rice but then rice had never given griffin much chance to warm to him distant polite but cold capable of that total indifference even toward the man to whom he owed his job alex squinted in the darkness following a disturbing train of thought if rice was the true thief still why should he be killed if he knew too much but why should he have been told any more than tony no that wasnt it because rice was in the wrong place at the wrong time then what did he see what did he know griffy youre definitely detective material griffin listened to his breathing thunder in his chest the blood roaring in his ears and knew that he had to call millicent he propped himself upright and said switchboard the screen formed a pale violet rectangle of light a voice asked yes mr griffin stifling a yawn he said summers millicent summers priority call twenty seconds later millie rippled to life in front of him her eyes puffy and halfcrossed with bleariness chief whats up gotcha he thought but it didnt seem to matter i need your help hon you did the research even as he spoke she was coming alert her eyes focussing mouth hardening by god he thought to himself maybe i never will learn her secret chapter thirtyone departures at ten past ten that wednesday morning skip obrien looked like the surviving garners had looked stumbling out of the goose smiling successful but very tired he blinked at griffin and harmony and seeing no returning smiles lost his own am i late alex felt awake and alert after ten hours of sleep we havent been here long coffee skip you look like you need it he was already holding the pot good black thanks i didnt get to bed till two this morning worth it though skip slid his briefcase onto the desk and took the cup griffin handed him griffin refilled harmonys empty cup then his own harmony gulped made a face good well im glad to be wrapping this mess up finally skip your report please griffin watched skip remove three sheets from his briefcase and sort through them skip adjusted his glasses and skimmed down the chosen sheet we recovered almost half of the neutral scent considering the level of impact felt by the gaming party i believe we can safely conclude that weve got it all the formula has been recovered and we have stressanalyzed testimony indicating no copies were made although we dont have tapes to study the report filed by security chief griffin would seem to indicate that the drug performed at a level beyond our most optimistic expectations he smiled shallowly i think weve got a winner gentlemen he settled the papers back in his lap harmony tapped a thick finger on his desk pad very good alex its not quite so neat on my end mr harmony the bald mans face remained immobile explain please im just not sure that we know the truth yet there are some questions about rice that need to be answered wasnt it murder the coroner says so mcwhirter says he left rice alive and healthy and the voicestress test says he isnt lying but mcwhirters no doctor incidentally we picked up his accomplice at five this morning when he tried to recover the notes and the neutral scent alex grinned suddenly wet as a cat in the rain he was and not happy mcwhirter was supposed to leave the stuff behind the fake waterfall hes given us that much anyway we dont know who the man in sacramento was yet we will my question is was rice involved his apartment was rifled only two days before he was taking an unscheduled break exactly what are you saying skips eyes were narrowed its pretty thin but thieves have been known to fall out among themselves harmonys finger tapped more quietly im still not sure i follow griffin sighed here it came and it wasnt going to be pretty but he could be wrong he could still hope he was wrong alex said rice claimed that nothing was missing from his apartment we think he lied a statue was missing the statue was known to be hollow two days later rice is dead and the neutral scent turns up missing skip when exactly was the last time that the contents of that cabinet had been checked i see what you mean skip thought a moment id have to check all right now think with me suppose the neutral scent was already gone suppose rice stole it and the whole thing went down to divert suspicion then harmonys frown deepened you think that the statue held the vial and someone stole it back gave it back to us that doesnt make sense a lot of this doesnt make sense mr harmony maybe rice got greedy and didnt sell the drug to his friends maybe mcwhirter is a more calculating man than any of us realize all i know is that somethings wrong and im having bobbick check rices place again what we need may be there obrien squinted havent you already searched rices place not thoroughly just photographed well somebody searched it true and maybe they didnt get what they were looking for there are a lot of ways to hide things in a cmc apartment that an outsider might miss a place large enough to hide a statue no no only enough to hide what someone thought was in it rice was a sculptor you know it wouldnt have been hard for him to rig a fake brick for his fireplace a holo projection of a book could cover a hole in his shelf i dont really know alex glanced at the cuff of a fresh shirt bobbick must be almost there by now if theres anything there well find it skip snapped his briefcase shut whew this sounds pretty bad id better go and check the dates on that cabinet if youll excuse me alex thought a wordless curse harmony patted the air with his hand that can wait skip i need to know about the formula we recovered how familiar with it are you enough to be sure its the real thing iits hard to say i uh i could check with sacramento but if the leaks there the real formula could be switched already and if it isnt we cant compare them over an open line he sat down reluctantly then popped up again listen i may have some notes on this in my lab if i match them up harmony looked at griffin then back again he hadnt liked this when griffin broached the subject earlier when it was still hypothetical now he hated it and it showed in his face why dont you just get them on the phone have your office check well have a courier bring it over if necessary iwe cant uh theres been too much trouble already its too valuable youre too valuable to us here skip griffin said gently he turned to harmony theres only one person in sacramento whose name turned up in albert rices telephone book lady named prentice sonja prentice harmony nodded grimly the blood was draining from obriens cheeks his eyes flicked from harmony to griffin to harmony what the hell is this about he could barely speak the breath whistling weakly in his throat its about getting to the truth skip obriens mouth worked wordlessly you cant yes we can griffin said we know about sonja and we know about you and rice jesus obrien whispered then his eyes blazed and his lips set in a taut pale line im not saying a goddamned thing until i talk to my lawyer harmony spoke now and his voice cultured and precise was an ugly thing to hear im not sure you appreciate our position obrien alex and i talked this over before you arrived we cant have you prosecuted unfortunately skips eyes narrowed what do you mean what do you think would happen if it was known that cowles industries chief psychiatrist the man who has headed up our child research division for six years is a coldblooded murderer you did it skip griffin said hollowly you were in a position to alter rices computer records you could discover the forgery later after rice was dead you were working in r d the night he was killed he leaned close to skip whose eyes were closed now his breathing heavy we just need to know the truth skip all of it either we get it from you or the police come in and drag it out for us and the papers get everything again obriens mouth worked without sound then a long arid sigh it was the girl prentice my god it was so long ago he lit a cigarette with a shaking hand griffin watched the smoke haze around skip in a cloud until harmony whisked it into the ceiling rice was my student at sulphur university bright promising we became friends my wife found it so damn easy to get into the swing of being a university wife the entertaining the parties albert could talk sense and he he listened to me looked up to me he gestured aimlessly with the cigarette the smoke making spirals in the air we bad a thing it didnt last for that long but it was pretty intense more of a crush maybe when i tried to back off he grn crazy just nuts swore to tell the university said i was abandoning him that i didnt give a damn about him i tried to show him that i did griffin waited for him to continue then started to prod gently but skip continued by himself sonja was a girl who had taken a class from me the semester before she was lonely i knew that and i thought that maybe maybe there was enough common ground to form a bond between them had you had a thing with her too alexs voice was dangerously quiet obrien nodded miserably good old skip giving his all for the youth of america for a while it worked maybe only to spite me to prove he wasnt the emotional cripple he accused me of making him albert and sonja starting relating it was during this time that she modeled for his statue sometimes sometimes the three of us would play together he closed his eyes and swallowed by damn he whispered as an officer of this municipality alex you had better know that none of this is admissible in court i know griffin said flatly finish it what was supposed to be in the statue albert was into drugs that was why he made the hollow statue he had made some freebase cocaine in the lab one night we all got incredibly high smoking it sonja got too high too damn high i dont know why albert kept feeding it to her but be seemed to enjoy watching her literally lose her mind and she lost more than that he nodded we were all zonked out and finally i noticed that sonja was having trouble breathing i was stoned and scared and i tried to apply some kind of resuscitation she just stopped breathing thats all i couldnt believe it i was too scared to call the ambulance christ my job my wife so she died skip couldnt face them she died honestlyplease believe me i did try to call the police then but albert pleaded with me begged me not to said that we could get her back into the dormi tory without getting caught i was still high i didnt know what to do harmony was pitiless so you let him talk you into it yes albert went out to dispose of the smoking kit and the drugs in his apartment then at three in the morning we carried sonja into her dormitory got her into her room and left her undressed in bed i remember reading the papers hearing them talk about the suicide he buried his face in his hands i stopped seeing rice and that was the end of it until two years ago he called me at home the bastardl he said he knew i worked at cowles industries and he needed a job he didnt make any threats but it was there hanging i should have gotten rid of him somehow i got him the job then the demands started right a better job manipulate his psych proffie just a little twist of the arm a little blackmail that grows griffin left it open but obrien was shaking his head it wasnt like that really it was do a favor for a friend then it was make sure you stay my friend he kept pushing and i kept trying to draw the line finally he told me that he still had the smoking kit and that all those sets of fingerprints were on it his mine hers if i didnt do as he said the police would get it he told me i had more to lose than he did he was right so i broke into his apartment and ripped it apart looking for the kit i broke the statue open but there wasnt anything in it the next day he told me i had twentyfive hours to falsify his records or he would go to the police i did it the night that the r d center was broken into i went to meet him to tell him that now he had as much to lose as i did and that all bets were off skip seemed to have forgotten them his eyes were dreamy peaceful he wasnt seeing anything in harmonys office i found him in the break room trussed up like a turkey i already knew it wouldnt work it couldnt hed keep pushing me as long as there was a reasonable doubt as to my weakness i wanted my job my freedom my marriage he could ruin me and there he sat looking at me over that big wide bandage across his mouth waiting for me to turn him loose he was sniffling trying to suck in enough air skips voice was shot through with horrified fascination fear and heady power he was sniffling like calling attention to his nose alex it was like finding an easter basket the day after easters over when i held his nose shut he went crazy i had to kneel on his chest to keep him steady it took two minutes before i could get a good grip and another three before he finally stopped struggling he looked at his fingernails chose one after careful deliberation and began to chew on it i never found the smoking kit maybe your man bobbick will have better luck alex said i doubt it rice must have dumped it just like he told you the first time the office was deadly quiet for a while smoke wafted silently into the ceiling fan three still and silent men watched each other with calculating eyes harmony said it first well what do i do we know you did it but probably cant prove it even if we could we couldnt afford to turn you in too many innocent people would suffer cowles industries would suffer he drummed those thick fingers on his desk griffin youve called the shots on this thing so far any ideas yes alex kept his voice cold and refused to allow himself to look at skip first skip resigns from cowles industries effective immediately second he agrees never to work with children ever anywhere again if he does now he looked at skip from the way his former friend pulled back shrinking into his chair alex knew that obrien was seeing a griffin he had never seen before then we have a talk with his employers and his wife do you understand skip nodded griffin closed his eyes lightly and then theres the matter of tony mcwhirter he may be a thief but hes no killer and i dont want him treated like one alex we cant tell the district attorney harmony began no we cant but we can offer tony legal assistance i can testify that a reasonable doubt exists as to his capacity for coldblooded murder that together with the voicestress analyzer if he takes it may well counterbalance the coroners report all right and one more thing even with that a couple of years are going to be added on his sentence for oh negligent homicide at the least when he gets out of jail im going to offer him a job with me he beat my security system and i can use him well what do you say the man with the linebacker shoulders nodded that seems fair he turned to the man with the briefcase the man with the flesh stretched tight across his cheekbones who seemed to be trying to hide in the plushness of his chair all right obrien harmony said his voice for once unmelodic ugly id like you to dictate your letter of resignation and then go clean out your desk i want you out of the park by and out of cmc by next week griffin stood arent you staying alex no i dont have any stomach for this he had reached the door when he heard skip whining but what do i tell melissa and before he could stop his tongue he heard himself say just follow your instincts skip tell her anything but the truth then the door sighed shut behind him alex watched the towers and domes of dream park shift in his office shadowpuppets that swirled and loomed at his command there were people in the streets he couldnt see their faces or hear their sounds but he knew they were happy their balloons and cotton candy and plaid cotton shirts said so the children that skipped to a faroff jaunty melody said so there was sunshine out there and color and magic and music but tomorrow or next week the people would leave go back to their worlds carrying a little bit of the dream with them to lighten their lives and when those lives grew dreary again they could think of vacations and holidays and travel and dream park he had to laugh at himself how often had he accused the garners of blurring the line between fantasy and reality the truth was that their fantasy was his reality and their reality his fantasy tony would go to his grave thinking he had killed a man and there was nothing to be done about it for that matter it was true enough tony mcwhirter had gambled the lives of anyone who crossed his path that night he might have found a witness waiting when he emerged from g a and then what he might have crushed rices windpipe rice might well have died of a stopped nose mcwhirter could have died in that fight leaving rice to carry the guilt of the manslayer instead he had left rice as a gift to anyone with the whim to hold his nose shut tony must have known the odds when he set forth to rob dream park people die during burglaries but if tony mcwhirter was getting justice then what was skip obrien getting alexs fingers dug into the controls on his desk and the shadows shifted now the abandoned gaming area now the streets of section one now the hotel transport strips it wasnt fair it just wasnt for skip obrien to escape was obscene see you later chief right and maybe if griffin had consciously noted that rice had no words for obrien his former teacher the man who got him his job at dream park if he had noticed that rice had been talking to him for obriens benefit taunting they must have skipped over anything important but that was expecting too much of himself and that wasnt fair either a holo window opened up in the air above his desk and millies face materialized you have a visitor gruff millie was unusually subdued eyes worried she and bobbick had been treating him with kid gloves ever since hed laid out his suspicions about obrien friend buddy killer cant it wait millie his voice was more petulant than he cared to admit leave me alone let me hurt i dont think so alex he sighed and faded the holo map to black send em in when she stood in the doorway outlined in the darkness her brown hair flowing behind her like a scarf he swallowed not knowing if this was something he wanted he thumbed up the light hello alex hello cas what brings you here do i need a reason no no but youve got one she nodded smiling i just wanted to tell you that you were voted fifty bonus points for best novice player he leaned back in his seat and folded his hands behind his head she walked a few steps closer may i sit down please she folded herself into a chair and wiped her hands on her slacks i thought you might want to know the final score he was silent just watching her as a party we won almost points personally i walked away with a hundred and sixty she paused you earned a hundred and seventyfour counting your bonus congratulations youre no longer a novice player somehow her smile grew so warm and alive that it crossed the distance between them and they shared it thank you i really appreciate that ive been feeling very much the novice lately theres something else alex i care about tony maybe i love him im not sure but he used me to get into the game hey no they probably propositioned him after he was already registered theyd have wanted a novice her brows contracted oh she shrugged her strong smooth shoulders lifting under her blouse never mind what he didi cant let what happened stop me from letting you know how much i like you not now cas but she already understood no not now but youre not rid of me and ill be back her dark eyes twinkled at him sooner than you want probably i doubt that he heard himself say surprised and glad that he had been able to get it out past numbed lips my train leaves in twenty minutes she said rising he stood and the gulf between them grew great impossibly great again he held out his hand she looked at it for a second then took it gently he pulled her closer feeling only the slightest tug of resistance and kissed her it was a light brief kiss but it was less an ending than a promise and he was happy she turned pausing only at the door ill be back alex she said he fumbled in his mind for something appropriate to say good game he said finally the beginning of a grin framing the words good game she echoed and closed the door behind her he sat there in his office grinning like an idiot presently he tapped the corn line millie his dark genie materialized yes gruff my desk is irritatingly clear dammit isnt there some work to do you bet chief then wire it in here he stretched his head side to side listening to his neck pop good game damn straight it had been on its way she said his desk printer began to hum oh and one more thing whats that ive never met a slayer of the unclean before can i have your autograph we heroes are a busy lot he said blandly ill try to work you in tuesday he watched the sheets of fanfold paper sprout out of his desk when it reached a pile an inch high it stopped millie whistled thats a lot of business backed up there good luck personally id rather be fighting monsters wouldnt we all he said silently wouldnt we all he tore off the sheets and went to work afterword the authors had a wonderful time researching dream park as we hope you will agree melanesian myth patterns are as bizarre convoluted and imaginative as any in the world all of the various monsters and most of the magics are taken from the literature available concerning new guinea and its sibling isles road belong cargo by peter lawrence was the single most informative work albert and sylvia frerichs anutu conquers in new guinea benjamin t butchers my friends the new guinea headhunters roy wagners habu and ian hogbens the island of menstruating men are also worth reading the cargo cult is the melanesians attempt to explain the disparity between their own lifestyle and the superior technology of the europeans who changed their lives the melanesian approach was and is pragmatic they adapted christian deities to their own naturalistic pantheon to form such entities as godmanup jesuskilibob and goddodo they hoped that the right combination of ceremonies and imitation of europeans would open the road of the cargo bringing them the wealth that god intended for all his children equally when one approach to ihe rot bilong kako failedand they have all failed to datethe melanesians always tried something else even twenty years ago there had been at least five systems of cargo cult belief and where it stands now is anybodys guess because it is intended to divert goods now reaching europeans alone the cargo cult is by nature a secret society and illegal the worship of european artifacts created some truly bizarre situations one tribe did indeed try to hatch an airplanes egg in a fire with results better imagined than witnessed europeans ignorant of the cargo cult have found themselves involved in strange schemes intended to divert mail or to build airfields there seems no sure way to convince a melanesian native that his worldpicture is wrong if present spells are not effective he tinkers some more with the systemas if a european were working on a car that has been seen to run consider the case of yali born in yali was undoubtedly the secret leader of the cargo cults in the late s and midls he enlisted in the army during world war ii and was trained in australia he toured europeanstyle factories he returned to new guinea claiming to have seen god and his cargo workshops a highly intelligent charismatic war hero he amassed great power through his system of boss boys who controlled political and religious activity in dozens of villages his legend includes a tale of yalis death and rebirth in the jungle depending on whos talking he was either a saint or one of the greatest con men who ever lived peter lawrence sees yali as himself a victim of the melanesian worldpicture he saw those factories as an elaborate ritual intended to divert goods created and sent by god cargo cult or the worship of material goods is only one facet of melanesian mythology the winds the tides and rains all were influenced by an incredible array of gods goddesses spirits and netherbeings the fore do indeed exist and are the only group of people on earth known to be carriers of kuru the laughing sickness they are feared as magicians and cannibals of terrific ferocity giant snakes lizards birds and other natural creatures abound and required no modification to bend them to our story needs magical creatures needed a bit more modification the nibek is a village monster or big thing it is generally described as having a head like a snakes a body like a huge stone and legs like a centipedes it has a tiny mouth that expands in the manner of a python swallowing a rat the dread biditaurabohaza the man ripe making animal is precisely as presented a tropical gorgon of immense lethality the haiavaha was a demigod who guarded the secret of fire according to legend a dog stole the secret and brought it to mankind we added the reverse fire as well as the justso type why dogs cant talk anecdote zombies of one kind or another are common to many cultures the melanesians are no exception the spruce goose is of course an actual plane it flew only once off long beach california with howard hughes aboard the fantastic trooptransport was constructed almost totally of wood and was never put into production the concepts of gaming used in dream park are drawn from many sources computergaming dungeons and dragons the society for creative anachronism and the fiendish imaginations of fans throughout the southern california area to the many friends who contributed eyes ears and voice to the creation of this book a hearty thanks without your knowledge and enthusiasm writing dream park would have been far less than the exhilarating experience it was
