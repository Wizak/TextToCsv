adjuvant quam mollissime oportet pedem referre quintillian l vi c these verses have always been printed in my collected poems and as the best of them may bear a single reading i allow them to appear but in a less conspicuous position than the other productions a chick before his shell is off his back is hardly a fair subject for severe criticism if one has written anything worth preserving his first efforts may be objects of interest and curiosity other young authors may take encouragement from seeing how tame how feeble how commonplace were the rudimentary attempts of the halffledged poet if the boy or youth had anything in him there will probably be some sign of it in the midst of his imitative mediocrities and ambitious failures these first verses of mine written before i was sixteen have little beyond a common academy boys ordinary performance yet a kindly critic said there was one line which showed a poetical quality the boiling ocean trembled into calm one of these poems the reader may guess which won fair words from thackeray the spectre pig was a wicked suggestion which came into my head after reading danas buccaneer nobody seemed to find it out and i never mentioned it to the venerable poet who might not have been pleased with the parody this is enough to say of these unvalued copies of verses first verses phillips academy andover mass or translation from the eneid book i the god looked out upon the troubled deep waked into tumult from its placid sleep the flame of anger kindles in his eye as the wild waves ascend the lowering sky he lifts his head above their awful height and to the distant fleet directs his sight now borne aloft upon the billows crest struck by the bolt or by the winds oppressed and well he knew that junos vengeful ire frowned from those clouds and sparkled in that fire on rapid pinions as they whistled by he calls swift zephyrus and eurus nigh is this your glory in a noble line to leave your confines and to ravage mine whom i but let these troubled waves subside another tempest and i quell your pride go bear our message to your masters ear that wide as ocean i am despot here let him sit monarch in his barren caves i wield the trident and control the waves he said and as the gathered vapors break the swelling ocean seemed a peaceful lake to lift their ships the graceful nymphs essayed and the strong trident lent its powerful aid the dangerous banks are sunk beneath the main and the light chariot skims the unruffled plain as when sedition fires the public mind and maddening fury leads the rabble blind the blazing torch lights up the dread alarm rage points the steel and fury nerves the arm then if some reverend sage appear in sight they stand they gaze and check their headlong flight he turns the current of each wandering breast and hushes every passion into rest thus by the power of his imperial arm the boiling ocean trembled into calm with flowing reins the father sped his way and smiled serene upon rekindled day the meeting of the dryads written after a general pruning of the trees around harvard college a little poem on a similar occasion may be found in the works of swift from which perhaps the idea was borrowed although i was as much surprised as amused to meet with it some time after writing the following lines it was not many centuries since when gathered on the moonlit green beneath the tree of liberty a ring of weeping sprites was seen the freshmans lamp had long been dim the voice of busy day was mute and tortured melody had ceased her sufferings on the evening flute they met not as they once had met to laugh oer many a jocund tale but every pulse was beating low and every cheek was cold and pale there rose a fair but faded one who oft had cheered them with her song she waved a mutilated arm and silence held the listening throng sweet friends the gentle nymph began from opening bud to withering leaf one common lot has bound us all in every change of joy and grief while all around has felt decay we rose in everliving prime with broader shade and fresher green beneath the crumbling step of time when often by our feet has past some biped natures walking whim say have we trimmed one awkward shape or lopped away one crooked limb go on fair science soon to thee shall nature yield her idle boast her vulgar fingers formed a tree but thou halt trained it to a post go paint the birchs silver rind and quilt the peach with softer down up with the willows trailing threads off with the sunflowers radiant crown go plant the lily on the shore and set the rose among the waves and bid the tropic bud unbind its silken zone in arctic caves bring bellows for the panting winds hang up a lantern by the moon and give the nightingale a fife and lend the eagle a balloon i cannot smile the tide of scorn that rolled through every bleeding vein comes kindling fiercer as it flows back to its burning source again again in every quivering leaf that moments agony i feel when limbs that spurned the northern blast shrunk from the sacrilegious steel a curse upon the wretch who dared to crop us with his felon saw may every fruit his lip shall taste lie like a bullet in his maw in every julep that he drinks may gout and bile and headache be and when he strives to calm his pain may colic mingle with his tea may nightshade cluster round his path and thistles shoot and brambles cling may blistering ivy scorch his veins and dogwood burn and nettles sting on him may never shadow fall when fever racks his throbbing brow and his last shilling buy a rope to hang him on my highest bough she spoke the mornings herald beam sprang from the bosom of the sea and every mangled sprite returned in sadness to her wounded tree the mysterious visitor there was a sound of hurrying feet a tramp on echoing stairs there was a rush along the aisles it was the hour of prayers and on like oceans midnight wave the current rolled along when suddenly a stranger form was seen amidst the throng he was a dark and swarthy man that uninvited guest a faded coat of bottlegreen was buttoned round his breast there was not one among them all could say from whence he came nor beardless boy nor ancient man could tell that strangers name all silent as the sheeted dead in spite of sneer and frown fast by a grayhaired seniors side he sat him boldly down there was a look of horror flashed from out the tutors eyes when all around him rose to pray the stranger did not rise a murmur broke along the crowd the prayer was at an end with ringing heels and measured tread a hundred forms descend through sounding aisle oer grating stair the long procession poured till all were gathered on the seats around the commons board that fearful stranger down he sat unasked yet undismayed and on his lip a rising smile of scorn or pleasure played he took his hat and hung it up with slow but earnest air he stripped his coat from off his back and placed it on a chair then from his nearest neighbors side a knife and plate he drew and reaching out his hand again he took his teacup too how fled the sugar from the bowl how sunk the azure cream they vanished like the shapes that float upon a summers dream a long long draught an outstretched hand and crackers toast and tea they faded from the strangers touch like dew upon the sea then clouds were dark on many a brow fear sat upon their souls and in a bitter agony they clasped their buttered rolls a whisper trembled through the crowd who could the stranger be and some were silent for they thought a cannibal was he what if the creature should arise for he was stout and tall and swallow down a sophomore coat crowsfoot cap and all all sullenly the stranger rose they sat in mute despair he took his hat from off the peg his coat from off the chair four freshmen fainted on the seat six swooned upon the floor yet on the fearful being passed and shut the chapel door there is full many a starving man that walks in bottle green but never more that hungry one in commons hall was seen yet often at the sunset hour when tolls the evening bell the freshman lingers on the steps that frightful tale to tell the toadstool there s a thing that grows by the fainting flower and springs in the shade of the ladys bower the lily shrinks and the rose turns pale when they feel its breath in the summer gale and the tulip curls its leaves in pride and the blueeyed violet starts aside but the lily may flaunt and the tulip stare for what does the honest toadstool care she does not glow in a painted vest and she never blooms on the maidens breast but she comes as the saintly sisters do in a modest suit of a quaker hue and when the stars in the evening skies are weeping dew from their gentle eyes the toad comes out from his hermit cell the tale of his faithful love to tell oh there is light in her lovers glance that flies to her heart like a silver lance his breeches are made of spotted skin his jacket is tight and his pumps are thin in a cloudless night you may hear his song as its pensive melody floats along and if you will look by the moonlight fair the trembling form of the toad is there and he twines his arms round her slender stem in the shade of her velvet diadem but she turns away in her maiden shame and will not breathe on the kindling flame he sings at her feet through the livelong night and creeps to his cave at the break of light and whenever he comes to the air above his throat is swelling with baffled love the spectre pig a ballad it was the stalwart butcher man that knit his swarthy brow and said the gentle pig must die and sealed it with a vow and oh it was the gentle pig lay stretched upon the ground and ah it was the cruel knife his little heart that found they took him then those wicked men they trailed him all along they put a stick between his lips and through his heels a thong and round and round an oaken beam a hempen cord they flung and like a mighty pendulum all solemnly he swung now say thy prayers thou sinful man and think what thou hast done and read thy catechism well thou bloodyminded one for if his sprite should walk by night it better were for thee that thou wert mouldering in the ground or bleaching in the sea it was the savage butcher then that made a mock of sin and swore a very wicked oath he did not care a pin it was the butchers youngest son his voice was broke with sighs and with his pockethandkerchief he wiped his little eyes all young and ignornt was he but innocent and mild and in his soft simplicity out spoke the tender child oh father father list to me the pig is deadly sick and men have hung him by his heels and fed him with a stick it was the bloody butcher then that laughed as he would die yet did he soothe the sorrowing child and bid him not to cry oh nathan nathan whats a pig that thou shouldst weep and wail come bear thee like a butchers child and thou shalt have his tail it was the butchers daughter then so slender and so fair that sobbed as it her heart would break and tore her yellow hair and thus she spoke in thrilling tone fast fell the teardrops big ah woe is me alas alas the pig the pig the pig then did her wicked fathers lips make merry with her woe and call her many a naughty name because she whimpered so ye need not weep ye gentle ones in vain your tears are shed ye cannot wash his crimson hand ye cannot soothe the dead the bright sun folded on his breast his robes of rosy flame and softly over all the west the shades of evening came he slept and troops of murdered pigs were busy with his dreams loud rang their wild unearthly shrieks wide yawned their mortal seams the clock struck twelve the dead hath heard he opened both his eyes and sullenly he shook his tail to lash the feeding flies one quiver of the hempen cord one struggle and one bound with stiffened limb and leaden eye the pig was on the ground and straight towards the sleepers house his fearful way he wended and hooting owl and hovering bat on midnight wing attended back flew the bolt up rose the latch and open swung the door and little mincing feet were heard pat pat along the floor two hoofs upon the sanded floor and two upon the bed and they are breathing side by side the living and the dead now wake now wake thou butcher man what makes thy cheek so pale take hold take hold thou dost not fear to clasp a spectres tail untwisted every winding coil the shuddering wretch took hold all like an icicle it seemed so tapering and so cold thou comst with me thou butcher man he strives to loose his grasp but faster than the clinging vine those twining spirals clasp and open open swung the door and fleeter than the wind the shadowy spectre swept before the butcher trailed behind fast fled the darkness of the night and morn rose faint and dim they called full loud they knocked full long they did not waken him straight straight towards that oaken beam a trampled pathway ran a ghastly shape was swinging there it was the butcher man to a caged lion poor conquered monarch though that haughty glance still speaks thy courage unsubdued by time and in the grandeur of thy sullen tread lives the proud spirit of thy burning clime fettered by things that shudder at thy roar torn from thy pathless wilds to pace this narrow floor thou wast the victor and all nature shrunk before the thunders of thine awful wrath the steelarmed hunter viewed thee from afar fearless and trackless in thy lonely path the famished tiger closed his flaming eye and crouched and panted as thy step went by thou art the vanquished and insulting man bars thy broad bosom as a sparrows wing his nerveless arms thine iron sinews bind and lead in chains the deserts fallen king are these the beings that have dared to twine their feeble threads around those limbs of thine so must it be the weaker wiser race that wields the tempest and that rides the sea even in the stillness of thy solitude must teach the lesson of its power to thee and thou the terror of the trembling wild must bow thy savage strength the mockery of a child the star and the waterlily the sun stepped down from his golden throne and lay in the silent sea and the lily had folded her satin leaves for a sleepy thing was she what is the lily dreaming of why crisp the waters blue see see she is lifting her varnished lid her white leaves are glistening through the rose is cooling his burning cheek in the lap of the breathless tide the lily hath sisters fresh and fair that would lie by the roses side he would love her better than all the rest and he would be fond and true but the lily unfolded her weary lids and looked at the sky so blue remember remember thou silly one how fast will thy summer glide and wilt thou wither a virgin pale or flourish a blooming bride oh the rose is old and thorny and cold and he lives on earth said she but the star is fair and he lives in the air and he shall my bridegroom be but what if the stormy cloud should come and ruffle the silver sea would he turn his eye from the distant sky to smile on a thing like thee oh no fair lily he will not send one ray from his faroff throne the winds shall blow and the waves shall flow and thou wilt be left alone there is not a leaf on the mountaintop nor a drop of evening dew nor a golden sand on the sparkling shore nor a pearl in the waters blue that he has not cheered with his fickle smile and warmed with his faithless beam and will he be true to a pallid flower that floats on the quiet stream alas for the lily she would not heed but turned to the skies afar and bared her breast to the trembling ray that shot from the rising star the cloud came over the darkened sky and over the waters wide she looked in vain through the beating rain and sank in the stormy tide illustration of a picture a spanish girl in reverie she twirled the string of golden beads that round her neck was hung my grandsires gift the good old man loved girls when he was young and bending lightly oer the cord and turning half away with something like a youthful sigh thus spoke the maiden gray well one may trail her silken robe and bind her locks with pearls and one may wreathe the woodland rose among her floating curls and one may tread the dewy grass and one the marble floor nor halfhid bosom heave the less nor broidered corset more some years ago a darkeyed girl was sitting in the shade theres something brings her to my mind in that young dreaming maid and in her hand she held a flower a flower whose speaking hue said in the language of the heart believe the giver true and as she looked upon its leaves the maiden made a vow to wear it when the bridal wreath was woven for her brow she watched the flower as day by day the leaflets curled and died but he who gave it never came to claim her for his bride oh many a summers morning glow has lent the rose its ray and many a winters drifting snow has swept its bloom away but she has kept that faithless pledge to this her winter hour and keeps it still herself alone and wasted like the flower her pale lip quivered and the light gleamed in her moistening eyes i asked her how she liked the tints in those castilian skies she thought them misty t was perhaps because she stood too near she turned away and as she turned i saw her wipe a tear a roman aqueduct the sunbrowned girl whose limbs recline when noon her languid hand has laid hot on the green flakes of the pine beneath its narrow disk of shade as through the flickering noontide glare she gazes on the rainbow chain of arches lifting once in air the rivers of the romans plain say does her wandering eye recall the mountaincurrents icy wave or for the dead one tear let fall whose founts are broken by their grave from stone to stone the ivy weaves her braided tracerys winding veil and lacing stalks and tangled leaves nod heavy in the drowsy gale and lightly floats the pendent vine that swings beneath her slender bow arch answering arch whose rounded line seems mirrored in the wreath below how patient nature smiles at fame the weeds that strewed the victors way feed on his dust to shroud his name green where his proudest towers decay

captive earth supplied the dew of memorys passing tear falls on the arches of her pride from a bachelors private journal sweet mary i have never breathed the love it were in vain to name though round my heart a serpent wreathed i smiled or strove to smile the same once more the pulse of nature glows with faster throb and fresher fire while music round her pathway flows like echoes from a hidden lyre and is there none with me to share the glories of the earth and sky the eagle through the pathless air is followed by one burning eye ah no the cradled flowers may wake again may flow the frozen sea from every cloud a star may break there conies no second spring to me go ere the painted toys of youth are crushed beneath the tread of years ere visions have been chilled to truth and hopes are washed away in tears go for i will not bid thee weep too soon my sorrows will be thine and evenings troubled air shall sweep the incense from the broken shrine if heaven can hear the dying tone of chords that soon will cease to thrill the prayer that heaven has heard alone may bless thee when those chords are still la grisette as clemence when i saw thee last trip down the rue de seine and turning when thy form had past i said we meet again i dreamed not in that idle glance thy latest image came and only left to memorys trance a shadow and a name the few strange words my lips had taught thy timid voice to speak their gentler signs which often brought fresh roses to thy cheek the trailing of thy long loose hair bent oer my couch of pain all all returned more sweet more fair oh had we met again i walked where saint and virgin keep the vigil lights of heaven i knew that thou hadst woes to weep and sins to be forgiven i watched where genevieve was laid i knelt by marys shrine beside me low soft voices prayed alas but where was thine and when the morning sun was bright when wind and wave were calm and flamed in thousandtinted light the rose of notre dame i wandered through the haunts of men from boulevard to quai till frowning oer saint etienne the pantheons shadow lay in vain in vain we meet no more nor dream what fates befall and long upon the strangers shore my voice on

such the wide earth shows with fairer cheeks and brighter eyes match us the star and rose the winds that lift the georgians veil or wave circassias curls waft to their shores the sultans sail who buys

ask not for the dainty toil of ribboned knights and earls the daughters of the virgin soil our freeborn yankee girls by every hill whose stately pines wave their dark arms above the home where some fair being shines to warm the wilds with love from barest rock to bleakest shore where farthest sail unfurls that stars and stripes are streaming oer god bless our yankee girls linconnue is thy name mary maiden fair such should methinks its music be the sweetest name that mortals bear were best befitting thee and she to whom it once was given was half of earth and half of heaven i hear thy voice i see thy smile i look upon thy folded hair ah while we dream not they beguile our hearts are in the snare and she who chains a wild birds wing must start not if her captive sing so lady take the leaf that falls to all but thee unseen unknown when evening shades thy silent walls then read it all alone in stillness read in darkness seal forget despise but not reveal stanzas strange that one lightly whispered tone is far far sweeter unto me than all the sounds that kiss the earth or breathe along the sea but lady when thy voice i greet not heavenly music seems so sweet i look upon the fair blue skies and naught but empty air i see but when i turn me to thin eyes it seemeth unto me ten thousand angels spread their wings within those little azure rings the lily bath the softest leaf that ever western breeze bath fanned but thou shalt have the tender flower so i may take thy hand that little hand to me doth yield more joy than all the broidered field o lady there be many things that seem right fair below above but sure not one among them all is half so sweet as love let us not pay our vows alone but join two altars both in one lines by a clerk oh i did love her dearly and gave her toys and rings and i thought she meant sincerely when she took my pretty things but her heart has grown as icy as a fountain in the fall and her love that was so spicy it did not last at all i gave her once a locket it was filled with my own hair and she put it in her pocket with very special care but a jeweller has got it he offered it to me and another that is not it around her neck i see for my cooings and my billings i do not now complain but my dollars and my shillings will never come again they were earned with toil and sorrow but i never told her that and now i have to borrow and want another hat think think thou cruel emma when thou shalt hear my woe and know my sad dilemma that thou hast made it so see see my beaver rusty look look upon this hole this coat is dim and dusty oh let it rend thy soul before the gates of fashion i daily bent my knee but i sought the shrine of passion and found my idol thee though never love intenser had bowed a soul before it thine eye was on the censer and not the hand that bore it the philosopher to his love dearest a look is but a ray reflected in a certain way a word whatever tone it wear is but a trembling wave of air a touch obedience to a clause in natures pure material laws the very flowers that bend and meet in sweetening others grow more sweet the clouds by day the stars by night inweave their floating locks of light the rainbow heavens own foreheads braid is but the embrace of sun and shade oh in the hour when i shall feel those shadows round my senses steal when gentle eyes are weeping oer the clay that feels their tears no more then let thy spirit with me be or some sweet angel likest thee how few that love us have we found how wide the world that girds them round like mountain streams we meet and part each living in the others heart our course unknown our hope to be yet mingled in the distant sea but ocean coils and heaves in vain bound in the subtle moonbeams chain and love and hope do but obey some cold capricious planets ray which lights and leads the tide it charms to deaths dark caves and icy arms alas one narrow line is drawn that links our sunset with our dawn in mist and shade lifes morning rose and clouds are round it at its close but ah no twilight beam ascends to whisper where that evening ends the poets lot what is a poets love to write a girl a sonnet to get a ring or some such thing and fustianize upon it what is a poets fame sad hints about his reason and sadder praise from garreteers to be returned in season where go the poets lines answer ye evening tapers ye auburn locks ye golden curls speak from your folded papers child of the ploughshare smile boy of the counter grieve not though muses round thy trundlebed their broidered tissue weave not the poets future holds no civic wreath above him nor slated roof nor varnished chaise nor wife nor child to love him maid of the village inn who workest woe on satin the grass in black the graves in green the epitaph in latin trust not to them who say in stanzas they adore thee oh rather sleep in churchyard clay with urn and cherub oer thee to a blank sheet of paper wanvisaged thing thy virgin leaf to me looks more than deadly pale unknowing what may stain thee yet a poem or a tale who can thy unborn meaning scan can seer or sibyl read thee now no seek to trace the fate of man writ on his infant brow love may light on thy snowy cheek and shake his edenbreathing plumes then shalt thou tell how lelia smiles or angelina blooms satire may lift his bearded lance forestalling times slowmoving scythe and scattered on thy little field disjointed bards may writhe perchance a vision of the night some grizzled spectre gaunt and thin or sheeted corpse may stalk along or skeleton may grin if it should be in pensive hour some sorrowmoving theme i try ah maiden how thy tears will fall for all i doom to die but if in merry mood i touch thy leaves then shall the sight of thee sow smiles as thick on rosy lips as ripples on the sea the weekly press shall gladly stoop to bind thee up among its sheaves the daily steal thy shining ore to gild its leaden leaves thou hast no tongue yet thou canst speak till distant shores shall hear the sound thou hast no life yet thou canst breathe fresh life on all around thou art the arena of the wise the noiseless battleground of fame the sky where halos may be wreathed around the humblest name take then this treasure to thy trust to win some idle readers smile then fade and moulder in the dust or swell some bonfires pile to the portrait of a gentleman in the athenieum gallery it may be so perhaps thou hast a warm and loving heart i will not blame thee for thy face poor devil as thou art that thing thou fondly deemst a nose unsightly though it be in spite of all the cold worlds scorn it may be much to thee those eyes among thine elder friends perhaps they pass for blue no matter if a man can see what more have eyes to do thy mouth that fissure in thy face by something like a chin may be a very useful place to put thy victual in i know thou hast a wife at home i know thou hast a child by that subdued domestic smile upon thy features mild that wife sits fearless by thy side that cherub on thy knee they do not shudder at thy looks they do not shrink from thee above thy mantel is a hook a portrait once was there it was thine only ornament alas that hook is bare she begged thee not to let it go she begged thee all in vain she wept and breathed a trembling prayer to meet it safe again it was a bitter sight to see that picture torn away it was a solemn thought to think what all her friends would say and often in her calmer hours and in her happy dreams upon its longdeserted hook the absent portrait seems thy wretched infant turns his head in melancholy wise and looks to meet the placid stare of those unbending eyes i never saw thee lovely one perchance i never may it is not often that we cross such people in our way but if we meet in distant years or on some foreign shore sure i can take my bible oath ive seen that face before the ballad of the oysterman it was a tall young oysterman lived by the riverside his shop was just upon the bank his boat was on the tide the daughter of a fisherman that was so straight and slim lived over on the other bank right opposite to him it was the pensive oysterman that saw a lovely maid upon a moonlight evening a sitting in the shade he saw her wave her handkerchief as much as if to say i m wide awake young oysterman and all the folks away then up arose the oysterman and to himself said he i guess i ll leave the skiff at home for fear that folks should see i read it in the storybook that for to kiss his dear leander swam the hellespont and i will swim this here and he has leaped into the waves and crossed the shining stream and he has clambered up the bank all in the moonlight gleam oh there were kisses sweet as dew and words as soft as rain but they have heard her fathers step and in he leaps again out spoke the ancient fisherman oh what was that my daughter t was nothing but a pebble sir i threw into the water and what is that pray tell me love that paddles off so fast its nothing but a porpoise sir that s been a swimming past out spoke the ancient fisherman now bring me my harpoon ill get into my fishingboat and fix the fellow soon down fell that pretty innocent as falls a snowwhite lamb her hair drooped round her pallid cheeks like seaweed on a clam alas for those two loving ones she waked not from her swound and he was taken with the cramp and in the waves was drowned but fate has metamorphosed them in pity of their woe and now they keep an oystershop for mermaids down below a noontide lyric the dinnerbell the dinnerbell is ringing loud and clear through hill and plain through street and lane it echoes far and near from curtained hall and whitewashed stall wherever men can hide like bursting waves from ocean caves they float upon the tide i smell the smell of roasted meat i hear the hissing fry the beggars know where they can go but where oh where shall i at twelve oclock men took my hand at two they only stare and eye me with a fearful look as if i were a bear the poet lays his laurels down and hastens to his greens the happy tailor quits his goose to riot on his beans the weary cobbler snaps his thread the printer leaves his pi his very devil hath a home but what oh what have i methinks i hear an angel voice that softly seems to say pale stranger all may yet be well then wipe thy tears away erect thy head and cock thy hat and follow me afar and thou shalt have a jolly meal and charge it at the bar i hear the voice i go i go prepare your meat and wine they little heed their future need who pay not when they dine give me today the rosy bowl give me one golden dream tomorrow kick away the stool and dangle from the beam the hot season the folks that on the first of may wore winter coats and hose began to say the first of june good lord how hot it grows at last two fahrenheits blew up and killed two children small and one barometer shot dead a tutor with its ball now all day long the locusts sang among the leafless trees three new hotels warped inside out the pumps could only wheeze and ripe old wine that twenty years had cobwebbed oer in vain came spouting through the rotten corks like jolys best champagne the worcester locomotives did their trip in half an hour the lowell cars ran forty miles before they checked the power roll brimstone soon became a drug and locofocos fell all asked for ice but everywhere saltpetre was to sell plump men of mornings ordered tights but ere the scorching noons their candlemoulds had grown as loose as cossack pantaloons the dogs ran mad men could not try if water they would choose a horse fell dead he only left four redhot rusty shoes but soon the people could not bear the slightest hint of fire allusions to caloric drew a flood of savage ire the leaves on heat were all torn out from every book at school and many blackguards kicked and caned because they said keep cool the gaslight companies were mobbed the bakers all were shot the penny press began to talk of lynching doctor nott and all about the warehouse steps were angry men in droves crashing and splintering through the doors to smash the patent stoves the abolition men and maids were tanned to such a hue you scarce could tell them from their friends unless their eyes were blue and when i left society had burst its ancient guards and brattle street and temple place were interchanging cards a portrait a still sweet placid moonlight face and slightly nonchalant which seems to claim a middle place between ones love and aunt where childhoods star has left a ray in womans sunniest sky as morning dew and blushing day on fruit and blossom lie and yet and yet i cannot love those lovely lines on steel they beam too much of heaven above earths darker shades to feel perchance some early weeds of care around my heart have grown and brows unfurrowed seem not fair because they mock my own alas when edens gates were sealed how oft some sheltered flower breathed oer the wanderers of the field like their own bridal bower yet saddened by its loveliness and humbled by its pride earths fairest child they could not bless it mocked them when they sighed an evening thought written at sea if sometimes in the dark blue eye or in the deep red wine or soothed by gentlest melody still warms this heart of mine yet something colder in the blood and calmer in the brain have whispered that my youths bright flood ebbs not to flow again if by helvetias azure lake or arnos yellow stream each star of memory could awake as in my first young dream i know that when mine eye shall greet the hillsides bleak and bare that gird my home it will not meet my childhoods sunsets there oh when loves first sweet stolen kiss burned on my boyish brow was that young forehead worn as this was that flushed cheek as now were that wild pulse and throbbing heart like these which vainly strive in thankless strains of soulless art to dream themselves alive alas the morning dew is gone gone ere the full of day lifes iron fetter still is on its wreaths all torn away happy if still some casual hour can warm the fading shrine too soon to chill beyond the power of love or song or wine the wasp and the hornet the two proud sisters of the sea in glory and in doom well may the eternal waters be their broad unsculptured tomb the wind that rings along the wave the clear unshadowed sun are torch and trumpet oer the brave whose last green wreath is won no strangerhand their banners furled no victors shout they heard unseen above them ocean curled safe by his own pale bird the gnashing billows heaved and fell wild shrieked the midnight gale far far beneath the morning swell were pennon spar and sail the land of freedom sea and shore are guarded now as when her ebbing waves to victory bore fair barks and gallant men oh many a ship of prouder name may wave her starry fold nor trail with deeper light of fame the paths they swept of old qui vive qui vive the sentrys musket rings the channelled bayonet gleams high oer him like a ravens wings the broad tricolored banner flings its shadow rustling as it swings pale in the moonlight beams pass on while steelclad sentries keep their vigil oer the monarchs sleep thy bare unguarded breast asks not the unbroken bristling zone that girds yon sceptred tremblers throne pass on and take thy rest qui vive how oft the midnight air that startling cry has borne how oft the evening breeze has fanned the banner of this haughty land oer mountain snow and desert sand ere yet its folds were torn through jenas carnage flying red or tossing oer marengos dead or curling on the towers where austrias eagle quivers yet and suns the ruffled plumage wet with battles crimson showers qui vive and is the sentrys cry the sleepless soldiers hand are these the painted folds that fly and lift their emblems printed high on morning mist and sunset sky the guardians of a land no if the patriots pulses sleep how vain the watch that hirelings keep
