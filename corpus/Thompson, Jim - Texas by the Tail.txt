texas by the tail by jim thompson copyright lintlike threads of cigarette smoke cloyed around the four men mingling with the faint fumes of very good whiskey occasionally swirling away from them with the soft explosions of some very bad words it was the night of the last day of fort worths internationally known rodeo and fat stock show the room was one of the hotels best a bargain by its tenants standards at thirty dollars a day as the man next to him crapped out mitch corley took out his wallet and peered into it deliberately through oldfashioned steelrimmed spectacles he was playing the rube here in fort worth the big frog from a little puddle the smalltown rich man he wore a ranchstyle hat an illfitting suit and a pongee shirt with a string tie glancing cautiously from his wallet to the three other men he looked fifteen years older than his thirtyfive all right with you fellas he said if i shoot two hundred two hundred the redfaced drilling contractor groaned jesus christ shoot two thousand if you want to yeah what the hell frowned the cattle buyer i thought you were a crapshooter pops god knows you talk a big game mitch hesitated letting their irritation mount then slowly counted five twenties onto the bed reckon i just better stick to a hundred he said dont feel so lucky tonight there was a chorus of groans and curses with dogged patience the lease dealer suggested that mitch might do well to pull out i reckon the games a little too fast for you corley maybe you better go back to pancake junction or wherever you came from and match pennies with the mayor now dont you go apokin fun at me mitch grumbled i done lost three hundred dollars tonight an i aim to get it back then shoot for christs sake crap or get off the hole mitch said that he was going to shoot and he was going to make it two hundred after all he again opened his wallet glancing at his watch as he counted out another hundred almost eight minutes yet eight minutes before the payoff and the takeout he would have to stall a little clumsily picking up the two dice he let one fall to the floor that took care of a minute in all which left him approximately seven more to kill again for the third time now he took out his wallet holy god the drilling contractor slapped his forehead what now im goin to shoot another hundred thats what you think im a piker ill show you shoot it shoot five hundred if you want to i reckon you think i wont mitch glared at him crankily i reckon you think i aint got five hundred pops the cattle buyer said wearily for gods sake pops all right mitch slammed more bills onto the bed im shootin five hundred he picked up the dice setting them with an invisible movement of his fingers fixing them to the necessary position he rattled them or appeared to actually the dice remained set he was only clicking one against the other he threw them with feigned awkwardness the red cubes spun down on the beds tightly stretched blanket came up on a six and an ace the man sevened intoned the lease dealer want to shoot it all corley you mean a whole thousand a whole thousand dollars goddammit the contractor hurled his hat across the room shoot something shoot or pass the dice mitch went for the grand he came out with a sixfive he was taunted and jeered and cursed into going for the two thousand why not youre shooting with our money all right by gosh ill do it he spun the dice out again a fourtrey faced up on the blanket as the others groaned he reached for the money i reckon i just better shoot a hundred this time he said or maybe just fifty if thats all right with you fellas it was damned well not all right with the fellas and they made him know it the hell hed drop the bet to peanuts while he held a bale of their money but four thousand dollars mitch protested four thousand dollars youre covered the cattle buyer said coldly shoot well all right mitch said nervously all right dang it he rubbed his hand against his pantleg wiping the sweat from it before picking up the dice his nervousness was not entirely feigned once even with the best of surgeons the scalpel may slip once the most skilled of knifethrowers may throw a little too close once only once the highwire walker may misstep to eternity so with the dice handler no amount of skill or practice is completely impregnable to luck there is no statute of limitations on the law of averages two minutes to go eight thousand dollars on the bed just about all they were carrying mitch guessed certainly all that it was safe to take away from a group like this and the taking would have to look very good no sevens or elevens this time nothing that a square might do legitimately an honest john might make seven or eight straight passes in a row but a hustler had to play it cute he clicked the dice he threw them awkwardly then stood chagrined as the others snorted with laughter up jumped the devil you got a big four pops now goddang mitch whimpered goddang it anyways want to bet a little more corley give you six to five danged if you wont mitch grumbled and they laughed again joe of course is the lowest point on the dice above it are phoebe five easy six craps eighterdecatur quinine big dick and the fielders heaveneleven and boxcars which have no bearing after the initial roll the theoretical odds against five and nine are approximately three to two as opposed to six to five for six and eight the odds are two to one against ten and four but any crapshooter will swear that ten is an easier point to make obviously little four has little going for him as if recognizing the fact he normally stays out of sight after showing his luckless little face roll em pops lets see some craps dont rush me mitch whined im rollin these here dice he threw them a big ten he threw again nine then eight and five and six where the hell was red what the hell was she waiting on with so much riding these guys could be hard to handle he was getting tense and tension was hell on control and there it was the signal the muted familiar cough coming from just outside the door it went unheard by the others lost in their own noise seven dice lets see a sixace come on pops what the hell you waitin for give me time dang it stop rushin me he wiped his hand against his pantleg again he picked up the dice set them clicked them and threw nerves whispered that it was a bad throw screamed silently that hed goofed off a weeks careful finagling and a wad of expense money in one bad moment he watched hopelessly as the cubes spun across the blanket seeming to spin forever and ever an eternity a split second they turned over twice in unison stopped with an imperceptible backspin two deuces peeked up from the blanket before the three men could react there was a sudden furious banging on the door they turned toward it automatically and mitch swept up the money and stuffed it into his pockets it was the contractors room with a curse he strode to the door and yanked it open now what the goddam hell what what dont you curse me you you thing red stormed into the room giving the contractor a shove that sent him stumbling backward her angry gaze scorched the other two men then settled witheringly on mitch who seemed to wilt beneath it uhhah there you are she allowed herself to see the dice and up to your old tricks again you just wait until i tell papa you just wait aw now sis mitch squirmed childishly these here fellas are just bums thats what they are just bums like you now you march right out of here march with her red hair her white highcheekboned face she was every inch the termagant obviously a dame to steer clear of but there was a fidget of protest from the three losers mitch had almost all their money and they were entitled to a chance to win it back and the lady could see that for herself couldnt she and she could see that they werent bums either ive got offices in amarillo and big spring and ouch the contractor fell back rubbing the side of his face red ran at the other two hands wickedly clawed voice rising she threatened to scream ill do it her eyes blazed insanely ill call the police she threw back her head mouth opened to its widest mitch grabbed her in the seeming nick of time ill go im comin right now sis just you calm down an he urged her toward the door grimacing overtheshoulder apologies sorry fellas but but they could see how it was couldnt they what could you do with a crazy woman like this he closed the door on the dazed silence behind him he and red went swiftly down the hall to the elevator she had already checked them out of their rooms of course and a blackshirted porter stood waiting with their baggage at the side entrance of the hotel as a cab sped them toward the railroad station she moved close on the seat to whisper to him i got us a stateroom together okay what he scowled in the darkness were registered as brother and sister and you now honey she was a little hurt i didnt get it through the hotel you were late tonight me why i dont see how i could have been what difference does it make whether you see it she moved away from him it would take very little more to get her truly angry which would not be something to enjoy but he was pretty burned up himself shed been late on the takeout dammit a whole two minutes late hed had to sweat in danger of losing the dough and getting a schlamming just because she couldnt be bothered to check the time what the hell had she been doing anyway what was she a woman with a kids head red said very quietly youd better shut up mitch but goddammit you were late i dont mean to talk rough to you honey but and dont honey me as they followed the redcap to their train he looked up at the station clock then took a startled glance at his watch fast by almost two minutes so the mixup was his fault red hadnt taken him out late as he should have known as he had known but hustling the heavy scores kind of drained a man dry and until he filled up again he didnt have anything but crap for anyone probably mitch supposed it was that way with any bigtime frammis even the legitimate ones at least most of the bigtimers he knew had screwed up personal lives if you were willing to settle for some gig like working for the park department and saving tinfoil as a hobby you could stay loose but on the hardhustle uhuh no matter how much you had on the ball there was still a limit to it and if you blasted it off you couldnt spread it out in their stateroom with the roadbed whispering swiftly beneath them his hunger for red suddenly became a raging thing and knowing that it was no use he began a roundabout apology mentioning acquaintances real and imaginary whom stress also made unreasonably unreasonable there was my dad god rest him he forced a reminiscent chuckle he was a specialeditions promoter you know traveled around the country putting out special editions of newspapers hed run a boiler room all day bossing a bunch of phone men and closing the tough babies himself and by the time night came you could hardly say hello to him without getting socked why i remember mitch sighed letting his voice trail away silently cursing her for being as she was hed hardly said a thing to her nothing at all compared to the guff he had to take from people yet apologies coaxing were obviously a waste of time she intended to stay sore the wellstocked commissary of her flesh was closed until further notice he was sure that she wanted him as badly as he wanted her that was apparent from the single stateroom she had booked but it was also apparent from her manner of undressing that she was prepared to make him suffer and to hell with her own sufferings normally she was almost prudishly modest forced to undress in close quarters she would do so under her nightgown primly urging him not to peek as she worked out of her clothes but when she didnt intend to let him have anything then she put it all on display everything that she wasnt going to let him have no pro could do a more tantalizing strip tease than an offended red she would pull her panties halfway down around her hips casually turning this way and that to give him a glimpse of what could be glimpsed fore and aft with her panties pulled halfway down then the brassiere was loosened and the breasts carelessly allowed to come into view pinktipped traced through with fine blue veins their abundance seeming to bow her fraillooking shoulders then if she was feeling particularly mean she would lift them up and examine them critically and lengthily until his tongue felt as big as a ball bat she was very down on him tonight so he got the breast bit in full then disdainfully she discarded the last wispy fragment of her underthings and stood naked with her feet slightly apart her head thrown back to let the red mass of hair spill down around her shoulders she raised her hands and began to fluff it her breasts moving delicately with the movements of her arms finally she ducked her head forward bringing her hair over her shoulders letting it spread silkily over her breasts it parted perfectly on either side of her beautifully shaped head and at last she looked at him the look of a wicked angel and spoke to him huskily howd you like to have a little mitch knew it was strictly zilch he said two words one a personal pronoun and the other a very naughty verb oh not even a teensy bit she measured an amount on her finger not even a teensyeensyweensy bit mitch groaned and reached for her surrendering red said the same two words that he had said then she hoisted herself into the upper berth and pulled the covers over her eventually mitch fell asleep in the lower berth dreaming not of red strangely but of his father dreaming that the old man was sore at the statement that he was a hard guy to get along with he wasnt at all unreasonable his father said not a goddamned bit and he certainly wasnt all things considered there was almost no time of complete relaxation in the life of mr corley sr if he was not driving a crew of highpowered telephone salesmen and doing twice the work of any two of them then he was working advance attempting to line up a publisher for the specialedition routine and here was a job to make the saintliest of men curse with frustration they were invariably hardheads those publishers chronic cynics with a talent for poking holes in the smoothest promotional pitch mitch knew because he and his mother peppery nervous fasttalking usually accompanied his father on the initial visit to the publisher mr corley wanted them along to show him the kind of folks who were coming into his community no flybynights sir just a plain oldfashioned american family this last was mitchs signal to grab the guys hand winsomely inquiring whether he had any little boys then stepping aside quickly he allowed his mother to move in and she practically straddled the guy pushing herself right up against him as she gushed out a torrent of flattery and then before the chump could run and hide mr corley drove in for the sell he was a hard man to say no to although it was said to him three times out of five the points he made were not only virtually irrefutable but put forth with mannerisms which were almost mesmeric he would not let a prospect look away from him if one tried to alarmed by the purring pounding perfectly enunciating voice corley would shift in his chair assuming whatever position was necessary bending practically to the floor if he had to until he again had the mans eye then his own gaze unblinking he would begin an imperceptible wagging of his head moving it with the rhythm of his words back and forth talking steadily all the time wagword wagword to and fro to and fro and mitch until he learned to look away to cut off the sight and sound of his father would feel his eyes glazing and a strange numbness creeping over him for that matter he did not need to look or listen to follow the pitch it was pretty well standardized the gradually puttogether product of years of attack and counterattack on the same general issues why certainly sir mr corley would say certainly you could put out a special edition yourself you could make yourself a suit of clothes too i suppose or build your own house but you dont do those things you dont do them because youre not an expert at them and you know and i know and we all know that when you want something done right you go to an expert or knocking down another sore point im glad you mentioned that sir glad very glad its quite true that some advertising departments cant sell an inch of space behind a special edition theyve had it for a year afterward their explanation is that theres just so much ad money in a town and if you take it out on a special you cant get it daytoday oh yes ive seen advertising departments like that alibi departments i call them and ive seen publishers who let them get away with it softheaded types you know men who ought to be running a soup kitchen instead of a newspaper but if you were that type as of course youre not and if you did have that kind of advertising department youd still be ahead with a special youve got it made in a wad instead of having it spread over a year and and still another why thats wonderful sir just about makes you unique all the business you can handle all you need so much that youre not even interested in a timetried and proved proposition which has earned the wholehearted endorsement of almost two hundred daily newspapers my congratulations sir i can only hope that some of my less fortunate publisher friends dont move in on your bonanza now i was talking to a man just last week who was looking for another location and so on and so on some towns did not have to be promoted after the first time they were sold solid and would go for a special every year or more often every two years but this seemed only to increase the pace there was lost time to make up for hard times to be anticipated and there were arrangements to make the chiefest of which was the rounding up of personnel the professional highpressure salesmen who made up the specialedition breed when working some of them made several thousand a month when not working which was about twothirds of the time they made for the nearest big city there to live it up with booze and broads until they were broke and corley or someone like him made contact often corley would send them money never to see either it or them again often they would arrive more fit for a hospital than work eventually however a crew would be put together and things would start to jump on an average there were from six to a dozen salesmen depending on the size of the town headquarters was any empty storeroom which could be rented cheaply the furniture boxes packing crates and telephones you had only to stick your head in the door to know why it was called a boiler room you had only to listen to the constant clamor of the phones the muted incessant roar of fasttalking voices to understand the cursing the chainsmoking the opened bottles of whiskey convenient to every mans hand yet they seemed to enjoy what they were doing they were all savagely goodnatured in midconversation a man would swiftly thrust his phone at mitch want to piss in this guys ear kid or covering the mouthpiece of his phone a moment well crap on you cicero sometimes there would be a screwup and topofthebead apologies were necessary oh no madam that isnt at all what i said you see we have a very elderly gentleman here in the office who is taking a trip around the world we fellows are sending him as a matter of fact and he was wondering which was the cheapest way to go so i said oh ship ship there was laughter excitement the sense of great things afoot of vast sums pouring in of magic doors to be swung open by the quick and the glib but being so close to his parents affairs mitch knew that what he saw here was only the shadow and not the substance the perilous periphery of the big time minds and bodies were being bet in a fixed race you might beat it sure and you might also become rich by saving a dollar a day for a million days mr corley strode in and out of the boiler room a dozen times a day but mostly worked outside his wife helen dutch as she was usually called worked the inside keeping track of sales occasionally taking over a phone frequently circulating the room to see that nothing or no one got too far out of hand although she was a small woman her clothes never seemed quite large enough for her her round little rearend was always molded against her skirt her full little bosom strained constantly against her blouse she moved around the room pepperily her voice snappish her quick movements making her jounce all over now and then she leaned down her hand resting impersonally on a guys shoulder as she lit her cigarette from his or listened in on a call occasionally needing to get off her feet for a moment she sat down next to a guy butting him over on his packingbox chair with a waspish little fling of her hips all day day after day the men were her life all day day after day there was the salty talk of men the rousing sight of men the harshsweet smell of men the roughly tender feel of men and then at night in the initselfsuggestive hotel room where even the towels and toilet the thick tubes of the bedstead the dangling knob of the chandelier the table legs where everything achieved a phallic symbolism there were no longer any men there was no man corley and his wife played different roles but essentially they shared the same life yet draining him dry it simultaneously replenished her everything that had been taken from him seemed to have been given to her and late at night with mitch supposedly asleep in the connecting room they quarreled furiously and fruitlessly dutch for christs sake answer me damn you do you know what this things for do you know what youre supposed to do with it aah honey no no by god dont you love me up unless youre going to go all the way dutch its this goddamned life the first good spot i see well settle down balls whats wrong with this life anyway i mean it im taking a regular job oh lay off for shits sake selling sand on the sahara thats a regular job i see you in it was probably true in the rarefied atmosphere of the fast buck corley was slowly strangling his lungs gradually robbed of elasticity yet he knew himself completely incompatible to the valleys the world below his slippery mountain top even as a young man he could not adapt to it and he was now very far from young mitch changed schools every two months on an average being bright and personable as well as transient he escaped the authoritative attention which the regular and lessfavored students received after all he would be moving on in a few weeks after all he was wellmannered and smart far ahead of his grade in some respects why bother then why make things harder for him than they doubtless already were if he made only token obeisance to curriculum and routine that was the way things went until he was in his second year of high school then at last there was a crackdown a truant officer caught him in an allday burlesque house and his derelictions were laid before his parents they responded typically his mother made a dash at him and jerked him vigorously by the shoulders she said he needed his little backside blistered and she was just the gal to do it his father said a kids brains werent in his butt and the thing to do was reason now i want to ask you something boy he said pulling mitch around in front of him i want to ask you something look at me boy i want to ask you just one goddamned question what do you want to do with your life boy wag wag what do you want to do with your life do you want to get yourself a good education wag wag a good education boy or do you want to be a jerk its up to you boy strictly up to you you can have an easy chair or a broom boy you can loll back in that easy chair in a fine big office with a pretty little gal like your mama for a secretary you can do that boy wag wag or you can take the broom and go along the gutter sweeping up horse turds now whats it going to be mitch made the indicated response over his mothers furious protest his father handed him a fiftydollar bill that represents education boy education is money money is security youve learned something here today boy and its already put money in your pocket mitch promptly lost the fifty in a crap game in the bellboys locker room dutchs reaction was typical ditto her husbands now goddammit boy maybe your brains are in your butt after all goddammit that old broomhandles reaching for you already boy boy wag wag dont you know there are people who can handle dice dont you know there are people whove educated themselves to make the dice behave well there wasnt anyone like that in the locker room you dont know that boy you dont know it because you dont know a goddamned thing about dice and youve just proved it i say you proved it wag wag you cant see to hit the pot and youve peed all over your own feet so youd better squat on it boy squat on that pot play it safe or hold your pee until you can find the light switch of education otherwise i fear for you boy wag wag i say i fear for you the shadow of the broom is hanging over you and i can smell those horse turds already mr corley died during mitchs last year of high school mrs corley shook her son furiously hugged him frantically wept wildly and calmly had the body cremated back at the hotel she studied her mirrored reflection for a long time at last anxiously asking mitch if he thought she looked to be fortytwo mitch thought a little lightness was in order he said she didnt look fortytwo not a day over fortyone and ninetenths dutch burst into tears again looked around for something to throw at him what a lousy thing to say and your poor father lying cold in his grave you mean hot in his jar dont you all right all right dodging hastily sure you dont look fortyone nothing like it you could pass for thirtyfour or five any day honest youre not just saying that her face cleared then clouded again but what am i going to do for gods sake i cant work alone ill have to hook up with another guy and how the hell can i do that with you on my hands gee said mitch maybe id better jump out a window now honey but you do have your school to finish and god only knows where ill be lighting next its going to take some time to make the right kind of tieup i dont mean marriage of course of course will you shut up youre so smart you think of something instead of bugging me all the time mitch shrugged he suggested that he stay right here where he was and she could do as she pleased they were old customers of the hotel on friendly terms with the management and hotels had many jobs for presentable youths surely they could give him some kind of parttime work something that would allow him to finish his school term wonderful oh thats marvelous darling she clapped her hands together why dont you see about it right away it was almost five years from that day before he saw her again five years and she had remarried and he had married he was still married reds belief to the contrary still married still married in his sleep mitch stirred uneasily the words the everpresent threat of his mind whispered voicelessly with the clicking of the rails if red found out if she ever found out that their supposedly loaded safedeposit box was virtually empty shell kill you shell kill you reds the gal to kill you houston the blackest land the whitest people where you never meet a stranger they say that as texas sloped to the south the cream of its population was drained off into houston they say that houston does what other cities talk about doing and never never talks about it one does not flaunt his wealth here one makes his multimilliondollar gifts to universities and philanthropic foundations if he has it he is expected to and shuns the publicity ordinarily accruing from such largesse houston is south you see and it cherishes all that is best of the south gallantry generosity hospitality forth worth is west and dallas is east and houston is south and dont you ever forget that it is south the whitest people where you never meet a stranger but dont ever forget that word white particularly if the adjective doesnt fit you red still had the frost on the next morning as they stepped down from the train at houston a strikinglooking pair who left a wake of envious and admiring glances behind them the trim handsomely tailored man jauntily distinguished with the touch of gray at his temples the impeccably dressed woman regal with her highheld red head her square little shoulders trailing an improbable length of silvery sable her gloved hand rested on mitchs arm as a matter of course she detested public breaches of etiquette but it was purely a formality her occasional smile went no further than her lips there was bare politeness in her reponses to his remarks mitch knew it was time for drastic measures otherwise her anger allowed to deepen red might easily turn drastic herself reaching the interior of the station he excused himself and signaled the redcap to wait then he entered a phone booth and opened the directory he was in the booth for quite a while red was obviously puzzled and irritated by the delay but of course she said nothing not until they had been in the cab for several minutes and she suddenly became aware of its direction did she turn to him whats this i thought we had reservations downtown i cancelled them were checking in at a hotelapartment for a month mitch dropped his voice glancing meaningfully at the driver we need to be together for a while red some place where being together wont seem out of line we were together last night remember i know and im sorry dear terribly terribly sorry please forgive me wont you ill think about it keep asking me for a few years mitch took her hand she pulled it away but not until he had held it for a moment or two so she was melting a little he went on talking to her pressing his advantage i know a months a long time in one place but we can both use a rest the fat stock show in fort worth coming right after that convention in mineral wells i can take it im not the one whos blowing my top all the time i know but anyway i thought we might rent us a car while were here its only about a hundred and fifty miles to the school and we could drive over and see the boy big deal i should care about seeing your kid mitch repressed a smile she was nuts about his son there was a moment of silence while red somehow moved a little closer to him then with vast indifference she asked how soon they could see the boy i mean she amended hastily when do we have to mitch laughed fondly he told her that they could and would do anything she wanted to any time she wanted to and they would never do anything she did not want to do red said they would go tomorrow in that case then barely whispering a lovely blush suffusing her paleness i suspect well be pretty busy today her hand gripped his convulsively hand in hand they arrived at their destination mitch registered for them in the usual manner mr and miss corley once you started a thing like that you were stuck with it to the end since they were taking the place by the month the rent was payable in advance mitch paid it adding on another thousand as a credit an amount certain to be used up in charges long before the month was out ever so faintly worried he turned away from the desk and joined red at the elevator of course there were still a few bills in the safedeposit box a little better than three grand probably but even so he was very low on money almost dangerously low by the standards of the bigtime hustler even without splurges like the present one the overhead for red and himself travel payoffs everything was conservatively fifty thousand a year and he had other expenses his sons among them besides reds and his own with that kind of money pouring out with the necessity to be able to bet big and to absorb the rare but inevitable losses wisdom demanded a bankroll of at least twenty thousand dollars now including the dough in the deposit he had barely half that something would have to break fast he told himself something would break fast houston was a hell of a town all the money in the world was here well most of it anyway and the people were wonderful confidently with reds incredible body brushing against him he stepped out of the elevator and into their apartment red suppressed a gasp when she saw it the bellboys had hardly departed before she had her arms around him hugging him with fierce halffearful delight oh my god honey what have you done like it like it bbut im afraid to ask what it cost dont not unless you want to be called onecheek red mmm i mean ill bite a big juicy chunk out of your tail red laughed blushed and gave him a feverish kiss grabbing his hand she began dragging him through the place it was a penthouse with a threesided view of the city in the immense living room with its ceilinghigh fireplace was a fullsize grand piano ivory finished to blend with the snowy white carpeting there were two bedrooms and a maids room three baths and a powder room in the master bedroom red wheeled and put her arms around his waist breasts shivering with excitement dont tell me she begged i dont want to know how much but just a little hint not half what its worth to see you pleased you darling im going to make it up to you today for last night i mean you couldnt be a little more specific anything you kknow her body seemed to be on fire anything big category mitch pointed out little girl youll see now about that hint weel a very wellknown public figure is reputed to have stayed here how wellknown the wellknownest the biggest his meaning suddenly sank in on her you mean the pres she put her hands against his chest and firmly pushed him away out out right this minute i want to get into something comfortable before i faint mitch sat down in the living room and picked up a telephone a parade of servants began to arrive a maid bellboys with morning papers blooms for the flower vases and an assortment of liquors for the bar a waiter with breakfast signing the various checks with suitable tips penciled in mitch estimated that their total at about one hundred and fifty dollars he sighed unconsciously he summoned red now dressed in a formfitting housecoat and they went out on the terrace to breakfast her hair blazed in the morning sun her skin seemed as delicately transparent as the porcelain cup that she lifted to her lips she ate delicately but enthusiastically the food reacting like a tonic to her food did to her what drink did to other people the brown eyes sparkled joyously the highcheekboned face seemed to glow with contentment mitch smiled watching her she smiled back at him a little defensively so im a pig there wasnt too much food around when i was a kid do you remember our first meal together red pointed to her mouth speech was impractical at the moment she chewed swallowed and shuddered ecstatically then she said of course she remembered how could she ever forget a thing like that adding casually that it was about five years ago wasnt it mitch laughed stop trying to trap me you know damned well its over six years six years three months twelve days she nodded and smiled dreamily wasnt it funny the way we met dear strange i mean what was funny about it mitch said i was looking for you you mean you were looking for someone to work with i mean i was looking for you mitch said and that was true but he hadnt known it until hed seen her red stood up abruptly and silently held out her hands mitch took them and kissed them then picked her up and carried her into the bedroom one of the worlds worst trains the absolute worst in the belief of many people runs from oklahoma city to memphis it has no diner its cars are of preworld war i vintage without airconditioning or other common comforts its schedule is presumably the product of a comicbook writer the many and prolonged delays are variously attributed to such causes as holdups by jesse james impromptu hunting and fishing parties by the crew and funerals for passengers who have advanced into and died en route of old age most of those who ride it do so because they must the occasional exceptions are usually sufferers from semantic insanity interpreting discomfort as quaint and the insufferable as interesting mitch had boarded the train because it was the quickest connection out of oklahoma city and he needed to get away from the city fast he was feeling very despondent at the time having just fired his assistant he was afraid that if he lingered around her he might weaken and hire her back which would have been very bad for both of them she was a very good kid in his book a former model and bitactress she had enough class and looks for two women she had in fact almost everything going for her but one thing she was a sucker for the sauce the weakness hadnt showed up for quite a while probably it was the strain that brought it out but there it was and it kept getting worse mitch talked to her like a father he scolded her unhappily he spanked her pointing out that she should be ashamed to need such punishment at her age nothing did any good she continued to louse him up invariably getting drunk just when he needed her worst the realization came to him finally that she just couldnt help it that if she was ever to get better it would not be around him so she wept heartbrokenly and he got a little blurryeyed himself but there was only one thing to do and he did it and jumped town on the first thing he could grab he may have been very tired he had been up with his exassistant for two nights running or he may have simply fled into sleep to escape the nightmare of the train at any rate it was around sunset when he returned to wakefulness and found this redhaired babe sitting next to him her duds were obviously discards from a rummage sale and she was eating some horrible guck out of a paper sack she turned abruptly looking at him out of the coolest steadiest eyes he had ever seen and suddenly he pieced those eyes and the hair and that complexion together with the rest of her and he saw her as she could be at the same time he realized how he must look to her unshaven redeyed his suit rumpled his shirt sweaty and sootstained she added him up item by item and sympathy came into her face eat something she said proffering the sack of guck youll feel better mitch said no no he was just fine but red knew he wasnt papa had been like that a lot and he always felt better after mama gave him a cold sweet potato and some pone mitch did a little nibbling the conductor came through taking orders for box lunches to be telegraphed ahead to the next stop but the girl grabbed mitchs hand as he started to reach for his wallet they charge a dollar a piece for those things you just save your money to get straightened out with but really the idea throwing money away and you with barely a stitch to your back she was unaware obviously that baggage could be checked on ones ticket born and raised in a jerkwater community a village dying with the croppedout land around it there was much that she did not know but she did know oh how well she knew a jobless propertyless drunk when she saw one youll feel better in the morning she patted his hand papa always does she went on talking apparently trying to cheer him up with papas unceasing miseries and the concomitant troubles of his family things had been pretty nice for a while what with her two older brothers joining the army and sending home allotments but they kind of had papas talent for messing themselves up and had soon messed themselves into death as a result of their own misconduct so there was not only no more allotment money but also none of the emoluments usually associated with service deaths of course everyone at home worked when they could chopping and picking for others as well as cropping their own but when land wouldnt even make a quarterbale an acre well where were you particularly where were you when you had a force the size of papas i worked in the library until they closed it down and then the general store until it closed and then the telephone exchange until it closed there just wasnt any reason for them anymore you know everyone was leaving who could but papa was ailing again and mama was pregnant again a note of bitterness disgust and at least they have a house where they are and she red had been elected to go to memphis to get a job immediately and promptly send some money home and dont think i wont she declared her chin jutting out uh what kind of work do you do uh mitch mitch for mitchell do you mind being called red why should i uh what kind of work did you say you did mitch he decided to level with her she seemed to be the kind you could do it with im a gambler oh i guess youre not very good at it are you what if i told you i was very good that i had ways of winning almost all the time id say you should she said firmly if you cant win you shouldnt play but if youre so good why he told her why briefly giving her a glimpse of his bankroll by way of documentation the reaction was not the one he had expected so you were lying to me her eyes flashed fire you sat right there and told me youd got drunk and lost your job and didnt even have enough to why no i didnt i didnt say anything you did too just the same as i tried to be nice and you made a fool out of me mitch asked her if she wanted him to find another seat and she tossed her head with a humph that was the way with liars she said first they lied to you and then they ran i could give you a job red he persisted youd make a great deal of money and you hush up i know the kind of job youd give me no really hush mitch hushed the train grew very cold with the coming of night and he lowered the windows around them then shrugging down in the seat he tried to pull his coat across his chest red primly opened her suitcase making a production out of it she took out a bulky something and began tucking it around her at last settled back cozily she shot a haughty glance at mitch you see she said you could be warm too if you hadnt lied to me thats all right mitch said you need your blanket for yourself blanket this is my coat darn you she flounced around in the seat turning her back to him there was a long moment of offended silence and then she faced around to him laughing i guess it does look like a blanket doesnt it here come on and get under it of necessity they had to move close together almost face to face the lights dimmed and went out and there was only the ozark moonlight drifting through the windows and red said it was almost like being in bed wasnt it well yes and no mitch said and red gave him a reproving pinch mitch did you mean it about the job yes its uh kind of dishonest isnt it he shrugged it depends on your viewpoint i guess and and you really think i could do it i think so he hesitated carefully i could be wrong but sizing people up is a big part of my business and you seem to fit the bill in any event youd have to work very hard with me get a lot of training before you were ready naturally she nodded you have to work hard if you want to get any place in this world uh about how much would i make mitch twentyfive per cent of the take after expenses that could be a thousand or more a week but there are a lot of weeks when you dont work she had one more question to ask but she fumbled around it she was afraid she said that he might get the wrong idea about her i think i know what you have in mind mitch said the answer is no not as far as im concerned those relationships can and do develop but hush she said strangely cross im nineteen years old for goodness sake you dont have to spell everything out like i was some little kid sorry what was it you wanted to ask she told him adding that he probably thought it was none of her business mitch said that he didnt think anything of the kind she had every right to know if they were going to be working together and he was more than glad to tell her behind the deliberate words his mind raced he wanted to tell her the truth but what was the truth he hadnt heard from teddy in years probably she had divorced him or perhaps some publicspirited citizen had killed her it hadnt mattered until now now it mattered a great deal if he wanted this redhead and his disclaimer to the contrary he did want her all the way work and play he could give her only one answer he knew it sensed it just as he knew sensed the potential treasure of her body and face and mind no he said im not married i was married and i have a small son in boarding school but my wife is dead well all right then red said now you put your arms around me no this way silly and well be real nice and warm just like we were in bed hush she said ill let you know when i want you to get fresh with me in their penthouse bedroom red raised her arms to permit the removal of the housecoat then head bowed submissively eyes halfclosed she went to the bed and spread herself upon it mitch began flinging off his clothes he had disposed of two shoes one sock and a necktie when the door chimes sounded the youth entering hotel work may follow one of several courses since he is surrounded by many temptations in the form of women drink and opportunities to steal he is very often fired but if he is able to behave himself he normally has little trouble in advancing to a responsible position not advancing remaining a uniformed menial or using his hotel contacts to get good nonhotel employment strangely strangely on the surface that is most youths do the second thing the hotel boy you see is ageless as long as he is reasonably ablebodied he is a boy at sixtyfive just as he was at sixteen when he began his career as a page valet or bellhop throughout the years his earnings remain about the same he is making no more at the end than he was at the beginning contrariwise however he is making as much at the beginning and to exchange his handsome tipearned income for one of the lowpay jobs through which he must climb to the top is very hard for a youth to do still quite a few do make the exchange they are repelled by the specter of themselves as uniformed grandpas or some interested executive takes them in hand ordering them to get with it or get out or they are afflicted with late growth suddenly finding themselves too large for the role of flunky in any event and for one reason or another many of the young men mitch had worked with as a bellboy had risen to highly responsible positions foresightedly and simply out of liking he had helped them along the privation path to the top now with rare exceptions they were ready to help him out of liking and gratitude out of practical considerations who is ever beyond the need of a safe buck out of the hotel mans contempt for the genus chump and any nonprofessional gambler who gambles is considered a chump inevitably he will be taken so why shouldnt a friend do the taking mitch flung open the door on the threshold stood a plump rosycheeked man in striped trousers and morning coat grinning almost to his thinlyhaired scalp he held out his arms mitch you sweet bastard i just discovered that youd checked in mitch let out a groan of feigned dismay turk god save us all its turk he dragged the plump one into the apartment calling word of his arrival to red all is lost honey turkelsons here turkelson chuckled delightedly as red came running in she hugged him enthusiastically kissed him on top of the head and accepted a kiss on the cheek is there no way she asked turning to mitch to escape this character that said mitch is the question on everyones lips well hed better behave himself red said severely hes thirty stories up mitch urged him to sit down before his weight pushed him through the carpet then he asked what turkelsons position was at the place did he wash dishes or clean out the johns turkelson chuckled that he had applied for both jobs been rejected as untrustworthy and forced to accept the post of resident manager actually he added with the faintest trace of gloom the job was not as good as it looked practically everything was a concession food drink laundry and valet newsstand florist shop and so on leaving him only the management of the hotel proper but i do all right he brightened and i see you kids are certainly making out when you can pop fortyfive hundred for a months rent red let out a yipe and appeared to faint mitch shook his head disgustedly oh god mitch turkelson slapped his forehead i should have know you wouldnt tell her why should i have to with you in the same country but thats what i came up for one of the things to do something about it i mean red you dream creature if youll pass me the phone please she passed it to him abruptly he became a different man imposing humorless voice cracking with authority as he spoke to the room clerk now you know better than this davis you should know at least other things being equal the rate in a case of this kind is governed by the availability of space and the desirability of the guests we want people to come back you know or did you have some other idea well all right then all right but consult me hereafter oh yes and make this uh thirtysevenfifty he hung up the receiver and beamed at them mitch pulled red onto his lap signaling her with a sharp little pat red responded promptly this is a nice man mitch maybe we should give him a little present but he already has everything mitch said dandruff fallen arches a sixtyfourinch bust well lets see said red as turkelson chortled helplessly why dont we give him a bucket of breadandbutter sandwiches hes obviously on the point of starvation one bucketful wouldnt put a dent in that yawing void do you suppose we could trust him with money its now or never red said after all hes a pretty big boy horizontally well give him this one chance mitch declared turk you are to spend five bills of that rebate on breadandbutter sandwiches turkelson flatly refused to accept the five hundred after all friends were friends he refused to accept so much friends being friends he absolutely would only accept it because they were friends and friends should help each other and since they were helping him he must now help them theres some big action at zearsdale country club i can get you a guest card can you put me in a game with that crowd i couldnt put jesus christ in it red and mitch groaned in unison they razzed him mercilessly turkelson chuckling and shaking and growing red with delight he had been pretty embarrassed about the money and the razzing helped to dispel it catch this character mitch jerked a thumb at him hed actually get us a guest card to a country club it pays to have influence red said i bet he could even get our names in the telephone book hes all heart mitch said pot heart laughing the manager held up his hands all right all right but i do have something ive just thought of something winfield lord jr is checking in here next week and i know i can put you in with him i can come right out and tell him that youre a gambler and hell be up here pounding on your door he beamed from red to mitch very pleased with himself then slowly his smile faded and he looked almost comically plaintive please he pleaded cant i do anything to suit you two you can stop using dirty words in my presence red said huh but like winfield lord jr mitch explained so all right hes a real stinker the manager conceded so hold your nose and grab for that sweetsmelling lord money my god the lords own half the state of texas and how fast money goes in texas mitch said winfield lords part of it anyway ten years twenty million all he has left now is a rubber checkbook and the worlds nastiest disposition we take his checks turkelson said weve never had a minutes trouble with them either thats different his mother would make good on a legitimate expense i happen to know that frank downing has taken his paper too more than fifty thousand dollars worth and he got every nickel of it mitch said that that also was different no one was allowed to coolout on frank downing winfield lords mother had had the choice of paying off or keeping her son on the lord ranch for the rest of his life downing frank downing red mused now dont i know that name of course you do mitch told her he runs that store outside of dallas kind of a texas monte carlo except that franks place is probably bigger turkelson coughed running a finger between his tight wing collar and the folds of his neck he said hopefully that perhaps the situation had changed with winfield lord jr maybe mama lord was loosening the strings of the bottomless lord purse i hardly think so mitch said news like that gets around but you cant be sure turkelson turned to red its worth a try dont you think so red i think whatever mitch thinks mitch is the boss huh turkelson twinkled of course hes the boss whats so damned funny about that mitch kissed her cuddled her protectively in his arms reds my lamb he smiled firmly dont you tease my lamb turk certainly shes a lamb havent i always said so the manager gestured plaintively but mitch i do wish you could see this lord thing after all youre already here and hes going to be here what can you lose but a little time mitch hesitated thoughtfully examining the project in his mind deciding that turkelson was probably right there was nothing to lose and this was certainly no time to overlook a bet but still still something seemed to hold him back from some deep recess in his mind a voice whispered darkly pointing out that lord was a bastard and that no good was to be had of him but but maybe personal feelings were getting in the way of his reason lord had once tried to paw red he was too drunk to know what he was doing of course even to recognize who she was but a thing like that mitch sighed pulled in two ways almost irresistibly tugged by the need to be practical yet still stubbornly resisting let me brood about it a little he said at last im kind of getting an idea for beating the badcheck angle but i want to kick it around for a day or two if it comes up yes youre down for ten per cent oh now turkelson protested feebly thats not necessary ten per cent which youll earn mitch said meanwhile well take that zearsdale guest card i cant get in the action naturally but at least i can show red off red kissed him and stuck her tongue out at turkelson chuckling the manager stood up promising to bring the guest card right away youd better not red declared you put that card in our room box but ill be glad to would you be glad to get killed mitch demanded red you must tell this man about the birds and the bees turkelson departed chortling mitch and red returned to the bedroom they had a late and light lunch in midafternoon then as red summoned a beautician from the downstairs salon mitch went to see about renting a car he had some trouble deciding between a sedan a lincoln continental and a black jaguar convertiblecoup finally feeling that the sedan might be a little showy he settled on the jag it was not a good choice he was aware of that around eight oclock that night as he turned into the long curving driveway which led up to the club ahead of them in a boxcarlength rolls with both chauffeur and footman rode an elderly man in full evening dress he kept staring back through the rear window then leaned forward to consult with the two livened servants who also looked back briefly debouching finally at the entrance the elderly one gave the jaguar and its occupants the ultimate in quizzical stares turning away with a look of such wry wonderment an illbedamned whathavewehere look that mitch almost winced so the car was all wrong it was wrong by the mere fact of red and mitch being in it there was prompt proof of that if any further proof were needed a cutdown jalopy came roaring up the drive throwing gravel over the jaguar as it skidded to a stop a halfdozen teenage boys and girls swarmed out of it dressed in odds and ends of clothing ran shouting and laughing into the clubhouse the doorman dressed like a coachman even to his whip looked after them fondly then turning back to mitch he critically examined the guest card you were meeting someone sir he poked the card back at mitch perhaps i could notify them for you were not meeting anyone i see hmm the term guest is used rather literally here sir these cards are only honored ordinarily that is at the request of a member ive used a great many guest cards mitch said coldly and ive never heard of such a practice obviously so under the circumstances he signaled with his whip and a uniformed attendant came running to remove the jag well have the car readily available for you sir mitch could feel reds hand tremble on his arm taking her up the three long steps of the club building he smiled down at her reassuringly but he felt none of the calm which he was trying to convey his principal emotion was one of fury a raging anger with himself for bringing her here turkelson should have known what he was sending them into turk probably had known as much as one could know by hearsay but he would justifiably expect mitch to be at least as wellinformed information was half of mitchs job in the pavlovian maze of the heavy hustle he must always spot the proper tunnel correctly associate action and reaction sound with deed word with word oil was a threeletter word if you were content to get your kicks from birdwatching but if you liked the big time you had better spell it zearsdale jake zearsdale the unquestioned head of the fabulous houston hundred zearsdale was the founder of the club its membership was limited allegedly to the families and connections of the hundred presumably one of them owned the hotelapartment where mitch and red were staying what more likely owner for such an establishment so business being business a few guest cards were made available which did not necessarily mean that they would be honored that would be looked into after the guest arrived nor would anyone be a bit interested in whether he was affronted he was an outsider wasnt he he could neither hurt nor help the clan well then but that that attitude wasnt texas of course it was only the wealthiestpeopleintheworld texas mitch had always found houston an exceptionally friendly city he had simply been asking for it in coming to a place like this immediately inside the doorway of the club building stood a squat broadshouldered man in a dark dinner jacket he was frowning as he watched the door rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet his sharp cold eyes stopped them like a wall and for a moment it seemed that he would not unclasp his hands from behind his back and take the card which mitch extended at last he did so however and he returned it with a wisp of a smile upon his thick broad mouth the cold eyes warmed as he looked from mitch to red and he spoke with a voice which was faintly musical the bar allow me to show you please he guided them down the vaulted corridor to a vast room which whispered with music and the hum of acousticallystilled voices then having led the way through the dimness he saw them seated at the bar snapped his fingers at an attendant and departed with a low bow icy martinis were set in front of them the barman hovered obsequiously lighting their cigarettes moving the ashtrays a fraction of an inch closer assured that they needed nothing else he at last left them alone mitch lifted his glass to red murmuring that the atmosphere had warmed considerably red agreed that it had but she still didnt like the place lets leave as soon as we can honey we dont belong here and this gang knows it oh id say wed made the grade with flying colors and footprints on the seat of our pants please mitch i thought wed have dinner maybe a dance or two we can have it somewhere else she studied his face frowning you surely arent going to try for anything here are you mitch hesitated taking a sip of his drink as she prompted him anxiously he started to reply then abruptly broke off a man was on the point of passing them a tall man whose dinner attire was perhaps an unmeasurable fraction too elegant whose face was completely expressionless as he went by his knuckles rapped mitchs spine lips barely moving he spoke two words get out in the rationalizing part of his mind mitch was inclined to blame his mother for his marriage to teddy he was subconsciously seeking a mother he believed when he allowed teddy to trap him in his leniency with teddy he was making amends to his mother for his actions at their last meeting their one and only meeting since the death of his father admittedly his thoughts on the subject were very confused it was impossible to think of teddy without being confused almost as hard as it was to think of teddy as a mothertype what mitch thought about the first time he saw her was certainly not motherhood but rather that joyous biological preliminary to womans noblest estate he was night belihopping at the time teddy so he had learned was the highlypaid night auditor for an oil company finishing her duties she would eat in the hotels coffee shop just as dawn was breaking then have a cab called to take her home it fell to mitch his second night on the job to call the cab she was a very wholesomelooking young woman with corncolored hair and a sprinkling of freckles across her nose severely dressed she still had a lot of stuff to show and mitch found himself looking at it as they waited together at the taxi entrance he also found after a moment that she was studying him out of longlashed green eyes embarrassed he was about to shift his gaze when the eyes squinched shut in a double wink an enticing nosecrinkling wink and she growled at him yes growled grrr she said rrrruff wwhat he said grrr woof she said bowwow well mitch didnt have to be hit in the face with a pie to know when dessert was being passed in a little more time than it took to get her telephone number he was at her apartment figurative fork in hand he warmly declared himself ready to share the bed which she was obviously preparing to retire to teddy demurely demurred im saving my candy for my daddy she explained i figure that if a man buys the box he ought to get all the pieces mitch suggested that they lie down and talk it over teddy primly shook her corncolored head now you wouldnt want to rob my future husband would you you wouldnt want to take something that was rightfully his well look mitch frowned if thats the way you feel why did you uh i thought you might like to examine the merchandise teddy said i mean how could you make a commitment unless you knew what you were getting uh wwhat huh mitch gasped but please handle with care teddy murmured as she shyly shed her negligee none of these items can be replaced crazy sure it was who said different mitch was pretty crazy himself by the time she shoved him out the door politely wishing him a good days sleep a good days sleep for gods sake after all that seeing and not a single sampling he had never felt so frustrated so furious so yes flattered here was obviously a very highclass girl a woman rather who not only had everything it took downstairs but a brain to go with it a woman like that could have any man she wanted she probably had to fight them off with a club yet she had chosen him boy nobody and she was prepared to go to any lengths to get him and how could you knock a thing like that he was back in her apartment the next morning and the next and the next weakening he tried to get at the reason behind her behavior the why of her desire for marriage with him but the answer no answer was always the same because youre my sugar my own sweet daddy but you dont even know me you never saw me until a few days ago oh yes i do she smiled serenely oh yes i did but how could you i mean when i know my daddy she said id know my sugar anywhere at the end of the week he married her there were one hundred and ten delicious pounds of reasons for doing so and no apparent reason not to on their wedding night they both got sozzled on champagne so sozzled that he was a little hazy about his share in consummating the marriage but awakening to the sound of teddys sobs he charged himself with brutality she shook her head hugging him fiercely im jjust so happy darling sso glad youre not ddead hmm what mitch mumbled foggily whos dead i know you couldnt be darling everyone said you were even the general wrote me a letter but i knew i knew i knew snice mitch yawned and was suddenly asleep again he was not sure the next morning that it hadnt been a dream in fact he hardly thought about it at all teddy being a woman to give a man much more interesting and delightful things to think about when eventually he became alarmed and consulted a psychiatrist a permanent resident at the hotel where he was working and was advised that teddy quite probably had cast him in the leading role in her own private sex fantasy something with roots trailing back into puberty he was incredulous and angry it just couldnt be dammit it couldnt yet doubtless it was he never had a better explanation for her and the dream which he had become a part of which teddy had hooked him into being a part of ultimately turned into a nightmare meanwhile there was the meeting with his mother a meeting which in a negative way had at least one plus quality it almost made teddy seem like a dullnormal person it was about five years after his fathers death had separated them before he saw his mother she wrote occasionally and vaguely and he replied but his letters were often returned for want of a forwarding address once he got an urgent wire from dallas asking for a hundred dollars one year she remembered his birthday three times each with a tendollar bill finally after a silence of almost a year she wrote him that she was married and very happy the letter had been a long time in catching up with him it was addressed from the same city in which he was then working he read it feeling a nostalgic tug at his heart having an afternoon off from his job he went out to see her the house was in a scrofulous neighborhood of similar dwellings flanking it on one side was a weedgrown railroad siding on the other was an abandoned commercial building its crumbling fa ade clustered with grinning frowning earnestlooking posters of innumerable political aspirants cardboard vultures on the bones of a dead dream stepping up on the porch and starting to knock mitch glanced through the opened screen door it was a socalled shotgun house its threeandahalf rooms in a row it was just about impossible not to see into the bedroom the second room back and to hear the epigamic surgings of the bedsprings mitch lowered his hand without knocking he went quietly down the walk and sauntered up to the corner and back then he moved toward the porch again whistling noisily he knocked he knocked a second time and the throaty flushing of a toilet answered him in the fragmentated silence that followed a silence punctuated by a mans surly monosyllables and simpering whinny which could not be but was his mothers mitch called out to her mother its me mitch in the interim before she finally came to the door mitch almost called it off and left he did not see how he could face the whinnier the owner of that cowering voice and he was sure that he had better not face her husband he could see the man moving about the bedroom a swarthy sleekhaired character with very broad shoulders and an invisible waist and he detested every inch of what he saw still knowing that he should beat it mitch was somehow held where he was so after almost ten minutes he was at last greeting his mother through the rusted screen through it since she did not unlatch it although her hand hesitated fearfully in the neighborhood of the latch francis she spoke weakly over her shoulder its my son dear big deal uh would it be all right could i have him come in dear he aint my kid oh thank you dear thank you his wife breathed gratefully and mitch was allowed to enter she gave mitch a hasty peck obviously fearfully aware of the man in the other room mitch sat down on one of the three straight chairs a little puzzled by the appearance of the divan until he recognized it as the front seat of an automobile his mother asked him what he was doing now and he said he was night bellcaptain at the citys leading hotel she said that was nice oh that was awfully nice wasnt that nice francis and mitch thought holy god whats happened to her he knew the answer to that one of course and in a way it seemed to have been good for her the peppery waspishness had given way to a cowlike contentment she was washedout looking haggard as a witch but hell she was pushing fifty now and francis the gallant couldnt be over thirtyfive a dancer you know his mother was saying francis is a very talented dancer everyone says so thats nice oh thats awfully nice mitch said yes uh yes he dances oh said mitch you mean he dances yyes a dancer well thats nice thats awfully nice mitch said and then his mothers eyes begging he made himself behave im sure hes very good he said id like to see him sometime francis did not come into the living room until he was fully dressed in a very sharp black suit with broad chalk stripes toothpicktoed shoes a black shirt and a yellow tie he waited until mitch had arisen and extended his hand then he sat down ignoring the hand taking a swig from the can of beer he was carrying he stared at mitch silently eyes unblinking mitch stared back at him smiling so youre a bellboy he finally grunted what do you do when a guy asks you to get him a woman what do you do mitch said i heard that all you birds was pimps did you indeed mitch smiled and whats your personal opinion his mother was fidgeting nervously she whimpered the statementquestion that mitch might like a can of beer so let him have one francis said and he suddenly pitched the can at mitch mitch caught it but awkwardly beer splashed onto the trousers of his onehundredandfiftydollar suit very carefully he set the can down on the bare pine floor he again turned his smile on francis who was shaking with laughter you aint much of a catcher bellboy no im not mitch smiled but you should see me pitch whatd you pay for that suit youre wearin i made it myself mitch said i make all my own clothes dont get smart bellboy you should try it mitch said after all what have you got to lose he could feel his smile widening freezing on his face his mother knew its meaning and twittered an attempted diversion but her husband silenced her with a look how much loot you make a week bellboy ill trade information with you said mitch where do you keep your little red hat huh i aint got no little red hat but what do you use to collect the pennies in collect pen huh that people give you for dancing mitch explained or doesnt the organgrinder trust you with money his mother whinnied fearfully francis cursed swarming up out of his chair but he just wasnt fast enough before he knew what was happening to him mitch had given him a kick in the groin an elbow across the windpipe and a knee in the face then as mitchs mother screamed and clawed at him he methodically stomped in her husbands ribs he was sorry terribly terribly sorry even as he fled the house the fact that francis was the king of the boobs was no reason to halfkill him in attacking francis he realized the real victim had been his mother he would never dare see her again now and he would have to get himself out of town very quickly he went home and gave teddy the news promising to send for her as soon as he found another job teddy declared that she was going right along with him her daddy wasnt going to go any place without his mama well go to forth worth she announced i know of a very good job i can get there the same kind of work im doing now but what about me i dont know that i can get a job there you dont need a job i make more than enough for both of us anyway youll be busy taking care of the baby baby what the hell are you talking about teddy raised her skirt and pulled down her panties baring the creamy environs of her belly button she pulled his head against the area and suddenly he felt something a small but unmistakable kick see she beamed at him as he jerked away eight months and it hardly shows at all some women are like that the doctor says he says ill probably be able to work almost up to the time of its birth bbut but mitch waved his hands desperately so everythings going to be just fine and dandy mama will work and daddy will take care of the baby a baby should be taken care of by its daddy and hell have plenty of time to play with his little diceywicey mitch suddenly exploded he asked her what the hell she took him for he by god would provide the money for the family hed find some kind of a job and she by god would take care of the baby i will not said teddy iron coming into her dulcet voice i already have a baby to take care of my daddys my baby you heard me mitch said and knock off that daddymama alfalfa shake it out of your pretty little skull its beginning to give me the meeyams dont you sass your mama teddy said goddammit mitch yelled i said to knock it off he flung himself down on the bed face clouded ominously teddy marched into the bathroom he heard water running he bit his lip remorse flooding over him my god first his mother then his wife pushing around two women in one day the only two who meant anything to him and teddy was pregnant almost on the point of becoming a mother it was up to him to humor her at such a time not shout and curse at her he was on the point of calling an apology to her when teddy suddenly loomed over him she shoved a washrag into his mouth she scrubbed vigorously for a moment he was too startled to move then gasping and gagging and retching he struggled free of her staggered about the room literally frothing at the mouth he spat cursing sickishly and a flood of soap bubbles sprayed from his lips teddy watched him with an air of selfrighteous sympathy now mama didnt want to do that she said it hurt mama much more than it hurt daddy for gods sake mitch sputtered weakly why the hell what kind of a damned fool you better be careful teddy said you better be a nice daddy or mama will wash your mouth out again there was a soft upward swelling of the music in the bar mitch arose from his stool with a little nod to red sit tight honey ill be right back mitch her eyes were following the tall overlyelegant man who had told them to leave who is he mitch frank downing he left quickly before red could protest at a door some distance away downing turned and glanced over his shoulder then passed on through it the room was a kind of annex to the bar a place to lounge and confer informally the lights here were even dimmer than they had been outside and there was not even the muted rustle of a voice to whisper of another presence mitch blinked peering around trying to penetrate the shrouding shadows then there was a click the flame of a cigarette lighter and frank downings phlegmatic poker face hung limned against the darkness he was sitting over at the far side of the room at a small writing desk guided by the spasmodic glow of downings cigarette mitch made his way across the deep pile carpet and sat down opposite the dallas gambler he said nothing waiting downing said nothing minutes passed mitch lighted a cigarette and went on waiting at last downing broke the silence a reluctant grunt of admiration then he sighed softly tapping out his cigarette that redhead he said is positively the most woman i have ever seen yes mitch said innocently my sister is a very attractive girl downing let out a snort nobody he said but nobody ever had a sister like that so so buy her another drink if you like buy her some dinner dance with her a few times and then get the hell out of here like i told you to or maybe you didnt hear me i heard you i dont think you did downing said no one ever hangs around a place after i tell them to beat it maybe im an exception that redhead is certainly a lot of woman downing said absently a woman like that deserves to be happy he started to get up mitch hastily put out a restraining hand he had to operate in texas except perhaps for tulsa and oklahoma city texas was the only remaining pasture for the big time gamblers grazing here alone was there always another metropolis to move on to lush with the longgreen and stubbornly resistant to the blight of credit cards and chargeaplates here they liked the feel of money here they were shocked by the piker notion of never carrying more than fifty dollars here were people whod gambled their very existence for what theyd got and who stood ready to gamble again here and almost here alone did restlessness impatience and selfconfidence the conviction that there was always more to be had where the first had come from combine to make dice an accepted social pastime much as bridge and rummy were accepted in areas where the money was older and its owners more effete so there it was he had to operate in texas he could not operate there in fact he was very apt not to operate period if he antagonized downing all right he said at last all right frank but i dont like it i knew youd see it my way downing murmured im no punk weve always got along together now you holler frog and ive got to jump why whats the answer why do you want me out of here give the girl another drink downing said give her some dinner dance her around a few times come off of it mitch frowned determinedly ive got a right to know he hesitated studying the gambler if youre afraid i might try to crumbin on your action dont be stupid i wouldnt pop for a penny outside my own store then why redand i are good people why treat us like dirt downing didnt seem to hear him slowly he lighted another cigarette absently contemplating the exhaled stream of smoke as mitch silently waited he ground the cigarette out again hesitated and spoke there was a peculiar note in his normally toneless voice ever in the dallas river bottoms in the old days mitch no mitch shook his head puzzled downing said that hed been born there and it was quite a place crap creek the bottoms squatters had called it shit creek because that was just about what the river was so thick you could walk on it in some places yet people bathed in it what else they drank from it they drowned their bastard infants in it and there were many of them to drown for whoring was one of the largest industries and unwanted babies a principal crop bastards and rats and disease but frank downing had been lucky a happy victim of a process which snatched him from the bottoms to the relative heaven of the states toughest reform school he had eaten regularly there he had had a bed to sleep in and clothes to wear he had gotten texas standard eleven years of schooling he had received invaluable training in the arts of bribery graft strongarm and gambling and when he left the head guard himself had given him the warmest of recommendations to the chief of the dallas vicesquad thats what i came from mitch from there to here from there to zearsdale country club yes mitch nodded still puzzled thats quite a story frank and i appreciate your telling it to me but im up for membership in the club membership but uh why thats fine frank i its a joke downing said flatly you know like taking a whore to church teehee hoho haha just look who weve got in our club its a joke but whos the joke on i want in i cant let you or anyone else get in the way mitch wanted to know how he could do that the gambler spelled it out for him were both pros you kratz yourself up and it could rub off on me like say we were working a frammis together mitch argued with him declaring that downing was really reaching for it downing said that hed been really reaching for a long time all the way from the dallas river bottoms it was true that mitch wasnt known as a pro but he could get known it was also true that mitch wasnt the kind to kratz up but that could change too the point is mitch theres always a chance when you take chances and on you i dont have to take any so i wish you hadnt rushed off so fast i was going to tell you goodbye but i see youve already gone he nodded grinned satirically and started to rise again mitch detained him im holding light frank red doesnt know it but i need to hit yeah downing obviously didnt believe him if you hadnt already left you could see my collar was on frontwards i mean it frank ive just about got to hit oops downing pointed there he goes what the chaplain he just ran out the front door downing said probably couldnt stand to see a man crying for that matter neither can i mitch knew he had blundered he reversed himself immediately all right he laughed im here and i want to get my feet wet now suppose i never touch the dice myself just fade and try to make out with the odds that couldnt possibly do any harm could it downing hesitated aside from liking mitch he believed in doing favors where no cost to himself was involved youre asking me to put you in the game he said no im not of course i figured that youd probably want to watch me downing said that it worked out to the same thing mitch denied it well all go in together sure you and red and i you can make talk with her while im at the table but that doesnt add up to putting me in the game you know everyone and were just a couple of more people that you know well the gambler halfnodded you dont push yourself now you cant do it here i wouldnt do it anywhere and you only fade no shooting mitch agreed they arose mitch grinning to himself tonight he would simply break the ice get himself known to the highrollers then another night after making sure that downing was no longer in town he would come back for another visit they reached the door of the room downing suddenly turned on him with a curse why you sneaky it went right past me and i didnt see it yes mitch said innocently something wrong frank you didnt have any intention of playing you didnt even know where the action was we made a deal frank i know but watch yourself mitch make that the last fast one of the evening red saw the byplay from the bar she coupled it and colored it with their earlier encounter with the gambler and the result was not flattering to downing she bared her teeth rather than smiled as mitch intro duced them he started to help her down from the bar stool and her elbow pulled firmly from his grasp his brows raised slightly ironic humor twinkled at the back of his eyes he had been around for a very long time and was a very long way from his place of origin the situation appealed to him and he knew how to make the most of it the action was on the third floor downing guided them to a private elevator and its operator gave them one unobtrusively searching glance photographing them in his mind debouching from the car they were met by another man a suave but huskier version of the elevator operator and again there was that swift photographing glance he opened a door on the opposite side of the hall stood back with a little bow and pulled it shut after them the room was approximately octagonal in shape sunken a few feet from the entrance by three broad steps there were no windows a barbuffet with a negro attendant halfcircled a corner of the room flanked by four long low lounges set back at a comfortable distance was an oblong dice table a halfdozen people stood around it one of them a stout middleaged woman with a nod to his companions mitch wandered over to it downing and red sat down on a lounge laughing inwardly the gambler gave her a confidential wink how about a good stiff drink honey you look like a gal that could slug it down red shook her head no thank you it dont cost nothin downing said craftily get yourself pieeyed and it wont cost you a penny no she tried to ignore the gambler keeping her eyes on mitch watching the easy way he made himself one with the group around the table but downing would not be ignored he kept up the dumb act even nudging her with his elbow until be again had her exasperated attention and you know somethin he was saying i think youre a heck of a pretty gal gee dad she gave him an icy grin youre a daisy its sure been a hot day aint it downing went on sweated so bad i had to wash my feet why you poor thing you red said didnt it make you awfully sick well yeah it did kind of you know what i always say i always say it aint the heat but the humidity do you red said do you always say it aint the heat but the humidity yep yessir thats what i always say well youd better write it down somewhere red said you might forget it and then where would you be downing pulled a look of heavy suspicion he asked her if she was trying to razz him or somethin ill bet you are he said ill bet youre tryin to razz me or somethin an intelligent gentleman like you perish the thought you cant fool me downing said darkly i reckon you dont like me very much do you red turned on him giving him the full effect of her scornful eyes no i dont like you mr frank downing she said to be honestly frank i dont like you a darned bit well theres nothing like being honestly frank downing murmured unless its redundant red started she blushed tried to look indignant and suddenly giggled why you you something wrong lady downing said innocently there certainly is red declared just where have you been hiding me i been here all the time maam sittin right next to the humidity then thats quite long enough red said firmly you get right up from there and bring me a drink downing laughed and got up he brought drinks for both of them along with a plate of hors doeuvres a brisk conversation sprang up between them and a feeling of liking as well one of those peculiarly strong likings which so often evolve from meetings that have started off badly meanwhile the man nearest mitch had picked up the dice he was apparently the big winner of the evening the pockets of his dinner jacket bulging with currency an oldishyoung man with prematurely gray hair he dug out a fistful of bills and dropped them on the table lets see four five six he sorted it with one finger seven sevenfive shoot it all money showered down on the green felt rattling the dice he announced that he was shooting seventyfive hundred with a thousand still open only a thousand people dont make me fall back before i fire his eyes swept the group hesitated at mitch then tendered an invitation a thousand open all or any part its only money mitch smiled and he took out his wallet the dice rolled came out with a hard eight the man followed with a four a six another four another hard four and bounced back with his hard eight another hard eight he let it ride fifteen thousand dollars there was two thousand open that time and mitch took it the dice rolled and stopped with two deuces up another hard four three of them in less than as many minutes to mitch it was like a red flag it could be on the level of course it couldnt be anything else in a place like this but still he watched the progression of numbers the dice combinations as they rolled out six fourtwo six again and again fourtwo and here came another hard eight then two deuces a hard four that made four of them now four hard fours and it made the man winner mitch stood stunned certain of the truth but unable to associate it with the circumstance the man wasnt a hustler these people knew him he was obviously a friend of long standing at any rate no hustler would be so crude he wouldnt have to it was too dangerous the dice handler depended on skill not some device which he might be caught with laughing the prematurely gray man gestured indicating that he would shoot the whole thirty grand then he saw mitchs expression and his smile drew in and he acted swiftly he swept the money up with his dice hand jamming it into his alreadybulging coat pocket with the same movement his hand came out of the pocket and spun two dice out on the table pass the dice he smiled pleasantly at mitch i hope youll have my luck sir it isnt luck mitch said youre using crooked dice what a perplexed smilefrown thats not a very good joke my friend mitch nodded agreeing that it wasnt he asked to see the dice the man had been using the ones in your pocket i mean you switched them when you were handling your money out of the corner of his eye he saw downing rise march red firmly toward the door while she looked anxiously back over her shoulder that was the right thing to do of course but it added nothing to his assurance there was a hint in it that he mitch corley had pulled a giant economysized goof i mean it he said doggedly you won that money with crooked dice did i does anyone else feel the same way no one did and they made it clear they seemed to move a little closer to the grayhaired man staring coldly at mitch a kindred group facing a common enemy youre free to search me if you do the man looked around at them beaming im always willing to oblige a friend dont be silly johnny an embarrassed murmur what the hell johnny were all pals here the gray head turned to mitch focused amused eyes on him it looks like you made a mistake my friend possibly youve had a little too much to drink theres no mistake now ill take a look at those dice help yourself the dice are on the table i mean the ones in your pocket ill take a look at them or ill take three thousand dollars no the man smiled firmly that isnt what youll do at all mitch took a step toward the man the man fell back into a fighting crouch at the same instant a steely grip closed over mitchs arm and whirled him around it was the stocky broadshouldered man who had met him and red at the entrance to the clubhouse the ma tre d perhaps or a captain of waiters yes he said in his faintly musical voice what seems to be the trouble mitch told him curtly the stocky man shook his head thats impossible just who are you to make such a charge you know who i am mitch snapped you saw my guest card tonight may i see it again please mitch handed it to him the man scanned it ripped it in two and dropped the pieces on the floor youre not welcome here mr corley i advise you to leave immediately now wait a minute mitch raged what kind of a place is this anyway i get cheated out of three thousand dollars and you just who the hell are you to push me around no one has pushed you around mr corley any disturbance has been caused by you well see what the manager has to say now i want your name of course the man nodded the name is jake zearsdale red had fallen asleep at last mitch moved quietly from her side tucked the covers back around her and went into the front room he fixed himself a drink taking it over to a window he stood looking out over the city troubledly staring unseeing at the sleeping metropolis he sorted through the nights happenings there had been nothing to do but leave the club quietly of course cheated of three thousand dollars a serious loss at this particular time he could only leave hoping that this would be the end of the matter which according to frank downing it might not be the grayhaired man downing told him was a longtime friend and business associate of zearsdale and zearsdale was a man who cherished a friend and cracked down hard on an enemy red and downing were waiting at the club entrance when he came out that night the gambler was cynically amused by what had happened maybe we could go into partnership mitch there ought to be big money in renting you out as a chump now you just stop that frank red scolded mitch did exactly the right thing did he then how come hes got that egg all over his face so much that it even rubbed off on me im sorry mitch said i hope i havent spoiled anything for you frank downing said that only time would tell about that if the club had members who used sixfoureight dice he wasnt sure that he wanted membership anyway mitch declared that the man had been using them all right downing shrugged nodded if you say so he probably saw that big chump sign youre wearing red punched the gambler on the arm mitch said all right frank just what should i have done what would you have done id have watched the dice awhile before i did any fading if id been sap enough to buck a game like that in the first place you mean i should have been looking for a cheat among those people well maybe not downing admitted but you should have kept your mouth shut after you got clipped what did you expect this johnny birdwell to do confess that he was a mechanic did you think his friends were going to toss him over and side with you mitch couldnt argue the point obviously in view of the way things had turned out he had been wrong to holler along with the loss of his three grand he had also lost the potentially lucrative opportunity to return to the club and had possibly gotten himself a powerful enemy so okay im a chump he sighed what do i do about it shoot yourself what else downing laughed and held out his hand take it easy you two and come and see me whenever youre in dallas he meant it the gambler did not pretend friendliness when be felt unfriendly so that at least mitch thought was a break to have had downing sore at him on top of everything else the shortage of money the lack of immediate prospects well there was one prospect winfield lord jr and there was a way seemingly to collect on lords nominally worthless checks mitch returned to bed slightly cheered but very slightly a vague feeling of unease gnawed at him a premonition that tonights misadventure portended still further trouble zearsdale well just what could zearsdale do anyway the oilman would find mitch corleys nose very very clean much cleaner doubtless than that of the workaday citizen the mitch corleys of the world could not afford the petty nastiness the shady little deeds which were generally shrugged off as the everybodydoesitnorm they the worlds corleys shuddered at the notion of stealing towels from a hotel or betraying a confidence or making time with a friends wife there was always a risk in such shenanigans and the professional gambler had enough risks as it was zearsdale then if he was inclined to make trouble would have a hard time finding a vulnerable spot of course mitch was vulnerable by the fact of being what he was of living as he and red lived so she rolled over in the bed and put her arms around him dont worry any more darling she whispered everything will be all right of course it will he patted the satiny plumpness of her bottom im sorry if i waked you up honey thats okay want me to give you something to make you sleep he did and she did and it did but the sleep seemed almost as brief as the treatment which brought it about one minute he was dozing off the next or so it seemed red was shaking him telling him that he would have to hurry because breakfast was already on the way up he arose promptly and headed for the bathroom grumpily wondering why he had been called so early but recognizing that red would have had her reasons husbandlike he had learned long ago that if red thought he should know something or remember something it was best to pretend that he did otherwise he would find himself guilty of possibly the worst crime on the wifely calendar ignorance of something of great importance to her which should therefore be of equal importance to him he had shaved and was in the shower when red poked her head in the door was he about ready breakfast had just arrived he called that hed be there in a shake hoping she would jog his memory with a clue when she didnt hearing her reclose the bathroom door he called to her again uh about how much time have we got honey well were we going to try to get there by noon get there get where whatever you think he turned off the shower and began toweling himself uh where shall we eat lunch well oh i know well take it with us ill have the dining room pack us a big hamper fine oh fine mitch said desperately searching his memory maybe i should call ahead too huh so well be expected uh yes you do that mitch said the door closed he got out of the shower and reached for his robe and suddenly he remembered why of course they were driving up to his sons school today this was the day they were seeing sam his son and he had forgotten hurrying out of the bathroom to breakfast mitch felt a wrench of conscience how bad off could a guy be anyway to forget a visit to his own son they had breakfast and dressed mitch in tweeds and a dark sport shirt red in a fawncolored travel suit with a head scarf of offivory silk as they took the elevator downstairs mitch asked her to remind him that the quarterly payment on his income tax was about due red said she would do it and that he was not to talk about anything unpleasant for the rest of the day turkelson himself was at their car supervising the tuckingin of a thermostype hamper mitch addressed him as boy and handed him a dime tip the manager accepted it with as much bowing as his portliness would permit then exploded into laughter as they drove away it took them perhaps an hour to get out of houston and the citys heavy traffic then having reached the highway he settled the jag down to a moreorless steady seventy miles an hour it was a warm day but a little cool in the swiftly moving car red moved close to mitch her small shoulder pressing against his glancing up into the cars mirror he surprised her in a look of such love and devotion that a quick lump came into his throat mitch she said softly youre the dearest darlingest nicest man that ever lived what took you so long to catch on mitch grinned ive known it right from the beginning sometimes i forget i guess and then something happens like this morning youd forgotten about coming to see sam hadnt you mitch nodded guiltily i should have had my ass kicked you were a darling red insisted you pretended to remember because i expected you to to keep me from being hurt or disappointed in you mitch said that that was the way he was perfect the thought not highly original flicked through his mind that the more different women were the more they were the same how many times for example had teddy and his mother and red done just about the exact opposite of what he had expected them to do teddy would smile at him when he expected a slap his mother would slap him when logic prophesied a smile red well red had just rewarded forgetfulness with tenderness as proof of her love for him all this was not to say of course that a woman would always do the thing contrary to a mans expectations no a woman was not going to be as easily understood as that the subtle kinship which united her with her sex had a sweetly mythic as well as a contradictory quality about her was the kind of wideeyed innocent infuriating deliciously irrelevant relevance that associated easter bunnies with painted hens eggs he was brought out of these abstract reveries when a few miles short of his sons school they stopped at a service station the emblem z on the stations gas pumps was responsible he had seen these signs before naturally but they had had no meaning for him now after last night they had a great deal for a man needs something very very special in the oil business to become an important refiner and distributor attempting to become one he invariably is confronted by the giantwithmanynames who proceeds nine hundred and ninetynine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine times out of a million to stomp the holy god out of him the giant has posted keep out signs around the field of refining and distributing littering that field are the bleached and broken bones of intruders who had everything to go the distance yet not quite enough there was gidsen for example a man with great wit and charm and the backing of some of the easts wealthiest families no more there was harlund who had as much going for him as gidsen plus plenty of political power no more and so on endlessly to fight the manynamed giant you had to fight his way and that was not something you could learn it had to be secondnature with you an instinct for the jugular a conviction that the destruction of an enemy was as necessary as defecation a social outlook that was as intestinal as it was amoral seeing ones neighbors as something to be gobbled up and a knife in the back as the best way to a mans heart not all the giants successful rivals were like that of course there are always exceptions but mitch doubted that zearsdale was one of them what the hell he asked himself im not that important i didnt really do anything to get him down on me his son sam was waiting for them at the gate of the school mitchs heart quickened as the boy came toward them blackhaired grayeyed wirily trim in his cadets uniform the longago image of one mitchell corley dice handler de luxe sam shook hands with him kissed red and complimented her on her suit then he cast a lingering and longing eye at the cars controls and cocked a brow at his father okay mitch laughed if its all right with your aunt red of course its all right red smiled ill sit on your lap mitch mitch slid over on the seat and sam got behind the wheel how old was he now thirteen fourteen he experimented with the stick shift for a moment then drove them smoothly through the gate to a nearby picnic area mitch complimented him on his driving as they unloaded the picnic hamper it wouldnt be long now he said before sam was driving his own car the boy shrugged casually i wouldnt have much use for one in a place like this dad well of course you wont be here by the time youre old enough to vote of course to mitch the words seemed an echo of his own voice something that he had once said pretty much as sam had said them now he glanced at red and found her looking at him meaningfully i think youll be through with boarding schools before long sam he heard himself saying red your aunt red and i hope well be able to run our business without traveling in another year or two and then well all settle down together well sam said i dont care particularly about settling down id just as soon travel as not mitch passed a paper plate of roast beef murmuring that he needed to get an education before he started traveling sam said that mitch seemed to have managed to combine the two no i didnt really get an education mitch said seriously my folks couldnt afford to put me in boarding school or you can bet they would have what about aunt red what oh well aunt red was just a tot while we were on the road by the time she was of school age the family was settled down in one place the boy looked gravely from his father to red he nodded as though to himself and began buttering a roll good chow he said did you cook it red aunt red i mean why no i didnt they dont allow cooking in the apartment where we are ill bet you could cook though couldnt you ill bet you can do anything better than a wife could do wwhat red stammered i uh why do you say that because dad has never got married again i mean you take care of him so good that he doesnt want a wife a deep blush had spread over reds face she bit her lip band trembling as she reached for a piece of fruit in the heavy silence sam looked innocently at his father ive got the afternoon off dad want me to show you around or anything why dont you show your aunt red around and let me join you later mitch said right now i imagine id better make my courtesy visit to the colonel hes been in the infirmary all week sam told him but i guess you should drop in on the adjutant hes sitting in for the colonel good ill take care of it right now mitch said he left the car with them and headed on foot for the ivycovered administration building crossing the sunbaked parade ground he skirted a small group of drilling cadets in the custody of a redfaced man in sergeants uniform they were a punishment squad apparently or perhaps an awkward squad sweat streaked their straining faces dripping down to darken the gray of their uniforms to mitch they seemed like automatons moving like a single machine yet they did not satisfy the sergeant with a harsh and unintelligible yell he brought them to a halt molded them into a dozenodd sweating statues then pacing up and down in front of them occasionally thrusting his nose within an inch of some supposed miscreant he spewed out such a threatening and insulting tirade that even mitch was a little shocked but this was a good school one of the very best he thought as he went up the steps of the administration building the sons of the southwests elite were enrolled here and he had only been able to enter sam with the help of some of his highlyplaced hotel friends it was good so how could you knock it how could you object after a nonage in bellboys locker rooms to the discipline in one of the very best schools certainly sam never kicked about it sam never kicked about anything for that matter major dillingham the colonels adjutant might have been created by a drunken cruikshank or hogarth using the paradeground sergeant as model face bloated and beetcolored he wobbled up from behind his desk as though floated by the balloon of his belly he proffered a puffy hand which seemed to compress interminably within mitchs grasp then he teetered to the door and closed it his pipestem legs seeming on the point of snapping at any moment so thin that their puttees appeared to be wrapped about less than nothing a kind of embryonic invisibility he sat down again he treated mitch to what had all the aspects of a sternly penetrating stare except for the absence of eyes which were presumably lurking within the puffy foxholes of their lids mr corley he wheezed heavily mr corley mr mitchell corley mitch waited looking at him silently he could smell something here something besides the faint aroma of talcum and the osmotic emanations of faulty kidneys something has come up mr corley something that uh must be explained but which i see no satisfactory explanation for i was going to take it up with the colonel and of course i will have to there is no alternative im afraid but hearing that you were visiting samuel today a very fine young man mr corley one of our best young men i know that mitch said what i dont know major is what youre leading up to and when or if youre going to get to it the statement seemed to stun the adjutant it was meant to mitch had always believed that attack was the best defense he leaned back negligently as the major puffily collected himself it uh came on todays mail mr corley addressed to the colonel naturally but since i am temporarily in charge i i find it difficult to understand impossible to understand go on mitch said coldly but he knew what the trouble was now im a busy man arent you the major underwent another moment of shock then a faint gleam of malice in his enbunkered eyes he took an envelope from a locked drawer and pitched it across the desk mitch opened it there was a picture inside a blownup copy of one a rogues gallery frontandprofile photograph of a woman it listed her police record on the reverse side sixteen arrests sixteen convictions all for the same crime there were no aliases the woman had always used her legal name mrs mitchell corley fort worth cowtown where the west begins take it easy here and people will do you the same kind of favor dress as you like you wont be judged by your dress that kind of crummy looking fella in levis and boots is worth forty million dollars do as you like do anything youre big enough to do but be danged sure that you are big enough neighboring dallas started an evil rumor about its rival forth worth was so rustic the libel ran that panthers prowled the streets at high noon fort worth promptly dubbed itself the panther city and declared the lie was gospel truth certainly there were panthers in the streets kiddies had to have somethin to play with didnt they aside from that the cats performed a highly necessary service every morning they were herded down to the eastflowing trinity river there to drain their bladders into the stream which provided dallas water supply that was probably why them people over in dallas had so many nutty ideas theyd take a few swigs of that panther piss and pretty soon they were thinking that they were just as good as other people mitch and his wife teddy arrived in forth worth approximately a month before their son was born and mitch as teddy declared he must became the housekeeper for the family he felt that he just about had to for the time being and under the circumstances teddys earning power was far greater than his and much would be needed for a family of three also he could not dispute with his wife at what he considered a very trying period for her nor could he ask her to cut down on expenses merely to indulge his vanity as a bachelor living in a furnished room he had entered marriage with only the vaguest idea of the cost of maintaining a wife and household a wife like teddy that is and a household governed by her whims in fact he never knew since teddy did the buying and billpaying accepting whatever portion of his earnings he gave her as being plenty but it did gradually dawn on him that teddy was pooping off enormous amounts of money teddy had to have the very best of everything furniture food and drink apparel living quarters but that was only the beginning she would buy a hundreddollar dress and discard it after one wearing she would buy new furnishings decide that they were all wrong and dispose of them for whatever was offered she would do senselessly extravagant things for mitch the purchase for example of a dozen pairs of wateredsilk pajamas then pout when he was not properly appreciative mitch had the weird notion at times that teddy hated money that she felt guilty about having it and was impelled to get rid of it as quickly as possible well things were going to change he told himself determinedly after the baby was born and she had recovered from her pregnancyinspired goofiness little teddy was going to get squared away fast thats what the man thought that wasnt what happened for one thing he was immediately enchanted by little sam named after his father for another teddy was not enchanted by the baby it annoyed her she regarded it as an intruder on a situation which had been just about perfect as it was youre my baby she told mitch youre all i need but youre his mother mitch insisted a mother should want to take care of her baby i do i love taking care of you but goddammit i mean look honey why did you have a baby if you felt like this because you wanted one you wanted a baby so i gave you a baby but but teddy so now its your job to take care of him teddy continued sweetly you take care of your baby and ill take care of my baby the conversation took place about ten days after sams birth and teddy had already returned to work he had awakened in the middle of the night to find her gone from his side and a note pinned to her pillow he had been so angry that he almost called her employers and he refrained from doing so only out of fear of embarrassing her they didnt know she was married her pregnancy almost undetectable even to mitch had gone unnoticed and she had gotten her needed time off on the pretext of traveling to the deathbed of a close relative it was the companys policy not to employ married women teddy had strictly enjoined him against ever calling or coming to the place well anyway mitch decided to let things rock along as they were for a while he loved being with the baby someone had to earn the living and he had no job to go to so he became the housekeeper for their apartment and the fulltime nurse for his son he read a lot he worked with the dice on nice days he loaded sam into his perambulator and took him out for an airing as time went on these walks often wound up in hotel lockerrooms and the back rooms of pool halls and cigar stores or wherever else a crap game could be found mitch was getting better and better with the dice he was not nearly as good then as he eventually got to be but he was good he banked part of his winnings contributing the rest to household expenses that gave him some feeling of independence at least he was paying for his own keep but he was far from satisfied sure he loved being with the baby but he couldnt make a career of it sure he was doing fairly good with the dice but how was he doing it by hanging out in the kind of places that had always been faintly repugnant to him cheap shoddy places the habitat as a rule of cheap shoddy people walk into one of those joints ten years from now and youd find pretty much the same people there they were pikers bums the small fry of the nowhere world stick around them long enough and you became a permanent member of the family if you ever wanted to be in the big time you had to be where the bigtimers were still what to do about teddy he loved teddy he wanted her to be happy he wasnt afraid of her not exactly that is but he shrank from the prospect of annoying her as it turned out he didnt have to do anything about teddy because she had also become dissatisfied with the way they were living she announced abruptly one morning that they were renting a house and in that house there was going to be a housekeeper or a nursehousekeeper or whatever the heck was necessary to allow mitch to take a job i mean it mitch she said crossly i dont care what kind of job it is but by golly you get one and get it fast but but thats what ive been wanting to do all along mitch exploded youre the one that insisted that i stay at home and i did not anyway what good is it having you stay at home if i never get to be with you when im working youre asleep and when im ready for bed youre cleaning house or out walking with the baby or some other crazy thing i know but youd better stop arguing with me mitch corley get yourself a night job like ive got then maybe well get to see each other from one week end to the next mitch did as he was told the job he took hotel doorman was not something he would have bothered with ordinarily it didnt pay enough money but money wasnt the most important factor at the moment and there were compensations for the lack of cash he wore the hotels livery but he was actually employed by the garagetaxi company which serviced the hotel thus since the latter company could hardly hire a supervisor for one man he was pretty much his own boss then he was no longer addressed as boy lifted out of the category of faceless flunkies he became a person a man with a name who was to be consulted with at least a measure of respect on the vital matters of transportation and the maintenance of ultraexpensive cars there was little if anything to do between two and six in the morning and he could sit in his starters cubicle and read or chat with the inevitable guests who were afflicted with insomnia one of his most frequent visitors was an ageless little man with eyes which bugged enormously behind his thicklensed glasses and a great mop of wiry irongray hair early in mitchs employment he had introduced himself with a question if you are a doorman he said in subtly accented english why are you called a starter ill look it up mitch grinned ask me tomorrow night so the man nodded gravely approving then leaned far over into the starters cubicle why do you read a book on modern art someone has asked you a question about it mitch said no he was simply doing it on his own account hed heard some ostensibly important people talking about modern art and he figured it was something he should know about then you are not doing it on your own account it is only a sop to others weel maybe but not entirely i mean how am i going to know whether something interests me unless im informed on it the man studied him intently bobbed the bushy mass of his hair we he said firmly shall talk again that was mitchs first meeting with fritz steinhopf md phd eras heidelberg the sorbonne university college it was fairly typical of the psychiatrists introduction to other members of the hotels staff indiscriminately and without apologetic preliminary he had quizzed the resident manager the haughty headhousekeeper very much an executive in the hotel world the superintendent of service the head chef and various bellboys and cleanup men his attitude was one which in ordinary cases would have elicited the chilly suggestion that he would be happier at some other hotel but fritz steinhopf was very far from being an ordinary case in addition to his living quarters he maintained an elaborate professional suite on the mezzanine floor his patients were among the southwests most prominent and wealthy including two of the hotel companys major stockholders mitch wondered why a man of steinhopfs importance didnt concentrate on his practice instead of prying into the affairs of people like himself when the answer finally dawned on him it did much in the shaping of his own character one could not he came to realize approach every person and situation with a view to immediate gain to be effective subjectively a broad objectivity was necessary interest and curiosity were not traits to be turned off and on at will nothing was ever lost knowledge gained at one time could be used at another with much idle time on his hands mitch was more and more the target of the apparently nonsleeping steinhopfs insatiable curiosity and the more that curiosity was exercised the greater it became the psychiatrist was completely uninhibited he could not be brushed off a little irritated with him one night mitch declared that he had to go to lunch steinhopf said that he would go also and he trotted along at mitchs side to the allnight lunch room they ate together almost nightly after that the psychiatrist stuffing himself with whatever was put in front of him blandly asking the most intimate questions occasionally making some comment which by turns enlightened frightened and infuriated mitch it is a substitute this gambling he said a compensatory drive you are haunted by your fathers impotence he had no such compensating satisfaction so you provide yourself with one oh come off it doc mitch laughed if i was any better in bed id need a harem so perhaps but the fear is still present a man confident of his prowess that he is a man is not dominated by his wife as you are by yours my dear mitch its not like that at all i try to be reasonable of course she brings most of the money into the family and she should have something to say about how its run but but she has always earned the major share of the income has she not there has been relatively no change and money is obviously of no importance to her something to be thrown away how then does it justify her drive to make you less than a man dammit i told you it wasnt like that im in love with my wife i want to do everything i can to please her and make her happy that is as it should be steinhopf purred assuming of course that she does everything she can to please you and make you happy but i understand believe me i do the doctor said softly i am asking you to accept the unacceptable you know your wife as no one else can know her between you there is something which is singularly your own a history of troubles shared of secret words and intimacies the warm and delightful and always unique treasure which is peculiar to every marriage no matter how bad that marriage may be the husband is always the last to know they say of course he is how else could it be since he is closer to his wife than anyone else but consider mitch it is this very closeness which blinds him to the truth it is almost impossible for him to be objective a negro patient once assured me with great bitterness that i did not know what it was like to be a negro i could only point out that he also didnt know what it was like to be a white man mitch frowned it seemed to him that the doctor had almost said something decidedly ugly steinhopf smoothly continued aside from your intensely subjective viewpoint there is the matter of your childhood the marriage of your parents you grew up in circumstances which were anything but normal so your present home life does not seem as shocking as it essentially is nor is your wife too blatant a contrast with your mother your mother seems to have been lacking in most of the instincts normal to a mother while simultaneously possessing an oversupply of certain other womanly instincts so teddy by comparison mitch got up and stomped out of the place the doctor caught up with him trotted along at his side they would talk again he said imperturbably they would talk again many times for there was much indeed to be discussed at the moment mitch had other ideas on the subject hed just about had it with steinhopf but they did talk again many times and at length and at mitchs own wish because he was getting very worried about teddy himself he still loved her or believed that he did but their relationship was becoming increasingly unsatisfactory the more he saw of her the more dismayed he became and he was seeing a great deal of her literally constantly she took him to bed the minute he came home the normally delightful demands she made upon him had through excess become a source of despair and disgust she couldnt carry on a conversation not a real honesttohannah conversation why hadnt he noticed that before what he had taken for wit was really the product of ignorance and the parroted statements of others actually she was almost completely humorless joking with her laughing in her presence could induce her to insane fury hed better not laugh at her very bad things happened to daddies who laughed at their mamas she paid no attention to little sam and she was angrily jealous when he did she wanted one thing of mitch over and over and over and when he could not deliver it she was peevish pouting yet with a kind of smugness an air of selfsatisfaction so mitchs talks with dr steinhopf resumed in detail he poured out the story of himself and teddy from the very beginning i guess i was supposed to be another guy he explained with attempted humor someone she was engaged to before i came along i remember she was crying in her sleep the night we were married mumbling about getting a letter from the general and everyone telling her this other fellow was dead steinhopf said that he doubted very much that there had been any other fellow in the context of mitchs meaning or any general the other fellow was a sexual fantasy the general represented authority trying to destroy the fantasy you mean mitch frowned shes insane my dear mitch please do not use that word in my presence let us say she is not normal in the accepted sense of that misused term the poor kid mitch said bewilderedly i just cant understand it steinhopf shrugged she is a classic case i would say of a not uncommon disorder among american women you could find less exaggerated and complex examples all around you where are its roots in a dominant mother of course and a defeated but beloved father mingle with these the factor of penisenvy a younger neighbors boy perhaps and the childhood pastime of playing house add in large sums of money the nominal proof sad to say of superiority and the urges normal to woman this broadly speaking would give you your teddy i believe to be conclusive or helpful i would have to see her over an extended period of time an obvious impossibility well mitch hesitated if it was just a matter of money always the psychiatrist said gravely a fee of some kind is necessary what is given for nothing i find is usually valued at that but it would be no problem i assure you five dollars say for what i would ordinarily charge a hundred the problem is that your wife would not see me she would become very angry at the suggestion that there was a problem or do you say otherwise steinhopf waited a moment then continued sexual degeneracy is a way of life with her the right way she has no desire to change it the tendency another delicate pause has always been to expand it mitch felt himself reddening as the doctors words slowly sank in on him steinhopf spread his hands apologetically is not the evidence all around you mitch a woman of patently limited mentality who allegedly earns an extravagant salary the peculiar working conditions the voracious demands upon you the constant thank you doctor mitch said coldly thank you very much please mitch for your own sake mitch turned his back on him he kept it turned but he could not forget what the doctor had said he could not allay the suspicions which as steinhopf had guessed were already in his mind he was very wrong to have them he knew it was hateful and ungrateful to think such terrible things about the mother of his son finally he persuaded himself that he owed it to teddy to find out the truth mitch took his days off from work in the ordinary way during the week in which they occurred teddy allowed hers to accumulate taking them during the five days of the month which menstruation made difficult for her thus he had the opportunity to follow her and since she was not looking to be followed it was shamefully easy he knew the place she went to not from personal experience but from informed hearsay still however he would not believe what was obviously a fact there had to be some innocent explanation teddy would have gone there on some entirely honest errand and she would not go back again he waited outside waited for hours she did not come out so he followed her again the next night still stubbornly resisting the truth and that time he went in it was a wellrun place a partitioned tunnel extended a few feet inside the door and an apelike figure with a sawedoff ball bat under his arm stood at its end no booze no rough stuff he recited giving mitch a quick frisk okay youre welcome he stood aside to let mitch enter in the hallway seated at a desk which guarded without blocking the stairs to the second floor for this was a wellrun place you know was a polite pudgy little man in a neat serge suit no booze no rough stuff he smiled what can i do for you sir mitch told him the man hesitated i think you must mean neddy dont you sir yes im sure you must oh no please he gestured distastefully as mitch reached for his wallet the gratuity must be left with the young lady mitch sat down in a row of chairs with three other clients they kept looking at one another and looking away again as they were permitted to ascend the stairs other men were coming through the entrance tunnel each greeted with a frisk and a singsonged no booze no rough stuff at last the man at the desk smiled and nodded at mitch mitch started up the stairs and the man said that neddy could be found at the first door on his right a preferred room sir and a very special young lady thank you mitch mumbled he was getting the classa treatment he guessed he was a more likelylooking customer than they usually got and they wanted him back at the head of the stairs he paused and drew a long shuddery breath then he opened the muslincovered screen door on his right and went in he was hardly breathing unable to breathe nervously he caught the door letting it close without a sound he dragged his eyes to the bed made himself look and almost shouted with relief the girl was lying on her stomach head pillowed on her arms in the subdued light her naked body was a shadow carved of ivory a beautiful but vaguely limned shadow it was only a little more clear to him than her face but he could see her hair hair that by no stretch of the imagination could be teddys a long pageboy bob trailing to her shoulders and black coal black fine beads of sweat broke out on mitchs forehead he was relieved oh god was he relieved but what the hell did he do now obviously he couldnt do what a patron was expected to do but what was the alternative what would this girl think or do and what about that guy downstairs with the baseball bat he didnt know what would be an acceptable course of conduct almost as far back as he could remember he had been hearing about places like this in the frankest detail but he had never been in one he didnt know what a customer who wasnt a customer was supposed to do looking for a way out some clue to getting off the hook he let his eyes rove the room on the mirrorless dresser stood a white crockery water pitcher and a washbowl of the same color and material conveniently nearby was a small cardboard box of purplish disinfectant the socalled snakebite remedy soluble crystals of potassium permanganate the washbowl was tinged with traces of purple there were also smudges of purple on the towels which halffilled the basket at the side of the dresser in addition to a chair and of course the bed there was one other item of furniture a large white chamberpot it was about half full like the towel basket what could be more logical and its yellowish contents were also veined with the purple of potassium permanganate a wellrun place a house with a social conscience mitchs lips quirked in a nervous smile the smile began to spread then the girl turned over on the bed she sat up and stared at him she was a very wholesomelooking girl with a sprinkling of freckles across her nose the change in her appearance wrought by the black pageboy wig was incredible mitch gulped his emotions locked on the delicate gear between comedy and tragedy the hideous and the hilarious then there was a kind of inward backthrust the kick of a mechanism that had built up more compression than it was meant to handle and he began to laugh he laughed as though his life depended upon laughing well as in a sense it did he was still laughing laughing and weeping when teddy got up and slugged him with the pisspot the major was waiting studying mitch with a mixture of malice and and what envy hunger mitchs mind raced trying to probe the other mans soul and brain meanwhile the major felt forced to speak a very fine young man samuel i am truly sorry that he will not be able to continue here why wont he mitch said oh now really mr corley this is a very select school as you know to have a student whose mother is a uh uh well you must see that its impossible why the semester will be ended in less than three months just why cant he remain here for that length of time the majors mouth worked wordlessly a man trying to explain the axiomatic at last with a helpless gesture he placed the matter in purely practical terms yet his visitor remained unimpressed but no one knows you received this major thats right isnt it if the question should ever arise and it wont theres no way to prove that you received it but but i know mr corley i uh know and my duty is painfully clear mitch said that he didnt see it that way at all and he was sure that the major wouldnt if he thought things through the majors first duty was toward his students and how could duty be interpreted as the punishment of a student for the wrongdoing of a parent youre a man of the world major i can see that ill bet youve had a fling or two yourself havent you mitch smiled engagingly a man right in his prime as you are can still enjoy a juicy taste of life he knows what lifes about there are certain rules to observe of course but he certainly isnt going to embarrass someone like myself another man of the world because of a youthful mistake the major coughed his swollen flesh shifted inside the tan uniform straightening and readjusting its mass trying to remold itself into some semblance of the trim figure that sat across the desk as you say mr corley huhhuh these things do happen to the very best of us fellers oh yes huhhuh there was a girl in the philippines he broke off in sudden alarm now mr corley i really cant see no one knows about this mitch said steadily no one but you and i theres not a reason in the world why anyone else has to know it but but what are you suggesting i cant enter sam in another school at this late date if hes forced to leave here hell lose an entire semesters work now i was reading an article the other day on the cash value of an education to a boy i dont remember what the overall figure was but i think that if you broke it down a semester would be worth about two thousand dollars the major stared at him dazedly he looked down at the band that was being held out to him heard mitch murmur that hed have to be running along the major shook the hand and withdrew his own palm felt the flatfolded crispness that was like no other feeling it was done then so easily and smoothly a gracious thing that could only be undone ungraciously he wobbled upright on his wretched legs hardly at all discomfited the benefactor rather than the benefacted seeking the words appropriate to one man of the world when addressing another we must get together again mr corley two fellers like us heh and uh let me repeat that we are most happy to number samuel among our students we shall uh hope that he shall be back with us again next year thats very nice of you mitch smiled but he was thinking the hell sam will be back here another year not in the same place with a character like you and then leaving the office going down the steps of the administration building he was fairer about it he was used to giving bribes the major clearly wasnt used to accepting them the poor ineffectual bastard had been flattered and persuaded by an expert honestly convinced no doubt that he had only cooperated in an act of good will and who knew who knew perhaps he also had a nemesis who would make him do things he would never ordinarily do a dogged and vicious creditor a disease which impelled the life it was destroying to a last desperate tasting of life a woman who had had him hunted down just when he thought he had it made he knew now that he should have leveled with red when teddy first reappeared in his life but he was afraid of losing her he and red hadnt been together very long at the time and even with red knowing and accepting the truth there would still have been sam to protect how could you tell a kid or let him be told that his mother was a whore that she hated him how would he take it how could you risk the terrible damage that it might do to him he could divorce teddy naturally but that would accomplish nothing divorced she could do just as much as she was doing now divorce would crack the whole nasty mess wide open destroying everything that he had been trying to preserve sighing he pushed the problem to the back of his mind putting on a bright face as he came up to red and sam they strolled across to the campus lake together remained there talking and skipping stones across the water until late afternoon then they returned to the car and with sam waving goodbye red and mitch started back to houston red was looking a little glum depressed as she always was after leaving sam mitch suggested stopping someplace for a drink and dinner but red wasnt hungry he gave her a brief onearmed hug knowing what was coming but knowing of no way to head it off she led into it by a new route telling him that she thought sam knew the true nature of the relationship between them mitch shook his head firmly you mean you think he suspects that youre not really his aunt dont you well yes but but that doesnt mean he suspects anything else no he went on i think its more a matter of wishfulthinking on his part than anything else he likes you hed like to have you for a mother therefore he wishes you werent his aunt red was silent for a moment then she said quietly but flatly that she wanted to be sams mother now mitch lets get married right away weve got more than a hundred thousand dollars havent we that certainly should be enough to to to what mitch said just what do we know about anything except what we are doing well well we can learn cant we my gosh other people do and they dont have a hundred thousand dollars either were not other people weve been living high off the hog for a long long time and i think wed have one hell of a time doing a complete right aboutface as i see it and youve been seeing it the same way wed just about have to have enough to retire on to retire comfortably or at least enough to look around on and find something solid before we jump into it but a quarter of a million dollars honey do we really need that much we agreed on it we decided that wed need every penny of it red said crossly that they could undecide then there wasnt a real reason in the world why they couldnt get married right now unless that is mitch no longer wanted to marry her you know better than that mitch said sharply my god what a nasty thing to say well im sorry mitch i didnt really mean it of course i should think so but but couldnt we do it honey please of course we can mitch said but wait now red wait a minute we get married and then what yank sam out of school why no why would we want to do that but wed at least have to have some kind of home where he could visit us and an income to support that home something legit or did you think we could go on with the dice hustle oh of course not silly but well then were you just planning to go up to the school and tell sam we were married period i dont quite see what itll accomplish but if thats what you want red told him snappishly to just shut up for gods sake he was so darned smart he ought to hang a medal on himself then after a moment or two she laughed and patted his cheek sorry darling youre right of course its just that when a person wants something so much we both want it and were going to have it too mitch said warmly who knows houston is a good town maybe well make it right here id be satisfied to just make a good chunk of it i think perhaps we should be kind of preparing sam for the good news mitch went on giving things a good push while they were going his way maybe we should drop a hint or two that youre not really his aunt that you were a distant relative say who was adopted by my family red said that she guessed they probably should do that it might be kind of a shock to sam to tell him abruptly that they were married i know mitch she turned to him eyes shining well have him come to the wedding he can be the best man wonderful mitch said basking in her happiness hating himself for his deceit i can hardly wait honey they reached their apartment early in the evening despite his near exhaustion he again slept badly the following forenoon on the grounds of having to see his tax accountant he drove into the downtown business district at the bank he found he had guessed right about the amount in his safedeposit box it contained only three thousand dollars three thousand out of the approximate one hundred and twentyfive thousand that it should have held he took the six fivehundreddollar bills bought an equivalent amount of cashiers checks and mailed them to teddy it had been more than a month since he last sent her money but he had pointed out at the time that he was sending a considerably larger amount than her regular exorbitant stipend and that it would have to do her for at least six weeks he had hoped in this way to get her off his mental back for a while to free himself of the constant fear and danger of being late with a payment and what invariably happened if be was late now he knew he had made a colossal blunder teddy had cracked down on sam anyway without warning she had thus notified her husband that the payments had gone up he had proved that he could pay a larger amount so henceforth he would have to go on doing it driving back to the apartment mitch was suddenly struck by the terrifying knowledge that he would have to make another payoff to teddy in approximately two weeks by her reckoning he would owe it to her then and he would have to get it up or else and barring a miracle he simply couldnt do it he saw a drivein restaurant just ahead of him turning into it he ordered coffee sipped it slowly while he did some rapid mental arithmetic five thousand dollars that was roughly the amount he had laid on the line at the hotelapartment then there was the three thousand he had been cheated of at zearsdale country club plus a twogrand bribe to the major at sams school and another three thousand this morning to teddy it added up to an incredible thirteen thousand dollars thirteen thousand in less than three days he had been closerun to begin with with really less than he needed to enter a big game but he could have made out all right despite the five grand at the apartment it had been that extra eight thousand that had put him under the gun the club loss and the bribe and the money to teddy he hadnt counted on that which was stupid of him in this racket a man always had to anticipate the disasters which he had no logical reason to fear now well just how much cash on hand did he have he started to take out his wallet then firmly thrust it back into his pocket there was no point in knowing the exact amount whatever it was it would have to be enough it would be enough it always had been and it would be now driving on to the apartment house he felt unreasonably cheerful the fatalistic cheerfulness of a man who has survived the worst that can be handed to him in the lobby of the building he ran into turkelson who greeted him with the news that winfield lord was checking in early lord would be there the following night axiomatically ready for a game mitch said that he would go for it with certain cooperation from turkelson the manager happily agreed to give it to him so the mood of cheerfulness grew stepping onto the elevator mitch assured himself that the pendulum was now swinging the other way he would make a killing here in houston he could look forward to nothing but good from now on bad beginning good ending everything bad that could possibly happen had already happened it was an excellent hotelapartment needless to say perfectly insulated to accommodate its airconditioning soundproofed a monument to luxury which neither admitted nor emitted noise thus mitch had no warning not the slightest he simply stepped into the penthouse and found jake zearsdale waiting for him he was aware that red was in the room but he couldnt look at her he was aware that she was saying something but he couldnt hear it it wouldnt register on him all his senses were concentrated on zearsdale for an endless moment he stood stock still barely across the threshold he was frozen there unable to speak or move then the inner man took over and the voice of experience spoke to him always take the initiative always face up to the danger and frowning politely he advanced on the oil man and held out his hand i hardly expected to see you again mr zearsdale he said coolly red why dont you give our guest a drink she already has mr corley zearsdale gestured toward a side table your sister has been very good to me i only hope his broad mouth parted in a smile that youll be equally pleasant not that id blame you much if you werent my sister and i are always polite to guests mitch said we were taught to be as children apparently that isnt a teaching that penetrated your country club is it zearsdales heavy face darkened his sharp eyes glittered coldly seeming to whet themselves on mitchs eyes then he laughed with the sound of ice tinkling on fine crystal mr corley he said i came here instead of calling because i was afraid you might refuse to accept my call and what i have to say is important now do i get to sit back down or are you going to make me speak my piece standing up of course youre going to sit down mitch smiled dropping the offended bit lets freshen your drink a little too he carried the glass over to the bar where red took charge she brought him a drink also when she delivered zearsdales mitch studied the oil man as the latter took an incongruously delicate sip zearsdale wasnt covering up obviously as he had proved at the club he behaved pretty much as he felt not at all moved by the constraints which governed ordinary mortals unfriendly he had shown it now since he was showing friendliness i came here to apologize zearsdale said john birdwell hes the man who won that three thousand from you was cheating i see mitch nodded would you mind telling me how you caught on to it mr corley it was pretty plain mitch shrugged lightly he kept rolling fours and sixes and eights never anything but those three numbers there had to be something wrong and you accused him of cheating just on that basis that sounds pretty risky i thought it was pretty clearcut particularly when he used his dice hand to reach into his pocket mitch paused to light a cigarette what tipped you off weel zearsdale hesitated maybe it would be easier to explain if i told you something about birdwell he worked for me you know assistant vicepresident i believe id heard something to that effect i dont pay my people big salaries mr corley not what you and i think of as big theres just not much point to it you know the way taxes are and it doesnt give them the feeling of being part of what theyre working for its much better all around as i see it to give them stock options to be taken up at staggered intervals in other words but im sure i dont have to explain all this to you mitch said easily that perhaps hed better if it was necessary for red and him to understand it sis and i are much better at spending than earning put it this way then zearsdale went on johnny mr birdwell that is had been with me for seventeen years during that time he received increasingly large stock options they were better than money you understand every dollar put into them was worth more than two so johnny should have been a wealthy man comfortably fixed at least but you started me to thinking about him and i ran a fast check and i discovered that what he had was hardly dime one let it all slip away from him in one way or another the oil man frowned heavily seemingly as much offended as bewildered by birdwells bad management he continued yes johnny was broke but he had another one hundred thousand dollar stock option due him in a few days and hed already notified me that he was picking it up well zearsdale spread his hands there it was last night i took him into a private room at the club and searched him he was using crooked dice just as you said mitch shot a quick glance at red he frowned unconsciously im sorry if i caused any trouble he said any trouble he has is his own fault zearsdale said youre the injured party not him and im going to make it up to you he explained how he was going to do it mitch choked on an incredulous laugh and a faint frown puckered the oil mans brow i say something funny he said your sister seemed very pleased by it im sorry mitch said we appreciate your offer of course but naturally we couldnt accept it oh why not because we couldnt i mean its impossible its the same as making us a gift of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars zearsdale murmured that it wasnt the same at all he owed them something for the embarrassment he had caused them and for exposing birdwell as a cheat by allowing them to pick up birdwells stock option at less than half its market value he was only repaying a debt youre not depriving anyone of anything mr corley the options there if you dont pick it up it will simply lapse im sorry mitch shook his head im sorry but we just couldnt he lighted a cigarette taking his time about it very carefully he shook out the match a little weakly he again repeated that he was sorry avoiding reds eyes the pained and furious question that was in them you were saying zearsdale persisted that you and your sister didnt know much about business now if youd like to consult your banker no no mitch smiled quickly it isnt that at all but you wont accept the offer i guess i dont understand that kind of pride mr corley but if thats the way you feel he put down his glass and suddenly stood up with a cold nod he started toward the door and then red was abruptly across the room apologetically touching his arm please mr zearsdale my brother doesnt mean to be stuffy but well our funds are pretty well tied up invested we well it might be rather difficult to to mitch silently cursed her even as zearsdales face cleared and became friendly oh he said well i can understand that how long do you think it would take you to shake loose mr corley im not sure mitch said im not sure it would pay me to shake loose at all for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars nonsense the oil man laughed firmly you just put your banker in touch with me hell go for it regardless of what your setup is mitch said that he would see about it what the hell else was there to say after red had boobytrapped him then its all settled zearsdale said you call me in a couple of days okay okay mitch said and thanks very much they walked to the door together as they shook hands a curious expression flickered briefly across zearsdales face the look of a man who has been struck by a sudden and implausible notion then it was gone and he was gone and mitch slowly closed the door red was fixing herself a drink she tasted it and turned around to face him well she said well mitch too bad mitch said easily i wish it had been as good as it sounded honey you mean it wasnt zearsdale was making all that talk just to stay in practice mitch chuckled fondly now baby even you ought to know that a guy isnt going to make us a present of one hundred and fifty grand what do you mean even me her eyes flashed just how stupid am i supposed to be anyway lets drop it mitch said lets just for gods sake drop it red shook her head angrily i asked you a question mitch and i want an answer why did you turn zearsdale down because it would have forced your hand given us all the money you say we have to have to get married what mitch snorted now what kind of sense does that make you heard me yesterday we needed a quarter of a million dollars to pull out of this racket and settle down a hundred grand plus what we have on hand so today it falls right into our lap and you give it the brush no reason you dont ask me what i think you just i didnt think i had to ask you youve always said that i was the boss well she slowed down a little well you always have been mitch but but now im not he felt her weakening and pressed the point it has to be one way or the other red she looked at him hesitantly then put down her glass and came swiftly to him standing on tiptoe she brushed her lips against his then stepped back frowning slightly at the calculated coolness of his kiss it shouldnt have to be that way mitch not if you really love me are you saying that i dont its not what im saying that matters mitch its what youre not saying just because i dont demand explanations doesnt mean that you shouldnt offer them her reasonableness was infuriating mitch said for gods sake how many times did he have to tell her i dont think zearsdale was leveling i dont know what hes trying to pull or why but im certainly not going to take practically our last dollar and hand it over to him but he told you to consult your banker red pointed out he surely wouldnt have done that if he was pulling a fast one how do you know he wouldnt what do you know about business he pushed past her and went to the bar dumping whiskey into a glass he brooded savagely that this was really too damned much he was so near broke that his backbone was snapping at his belly button and he was being crowded for dough from all sides and now red was throwing her weight around demanding an explanation for the inexplicable adding to the agony of losing the onceinalifetime opportunity which zearsdale had offered he turned back around from the bar again found himself facing red well he said any more nutty questions dont you get sarcastic with me mitch well dont act like a damned fool then i ouch he said for red had suddenly slapped him why the hell did you do that ill do it again if you call me a damned fool my mother took that guff all her life but im not going to what what the hell has your mother got to do with it and you just stop cursing me too but goddammit i red slapped him again mitch grabbed her hauled her kicking and squirming to the lounge and turned her over his knee jerking up her housecoat he gave her bare bottom a resounding whack now lets knock it off he said jerking her upright again we forget zearsdale get me its all over kaput oh no it isnt red said dont you kid yourself it is mr mitch corley her red hair was tumbled around her face she tossed it back her breasts swelling and trembling as she fought to control herself ill tell you when itll be over mitch when you answer just one question for me do we or dont we have more than a hundred thousand dollars put away whaat he laughed shakily what kind of a crazy question is that answer me mitch but it doesnt make sense youve been with me all these years how could i have blown more than a hundred grand on myself the question threw her for a moment well she said i didnt say that you had spent it on yourself but well i should hope not ive always given you better than ive taken for myself everything ive done has been for you why my god honey wait she cut him off with a gesture just tell me the truth mitch thats all i ask just the truth do we have the money yes he snapped yes yes yes he snatched the key to the safedeposit box from his pocket its right here in town do you want me to take you down and show it to you red looked down at the key she brought her eyes up to look into his yes she said but you do red nodded evenly i dont think youre telling the truth mitch so yes i do want you to take me to the bank and show me the money mitch shook his head i dont think you know what youre saying red we have to trust each other if we dont we cant operate together i know that i was wondering if you did mitch shrugged he said all right if that was the way she wanted it thats the way i want it red said very well he consulted his watch we can have lunch somewhere along the way or would you rather have a bite here well eat later red said after ive seen that dough and before you can con me out of seeing it there was a certain banker in houston there is a certain banker in almost every large city his position will be one of importance an assistantcashier or better technically he does nothing illegal although discovery can cost him his job yet he reaps heavily from the operators perhaps they invented him the con men the bluesky operators the hustlers and highflying gamblers perhaps they merely discovered him the question is akin to the chickenortheegg riddle at any rate in the coming together of him and his clients almost never the banks clients there is a profitable conjunction of their necessity and his opportunity his charges are extremely high not only because of the risk to his job but because his clients have to have him in certain kinds of hustles whereas he does not have to have them so they can pay what he asks or go to hell but assuming that they are willing to pay want to move a sight draft in an hour the banker can do it for you want to impress a chump the banker will treat you like a longlost brother want to show a bundle of flash the banker will benevolently count it out for you in fort worth not so many years ago a rag mob played a rancher against the wall for seventyfive big ones it was a bald swindle and the lads wound up where all bad hustlers go but not the banker the key man in the frammis there was no provable crime to pin on him mitch got the car out and was waiting for red when she came down as they drove into the city he sensed her occasional sidewise looks the doubt that his calmness was producing in her but he said nothing and she remained stubbornly silent he put the car on the banks parking lot helping her out politely he escorted her into the bank and here at last she began to weaken red didnt know anything about banks her only contact with them had been indirect and unpleasant their more or less constant harassment of her fathers family mitch she shivered slightly in the vaulted vastness let it go honey mitch said it was too late to let it go and it was taking her by the arm he steered her firmly toward the railedoff enclosure occupied by upperechelon executives and stopped at the desk of an assistant vicepresident the mans name was agate a middling middleaged man with colorless lips rimless glasses and a thinlyhaired scalp that was as pink as a babys bottom why yes he said accepting the key to the safedeposit box ill be glad to handle this for you if youll just sit down please they sat down and he departed mitch took out a package of cigarettes proffered one to red she refused with a nervous little jerk of her head and he lit one for himself agate returned he placed an oblong box on the desk then withdrew a few feet so that they could have a kind of privacy mitch picked up the box and turned it upside down the flash tumbled out ofl the desk a cascade of largedenomination bills leaning back he told red to start counting aah no mitch she gave her head another little jerk lets just get out of here count it he insisted she gave him a pleading look an angrily pleading look she picked up a packet of bills and laid it down again blindly she picked up another pack gave it a clumsy push toward the first then with an almost desperate motion she stood up mitch a begging whisper please honey yes he said you mean youre satisfied yes yes i am darn you well please please come on mitch said he would have to wait for the money to be put away and the key returned to him red said that she would meet him at the car and she left hastily not looking back he followed her after a few minutes she obviously felt miserable ashamed of herself but he could take no comfort in his triumph it had cost too much he loved her too much as they neared the apartment house he told her that he was going to let her go up by herself and she looked at him frightened but he smiled reassuringly we both need to get pulled together a little so lets do it and then well forget it ever happened red bit her lip blinking back the tears she told him not to be so ddamned nice its your own fault ddoggone you yyou you shshouldnt have i shouldnt have asked you to take me on trust mitch agreed smoothly ill never do it again baby whaat she turned on him blazing dont you dare say that but you hush you just hush she almost ran into the apartment house legs flashing in their seamless hose mitch drove back to town in a secluded booth of a swank restaurant he met and lunched with agate explaining the potential deal with zearsdale and asking for help in swinging it agate considered it munching a bite of cherry torte when he had swallowed it and taken a sip of coffee he shook his head no can do mitch the deal would have to go through the bank which would mean references et cetera or heavy collateral but the stocks collateral in itself oh come on now you dont have the stock until the moneys been transferred but you can keep it all in escrow when you pay the money you take the stock wheres the risk in that agate conceded that there wasnt any but it was still no soap its one of those things you can do if you already have money mitch if you were the substantial citizen that is that zearsdale thinks you are as it is well theyd try to check it out with him which would start him to checking on you and youd probably wind up with something you wouldnt like mitch grinned wryly a hell of a note isnt it lee if i want to throw a curve youre my boy but i bring you something strictly legit and youre not at home mmmmmm agate had filled his mouth again good lunch mitch lee i could move the whole thing in one day get the money from you in the morning cash in the stock and have it back to you by closing time whuh the banker sprayed crumbs from his mouth eyes bulging with horror dont say things like that mitch id cut the juice right through the center lee seventyfive gs for each of us dont not another word agate shuddered visibly my god man how could you even ask me to take a hundred thousand dollars of the banks money and turn it over to a uh mitch knew it was no use yet something beyond the knowledge pushed him on you know me lee you know i wouldnt pull a fast one on you no mitch no no no why hell you could go along with me for that matter what could be more logical seventyfive grand just for taking a little walk with me no sir i dont walk anywhere with the banks money well use your own then you could raise it couldnt you well its the chance of a lifetime lee seventyfive thousand dollars for doing absolutely nothing nothing agate laughed a little angrily putting up a hundred thousand is nothing not for a man like you not in view of your profit well mitch saw that he was weakening glory to god he was weakening and taking very careful aim he threw in the hook well forget it lee theres a couple of other prospects i can probably get it from no now wait agate said i i think i can do it its eightyfive thousand net right actually eightyfive instead of a hundred eightyfive what do you mitch broke off oh yes i promised you fifteen for this morning didnt i agate said that fifteen was right you know i only swing about once a year now if something doesnt look extra good i dont touch it this wasnt a caper lee the fifteen is a flat loss to me if you say so agate shrugged either way you had me stretched too far for comfort if anyone else had phoned me to snatch up a hundred and twentyfive thousand on less than a hours notice id have told em to go jump it was an emergency lee i know so agate smiled with a trace of nervousness with the eightyfive i get together and the fifteen you give me now mmm yes mitch nodded that will make it wont it how soon can you get your end together that isnt the question mitch not right at the moment it isnt oh no agates eyes gleamed coldly behind the rimless glasses and if you were about to ask me if im worried about getting the fifteen thousand ill say no again i dont have to worry i know too much about you the change that had come over him was amazing a change so pronounced that the cozy quiet of the restaurant seemed suddenly ominous he drummed on the table waiting watching his lips tightening into a thin colorless line he watched and waited no longer the amiable almost priggish acquaintance but now revealed as the calculating whore he essentially was mitch smiled at him winsomely give me a few days will you lee im a little short this trip that wasnt the agreement mitch i honestly cant help it lee my god you know im good for it a man like you said agate is good only as long as he keeps his promises mitch would have said the same thing himself generally speaking but he hadnt thought that agate would play it so tough all right lee he said i should have told you it would be a few days only a couple actually but you dont mind do you as long as you know youre going to get it do i have a choice the banker wadded his napkin laid it on the table and stood up mitch also arose picking up the check but agate plucked it from his fingers sometime when youre not so hard up mitch say two days from now aah lee mitch winced i wish you wouldnt take it like this fifteen thousand youd better have it mitch he turned and walked away fitting a homburg over his pinkish scalp mitch looked after him glumly knowing that he would have to have the fifteen on the line knowing that he had lost his one chance to pick up the zearsdale option many texas fortunes are old to the point of antiquity their origins dating back to the copquistadores and huge spanish landgrants the founders were cattleraisers beef cattle so also were their descendants even to the present day the discovery of oil was looked upon as a by no means lucky accident it was stinky stuff something that spoiled water for the cattle and messed up the grazing since it was there it had to be accepted along with the millions it represented but their attitude toward it was one of polite disdain it was upstart you know an infringement upon the civilization of a highly select group whose forefathers had been living in elegance for centuries one has never been properly snubbed until he has come up against these quality texans or perhaps snubbed is the wrong word since one cannot very well be snubbed by a person who does not recognize his existence nor can one hardly take offense when that same person may be honestly puzzled at the mention of the cabots and lodges who are they anyway easterners oh that is one kind of bigmoney texan the old money rooted inexorably in cattle and generally speaking he tries to live up to the superiority with which he has cloaked himself his conduct is impeccable he is a loyal friend a generous enemy he shuns ostentation he is gallant with ladies a gentleman with men as good a man in private as he is in public all of which is by way of saying that winfield lord jr was not that kind of texan nor did he belong to the oilmoney group in fact the lords fitted into none of the established categories although they were a qualified amalgamation of several they were an old family they were pioneers their wealth had originated in cattle arriving in what is now oklahoma the lords were successively banished or chased from each of the tribes five autonomous nations until in about they arrived in the land of the osages the osages were not a nation since they were not considered civilized the government of the united states saw to it that they stayed within their own boundaries but otherwise they were pretty much free to do as they pleased it shortly pleased them to spreadeagle four of the lords on their backs prop open their mouths with sticks and pour water down them until they were drowned the experience apparently had a wholesome effect on the remaining members of the clan fleeing into west texas they seem to have committed no outrages for almost a generation then the civil war broke out and the lords reverted to type while every ablebodied neighbor galloped away to support the cause of the stars and bars the lords moved in on their virtually defenseless holdings inevitably finding other renegades to help them then killing them off as soon as their work was done at the wars end they controlled whole counties there was no law to appeal to they were the law gradually success and its whilom companion excess had done what nothing else could do one by one the lords had indulged themselves into early deaths the exceptions being those who had rubbed the right people the wrong way now winfield lord tall dark handsome and a firstclass sonofabitch was the last of the male line it was mitch believed the one good thing that could be said about him he and lord were in the smaller of the penthouses two bedrooms the spread had been pulled back and the blankets drawn tight on the bed on the back of it out of the way of the dice which lord was about to roll was a total of two thousand dollars he hurled the dice they bounced against the wall and came down on the blanket with a craps three immediately he snatched them up glaring defiantly at mitch no dice they slipped out of my hand oh for christs sake winnie it was so ridiculous that mitch laughed are you really that bad off i told you they slipped goddammit it was no dice go ahead mitch said wearily have yourself a free roll lord shook the dice vigorously he breathed on them and kissed them and threw them again the dice showed onetwo for craps mitch picked up the money and nodded to the cattle heir this was it he knew lord was broke again and turkelson would cash no more checks for him all that remained now was to bust him out of the apartment reds end of course but pretenses had to be kept up still your dice winnie you havent had a point yet lord recovered the dice declaring that he was shooting five thousand dollars mitch told him to go right ahead as soon as he showed the money and dont pull that check routine on me again im not having any whassa matter lord belched spewing the sour aroma of whiskey from his finely chiseled mouth you saying my checks no good or somethin skip it i told you we play for cash or not at all so if you dont have any more lord cursed and snatched up the phone he got turkelson on the line and told him to drag his fat ass up there with five thousand dollars met with refusal he unleashed an obscene tirade upon the manager ending it with a threat to come down and kick his balls off a fine frigging joint he slammed up the phone might as well stay in a goddamned shithouse well theres always another night mitch said carelessly let me fix you a drink win he turned toward the living room lord pushed past him declaring that hed fix his own drinks and he didnt need any halfassed help to do it mn expert know what i mean he grabbed a bottle of scotch from the bar and began pouring into a beer mug been fixin drinks since i was tithigh to a tumblebug first you gotta the sound of the doorchimes interrupted him mitch crossed the room and opened the door and red walked in she was wearing a black strapless evening gown so formfitting that it seemed to be painted on her lords glass dropped to the floor with a gurgling crash and red gave him a dazzling smile then looked accusingly at mitch why mitch youre not even ready yet oh my god mitch groaned dont tell me this was the night it most certainly was and you were supposed to have harvey here too alice is down in the car waiting for him mitch apologized he introduced her to lord as helen harcourt and explained the seeming mixup a friend of mine and i had a date with helen and her sister tonight but it completely slipped my mind and arent you ashamed red pouted ill bet mr lord wouldnt have forgotten would you mr lord you just bet your sweet little ass ankles i wouldnt lord declared gallantly your sister anything like you baby oh no red simpered alice is the pretty member of the family lord was completely carried away by the reply couldnt be any prettier than you are tutz youre the prettiest little package of tail ive ever seen in my life now youre just being polite red gave him an icy smile youre just saying that to be gentlemanly i mean it lord insisted the prettiest tail i ever saw in my life and im a guy thats seen plenty of tail mitch decided that was about enough more than enough regardless of the need to get lord out of here he wasnt going to have red put up with this maybe youd better run along now he told her well have that date some other night well her eyes told him it was all right i was just thinking that mr lord might like to come along to keep alice company oh he probably wouldnt want to bother after all its getting late and we were having a little game lord said to screw the game and how goddamned late it was then bowed wobblingly in reds direction have to excuse the language honey be perfectly all right as soon as i have a drink i understand red murmured i hope you dont mind putting on a dinner jacket dont mind a bit baby what kind you like plaid white black black will be fine alice and i will be waiting down in the car mitch she swept out of the room with another brilliant smile at lord he promptly returned to the bar took a long drink direct from the bottle and slammed it down with a shuddery hiccup then turning slowly he treated mitch to a long thoughtful and seemingly sober stare seen you somewhere before havent i he said have you mitch said seen that redheaded broad too seen the two of you together weve been together before mitch nodded now that i think of it i believe ive seen you somewhere too so who cares everybodys seen me known far and wide im sure youre right hadnt you better be getting dressed if were going to meet the girls dont be so goddamned rude lord scowled cantcha see im havin a drink you can take the bottle along with you if you like now youre tryin to patronize me lord declared actin like i dont have any whiskey of my own mitch sighed wondering vaguely if there wasnt an easier way to make a living lord would have to be carried to his suite if he didnt leave very soon his appearance to the contrary he must be very near the point of collapse and yet well he just might not be with winfield lord jr one could never be sure his behavior was always erratic his speech was invariably obscene he had been sodden with alcohol for so long that drunkenness was the norm for him now he was apt to be sober when he appeared to be drunkest tell you where i saw you he was saying in a cage at the zoo you were trying to slip it to another ape imagine that mitch yawned i didnt know anyone was watching just testing lord said wisely always test people like that keeps em worried know what i mean think i remember em they dont try to pull anything thats very shrewd of you mitch nodded then you havent seen me before tonight lord said hell no he hadnt and that was one thing he had to be grateful for but i got to keep testing see i run into someone like you or that redheaded broad i test em and you know why i do it to keep them worried well shut up and ill tell you then lord said heres my ass see he slapped his rump and heres the whole goddamned world he held up the stiffened forefinger of his right hand thats the world just waitin the chance to jab poor ol winnie lord in the ttail his voice broke and he sobbed then getting control of himself he glowered ferociously at his upheld finger so what do i do about it what does winnie lord do when the whole worlds a big screwin finger huh hah well ill tell you what he bites the goddamned thing off mitch grabbed him frantically he tried to force lords mouth open to pull the finger out of his mouth but lord was slippery and strong they struggled about the room stumbling over furniture almost going through a window at last lord opened his mouth and burst into jeering laughter jesus christ he said are you ever a jerk the finger had been doubled over there wasnt a mark on it strangely or perhaps not so strangely mitch was almost grateful to him that took care of any twinge of conscience he had felt at beating lord for thirtythree thousand dollars his feeling now was that he had earned the money and then some the feeling increased as lord suddenly remembered helen and alice mitch suggested that he go to his own suite so that they could be dressing simultaneously but lord wouldnt have it that way no sir no by god mitch should get dressed and then accompany him while he was dressing gonna keep an eye on you get me yarent gettin away from me for a motherlovin minute suit yourself mitch shrugged you can have another drink while im changing stop ordering me around lord said who the hell you think you are anyway at last they were on their way lord holding himself very erect looking like a matinee idol as they descended in the elevator mitch guided him to his own suite sat him down inside and wheeled the portable bar close to him he sat down across from him and lord resumed his drinking and his endless and pointless obscenities and mitch could not feel sorry for him how could you feel sorry for someone who had everything and flatly refused to do anything with it but still he was subtly perturbed naggingly puzzled by the riddle this particularization of the universal which lord represented you could say he was a bastard by choice and that was true you could say that he could hardly be anything else in view of his heritage and that was true but still there had to be more to it than that some hideous note that only he could hear in the leitmotif to which he marched through life why did he choose to be as he was why had his ancestors chosen to be as they were why did a person a people who were fortunate beyond their wildest dreams use their all to crap up the only world they had to live in where was the answer did it exist in them or in oneself once finding himself on the campus of a large university mitch had chosen to stroll through the main engineering building a building whose main corridor was a hundred yards long at its beginning the beginning of the corridor that is the mathematical equivalent of pi was engraved upon the wall but that the accepted workaday definition was not true pi of course so there had been more decimals behind the customarily final one on and on and still on until the end of the corridor was reached but that still was not the end of pi as was indicated by the plus sign behind the final decimal somewhere possibly within the limitless infinity of mathematics a period could be correctly put to the equation or possibly it could never be perhaps what was missing was not intrinsic to the formula itself but in the eye that beheld it some new dimension which would illuminate the darkest corners of human knowledge including the perverse minds of men like winnie lord however it was mitch decided as he waited wearily for lord to pass out the answer to such imponderables as true pi and mans meanness was not his to provide however it was he decided he was damned glad that he was mitch corley with all of mitch corleys problems instead of winfield lord jr lord at last drew a blank mitch felt his pulse making sure that he was suffering from nothing worse than he ever suffered from then having checked the apartment for any burning cigarettes he covered lord with a blanket and returned to the penthouse turkelson and red were seated cozily on the lounge sipping tall drinks and nibbling from a huge tray of hot hors doeuvres mitch saw that red was just a little bit high and he looked at them with mock severity curse this bitter day he said flinging a hand to his forehead so this is what goes on while im out sweating over a hot pair of dice its all turks fault red declared hes simply been pouring the drinks down me mitch mmmhmm and i suppose he put you in that negligee and robe too didnt he yes he did red said thats exactly what he did i dont know what would have happened if you hadnt come in turkelson chucked and chortled his belly quivering with delight mitch sat down counted off three thousand three hundred dollars and handed it to him ten per cent of thirtythree okay turk my god yes the manager breathed its really too much mitch i didnt do anything to deserve a cut like this you did plenty how did the paper look anyway no illegible signatures or funny stuff see for yourself turkelson said and he handed mitch the checks which lord had written that night they were all made out to the hotel company rather than to cash or an individual thus they became a legitimate obligation for value received it would be obvious of course that lords bill could not have amounted to so much but that changed nothing as a means of building good will a large hotel may cash checks for a person who is not even a patron mitch handed the checks back began to relax for the first time in days he could pay off agate now and still have more than enough left to take care of his other immediate needs after that well after that was after that for the present he was sitting sweet red brought him a drink and a few delicacies from the tray he frowned slightly as she fixed herself another drink then grinned and winked at her she had been a little awkward with him since she had forced him to take her to the bank it was good to see her loosened up and having fun again red would never be a drunk she enjoyed life too much she was too honest with herself too clear of conscience all worn out honey she looked at him archly over the rim of her glass completely worn out mitch laughed and shook his head how about you winnie was giving you a pretty hard time him oh pooh you know hes such a complete stinker that i almost felt sorry for him dont mitch said firmly the last woman who felt sorry for winnie lord almost got her nose bitten off im not kidding he glanced at turkelson you remember it dont you turk some poor damned waitress in a galveston beer joint i remember the manager nodded the lords fought the case all the way to the supreme court she didnt even get her doctor bills out of it red said that that might be all well and good but lord had really paid her quite a compliment you heard him yourself mitch he said i was the prettiest little package of youknow hed ever seen he was probably exaggerating mitch told her you know how these texans are well what about you do you think i am or not how would i know mitch spread his hands helplessly youre the only woman ive ever known mmm red said mmmmmmmmmm am i going to kiss you for that when i get you alone then she turned and gave turkelson a speculative look now i just wonder she said i wonder if youd know what about turkelson grinned expectantly why not ask me well okay but youve got to promise to tell the truth she cocked her head to one side you promise you big fat man promise he held up a hand chuckling red turned on the lounge on her knees and whispered in his ear the ear suddenly turned sunset red as did his face and neck well she demanded pertly what do you think uh i uh think id better go turkelson said desperately running a plump finger around his collar i i he struggled to his feet red grabbed him by the coattail and dragged him down again now youve got to tell the truth she insisted if you dont tell the truth youll have to pay the penalty you know what the penalty is she whispered to him again leaned back with a solemn nod turkelson appeared to be on the point of strangling thats it she declared if you dont tell the truth right this minute im going to make you mitch mitch you let me go darn you mitch held her sackwise tucked under one arm as she kicked and squealed he shook hands with turkelson good going my friend well see you tomorrow huh uh yes you bet mitch the manager edged nervously toward the dor and weve checked out as far as lord is concerned understand no telephone calls he doesnt get up here on the elevator right oh absolutely turkelson bobbed his head i ill let myself out mitch he did so just as red tugged herself free pirouetted and paused with an arm theatrically upflung a little music professor now honey its getting pretty late hush she said music well okay then just a little he had never had music lessons but he had an excellent memory and naturally a sensitive touch sitting down at the piano he pressed the soft pedal considered the keyboard for a moment and brought his hands down on it very softly he swung out with a swaggering barrelhouse version of it must be jelly cause jam dont shake like that red did a lowdown grind turning completely around she kicked backwards and one of her houseslippers sailed into the air turning and grinding she kicked again and the other slipper sailed free mitch moved both hands down to the bass the piano became a tomtom and reds face took on an ecstatic look head flung back leaning backward from her knees she writhed out of her robe the lacy negligee went next and that was all for a minute or two mitch moved up the keyboard his fingers insistent demanding reds hands went to her bra seeming to struggle with themselves to fight against the action then as the piano sobbed and pleaded she suddenly ripped it off the panties went next then then there was nothing more only red ripe fullbodied a living dream of pulsing pastel they looked at each other silently then she turned slightly pointing to an almost invisible bruise on her flank see she said thats what you did when you spanked my bottom into each life mitch said some rain must fall arent you going to do anything about it well i might mitch said if i was sure you werent one of those phony redheads red said he could surely see for himself that she wasnt but mitch said it was not something that could be determined with the naked eye why i knew a blonde one time who passed herself off as a brunette her boy friend was a coal miner you see and he was allergic to soap and water red made her eyes very large my goodness gracious she said not to mention heavenstobetsy so theres no way of knowing whether im a phony or not well yes there is mitch said its a method ive developed over the years and ive enjoyed every minute of it how are you fixed for time well i dont have anything on tonight so you dont mitch said but im afraid tonight wouldnt be nearly enough how about the next forty or fifty years red said oh sure she could manage that all right what were forty or fifty years when the interests of science were at stake mitch stood up and pointed firmly to the bedroom just step into my laboratory madam the tests will begin immediately and i dont mean perhaps winfield lords reservation at the hotel had been for three days including the day of his arrival but perversely and for no apparent reason he remained for six he made no attempt to reach mitch quite possibly with his long training in blankingout he did not remember being with mitch but that was only a possibility not a certainty it was also possible where anyone as tricky as he was concerned that he was merely biding his time waiting for the proper moment to spring one of the nearriots for which he was famous or rather infamous some brannigan that would attract the attention of the police and newspapers mitch couldnt risk that naturally neither could he risk the demand from lord for another game even the thirtythree thousand was an uncomfortably large amount to take from such a character turkelson would have his neck out to there if he continued to play cashier for mitch you could always get bit by riding a good thing too far lord kept pretty much to his suite consuming great quantities of liquor eating sparsely receiving occasional visits from call girls and the house physician of necessity then mitch and red remained in their suite lord would forget them in time if he hadnt already for the present they could not take the chance of encountering him this cooling out on a chump of course is routine in any hustle ordinarily it would have been accomplished by jumping town since that was impractical here they could only remain in hiding which mitch reflected wouldnt have been at all hard to take normally what was so tough about being holed up in a fancy penthouse with a beautiful doll and a big bundle of the green red thought it was just fine and dandy and proved it by hardly letting him out of her sight mitch well mitch would have thought it was fine too if he could ever have stopped thinking for a moment about agate he had already broken one promise to the banker now since more than two days had gone by he had broken another and agate knew things about him things which could be very dangerous if he chose to reveal them mitch doubted that agate would be appeased by anything less than cash but on the third afternoon while red was showering he managed a quick call to him all right the banker snapped as mitch began a hasty explanation you couldnt get in when can you well im not sure lee i hope i can make it tomorrow but forget tomorrow then what about the next day well i i or the day after that well lee i just cant say for sure but i know youve got something big on the fire and you want to keep me quiet until you can pull it off aah no lee it isnt like that at all i agate slammed up the phone mitch didnt bother to call him back nor would it have done any good if he had there was nothing to do but wait and worry the end of lords stay coincided with the weekend thus it was monday before mitch could notify agate that the fifteen thousand was waiting for him agate seemed stunned to hear his voice on the phone but but i thought that well now you know you were wrong mitch said same place same time okay well have lunch well uh im not sure that uh you can have a drink with me if youre tied up for lunch or i can drop the dough off at the bank for you no no dont do that agate said and he seemed to sigh well make it for drinks they met at the same quietly luxurious restaurant they had lunched in the previous week mitch handed him an envelope and he looked at it almost blankly for a moment then he opened the flap thumbed through the contents and slowly raised his eyes again well mitch said its all there isnt it what agate blinked oh yes yes its all here he tapped thoughtfully on the table with the envelope then his lips tightening peevishly he added that mitch was very late inexcusably late you couldnt blame me at all if id blown the whistle on you well as long as you didnt mitch shrugged you just cant do things like this mitch agate shook his head fretfully you of all people should know that you cant you break one promise to me then you come right back and break another one you just let everything slide and then you show up when youre damned good and ready and expect everything to be all right isnt it lee mitch said isnt it all right if it isnt youd better tell me right now but agate continued his nagging he had to it was a mask for the confusion the uncertainty the fear which teemed through his mind it was a rationalization an attempt to blame mitch for his own betrayal and how could he possibly tell the truth anyway he needed this fifteen thousand he was terrified of what mitch might do if he knew the truth well lee mitch was saying isnt it all right does this square us up or doesnt it now thats not the point agate said doggedly youve got to admit that never mind mitch gestured curtly i cant sit here all day while you scold me how much more do you want twofifty five i thought the fifteen was damned plenty but ill sweeten it if you say so now i said nothing about sweetening it agate muttered i didnt say a thing about wanting more money but you do want it dont you mitch studied him carefully if you dont what the hell is this all about he took a sip of his vermouth cassis keeping his eyes on the banker agate gulped down the last of his double scotch sat twirling the glass nervously god why couldnt he have waited why had he had to be in such a hell of a hurry why how suddenly he saw a way out or thought he saw one it was a stupid way actually no way at all but desperation and the abrupt infusion of whiskey made it seem brilliant smiling he tucked the money envelope into his pocket and held out a hand the fifteen is plenty he said and excuse me if ive given you a hard time i had a rough morning at the bank mitch hesitated studying him a moment longer but the explanation sounded reasonable and he could think of no other blue monday a hard morning after a hard weekend it figured didnt it it happens to the best of us he said then were all set still friends of course we are certainly we are mitch just give me a holler the next time you need help im afraid i cant do anything for you in that zearsdale matter but anything else mitch nodded not particularly disappointed the zearsdale option had been a longshot something he had had to try for without really expecting to hit it was enough that he had been able to square himself with the banker and he was very relieved to have done it a dresssuited waiter approached looked expectantly from one to the other of them mitch suggested lunch but agate shook his head i think ill just settle for another drink another double please he said and dont let me keep you mitch ive got some things to think out and id just as soon be alone for a while mitch took the hint and excused himself as he departed the waiter brought agates second drink and the banker took a grateful gulp from the brimming glass with a sigh he settled back in the upholstered booth for the moment at least he could almost see himself as the suave man of large affairs the shrewd and imposing executive which only drink or dreams had ever permitted him to be his wife and children had no use for him his employers and coexecutives gave him neither liking nor respect fortuitously he had been available at a time when death and war had vacated increasingly desirable positions and thinned the ranks of those aspiring to them he had been there when no one else was there so now he was here and no one knew better than he that he had no right to be here the assistant vicepresident of a large bank mere chance was responsible chance and a lack of imagination were responsible a mental laziness which had kept him in the same rut it had led him to a normally deadend rut for more than thirty years he had come straight from high school to the bank now nearing fifty he was increasingly conscious of his inadequacies and decreasingly able to repair or conceal them time had shrunk him even as it had expanded the responsibilities of his job the noise of his rattling around in it was drawing frequent and frightening looks from his superiors it would be extremely awkward of course almost impractical to dispose of a thirtyyear man who was an upperechelon executive and agates appearance was a constant contradiction of the errors which could only occasionally be traced to him how could one believe that there was virtual emptiness behind the impressive bankerlike exterior with which he daily faced the world with so much on display then logically there had to be a great deal more underneath as with an iceberg whose greatest mass is below the surface logic and hadtobes to the contrary however there was daily evidence that his employers were at last seeing him for what he was as literally nothing compared to what he should have been as a very vulnerable link in a chain which needed to be strong now if somewhat belatedly they were discovering the real man a discovery which the first of a long series of hustlers had made almost fifteen years before those were the facts on lee jackson agate in the bemusing glow of alcohol he ignored them becoming one of the highest and mightiest among the high and the mighty he argued pleasantly with a readily acquiescent self pointing out that he was a success wasnt he however it had come about he was a success he had a fine home two fine cars a comfortable quantity of stocks and bonds he was quite a little in debt having unwisely followed the same market advice he had given various customers of the bank but why niggle over trifles what was debt to a man with such an impeccable credit rating that he had been able to acquire liabilities which were more than double his assets his house was in his wifes name darn her as were his blue chip stocks but the nagging and henpecking which had brought about this arrangement could not change texas law in effect a married woman in texas could not own property her assets being under the legal control of her husband he could do just about as he pleased with what she had hoped to do as she pleased darn her so he would just go into this zearsdale stockoption deal and he would split a fast one hundred and fifty thousand with mitch and then afterwards when his wife saw how truly brilliant he was well things had been quite good with them at one time back in the beginning they had been good then his parents had come to live with them having no other way of living and the good had rapidly become bad his wife had resented them she had resented him for being too nambypamby to let them starve they were wellmeaning what parents are not but they were also woefully ignorant and in their anxiety to be amiable good compny they provided their daughterinlaw with the means of wreaking vengeance on agate for the rest of his life pa his mother would say do you remember the time when you sneaked up on lee when he was out in the privy an or ma his father would say you remember the time when lee got sent home from school fr havin lice in his pants pears like someone told him if he set on a hens nest long enough he could lay aigs an or yessir that lee was really a case fell tsleep in church with his mouth open an a big ol juneybug flew down his throat had to knock him out with a prayer book before we could get him calmed down that was the way it went that was the way with lee agate trying to smile unable to chide his own parents his wife listening eyes sparkling maliciously and later when passion or tenderness mounted in him when his being cried out for the understanding he had so freely given himself then then a chilling snigger a gesture of simulated disgust a suggestion that he go on out to the privy the repeated implication that he was stupid or perverted or clumsy or nasty or vicious any and all of the unpleasant things which the senile anecdotes of his parents had painted him as being naturally his wifes attitude carried over to his children he had never been able to correct them or even to suggest a course of conduct to them without arousing their derision it had been a very long time since he had tried to just as it had been a very long time since he had made any gesture of love to his wife anything more than the merest peck on the cheek she resented this of course and his children resented his abandonment of his proper role in the family perhaps in the final analysis he was at fault rather than they it is an unquestioned tradition in the lore of the american family that the adult male would go the way of the buffalo except for the protection and guidance of his wife and children he may be trusted to perform brain surgery but never to sharpen a pencil he may be a chef but in his own home he cannot boil water he may be a writer but his help on a freshman theme is a virtual guarantee of a failing grade possibly there is an inverse relationship between the low rating of the american male in his own home and the alarming increase in impotence insanity alcoholism homosexuality suicides divorces abortions murders censorship and educated illiterates still the male is holding out rather well against the loved ones who want only to tear him apart and gobble him up he makes his office his home his work his pride undistracted he proves his worthwhileness over and over eventually garnering so much moral muscle that even his kiddies are impressed and refrain from cursing him in front of strangers and his little woman gives him a little of what little women have to give without first making him confess that he is a walleyed sonofabitch and that she is the nicest sweetest darlingest generousest beautifulest unselfishest perfectest ad infinitum ad nauseum somethingoranother that ever dwelt south of heaven unfortunately for lee agate he had no job not in the true sense of the word a creature who looks like a duck makes noises like a duck and is generally ducklike in its behavior may safely be presumed to be a duck but agate who bore all the outward aspects of a bank executive was no more than an implausible facsimile of one he found fear and not satisfaction in his position his crisp mannerisms his sternness were only an aggressive coverup for that fear a growing conviction of inferiority which the job nurtured in him so so hed just take the afternoon off goddamn em thatd show em right right right thirtyyear man wasnt he zecutive apisstant ricevedizent hee hee heeheehee uh uh heeehahaha agate suddenly sat erect and made his face stern he looked around the now sparselyoccupied room lips thinned severely eyes flashing sharply behind his glasses but no one had been watching him apparently unless perhaps they had looked away very quickly or if they had it was certainly understandable obsly big man captn of commerce d realize big man had to relax a little an get away from his cares the waiter brought him a fourth drink set it down in front of him with a very deliberate gesture agate stared at him coldly and the waiter asked him if he would like to see a menu agate said that he wouldnt what he wanted was a telephone and he wanted one now right now understand lets see a little service around here his eyes glittered triumphantly as the waiter scampered away he took two long gulps of his drink he waited in aloof silence while a phone was plugged in at the booth in his many years with the bank he had had frequent contacts with prominent and powerful houstonites zearsdale among them he was invariably in the role of a glorified messenger boy on these occasions but he did not remember them that way now rather in the roseate present he saw himself moving among these people as a friend rather than a flunky they were his pals and he was their pal and naturally jake zearsdale would want to give his pal lee agate an option to buy stock at twofifths of its market value perfly understanble right right ri nope wasnt right not now maybe later but jake zearsdale had to be called all ri al riut had to be called about ol pal mitch corley agate straightened himself again the importance of what he was about to do impressed itself on his sodden brain demanding all the effort of which he was capable and getting an outside line he dialed and spoke into the phone very carefully a secretary answered him passed him on to an executive secretary and thence to an executive secretary of an executive assistant finally almost ten minutes after he had placed the call he was connected with zearsdale he was beginning to fogup again by then and he virtually guffawed into the phone he choked it off mumbled a blurry scuse me mr zearsdale the line was silent for a moment then his voice harshly musical zearsdale said certainly who is this please dis is dub guy dat called you las week agate said about mitch corley rmember called you last week bout mitch hic corley im duh would you mind speaking a little louder please zearsdale said we seem to have a bad connection certnly agate raised his voice said i was dub guy dat called you las week about mish m itch louder please and just a little slower i said said agate enunciating as clearly as he could that i was the guy who called you last week about mitch corley juh get me that time mmm yes i believe i did zearsdale murmured do you have some more information on him agate shook his head firmly then laughed in selfdepreciation as he realized that the negative could not be seen little joke on me he explained to the phone and explained the jest in detail zearsdale laughed politely im a little crowded for time he added perhaps youd better tell me why you are calling wha oh yeah yeah sure agate mumbled jus wanted to say i was all wrong bout mitch checked into it mself an found id made a terrible mistake hesitated hic bout callin yuh but figgered man makes mistake oughta be big nough to admit it i see zearsdale said thoughtfully i see mean it agate insisted sall wrong based on unrli ble information checked it out mself an possibly just possibly zearsdales tone was judicious but im inclined to think that youre not telling the truth im quite a student of voices and you dont sound at all sincere oh yeah agate glared belligerently into the mouthpiece now you lissen tme buddy shut up zearsdale said huh whatdya mean shut i mean to shut up and youd better do it zearsdale said youd also better stop drinking you cant handle it youre a big enough damned fool when youre sober agates mouth was suddenly very dry his lips moved in a silently futile attempt at speech now im going to give you some advice zearsdale continued i wouldnt take your word for anything so ill find out the truth about corley myself meanwhile he is not to know that you have spoken to me you will make no attempt to warn him if you do ill make you the sorriest man in texas and thats a promise mr l j agate the mention of his name was like a purgative to agate he was abruptly very sober more frightened than he had ever been in all his fearfilled life wwhat he croaked what are you going to do do said zearsdale and his voice was almost lilting why im going to invite mr corley to have dinner with me he hung up agate hung up he looked at his drink started to reach for it then jerked his hand back as though it had touched a flame he had better go back to the bank he guessed no he had better go home no he had better go go the waiter approached still deferential from the last time agate had barked at him agate straightened himself patted the thin hair on his scalp assumed an impressive frown opened his mouth to speak and vomited all to hell over everything the day had been hot and humid a muggy sweltering day and one seemed on the point of boiling in his own perspiration the kind of day that is not quite so unusual as the citys civic organizations would have one believe those organizations may admit that houstons weather occasionally leaves something to be desired but they hasten to point out and with some truth that however unpleasant the day the nights are delightfully cool to someone unaccustomed to the climate the delightful coolness may bear a striking resemblance to frigidity and as mitch had preprandial drinks with zearsdale he was grateful for the low blaze in the fieldstone fireplace the fireplace was in the kitchen of the zearsdale home zearsdale in shirt sleeves and a butchers apron had led him back to the kitchen immediately upon his arrival and they were now seated at a large wooden table one of those sturdy utility tables such as one sees in restaurant kitchens and drinking a very authoritative ale from pewter mugs the oil man sighed on a subtly happy note brushing alefoam from his mouth as he looked around the huge beamed room i think id live in here if i could move a bed in he said theres something about it that makes me feel relaxed and at peace with myself its a lot of kitchen mitch smiled i know ive never seen anything like it outside of a big hotel and you never will zearsdale said nodding toward the range which ran practically the width of the room three cooks can work at that at the same time you could run five thousand meals off of it in a day if you had to i can believe it you do a lot of entertaining out here i suppose practically none zearsdale shook his head i just happen to like a big wellequipped kitchen i like to see it and be in it im not married and any entertaining i do is usually done at the club but still well i suppose it goes back a long way how about you corley what kind of home life did you have as a boy mitch said that he hadnt had much in the accepted sense of the word we always lived in hotels my father sold various kinds of intangibles and my mother worked with him they must have hit it lucky somewhere along the line pure luck im afraid mitch said deprecatingly i dont know too much about it since i was just a kid at the time but i know they sunk a lot of money in things that never panned out zearsdale poured more ale for him remarking that their backgrounds were not dissimilar we ran the cookshack for drilling crews my mother and i did rather my dad usually got some kind of little job flunkying around the rig a drilling rig runs twentyfour hours a day of course which meant that we had to serve meals around the clock i dont think my mother and i ever got to sleep more than two hours in a row he shook his head remembering his eyes wandering over the rooms extravagantly elaborate equipment we did all the cooking on a fourburner oilstove and we lived and slept in the same room we cooked in we well never mind theres nothing very interesting about drudgery its a good story mitch said id like to hear it well zearsdale shrugged ill keep it short then the owner of a wildcat lease on which they were working had become deeply in debt to them so deeply that by the time the well was drilled in a gusher they owned a large share of the property borrowing money from friends he tried to pay them off for the actual cash amount of his debt when they refused he wangled a secret agreement with the pipeline company the company contracted to take the oil being legally bound to but payment was to be upon delivery at such time that is as the pipeline was connected with the well it soon became apparent that that time was not going to come as long as the zearsdales retained their share there was one delay after another delays that were an obvious ploy in a game of freezeout but there was no money to go into court and prove it my dad was all for settling he wasnt a very strong man im afraid a contemptuous note crept into zearsdales voice but my mother had other ideas he wouldnt go along with them so she and i handled it ourselves we had to you know corley here a great wrong was being done and the law couldnt touch the people who were doing it so we had to i was fourteen years old at the time but its a lesson ive never forgotten that the strong people of the world have an obligation to that world thats why they have been made strong you understand to crack down hard when they see someone getting out of line mmm yes very interesting mitch said but just what did you and your mother do well zearsdale chuckled no one could prove that we did anything corley they didnt even suggest that we did it was put down as an accident and it really raised holy hell you see that was ranching country out there rolling grasslands with cattle grazing as far as the eye could see when the fire broke out and my mother and i were a long way off naturally fire mitch stared at him do you mean you you fire from the seepage around the well it wouldnt have happened if the pipeline had been connected as it should have been so they were held liable for the damages ten million dollars plus another hundred thousand to have the fire put out on top of that we collected our pro rata share of the cost of every barrel of oil that had burned zearsdale chuckled again grimly there was no more stalling after that no more trouble from them or anyone else he had mitch accompany him into a large walkin refrigerator to help select their dinner steaks he cooked and served them expertly and fortunately mitch was very hungry otherwise he might not have been able to ignore the picture which their odor aroused in his mind a picture of charred grasslands littered as far as the eye could see with the smoking carcasses of cattle that had been roasted alive after dinner zearsdale washed and dried the dishes politely but firmly declining mitchs offer to help im an old pro at this corley and i kind of like to keep my hand in god knows ive got plenty of hired help if i didnt choose to do it mitch assumed that the servants had been let off for the evening but zearsdale said they had never been on they need time of their own as well as i do aside from that most of them are getting along in years theyve been with me since my mothers time and i wouldnt want to keep them up late he stripped out of his apron and dried his hands on it shaking his head to mitchs remark that he was very generous with his servants no no im afraid im not corley it isnt possible for a man to be generous when he has a halfbillion dollars which is my estimated net worth hes lost his capacity to be touched by what he does you know he has no personal identification with it theres neither a sacrifice in giving away a million nor a gain in making one now i do try very hard to be fair and i think i succeed most of the time but youll find a lot of people who would disagree such as he grimaced distastefully our cheating friend birdwell the memory of the prematurely gray man his easy laughter the obvious liking of the people around him moved mitch uneasily i cant help feeling sorry for him he said i almost wish id kept my mouth shut about his cheating i feel sorry for him too zearsdale said gravely hes thrown away a fine career hes dragged his family down with him but he did it not i nor you we cant ignore wrong corley and we cant reward people for doing it but he had a good record with you didnt he hed been with you for a long time he had a very good record zearsdale nodded and hed been very well rewarded for it now if i reward a man for being good and believe me i do ive given anonymous help to many people who have no connection with my company then i must punish him for being bad or dont you agree with me mitch hesitated looking into the thicklipped face with with its sharp cold eyes utterly sincere eyes looking away again well he said i should think that would be a very uncomfortable responsibility for you like being god you know yes zearsdale agreed gravely thats exactly what it is like being god the intent eyes remained on mitch for a moment and mitch fought down an almost irresistible impulse to laugh he was halfinclined to believe for that matter that he was expected to laugh that the oil man had been giving him a deadpan ribbing take that bit about setting an oil well on fire now that didnt ring true did it zearsdale suddenly grinned remarking that they didnt have to solve all the worlds problems tonight now did they thought any more about that stock option he added think youre going to be able to pick it up it doesnt look that way at the moment mitch shook his head regretfully i dont fully understand the picture but i seem to be involved in a longterm investment program i couldnt pull out at this point without losing practically everything thats been put into it i see i think i know what you mean zearsdale said casually well do you feel up to a little fun he simulated a man shooting dice like to roll the bones a little whatever you say mitch smiled he followed zearsdale to a sunken recreation room and the oil man got brandy for them from a long saloontype bar then as zearsdale excused himself he wandered over to the dice table it was a regulation gamblinghouse crap table marked off for field pass come craps and so on in the ceiling above it and approximately the same dimensions was a mirror mitch was idly puzzled by it why a mirror over a crap table he picked up the dice from the green felt and made a few throws with them zearsdale returned slapping two thick sheafs of bills together new onehundreddollar bills with the banks band still around them warming up on me huh he laughed roguishly well well see about that want to teelee for firsts each of them rolled one of the dice mitch got a six zearsdale matched it mitch threw a five next time not wanting to look too good zearsdale came back with a six he picked up both dice and shook them put a name to it corley a buck two bucks a couple of bucks will be fine mitch said and he dropped two hundred dollars on the table two into that zearsdale said and he laid down a packet of the hundreds he rolled the dice they came up craps snakeeyes since he had had no point he lost the bet but kept the dice shoot the four bucks he said and came out with a big seven again picking up the transparent cubes he glanced at mitch eight or any part corley eight mitch nodded and he dropped more money on the table zearsdale sixed on the next roll and fell off a few rolls later with a seven he chuckled goodhumoredly tapping the sheaf of bills sixteen into me my friend want to shoot it sure mitch agreed shoot it all he was still intent on making it look good so he rolled a point rather than passing the point was ten and he came right back with a seven he could hardly believe it for a moment how in the hell could it have happened he could think of only one reason and that reason was not nearly so farfetched as it seemed the rich do get richer the majority do often with no apparent effort on their part them that has gets the same quality which led them to their original getting continues to prevail in their favor perhaps there is a better name for that quality than luck but no one has ever heard it of course mitch could admit the possibility that he might have goofed he had done it before to the tune of much bigger losses but always before he had sensed the slipping of his control the momentary shortcircuit between his brain and his fingers this time however he had had no such feelings he had called for a ten certain of its arrival and the devil had jumped up at him still he hadnt lost anything yet he had been shooting with zearsdales money so despite a certain uneasiness his gamblers conviction that skill can never beat luck he agreed to another doubling of the bet sure he said piling bills onto the green felt thirtytwos a nice round number here we go zearsdale said and away he went with a sixfive a sixace a fivetwo a fourtrey an eight another eight and another eleven and then mitch was glancing into his wallet grinning ruefully as casual as though he had dropped a book of matches instead of what was practically the last cent he had in the world i guess thats going to have to be the end of our game he said pleasantly next time ill come a little better prepared now you dont need cash with me zearsdale said just write a check for whatever you like no thats not fair to you mitch shook his head i think it jinxes a man to bet paper against cash well borrow some cash from me then come on now zearsdale urged jovially the games just getting interesting mitch strongly demurred but not nearly so strongly as he had in the matter of the check at last at the oil mans insistence he accepted a loan of ten thousand dollars with it his confidence surged back into him he firmly believed as any gambler would have that zearsdale had given away his luck with the loan he would now be betting against his own money and the good fortune it bad brought him just as he shook the dice there was a sudden clatter from the room above them mitch started surprised at the noise in what must be a wellbuilt house and zearsdale looked upward with dark disgust he muttered something to the effect that if the help wanted to romp around all night they could stay up and work lets see he said coming out for thirtytwo hundred right youre covered mitch nodded zearsdale rolled the dice bounced and spun and laughed at him with a little three he passed them back to mitch and mitch settled down to work he was confident but very careful the goofoftheyear was out of his system now and the magic was back in his hands but he was taking no chances he could only control the dice while he had them and he could not hold onto them indefinitely his first move was to lower the bet to five hundred dollars after all why make work out of fun thus buiwarked against a lucky run by zearsdale he won thirtyfive hundred dollars before deliberately crapping out the oil man passed pointed and fell off mitch went to work again allowing himself only two passes beating all around a point before he made it finally going unlucky after another thirtyfivehundreddollar run he kept it looking good all the way something much harder to do than winning it was drudgery but it paid off some ninety minutes after he had landed in the swamp he was up on the mountain top he was square on the loan and his original stake was back in his pocket and with it was eighteen thousand of zearsdales money he lost the dice at this point the oil man let them lay politely stifling a yawn getting a little tired arent you what do you say we have a drink maybe id just better run along mitch said unless youd rather keep the game going i dont want to quit winner on you if you do zearsdale said oh what the hell thered be another night well be seeing each other again you can depend on it corley now if youre sure you wont have a drink he saw mitch to the door they shook hands and said good night and zearsdale gently closed the door behind him then he went up the stairs his square heavyset body moving as lightly as a cats and opened the door of a small room it was directly above the recreation room part of its flooring had been taken up creating a gape in its approximate center poised to look down through this and through the twoway mirror above the crap table was a motion picture camera as zearsdale entered the room a thin middleaged negro was closing the lid on a round film can he began an immediate apology fear shining out of his liquid eyes mr zearsdale im sure sorry sir terribly terribly sorry sir i just happened to step backwards an i kicked that can it could have spoiled everything zearsdale said mildly might have tipped him off and left me looking like a fool do you think im a fool albert mmister zearsdale the negro paled under his yellowish skin please sir mmister zearsdale ive never let you down have i albert zearsdale went on his voice harshly musical treat you like a white man dont i instead of a jig treat you a lot better than a lot of white men you live just as good as i do and you get a thousand a month for screwing around thats all it amounts to you know you arent worth a thousand cents a month i just give it to you so that you can send your kids to school the negros head bowed on his thin neck he stood trembling and helpless biting his lip blinking back the tears of fear and shame well all right then zearsdale said in a gentler tone i dont let my people down i dont let my people let me down is that the film there yessir yessir thats it the negro snatched up the can and humbly tendered it to his employer think you got him mr zearsdale sir cant be sure but i thinks so zearsdale said that he would make sure he never guessed about anything how are your children getting along albert not quite ready to graduate are they jacob is sir only got one more year of law school amanda she still got two years lef in teachers college amanda zearsdale murmured my mother would have appreciated having a child named after her yessir an jacob he named after you mr zearsdale real proud of it too mr zearsdale yessir real proud im glad to hear it very glad the oil man nodded id hate to think that anyone with my name didnt have pride a man without pride is no good did you know that albert if he doesnt have pride he doesnt have anything not a damned thing to build on i dont like a man like that i may put up with him but i dont like him if he wont stand up for himself if hed rather have a brown nose than a bruised one i dont and cant like him how long have you been kissing my ass albert mmister mister zzearsdale twentythree years right well thats long enough youre fired the bedroom shades were drawn and the dimness of night still prevailed mitch rolled over in the bed his eyes closed in sleep his hands automatically seeking red it had been a very big night a very big very wonderful very wildwild night and even in sleep the wonder and the wildness of it remained with him he relived it again smelling the faint perfume of her flesh again hearing the passionate struggling of her breath again feeling the savage sweetness of her body as it fitted itself to his red he mumbled his hands probing the bedclothes lets lets red a frown spread over his face and the movements of his hands quickened became desperate red red where are and then his eyes flew open and he sat up with a yell red there was a clatter from the bathroon the door banged open and red ran out she had her shoes and stockings on her skimpy panties and her equally skimpy bra the way red was built small but richly full her bras and panties had to be skimpy she had her arms around him in a split second cradling his head against her breast whispering endearments as she begged him to tell her what was wrong mitch explained sheepishly that he had been having a bad dream red kissed him again murmuring an apology for not having been there she started to stand up mitch caught a hand in the waistband of her panties youre here now he said thats even better but but i she broke off forcing a bright smile okay honey just let me get a hairnet on will you no no wait he said quickly you were going out this morning werent you well i was but it can wait after all mitch said firmly that it shouldnt and wouldnt wait she was all fixed up to go out and he wasnt going to muss her up at the last minute i was just teasing you he lied now you run on and ill go back to sleep she did so but he didnt he lay with his eyes closed a little restless perhaps but glad that he had done as he had he thought back to the beginning of their intimacy and the viewpoint she had revealed to him she was a woman she pointed out and he was a man and a man and a woman needed something from each other that they could get from no other source she had known that long ago having grown up with a large family in a oneroom shack there would be times when she would be angry and then he had better keep away from her but otherwise he had only to ask or hint and what he wanted would be freely given why my goodness how else could it be what if she didnt feel like it just then most of the time she probably would because she had never had anyone but him and there was a lot of catching up to do but even if she didnt there would be no problem why should there be for pitys sake it only took a few minutes not nearly long enough sometimes and if a woman couldnt give herself to a man for a few minutes she just didnt love him the bed sank gently mitch started and turned and reds arms went around him ah mitch darling darling darling i couldnt leave with my darling needing me but baby your clothes tear em off of me tear em off and muss me up i can dress again and i can get unmussed and and and mitch an hour later she left on her delayed shopping trip a peculiar kind of shopping trip or one that would have been peculiar for anyone but red every now and then when they had some free time she would go on such an excursion spending the day at it limiting herself to a total expenditure of five dollars and shopping only in dime stores it was a thing she had always dreamed about doing as a child and unlike any adult mitch had ever known she seemed to be able to satisfactorily fulfill her childs dream moving cautiously from counter to counter spending a dime at one and fifteen cents at another and a quarter at another pausing to refresh herself with a frozen lollipop on a stick she would even eat lunch in a dime store a prospect which made mitchs stomach turn then having gorged on some hideous concoction such as wilted lettuce and creamed frankfurters she would return to the attack so timing herself as to have the expenditure of her last dime coincide with the closing of the store she would be very touchy about the armload of bargains she brought home once he had teased her asking if she had left anything in the store and the color had risen in her cheeks and she had called him a mean stupid darned old fool and then heartbrokenly she had begun to cry he had held her cuddled her small body in his arms rocked gently to and fro with her as the great sobs tore through her breast and there were tears in his own eyes as at last he understood the cause of her sorrow for it was his also and perhaps everyones the loss of innocence before it had ever endured the cruel shearing away of all but the utterly practical as pastoral man was caught up in an industrial society she was an extreme case yes as was he but the tenant farmers shack and the hotel room were merely the outer limits of a world which inevitably shaped everyone he did not need to wonder about her thoughts when her schoolbooks had related the adventures of mary jane and her magic pony he suspected that in a different way they had been akin to his as he had read of the joyous conspiracy between bunny rabbit and mr stork so she wept and he wept a little with her not for the idealized dream of things past but for the immutable realities of the present not for what had been lost but for what had never been not for what might have been but for what could never be then having wept she sniffed straightened and smiled and she declared that she was going right out dime store shopping again for everything else might be gone but hope was not and everywhere there was evidence that what could be dreamed could be realized this morning as she always did she had planned an early start and despite the delay on his account it was only a little after nine when she departed some thirty minutes later bathed shaved and dressed mitch was seated on the terrace reading the morning paper while he ate a leisurely breakfast he could not remember when he had felt so content with himself so sure that the world was an oyster on which he had an irrefutable claim houston was a hell of a town hadnt he always said so he had known it was going to be a good trip and it was proving better than good thirtythree big ones from stinker lord and another eighteen from zearsdale fiftyone grand in the kitty and the month was still young of course the outgo had been terrific too but turkelson stepped out on the terrace he hadnt knocked or rung the buzzer he had simply opened the door with his pass key and walked in and taking one look at his face mitch could only thank god that red was absent for the manager was clutching something in his hand a something that could only be one thing mitch got up quickly guided him back into the living room he pushed him down on the lounge and poured a stiff drink for him its all right turk it goddamned well wasnt all right just get that inside of you and calm down turkelson grasped the drink greedily mitch gently relieved his other hand of its burden checks thirtythree thousand dollars worth all redink stamped with the words payment refused he had known what they were but seeing them was another matter he suddenly felt very empty yet there was a cold and growing lump in his stomach he could have yelled with the frustration of it the damnable jinx that seemed determined to turn his best efforts against him and instead he laughed easily and gave turkelson a reassuring wink some fun hey keed is that all they kicked back on you all the manager said my god isnt that enough i mean his legitimate expenses his hotel bill he paid that by check too didnt he oh yeah well that one cleared mitch twelve hundred dollars and something and of course you gave him an itemized bill for it mitch odded well so there it was the lords might not be able to prove the thirtythree grand had gone for gambling they could not prove that winnie hadnt simply kept the money but proof was not an issue here they should have paid the checks it had been unthinkable that they wouldnt pay them but since they hadnt turkelson dumped more whiskey into his glass took a facereddening swig of it and ripped out a curse goddammit mitch they cant get away with that they cant now can they well have to see or rather i will for the present it looks like they have done it but but its not legal they havent got a leg to stand on turk mitch gestured with a trace of impatience what would you like to do turn it over to the hotels attorneys have it dragged through every court in the country and us along with it the lords would do it you know theyve got lawyers up to the yingyang and they like to keep em busy bbut mitch if you knew it was that way mitch snapped that they had both known it was that way what they hadnt known was that it was going to be this way so all right it is this way and lets stop kidding ourselves that it isnt and that they cant do it to us thats like telling a cop that he cant arrest you maybe hes got no right to but he can sure as hell do it turkelson gave him a stricken look mitch immediately softened his voice now its going to be all right he said ill guarantee that it will as things stand now youre thirtythree grand short in your cash how soon do you have to cover it right away the tariff and cash transcripts go to the home office every day of course i could put the checks through for payment again and still show em as a credit but mitch told him he had better not the checks were certain to bounce again and an amount that large might arouse inquiries weve crapped out turk theres nothing to do now but pay off he took out his wallet and counted thirtythree thousand dollars onto the table his mouth tightening unconsciously as he saw how little was left turkelson looked embarrassed mitch i uh im afraid i dont have forget it mitch said just endorse the checks over to me he hadnt expected turkelson to return his ten percent cut of the deal turkelson had a mother whom he doted on a hypochondriacal old battleaxe who had been wasting hospital space and her sons money as far back as mitch could remember troubled but obviously relieved the manager exchanged the checks for the cash this is a hell of a lick for you mitch i know you pull down heavy but are you sure you can take it i dont plan on taking it mitch said oh what are see how fast you can get me a plane out to dallas will you ive got to pack a bag he cut off any further questions by leaving the room an hour later having left a briefly explanatory note for red he was on his way dallas big d the new york of the southwest this is where you find it

around noon when mitch stepped off the plane he checked his bag at the airport and rode the airlines limousine into downtown dallas since the hour did not seem a good one for paying a call on frank downing he stopped in at a bar and grille that he remembered from his last visit to the city but he was not remembered by the personnel of the place sorry sir the bartender idly swabbed the counter with a damp towel its against the law to sell liquor by the drink in texas so what mitch laughed youre a new man arent you wheres jiggs mcdonald theres no one here by that name sir would you like a cup of coffee mitch said angrily that he didnt want any coffee he was tired and worried and hot and getting a drink was suddenly very important to him now come on and give me a bourbon and water he demanded what the hell ive been buying drinks in here for years no sir we dont serve drinks here the hell you dont mitch jerked his head at a man a few stools away whats he drinking if it isnt booze the man turned and looked at him a man with a very broad face and a forehead that ended at his eyebrows he rattled the ice cubes in his glass then arose and moved down the counter to where mitch was sitting what do you want he said coffee or trouble i think ill settle for some air mitch said and he left the place very quickly he felt like nine kinds of a damned fool it was always stupid to start a beef and he had done it without the slightest excuse he was in the worst jam of his career and he needed to be fast and smart smarter and faster than he had ever been before yet he had virtually stuck out his neck and asked to have his head kicked off the incident left him badly shaken up he forced himself to calm down taking a long second look at his mental makeup as a result he cancelled an earlier plan to call on teddy while he was in dallas to appeal to her to be reasonable in her demands teddy had never been reasonable only the wildest graspingatstraws thinking had let him hope that she sight be reasonable now at any rate his problem was an immediate one thirtythree thousand dollars or its approximate had to be had now without it he had no future none that red would be a part of without it he would be broke and just how could a man be broke red would wonder when he has a safedeposit box full of money he hailed a cab the driver looked back over his shoulder as mitch gave him an address too early mister they wont be open this time of day well see mitch said im telling yuh why dont you let me take you to a real live place why dont you mitch said for gods sake take me where i told you to are you going to do it or am i going to have to call frank downing and give him your name and license number and tell him that i cant keep an appointment with him because the cab started with a jerk it moved swiftly without further conversation from the driver for the next thirty minutes until it reached the wroughtiron gateway to downings domain mitch got out there and paid off the driver at this innocuous hour the gate was of course unlocked and he started up the long curving driveway to the house the neighborhood had been a very good one at one time even as it was crowded downhill by the expansion of the business and industrial districts there had been a number of holdouts against the march of progress people who had lived here almost as long as there was a city people with fourstory mansions and grounds that occupied a square block downing had picked up one of these magnificent old houses early in the areas transition period he had restored and renovated it completely and enclosed the grounds with a taste ful tapestrybrick wall aside from that and certain essential modifications to the interior the place was almost unchanged the front door stood wide open the interior hummed with the activity of cleaning people men and women with mops and brooms and vacuum cleaners beyond giving mitch a polite glance or nod they showed no interest in him he was not their problem he would be taken care of by someone whose problem he was mitch met that someone very suddenly he was starting down a small side corridor which led to downings office when a thin tiredlooking man lazed out of the shadows selling something mist he broke off a flicker of recognition in his eyes what dyou say mitch who can kick mitch said they shook hands mitch with his right the other man with his left since his right was in his pocket is the boss in ace you should know ace said he must have told you he would be or you wouldnt be here well im afraid i dont have an appointment i just happened to be in dallas tsk tsk ace clucked his tongue reproachfully be nice now taking mitch by the elbow he guided him up the corridor to downings office there he rapped on the door in a certain way waited a moment and then moved inside with mitch the gambler was seated at his desk sharply dressed as always except for his rolledup shirt sleeves slickhaired and freshly shaven there was a pile of account books and ledger sheets in front of him as well as a small adding machine he was making a computation on it as mitch and ace entered and he did not look up until he had completed it then without a word of greeting or the smallest sign of surprise he asked mitch how he was on income taxes you mean what do i know about them nothing mitch said i always hire an accountant i hire three youd think that would be enough wouldnt you downing shook his head three guys ought to be able to keep one set of tax records and do it right well those people have to be awfully careful frank if they try to claim something youre not entitled to downing said that wasnt what he was kicking about his trouble was that the accountants kept claiming too much i tell em not to by god i tell em to figure everything from the governments angle and then tack on ten per cent but will they do it hell no okay ace ace went out giving mitch an approving little pat on the back mitch accepted the offer to fix himself a drink and downing poured coffee for himself from a thermos carafe taking a sip of it he asked how red was doing i liked that kid by god i liked her how come you didnt bring her with you i didnt know i was coming myself mitch said it was one of those spur of the moment things you see he explained about the checks downing listened expressionlessly and you want me to collect on them for you thats right or ill discount them to you then go ahead and ask me ill smile when i tell you to go to hell youre too good for your own good mitch sighed but what about the fifty grand you collected for yourself what about the sixty grand i spent collecting the fifty grand downing shrugged ive got principles pal but they dont extend to your dough mitch was disappointed but not surprised he said he guessed hed better be running along he had a date with a westbound plane itll get me in big spring tonight and i can drive out to the ranch in the morning save yourself a trip the gambler said i can get your head beat off here for free mitch scoffed that the lords couldnt be that bad lets face it frank this is still texas and its still the twentieth century why would i kid you downing asked theyll push your tonsils right out your tail mitch youll have to take off your pants to brush your teeth youre just saying that to cheer me up mitch said well thanks anyway frank i sit down i wish i could but sit down downing said ive got some questions to ask you mitch sat down not liking it but accepting it wondering at the change that had come over the gambler downing lighted a cigarette studying him through the smoke now lay it on the line for me the lords have let you know they dont want to pay those checks just how do you figure to make em how do you figure to gain by walking right into their own private little kingdom i dont know mitch said its simply something ive got to try why why uhhuh why youre a gambler you dont buck the odds youve been pulling down heavy for years and youve got a lot of years left to go on pulling it down yet here you are pissing it all off on a long shot chance of collecting a few stinking bucks thirtythree grand stinks you know what im talking about downing said youve got a big kitty you can afford to swallow a loss like this now why dont you do it instead of jumping into a beartrap why frank mitch said lightly i didnt know you cared i asked you a question and about you i dont care but i liked that redhead and i know shes nuts about you i figure it would just about break her heart if anything happened to you so i want to know just why youre so damned anxious to get your head parted mitch hesitated seeking a way out knowing that there was none he said quietly im broke frank there isnt any kitty i figured downing nodded and red doesnt know it thats why you didnt bring her with you if she knew the truth shed never let you do this if she knew the truth mitch said shed probably kill me downing shook his head how could she do that when im going to or maybe youve got a real good reason for cheating the nicest kid i ever met ah frank for gods sake lets have it downing snapped start talking and talk fast or by christ you wont be able to youll be at the bottom of the trinity talking to the turtles his saturnine face was white with anger mitch started talking and he talked fast he told the whole story starting with his marriage to teddy then going on to the birth of his son and the discovery that she was a whore he told it all his meeting with red his sincere belief that teddy had died or divorced him her unexpected reappearance and the years of blackmailing that had ensued well thats it frank he concluded thats the story thats where the money went downing loked at him no longer angry so much as puzzled i guess i must have missed something he said like why do you let this halfbaked whore clip you for practically everything but your bean money i told you to keep her quiet and this was the only way you couldnt think of anything better than taking from the woman who loves you to give to the one who hates you well what else mitch broke off looking into the dead flatness of downings eyes no frank he said quietly i couldnt do anything like that who said you had to you could have it done its the same difference i dont play that way frank and why the hell not you dont have to have her killed dammit just a little workingover would do the trick mitch said again that he couldnt do it he agreed that teddy would never be satisfied and that getting out of his present predicament would only postpone the inevitable showdown he agreed that teddy deserved anything that happened to her but still it would be so simple of course so easy and swift and final just a few little words to the right people and then no more trouble from teddy yes there was a chance that you might have trouble with those aforesaid right people and there was every likelihood that solving your problems in this way would become a habit you would become addicted to it substituting it more and more often for talent and intelligence and all the other qualities which distinguished you from the animals you employed until in the end you were identical with them im sorry frank he said and possibly he was sorry the thing would have been so easy maybe im a sap but thats the way i am downing scowled at him then he laughed and spread his hands seemingly accepting mitchs perversity well skip it its your problem and i figure you can work it out need any scratch to travel on no im not completely flat then lots of luck with the lords you can use my name with em if you want to why thanks mitch said thats nice of you frank they shook hands downing bent back over his ledgers and the adding machine began to click and hum mitch went out the door too relieved by the gamblers geniality to consider the reason behind it without knowing it he saw the reason a double one coming toward him as he emerged from the side corridor and entered the main one they were very boyish and gaylooking young men blackhaired oliveskinned trim and slender of build they wore crisp white linen jackets perfectly creased dark trousers and twotone black and white shoes their names their actual names probably the only thing they had ever received from bestforgotten parents were frankie and johnnie and they were fraternal twins they had begun to snicker and whisper to one another at first sight of mitch suddenly when he was only a few feet away they came at him with a rush mitch sweetheart how are you baby now arent you the big beautiful chunk of man they flung themselves on him squeezing his arms slapping his back sniggering and giggling at his obvious discomfiture mitch drew his elbows in then abruptly shot them backwards throwing the brothers against the wall now im telling you bastards he said angrily you ever lay a hand on me and youll pull back a stump aw now baby we just wanted to kiss you get out of my way he snapped and he pushed past them savagely and their taunting sniggers followed him until he had left the corridor appearances to the contrary he knew the fag bit of the two was strictly an act another way of adding to their general obnoxiousness that was how they got their kicks frankie and johnnie by making themselves hateful to people it was another facet of the sadism which made their work a pleasure for them mitch knew quite a bit about them all of it unpleasant what he didnt know was how they had ever managed to live so long he took a taxi back through town and on to the airport after lunch and after wiring red of his plans he caught a plane for big spring in west texas it would be a several hours drive from there to the lord ranch but it was the only nearby town large enough to have a car rental service also he had a friend in big spring a man who just might be of help to him having passed her fortieth year teddy was just about out of the business of turning tricks she didnt need the money for all her wild spending she could not begin to get rid of her blackmail from mitch moreover she could seldom recapture the excitement which the excesses of her body had once given her and never at all unless the buyer of her favors was very young and very handsome unfortunately the young and handsome men who were in the market for prostituted flesh invariably chose to buy it from young and pretty women which whatever else could be said for her teddy was not she still had a good figure not as extravagantly exciting as it had been but good she still had a reasonably good face but forty is forty or rather it is much more than forty for a whore and to the young it is ancient to her own generation of males or those preceding it teddy still appeared a highly desirable woman but just as she was rejected by the young she also rejected the old and she looked upon any man as old who was not a great deal younger than she such old men had always been repugnant to her but what had once been a strong distaste for them was now a phobia they filled her with a sickish terror a feeling of incestuous violation and she would almost choke with revulsion if one even came near her women normally reach their peak of sexual desire in their early forties so teddy still wanted and needed men but they had to be young that was all that she asked of them youth not money she was ready to give them money along with herself if they were young and handsome her need had led her into some unusual experiences once she had hustled a guy on the street a primlooking youngster who wore white socks with black shoes and she had taken him home with her and there of all things he had begged her to go down on her knees with him and pray for her soul another time she had picked up a prospect in a bar and taken him back to the apartment and for a while it looked like he was going to be all right he talked the lingo like an old head and talk could be pretty exciting in itself he sent out for a couple of jugs of good booze and that was all right too teddys appetite for the whiz had increased with her years but the hours went by and she began to itch with her craving and still he didnt get down to business and finally when she was on the point of taking it away from him he gave her his card even teddy recognized the name of the psychiatric clinic and he also gave her fifty dollars and he told her there would be another fifty for her twice each week when she reported to the clinic teddy was outraged an amazing casehistory was she an untapped treasure of sexual source material why why this is a wonderful opportunity for you mrs corley youre still an attractive woman and you have many years to live just give me your cooperation and those years can be very good ones you sneaky sonofabitch yyouyouyouyou sonofa bitch teddy had stopped the outside hustling after that there was just no telling what you might run into she stayed in her apartment and occasionally some former customer would drop by someone who had been very young to begin with and was still acceptably young occasionally when the intervals between customers became too great she would find surcease in a messenger or delivery boy or a bill peddler or or or any youngster who chanced to stray near her door once she had tried to hook the fourteenyearold kid who delivered the newspaper and the little bastard had yelled and run home to his parents there might have been plenty of trouble about it but fortunately for her no one paid any attention to the complaints of niggers today she was standing nude in front of the livingrooms fulllength mirror fresh from her bath and critically admiring her body as she patted it dry with a towel when she heard the knock on the door it was one of those tricky little wiseguy knocks a knock that suggested all sorts of exciting things to teddy hastily she snatched up a robe her flesh already prickling with anticipation she cracked the door open an inch and peered out and then she flung it open wide and delight welled up in her until she almost laughed out loud two of them not one but two and what a two they were blackhaired oliveskinned and oh so beautifully wonderfully young why they hardly looked to be twenty and they were laughing and carrying on like schoolboys their white linen jackets crackled with freshness their shoes gleamed with polish and their trousers were flawlessly cleaned and creased they were fresh and gay and boyishlooking and yet they were obviously very much men they were just what teddy would have ordered if masculinity had been on order she didnt know who had referred them to her the word got around in time and who the hell cared how they had got here all that mattered was that they were here and making the most of every delicious moment of their stay frankie turned the latch on the door he snickered winking at johnnie and johnnie snickered and winked at him then they greeted teddy in unison hi they said hi teddy said hi they said again and then the three of them laughed together at having such good clean fun teddy let the robe slide from her she cast a provocative glance at them and asked who would like to come in the bedroom with her first they said they usually did everything together but teddy put on a little pout at that she said she thought it would be much nicer if they were good little daddies and were nice for their nice little mama and maybe theyd better match for turns sure well flip for it johnnie said whatll you take heads or tails tails frankie said ill take tails too johnnie said now wait a minute teddy laughed happily you both cant take tails they said of course they could tail was what they had come for and teddy laughed again i know but but you have to take different things darlings you see they had been advancing casually as the banter went on moving forward and sideways so that they were now separated by several feet and she was forced to turn from one to the other thus she was looking at johnnie when frankie spoke to her how come he asked snickering youve got your asshole under your nose what teddy gasped what did you he asked you if you were a stud with tits johnnie giggled and she whirled in his direction now look you two dont you frankie suddenly slugged her in the guts she turned white a greenish white the air went out of her with a rushing sound and she doubled slowly and sank down on the floor on her face she felt paralyzed unable even to groan she still made no sound when johnnie gave her a vigorous kick in the butt see he cackled it came up tails we both won shes all ass frankie said how can you tell the front from the back he grabbed her by the hair and pulled her upright thrusting his face close to hers he ordered her to come clean with him you aint really a dame are you huh youre one of those bitchy studs aint you sure shes a dame frankie said look at them bubbies on her johnnie said that that didnt mean anything studs were always buying rubber bubs for themselves so that they could pass for dames look he said see what i mean he swung his hand viciously whipping it back and forth against teddys breasts she groaned at that only breathlessness kept her from screaming but johnnie seemed not to hear her she didnt feel a thing see because they aint the real thing shes just a phoniedup stud you think so huh well maybe frankie suddenly grabbed her by the breasts and twisted again she tried to scream and was stopped with another gutpunch she fainted and when she drifted back into consciousness she was sitting on a burner of the kitchenette stove they were holding hands with her holding them with her fingers bent back toward her wrists they spoke to her conspiratorially as though letting her in on a delicious secret now were going to cook it a little know what i mean honey so if you aint a stud you can holler and well know youre for real naw shed better not holler you better not get me tutz well just do our cooking and she can tell us if it hurt afterwards there was a click as a burner was flicked on it was not the burner under teddy but she was convinced that it was it clicked on and off and each time she could feel the flame lick up her loins she could feel it reach up inside her and she smelled the cooking flesh heard the crackling and the sizzling as the flames consumed her she could not scream there were always those torturously bentover fingers the hands drawn back to slug her in the breasts she could only endure the silent tears flooding over her face her flank muscles jerking convulsively her very womanhood burning burning burning because youre not a dame right a dame dont louse up her husband does she she dont make things tough for her own kid oh no no no no no no no no no no nononono shes good to her husband right she gets herself a nice quiet divorce and she never gives him no more trouble oh yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yesyesyes you want to be a woman or a stud a woman a woman woman woman woman woman woman just short of the ultimate answer there is another one that embodies all the truth and the glory which justifies the life that is about to trade itself for death one may see it but once as the curtain closes on the stage of immediate concern one sees it immediately for what it is though it appears in many guises neither life nor death but something between the two as they suddenly become one there it is the truth and the glory in the space which separates the downrushing body and the uphurtling pavement in the bridge linking the last yellow capsule and the one next to last in the trillionthinch between bullet and brain in all those dark byways where man lifts his foot from life and steps across to death it must be there where else would it be when one has found it nowhere else why else would so many see it there so teddy having notquitedied knew a happiness and a peace she had never known before it was as though she had been drained of her filth as fear drove the hot urine from her body all the shoddiness all the vicious and degenerate urges were gone and she felt clean and reborn lying in bed with the sheets tucked modestly around her she looked up lovingly at frankie and johnnie and they beamed down at her they felt very good themselves as comfortably satiated as though they had used her in a way she had so often been used they were also pleased at having done their job so well now about that divorce honey oh im going to get it right away oh i can hardly wait to do it oh i yeah sure sure you will baby but what about money you got the dough to do it on teddy babbled happily that she had lots and lots of money and she mentioned the amount the smiles of frankie and johnnie faded and they exchanged a look of bitterness it was of course out of the question for them to take the dough downing would find out about it he had an unbelievable talent for finding out the closestkept secrets of his minions and since he had not explicitly told them to rob teddy they would be charged with bad conduct and how about that anyway downing had instructed them only to scare the hell out of teddy to see to it that she never again made trouble for mitch that was all so that was all they could do but it was really a hell of a note wasnt it here was this lousy pig with a mattress full of dough and they wait a minute wait just a peanutpickin minute they couldnt whip her for the loot but did that mean they couldnt perform an act of simple justice did it mean that they had to leave the pig loaded while they fine young men that they were were in relative want frankie and johnnie exchanged another glance their eyes bright with malice then they turned back to teddy and her smile abruptly faded and she began to tremble with terror thats not your dough frankie said coldly you squeezed it out of mitch bbbut youre a stud johnnie said a broad dont steal from her own husband bbut but youre goin to give it back to him frankie said its his and youre goin to give it back she better give it back johnnie said she better move real fast about it teddys mouth worked her two minds conscious and unconscious shouting contradictory orders she must make no futher trouble for mitch that thought had been firmly implanted in her yet what they were demanding would most certainly make trouble do it dont do it stay away from mitch go near mitch what what the boys loomed over her threateningly classic examples of the danger of a little knowledge she tried to explain incoherent with fear her two minds muddling one another and frankie and johnnie were deaf to her words whatre you tryin to pull pig sure you dont make no trouble for mitch what about it whats givin him back his dough got to do with making trouble i i i it was wrong it was right wrong whatever they said she likes the flame frankie said all these studs like the flame he flicked on his cigarette lighter darted it at her she started to scream and johnnie slapped her in the breasts how about it pig he said hows it going to be you going to take that dough back or not teddy said oh yes yes yes yes yes yes yes she went to houston that afternoon mitch was out of town of course so she gave the money to red big spring the metropolis of nowhere the beginning of far west texas big spring oil wells refineries tool and die works machine shops oilwell supply houses big hotels big banks big stores big people in every sense of the word walk softly here stranger be nice it takes time to get acquainted what appears to be a hardnosed attitude is simply frankness and economy of speech a merchant may tell you to go somewhere else if you dont like his prices but its a friendly suggestion not an insult a resident may stare at you a long time before answering a question and he may simply shake his head and not answer at all but he isnt being impolite he wants only to think over his answer carefully and naturally it would be rude to show no interest in you and if he finally decides he has nothing to say then how can he say anything its an attitude born of the prairies of the loneliness of the infrequent necessities for speech since there were so few to speak to it was born of the cattle industry the distantly separated ranches the need for deeds rather than words the wisdom of carefully looking over all strangers you see big spring was a cattle town not so many years ago just another wide place in a dusty road a town like any other such town built around the traditional courthouse square its streets drifting with dust its ironawninged buildings baking under the incredible heat of summer icepainted with the north pole blasts of winter that was how it looked when the two wildcatters first saw it like the assend of far nowhere the town for its part looked upon them with little more favor the town had seen wildcatters prospectors for oil before and this pair just didnt fit the picture there was first of all their drilling rig a cabletool rig naturally since the rotary had not then been perfected it was one of those big star machines a socalled portable rig which occupied two railroad flatcars with its accessory equipment none of the harumscarum wildcatter breed had ever owned such a rig an outfit worth a notsosmall fortune and these two were the last people in the world who should have owned it they were a middlingold man and his son the father wore the unmistakable stamp of defeat a man who had drilled one dry hole too many the kid looked mean and snotty and very sick and he was all three and then some into the rig and the job it had to do the old man had sunk his home his furniture his insurance policies every nickel he could beg and borrow that still left a hell of a hump to get over for an outfit and a job like this so the kid had kicked in for it the kid was a loner hed been one almost since the time he was old enough to walk some things had begun to happen to him about then that shouldnt happen to kids and maybe they could have been avoided and maybe they couldnt have but it was all the same to him he didnt ask for excuses he didnt give any as far as he was concerned the world was a shitpot with a barbedwire handle and the further he could kick it the better he liked it as far as he was concerned he had plenty owing to him and he was hell on wheels at collecting he was now nineteen years old he was suffering from tuberculosis bleeding ulcers and chronic alcoholism rig hands drillers and tooldressers accompanied the old man and his son huge tractors were hitched onto the rig and it was hauled eighteen miles out of town to the drill site they had no road to haul it over of course a road had to be made straight out across the tumbling prairie up hills and over streams through hubhigh mud and sand it took a lot of money they were in over their ears before they were ever rigged up they started to drill and the hole went down a hundred and twentyfive feet and every inch of it was a highpriced waste of money for the driller hadnt known his stuff and hed got a crooked hole and you cant set casing in a crooked hole you cant when youre using cable tools go down very far before your drill bit and stem drag on the side wildcats are always jonahs youre in unexplored territory and you never know what youre going to get into until youve already got into it and its too damned late this particular wildcatter had enough hard luck for a hundred wells the boiler blew up the rig caught on fire the mast snapped the tools were lost in the hole a dozen times the drill cable bucked and whipped cleanly slicing off a tooldressers head the kid announced that he had gone his limit he had nothing left but his ass and his pants and they both had holes in them his father said that they would manage some way and he took over the financing from then on the well finally got drilled it wasnt a gusher but it was a very respectable producer diffidently the old man asked his son what plans he had for the future you mean what do i want to be when i grow up the kid said sarcastically whats it to you anyway when were you ever interested in what i wanted to do son son the old man shook his head sadly have i really been that bad oh hell i guess not but im just not much on talking about things you talk about what youre going to do you never get it done the father guessed that it was probably a slam at him he had possibly always indulged too much in talk i suppose he said timidly youve been counting on having a lot of money the kid said why not theyd brought in a good well and they had hundreds of offsetting acres under lease conservatively they were worth several million dollars but ill settle for a hundred and eightytwo thousand i wont live long enough to spend any more than that a hundred and eightytwo why that particular figure son ive been keeping a little black book since i was seven years old there are one hundred and eightytwo names in it one for every rotten bastard whos given me a hard time ive shopped around and i can get them bumped off for an average price of one thousand dollars son the father shook his head aghast what happened to you how can you even think of such things thinking about it is all thats kept me alive the kid said i can die happy knowing that im taking all those bastards to hell with me the father decided that it was a good time to give his son the word the kid listened with a kind of gloomy satisfaction as one accustomed to seeing his dreams washed down the john so we dont own anything huh you hocked it all to get the well drilled im sorry yes what about the rig and the tools all gone the trucks our car everything goddam the kid said those one hundred and eightytwo bastards could be dead right now for what this well cost he had a right to be pretty damn sore about it he felt but somehow he couldnt be somehow he wanted to howl with laughter because when you thought about it you know it was really funny as hell he started to take a drink and then decided that he didnt want any he lighted a cigarette noting wonderingly that he no longer had ulcer pains he coughed and spat in his handkerchief and there was no blood in the spit my god he told his father and there was awe in his voice im afraid im going to live he and the old man walked out of town together they couldnt afford anything but the ankle express with the discovery of oil big spring was already burgeoning into a city the old man turned and looked back at it from its outskirts and there was pride in his defeated eyes we did that son he said you and i we caused a city to bloom in the wilderness weve made history we should have stood in bed the kid said but then he laughed and gave the old man an affectionate slap in the back for his physical health was not all that had improved during the past two years out there on the prairies where time had stood still for endless eons out there where nature loomed large and man was small he had gotten a new perspective on himself and his once allconsuming problems had shrunk in size and he had grown proportionately in the only way that growing matters out there he had discovered that a man could be much less and much more than the sum of his moments and that what had been done could be undone by enduring arm in arm he and the old man went down the road together not into the sunset for that was behind them but into the dawn or where the dawn would have been if it had been that time of day they went down the road together the old man and his kid the kid became a man and he got rid of the book with the one hundred and eightytwo names getting rid of a lot else along with it and it was the last book he ever compiled of that kind thats quite a story art mitch laughed is that really the way little big spring became big big spring you hintin that im a liar his friend demanded crustily and then he also laughed well thats pretty much the way it happened he said its a middlin true story no story can be gospel true unless youve got all the facts and the time to tell em which is two gots i aint got you figure on savin that bottle for yourself or passing it like a gent mitch chuckled and passed the bottle of sour mash his friend downed an enormous drink of it without the slightest change of expression and began rolling a brownpaper cigarette he was eighty years old mitch knew and he looked a healthy sixty he was an excowhand exgambler exrancher and exbanker he decribed his present vocation as galchasm and boozetastin they were sitting in mitchs room in the towns leading hotel the old man could have written a check for the full value of the hotel and the block it stood in yet he pinched out the coal of his cigarette and put the butt into the pocket of his threadbare shirt mitch had seen many old men do the same thing in these farout western cities men with permanently bowed legs and faces as brown as saddle leather and fortunes so large they could not even spend the interest on them they sat around the hotel lobbies in big spring and midland and san angelo reading newspapers that other people left behind squeezing two or three smokes out of the same brownpaper cigarette but it was not because they were stingy they had simply grown up in an era and an area where there was little to buy and few opportunities for buying the same newspaper might be passed around a bunkhouse for months because a newspaper was a rare thing and something to be treasured similarly a man was careful with his tobacco for it might be a very long time before he could replenish his supply that was why the old men were as they were because of the way they had lived as younger men because they had reversed the usual order of things learning the value of everything with suitably little regard for its ephemeral meaningless price lets see now said art savage mitchs friend what was we talkin about before you hid the whiskey and got me all confused mrs lord mitch grinned and since when could anyone hide whiskey from you dont get smart with me bub but about gidge lord gidge parton i always think of her used to tomcat around with her a lot before she married win lord a leetle bit youngern i was but that didnt seem to make her no never mind dont know just what might have come of it if win hadnt edged in on me because that gidge was really a lot of gal savage paused his faded blue eyes contemplating the past and its mighthavebeens mitch brought him out of it by passing the whiskey bottle so you havent seen her in recent years he suggested who the hell says i aint savage demanded sure i seen her twothree months after she was married we started gettin together again didnt feel quite right about it in a way its always kind of consciencesome triflin with another mans wife yknow and it aint ever been healthy in texas but gidge wanted to and with win boozin and whoring all the time i didnt feel too bad about it we finally broke it up when she got pregnant reckon idve broke it up before then if id had my ruthers because a lot of wins nastiness had rubbed off on her and she could run him a close second for lowdown what the hell are you grinnin about anyways me mitch said innocently well nothing really it just occurred to me that perhaps you were dont you say it savage said grimly dont you dast say it anytime i see a thing like winnie lord jr coming out of a place i been in ill pinch its head off hes wins begettin and dont you ever think he aint the spittin image of him you ever seen the two of them together at the same age you couldnt have told em apart mitch murmured reassuringly he declared that he had never seriously thought that a fine man like savage could father such a skunk about these checks art what do you think would be a good approach on them sue have to pay off in the long run on good paper mitch explained that suing was out of the question savage scratched his ankle with the toe of his boot and reached for the whiskey again it was just possible he said that suing wouldnt do any good anyway fella sued he might find a long line ahead of him come tthink of it thats probably why them checks wasnt paid mitch the way gidge is feelin the squeeze she aint paying nothing she can possibly get out of yes mitch said im not sure i follow you art whats so hard to follow the ranch is in trouble money trouble an it couldnt happen to a nicer outfit but how could it be for gods sake over a million acres of land and two or three hundred producing oil wells and savage told him how it could be because the ranch didnt end with its million acres it stretched all the way to new york and on down to south america and even over into iran and the far east the ranch holdings included chain stores and apartment houses and shipping and manufacturing companies and so damned many other things that even gidge lord probably didnt know what they were oh sure shes got people runnin the shebang for her whole office buildin full of em in new york i understand but the best people in the world cant help you none if you dont listen to em and they sure cant make a dollar be in moren one place t once savage paused chuckling with grim satisfaction told her a long time ago she was spreading herself too thin just tryin to be friendly you know and you know what she told me something pretty unpleasant i suppose it was oh it was unpleasant all right not to mention downright dirtymouthed had a mind to repeat it to her last week when she paid me a call but i just dont believe in talking that way in front of ladies even if they aint savage revealed that gidge lord had tried to borrow money from him the banks were loaded with her paper and would take no more and she was now beating the bushes for private money she needed twenty million or so she had told savage and she was short more than half of it i told her if she was so hard up shed better clamp down on winnie but ocourse shed never do it probly couldnt short of killin him and anyways i guess what he blows in doesnt stack up to a lot when you need as much as she does i suppose not mitch said particularly when he can have so much fun without paying anything for it oh sure theyre real fond of doing that they finished the bottle the old man drinking most of it mitch saw him to the door and they shook hands well thanks for dropping in art lets get together again when im out this way anytime savage said you just whistle an ill come arunnin did i tell you anything helpful helpful uhuh for when you go out to the ranch tomorrow well im not sure but then ill tell you somethin now dont go he nodded firmly and went down the hall to the elevator very erect swaying with the teeter of his boots at eight oclock the next morning mitch started for the ranch his first forty minutes or so were on the highway and easy going he turned off it onto a county road which twisted sharply and constantly at its township lines and ended abruptly after some twenty miles at the side of a small mountain a threestrand barbedwire fence ran along the base of the mountain from the top wire a rusted tin sign swung gently in the incessant west texas wind lord keep out the fence followed a rutted trail which led off across the rolling grasslands in a southwesterly direction mitch turned into the trail wincing as the cars crankcase dragged dirt he drove very carefully running in low gear much of the time the car bounced and pitched and a ribbon of steam seeped out from under the hood the lords had little interest in roads they traveled by plane and helicopter a spur railroad led into the ranch from its other side bringing in what they wanted to buy and taking out what they wished to sell since they seldom used roads themselves then naturally they would not contribute to their upkeep county and district tax boards had long since given up trying to make them in less than an hour mitch was forced to stop to let the car cool off with the hood raised he leaned against a fender and mopped the dust from his eyes he looked down the shambling line of the fence the tin warning signs swinging from it at fiftyfoot intervals lord keep out and he thought okay so i believe you on perhaps every fifth or sixth fence post was the bleached skull of a steer grisly testimony to the truth that ranching is not a gravy train one of these mementos grinned at mitch from a few feet away the horns were tilted at a rakish angle and the fleshless jaws hung open as though speaking to him he turned away from it suddenly he said aloud my god what am i doing here and he had no sensible answer to the question he had come here because he didnt know what else to do because there was always a chance in the seemingly most chanceless situation not much of a chance maybe a much better chance doubtless of getting your butt kicked off but there was a chance and if he could see it and act on it he could still stay even with the game he could still have red and if he missed it that oneinamillion chance well nothing would matter much anyway he got back in the car and drove on rather grimly his jaw set fighting down the insistent queasiness of his stomach this had to be done the long shot risk had to be taken but all his gamblers instincts cried out against it and all his years of civilized living shrank from it it had been a very long time since he had traveled in circles where clobbering was an accepted practice he wondered if he was still up to it and he guessed he would find out very soon the trail rose gently for a mile or more then dropped into a softly swelling flatland the brutal scruboaked cliffs and rocky hummocks were abruptly gone and the emptiness around them was gone and the land was filled with the evidence of life pumping jacks and stubderricks marched across the countryside telephone poles heavy with crossbraces and cables appeared out of nowhere whitefaced cattle moved over the grass like a slowly unrolling carpet spread out in an endless array of thoughtfully munching jaws and lazily switching tails until they were lost in the horizon far off to the right were the glimmering white outlines of the ranch buildings behind them a plane arrowed up into the sky and disappeared in its brilliance the trail took another rightangle turn a mile later it ended at a cattlecrossing and gate immediately inside the gate blocking the graveled road which stretched up into the ranch stood a jeep it carried the thick aerial of a radio transmitter a young cowhand sat in it talking over the phone his white teeth flashing occasionally as he laughed he gestured a greeting at mitch with the barrel of his rifle then pointed it shaking his head as mitch started to get out of the car mitch stayed where he was a couple of minutes later the cowhand hung up the phone and came over to him he wore a gunbelt and gun the first cowhand mitch had ever seen so equipped he also kept his rifle with him he thrust his towcolored head through the window his mouth parted in a wide grin and said uhhah mitch explained that he wanted to see mrs lord and her son and the grin it was meaningless mirthless widened winnie aint here whatd you want to see his maw about its a personal matter too personal to tell me im afraid so yes the cowhand moved his rifle scratching it against the side of the car and pointed with it thats the road back to town mister the same one you came in on mitch told him about the checks he told him in complete detail for the man would be satisfied with nothing less then he sat back to wait his heart thumping a little as the cowhand telephoned from the jeep the call lasted a long time or so it seemed to mitch and the cowhand seemed to be laughing through most of it at last he hung up backed the jeep off the road and motioned for mitch to come ahead mitch did so bumping across the cattle guard the man signalled to him again and he stopped abreast of the jeep white teeth flashed at him straight ahead mister cant miss it thanks mitch said thanks very much dont turn off nowheres start strayin youll get shot mitch nodded and drove on the road peaked a long almost indiscernible slope and then he was looking down into the orderly chaos of the ranch buildings they were arranged in a series of ragged openend squares with the white adobe ranch residence in the center it was two stories and roofed with heavy red tiles a tileroofed veranda or gallery extended across its length at the first floor level shading the homey assortment of lounging chairs beneath it a hum of activity arose from the buildings ambiguous blending together the roar of a jeep the cracking of a radio the clatter and click of machinery voices in blurred conversation an outburst of muted laughter a loud shout of what the goddam hell are you ending with the sudden roar of a tractor men moved in and out of the lanes between the buildings a man carrying a saddle over his shoulder two men driving a jeep two others lugging some heavy metal object a whiteaproned old man flung dishwater from a distant window and a man rose up from beneath the window and shook his fist angrily mitch parked the car in the packeddown gravel of the courtyard he got out and started across the patchy grass lawn to the house then turned as a voice hailed him corley off to the left immediately beyond the inside square of buildings was a stub derrick the site apparently of an abandoned or pumpedout well since no jack or lines ran to it two ranch hands and a girl had emerged from its sheetiron enclosure the girl striding in the lead she raised her hand as mitch turned indicating that it was she who had called he waved back a little diffidently and started toward her she must be a member of the family no woman employee would be out consorting with cowhands yet he had heard of no female lords aside from mrs lord and he would have heard of this girl she was so tanned that he couldnt tell what her face looked like in fact he hardly gave her face a passing glance he looked at her body and he could not look away for the girl seemed naked naked yes despite the riding pants and the blouse because that was the way she was built you could have bundled her up in a dozen overcoats and she still would have been wearing nothing and she would have known it and liked it because she was built that way too she was a bitch with her tail up she came toward him bitchily the svelte hips swaying with promise the extravagant breasts bobbling and jiggling and the heat welled out of her from fifty feet away he tore his gaze away from her the thrusting lewdness of her body he rubbed his eyes as though rubbing the sun out of them and then her boot heels clicked on the packed earth and he at last looked into her face looked and was almost sick for what he had thought was a girl was a woman an old woman which meant that she had to be gidge lord her hair was not blonde but a dirty gray the face beneath it was burned to a deep brown withered and shrunken as though by some savage headhunters rite her eyes were so pale that they seemed colorless all milky whites he could hardly see her mouth until she opened it only a brown wrinkle in the deeper brownness of her flesh she held out her hand mitch started to extend his and she viciously slapped it away the checks corley lets have them ill be glad to mitch said in exchange for thirtythree thousand dollars give the cowhands had lounged up to her sides and a little past forming the ends of a halfcircle they stood with their thumbs looped in their belts their jaws chewing lazily as they held him in a cold unwinking stare mitch shrugged lightly managing a surprisingly cheerful grin well he passed over the checks as long as you insist taking out his cigarettes he made a gesture of passing them around he beamed confidence and goodnature at the two men trying to bring them under the sway of his personality fighting with the only weapons he had the men remained exactly as they were thumbs looped in their belts eyes staring unblinkingly acknowledging his existence only as something potentially interesting but thoroughly unimportant mrs lord examined the checks one by one then she ripped them to pieces and hurled the pieces into mitchs face you filthy prick you know what we do to pricks around here ill bet youre going to tell me mitch said im going to show you what do we do with pricks al there was a low chuckle from behind mitch put em in a hole maam mitch whirled but he wasnt fast enough nothing would have been fast enough there was no running from a spot like this the rope sang and dropped over him it jerked and he flew off his feet his head banged down hard on the stony dirt and a million skyrockets went off at once and he passed out when he came to he was being hoisted up on the floor of the stub derrick his feet were firmly tied now although his hands and arms were free he pushed himself up rubbing the dirt out of his eyes a couple of men were prying up a square of planks in the middle of the floor two others were stringing a block and cable in the derrick another a very young man was standing with his arm around mrs lord his hand patting one of her flaring buttocks they saw mitch looking at them and laughed but they moved a little apart mitch massaged his aching head and glanced up into the rig as he did so one of the men there swung out and down riding a cable he came down and mitch suddenly went up shot up feet first into the derrick he went up about thirty feet then he came gently down until he hung poised over the gaping hole in the derrick floor gidge grabbed him by the hair thrust her hags face close to his want to guess what youre going to get now think you can guess hmm but mitch didnt need to guess he knew practically all modern oil wells are sunk with rotary rigs which drill with bits attached to pipe as the well deepens more lengths of pipe are added thus making a hole a relatively small one which is the same size from top to bottom old oil wells however any well drilled say before were drilled with cable tools which made a hole by dropping a bit from a string of cable this method required the frequent setting of casing to protect the drilling tools from caveins naturally each string of casing had to be smaller than the preceding one this also meant of course that where a deep well was contemplated the hole at the top had to be very large the hole mitch was dangling over was old and huge the socalled big hole of a deep test but no well had been drilled two hundred feet down the bit had struck an unexpected vein of granite and there was nothing to do but pull out and try another location the lords had left the hold unplugged planning just such use for it as it was now being put to their reputation being what it was however they had not had an opportunity to use it for a long time mitch went down through the hole in the floor and into the hole in the ground he did not struggle it was useless his one hope was to make it as simple and painless as possible he held out his hands in front of him like a diver keeping his body stiff and straight going down crooked or twisted could result in serious injury he sank into the yawing darkness smoothly brushing but not scraping the sides of the hole the blood rushed to his head and his brain roared with it but he kept a firm hold on his nerves this was going to be damned bad but nothing more than that he wasnt going to die they werent going to kill him he held onto that thought as he went deeper and deeper into the hole repeating it over and over they wont kill me they wont kill me and he was wrong they were going to kill him unintentionally water had seeped into the hole since its last usage no one knew it it couldnt be seen from the surface but it now stood more than half full of water mitch went into it headfirst and it closed over him frank downing the gambler had never been a sound sleeper too many of his years particularly the early ones had been lived in a world where sound sleepers suffered fatal accidents he was a considerable distance removed from that world now of course but habit was strong in him and he still slept in starts and snatches feeling no impelling urge to sleep until it was too late and he had to get up he liked to have a minimum of six cups of coffee before breakfast with and after the meal he would have a minimum of six more cups by which time he was prepared to be reasonably affable to people in his own way of course providing he felt them deserving of affability he had never felt that frankie and johnnie were deserving of it he had to use them yes but what they deserved in his opinion was what they were so fond of dishing out and he had secretly yearned for an excuse to give it to them for a very long time since his evenings and nights were extremely busy they had not been able to report back to him on the day of their visit to teddy oh they could have if they had tried but they had wanted to make the job look harder and more timeconsuming than it was so they had delayed until the following morning it was the morning after one of downings most sleepless nights moreover being anxious to make a good impression they arrived early for their appointment thus finding him several cups of coffee short of his absolutely essential dozen then they told him what they had done giggling and snickering very pleased with themselves and his hand jerked at the news and he slopped an overflowing cup of coffee on himself he caught their smirks and winks as he tried to mop up with a napkin but no one would have guessed that he did he seemed wonderfully goodhumored as though losing a nights sleep and having his sacred wakingup schedule disrupted and spilling coffee all over three hundred bucks worth of clothes and having his strict orders disastrously emended by a couple of punks as though all these had been delightful and heartwarming experiences goddammit he thought that blows it for mitch it could have been a cinch and these stupes have to act smart he smiled genially at them and complimented them on their astuteness smart he said yes sir that was plenty smart funny i didnt think of it myself oh well johnnie excused him patronizingly a man cant think of everything mmmhmm downing murmured a man cant think of everything thats pretty shrewd johnnie ill have to remember it anyway frankie cut in you didnt know that she had all that loot i guess you would have if youd stopped to think about it but but there you were downing said a man couldnt think of everything guess ill have to hire you boys to help me do my thinking he added excuse me a minute will you he left them briefly returning he sat down in front of them on the edge of his desk his hands were thrust in the pockets of his coat each hand gripped a roll of quarters by the way he said how did you boys happen to know mitchs address oh she knew teddy knew where to take the dough johnnie smirked keeping tabs on mitch was kind of her business but shes in a new business from now on frankie snickered downing jerked his head at them confidentially drawing them in close got something funny to tell you guys youll get a bang out of it he grinned widely his hands tightening on the rolls of quarters mitch is away from houston for a couple of days anyone that called on him would see the gal he lives with a real hottempered babe who doesnt know that he frankie and johnnie didnt wait to have it spelled out for them they flung themselves backward trying to make a break for it downings loaded fists lashed out he got them both in their pretty pans with a lightning swift onetwo then as they spun he swung with a doublearmed backhand again connecting with such force that they crashed against opposite walls of the room they were still out to the world some ten minutes later when ace came in he gave them a raisedbrow look shook his head deprecatingly at downing you shouldnt let guys sleep in here boss it dont look good theres something in the atmosphere i guess downing said they dozed off right while i was talking to em well that was kind of rude ace said frowning at the recumbent youths hows your hearing these days boss not so good the last guys you bounced around in the alley i couldnt hardly hear it at all ace expressed alarm after all he pointed out the alley was only a hundred yards away you suppose we ought to run another test downing thought that they should ace awakened frankie and johnnie he was very good at waking people even those who seemingly would never waken again the boys were on their feet in a matter of seconds howling and dodging and making many of the same kinds of noises that teddy had made ace took them out in the highwalled alley now that said downing a hundred yards away is a test darkness black wet no dark light and smothering strangling and breath wind downup up up biting slicing legs burning yank high low racing air and light light joggle run bump slam sound of slam mumbles and shouts voices light light breath and coughing strangling burning chest and voices whiskey coughing brush knock away mitch kept his head ducked lips clenched against the pressing whiskey he kept his eyes closed peevishly mumbling with simulated incoherence fully conscious but wanting time to size things up he was soaked dripping with the oily slime from the well several people were around him cowhands seemingly mumbling and fumbling as they tried to revive him he was sitting slumped on a leather lounge the room he was in was apparently a large one for gidge lords voice drifted to him from a considerable distance away oh no certainly not theres nothing at all wrong he just stepped outside for a just a moment please i believe hes coming in right now she laid the phone down on the desk as mitch at last opened his eyes frantically motioning for the cowhands to get out she hastened across to him im sorry as hell corley i swear to god i didnt know that hole was mitch weaved to his feet weaved deliberately there was something that had to be figured out here the reason for mrs lords alarm her downright panic the clue that might lead to that oneinamillion chance please corley she was hanging onto his arm her magnificent torso moving against his as she guided him toward the desk dont crumb me with him please dont knock me for gods sake tell him everythings okay and i swear ill she smiled at him with her leathery face the milky eyes pleading beaming good will mitch picked up the phone and spoke into it a harsh strangely musical voice came over the wire and immediately he had the clue to the riddle the banks were loaded with gidge lords paper they would lend no more so she had been beating the state of texas for big private money and one of the most obvious prospects for a huge private loan a man who would instantly know the worth of the lord holdings and see the opportunity in their mismanagement was mr zearsdale mitch said its good to hear from you so soon its nice of you to say so zearsdale purred your sister told me i might catch you there mitch said that the call had come just in time he might have been gone in another minute zearsdale said he was glad to hear it as long as youre through there you can come to a little party im giving tonight your sister wants to come if its agreeable with you well thanks very much mitch said what eight oclock hang on for a moment will you he started to turn to mrs lord zearsdales suddenly sharp voice stopped him is there some trouble there mr corley be frank with me please the ranch doesnt have a reputation for friendliness well mitch hesitated i suggest that you tell mrs lord ive invited you to a party at my home tonight tell her ill be very disappointed if youre not there well the fact is mitch said we have a little business to wind up it could be wrapped up in no time if we could get right down to it but then tell her to no let me talk to her mitch passed over the phone as she took it spoke into it almost cringingly he added her attitude to zearsdales peremptory one and arrived at the only possible conclusion she already had her loan or a big part of it made on demand notes naturally since zearsdale would accept no term paper in a situation that might go sour overnight so she was over a barrel gidge lord was she had to be nice very very nice or she would take a painful pecuniary paddling right on her astonishing ass she handed back the phone smiling grimacing rather literally groveling in appeasement mitch winked at her and she went to a wall safe begun turning the combination mr corley zearsdale said again im sure mrs lord understands the situation now im sure she does too mitch said thanks very much not at all by the way ive got a jet over in midland give you a ride home if you like thanks mitch said but i may as well use the other half of my round trip ill tell you what i might do if it wont inconvenience you yes its a long rough ride back to big spring why dont i check with you from there in two or three hours so that youll know i havent uh havent had any accidents you do that zearsdale caught his meaning immediately you do that mr corley they hung up after a moment or two of polite nothings mrs lord closed the safe and came back to the desk she counted out thirtythree thousand dollars and pushed it across to him would you like to clean up a little i can give you some other clothes too mitch said that sounded good to him but his immediate need was for a drink and a cigarette she provided them quickly also pouring a drink for herself then spoke to him nervously as he settled back in his chair maybe youd better sort of hurry hmm youve got to be back in town in a few hours oh mitch took a deliberate taste of his drink you think i might have trouble getting there youll get there all right youll get there if i have to carry you on my back mitch chuckled wickedly he wasnt inclined to pour it on anyone when they were down but gidge lord wasnt just anyone she was damned near a murderer his he felt entitled to needle her a bit im a professional gambler he pointed out i come out here alone and face up to an army of your thugs and i make you pay off like a slot machine i think the experience should prove very good for you mrs lord so she left it at that not saying any of the things that she might have said that zearsdale probably didnt know he was a gambler that it was zearsdale and zearsdale alone who was making her behave she had had to take a beating that was the fact and to hell with the why youre not even curious mitch teased you dont wonder why a man like zearsdale would go to so much trouble over me no she said flatly im not curious corley but maybe you should be mitch got back into big spring early in the afternoon after checking with zearsdale he shucked out of his borrowed duds took a long hot bath and redressed in some he had brought with him then he called red asking her to meet him when he arrived in houston she sounded a little cool and strained but that he thought was natural enough he had left town without giving her a chance to object and she would have objected to a trip as perilous as this one now that he was out of danger she meant to punish him for the scare he had given her he would have some pretty tall explaining to do he decided or maybe since this had been such a foolishly dangerous thing to do it was best not to try to explain just to say that hed lost his temper when the checks bounced so off hed gone into the wild blue yonder knowing it was crazy but doing it anyway red could understand a loss of temper who could understand better than red the fact was he was just feeling too damned good to be worried about anything he had dinner on the plane the stewardess was a dallas girl immediately stamped as such by her smartness her glossy sophistication she bantered with the man seated next to mitch a resident of fort worth no yokel by any means but a little on the drawly side hearty and easygoing of manner mitch listened to them the voices the attitudes of east and west and behind him he heard a south texas cotton grower disputing with a north texas wheat farmer and he was struck as he always was by the amazing amalgam the populous paradox that was this his native state between areas there were not only differences in accent but in language itself a pond for example became a tank biscuits were bread cookies were cakes afternoon was evening carry meant escort dirty was nasty and meat was automatically construed to mean pork unless qualified as red meat there were differences in dress too many to be noted yet intermingling with one another in these days of rapid transportation there were differences in outlook from one area to another and these positively did not intermingle in houston no negro was admitted to a white restaurant not even if he was a foreign potentate in austin there were negroes on the faculty of the university of texas in one city a minority group had absolutely no voice in municipal government in another the minority spoke loud clear and effectively that was texas that was not texas because it was a generalization and you could seldom if ever generalize about texas in so doing you were apt to be guilty of the very narrowness you deplored you were in a boat nottoodistant from that of the foreign viewers of popular american films people who knew us to be a nation of sexpots and gunslingers stopping only long enough to get sloppy drunk as we went about the business of shooting and screwing one another you could still find texans who made a brag of ignorance they hadnt never read no book but the bible they hadnt never been out of the state in their lives the fault was probably rooted far back in the history of the state in an official attitude promulgated by backwoodsy legislators which saw little reason to keep a child in school if his folks didnt and who believed that eleven grades of school were quite enough for any youngster texas had raised its educational standards a great deal in recent years but some of the old ideas still lingered and they were by no means all bad although some people might dispute this newcomers often objected to the schools seeming intrusion into the province of the parent their emphasis on manners and decorum but their objections went unheeded and after a time they were usually withdrawn before he was ever taught his abcs the texas schoolchild learned respect for his elders he learned that men were always addressed and replied to with sirs and that ladies were always spoken to with maams similarly he was taught to say please and thank you and excuse me the rule being that you could never say them too often he was taught courtesy and gallantry and concern for the weak and elderly and if he was slow in learning and remembering these teachings he would find himself in serious trouble very quickly so after all then there was one generalization you could make about texas you could say flatly and positively that the wanton and open flouting of every principle of decency and fair play which was becoming commonplace in other states was wholly foreign to texas there had never been anything like that there never would be hypocrisy yes you would find that you would find approval for it but if a man was a bum he had better not demonstrate the fact in public in some cities of america the streets were roamed by gangs of rowdies overgrown louts who had been slobbered over far too long by professional dogooders and who needed nothing quite so much as a goddamned good beating sadistic thugs who were as whimperingly sensitive about their privileges as they were blind to their obligations who showed no interest at all in the common privileges of soap water and hard work human offal who demanded everything of their nation and who contributed nothing to it but their plethoric progeny which a responsible citizenry was forced to provide for and this scum these outrageous brutes prowled the streets of those american cities knocking down wholly inoffensive citizens publicy committing robbery mayhem and murder doing it because they knew they could get away with it that a hundred people might look on but not a one would interfere well so be it but such shameful spectacles were not seen in texas no texan would have stood idly by while a dozen slobs stomped a decent man to death no texan regardless of whether he was nine nineteen or ninety whether he was rich or poor whether he was bigot or liberal whether he was outnumbered a hundredtoone no texan you could be sure would look on unconcerned while a woman was being raped at dallas mitch had a halfhour layover between planes he entered a phone booth and placed a call to red intending to tell her that he was running a little late but the apartment didnt answer and the clerk cut in after a moment or two advising him that red had left for the airport a few minutes before that was reasonable enough of course traffic being what it was mitch started to leave the booth then turned and put in a call to downing it was a courtesy owing the gambler he felt he had taken his hard luck story to downing downing was now entitled to hear the happy ending just off for ghent he said as the gamblers voice came over the wire thought id tell you the news from aix is strictly copasetic there was a heavy silence then a very feeble chuckle from downing poetry yet huh i think they had it the decade i missed class didnt the guy get a bottle of wine poured down his throat for bringing the good news i thought youd never remember mitch laughed thanks frank but i cant make it tonight just here between planes downing sighed he said he had a little poem for mitch it goes like this pal here i sit all brokenhearted yeah mitch smiled expectantly what do you mean frank i mean i reversed the habits of a lifetime and tried to do you a favor and the way it turned out well you better brace yourself before i tell you mitch braced himself it didnt help a bit mitch took the receiver from his ear he stared at it and then he put it back again stood speechless chokedup for a moment by the surging tide of his emotions shaking his head over and over and over frank he found his voice at last youre supposed to rattle before you fang a guy im sorry as hell keed i was just trying to help help mitch could have slugged him help how by kicking a woman around doing something that the first hairyassed caveman could have done ten times better what the hell are you a man or a mule and dont tell me gee downing said humbly a promotion already i used to be a snake goddammit frank mitch was almost shouting where do you get off at pulling this on me you knew i didnt want this muscle bit you know ive always steered clear of it ive got a head by god and i believe in using it and if youd just left me the hell alone let me handle my own problems in my own way instead of acting like a goddam public nurse mitch downing pleaded come over and shoot me huh anytime you dont need an appointment i think ill wait for a spear mitch said bitterly with a guy like you around we should be back using them in another week he slammed up the phone he banged out of the booth took a few angry strides away from it and then of course he went right back to it again and got the gambler back on the wire because downing had tried to help he had apologized and after that well what could you do but accept it then too there was just a chance that sorry i blew my top frank now about frankie and johnnie do you suppose theres a chance that they didnt make the send stick with teddy no downing said regretfully but firmly those kids do a job like di wah didy shed have sprouted a trolly and made like a streetcar if theyd told her to goddam mitch sighed why couldnt they just have kept the dough for themselves well that would have been stealing downing pointed out reasonably anyway they knew id find out about it yeah yeah sure it aint all bad is it keed youll get your divorce and youll never see that broad again thats a little something anyway mitch admitted that it was and it didnt make a damned bit of difference because hed lost red he was as sure of that as he was that yesterday wasnt today downing said that maybe he was lowrating red a little she was yar about him so maybe shed forget and forgive like the sweet kid she was mitch said maybe and maybe yesterday was today after all and on that unhappy note the conversation ended the plane seemed hardly out of the dallas airport before it was in the houston landing pattern mitch fastened his seat belt probing the hopeless darkness of his problem red was apparently not quite through with him yet otherwise she would have told him off over the phone she meant to get through with him in person which meant that her voice came to him out of the past back from the beginning and up through the years dont you lie to me dont you ever ever lie to me he remembered her attitude about the money when she thought he had lied about the depositbox cache her dead coldness her refusal to be swayed or persuaded he remembered her fury over nominal trifles because he had spoken to her sharply or thoughtlessly frightening fits of anger which might hang on for a day or more and in which she was hardly responsible for what she did he had told her a thousand lies one piling on top of the other as he sought to cover them up he had made her a thousand promises knowing quite well that there was hardly a chance in the world that hed be able to keep them he well all right then as long as youre not married why then its just the same as if we were i dont need to feel ashamed and but it better be the truth you hear if you lied to me he got off the plane and went up the ramp as he came out into the waiting room he heard himself being paged over the public address system he stopped dead still then moved toward the information desk a sick dread welling in his heart the message was from red a perfectly innocent one miss corley was waiting for him in the parking area mitch collected his baggage and went out to her she was standing at the side of the car she was wearing a black semiformal gown short and low cut her gloves were long and white and a white mink stole draped her shoulders and she carried a small mesh evening bag he stopped a couple of steps short of her not knowing quite what to say noting her strained taut expression then he made a tentative motion of taking her in his arms dont she stepped back quickly i i mean youll muss me up red he said let me explain will you i no her head jerked nervously theres nothing to we dont have time to talk now because of zearsdale you mean but we cant go to a party with things like this well we are going we promised to go and we will if a person doesnt keep his promises he he she broke off turning away from him lets get this over with mitch she opened the door of the car and climbed in the dress riding high on her legs mitch put his baggage in the trunk and slid behind the wheel he didnt know what the right way of handling this was if there was a right way but he knew that what he was doing was all wrong he should be leading instead of following her lead he should not for gods sake be taking her to a party at a time when she was about to cloud up and rain all over him he saw the small mesh bag in her lap and started to reach for it she snatched it away dont dont you touch that but but i was just going to put it in my pocket for you i dont want you to i want to carry it myself i see he said and he did see that much anyway he knew why she wanted to keep possession of the bag he started the car he guided it out of the parking lot and drove swiftly toward zearsdales house neither of them spoke red seemed on the point of it a time or two he could sense the occasional glances which she stole in his direction hear the hesitancy in breathing which precedes speech but he couldnt and wouldnt help her out any now that he knew what he did so she also remained silent he turned into the driveway of the oil mans home feeling very dead inside and deeply puzzled although he no longer gave a particular damn about anything why was she doing this what kind of sense did it make to go to a party when she was planning a thing like that he parked the car and helped her out they went up the steps together red keeping a little away from him her lips were set in a nervous little smile the color was high in her cheeks zearsdale himself answered the door as he had the night of mitchs visit chatting amiably he guided them into a small reception room and offered drinks red shook her head a slight frown on her face not now thank you are we the first ones here first said zearsdale your first guests said mitch and he too was frowning a little there doesnt seem to be anyone else here zearsdale said casually that there were others around its a big house you know how about you drink no thanks well have one with the others if you dont mind better have something zearsdale said and then as mitch again declined firmly well come along then got some pictures i want to show you somehow he got himself between them as they left the room he was still between them when they entered another somewhat larger than the first a motion picture screen hung from a stand about halfway down the room near the door they had entered stood a heavy mm projector now you sit down there corley thats right over there zearsdale pointed and you miss may i call you red you sit over here miss red the others have already seen these pictures so sit down corley no said mitch no i am not sitting down zearsdale im walking out of here and red is coming with me and dont try to stop us the room went silent zearsdales expression froze between joviality and anger and for a moment he looked pudgily foolish as he tried to adjust to the situation mitch silently cursed himself the mirrored ceiling above the crap table the sudden clatter from the room above as he and zearsdale had gambled and then today the way zearsdale had thrown his weight around with gidge lord using the muscle of all his millions to make sure that he mitch attended this party how could he have missed it for gods sake how could he have led red into the trap red he looked at her so small and helpless almost lost in the huge lounging chair he looked at her and her unreasoning anger the deadly evidence of her intentions was wiped away and nothing mattered but getting her out of here safely he smiled at her spoke with firm reassurance dont be afraid honey well leave now she smiled back at him tremulously started to rise zearsdales heavy hand came down on her shoulder shoving her back in the chair she stays he said youre both staying zearsdale mitch moved toward him you are so wrong zearsdale stood where he was red let out a little scream a warning mitch started to wheel and a fist exploded against the back of his neck and a kidney punch blazed fire through his body and then he was yanked backwards slammed down into a chair with spinerattling force three men stood over him young wiry types preening in their toughness smelling faintly of poolchalk and bowlandpitcher bathing if you knew anyone who knew anyone who knew anyone you could pick them up for a couple of bills each but you had to catch them fast for the man with the scythe was already reaching for them one of them at least one out of three was destined for the death cell the lad with the tiny head and the closeset eyes was a likely candidate the second youth well to him who passeth it out shall be returned a hundred fold so beat his head in he never used it anyway and leave him in some dark alley with his brains spread out around him as for the third young man here surely is a victim of fivedollar sinning for he will never spend five dollars to visit a doctor so he also in a different way is a sure prospect for brain damage come in a little closer look a brief distance into the future and observe note the lowered trousers the reddish stains on his shorts note the hardrubber dosing gun filled with that ol reliable remedy note the downward thrust of the plunger the shrill suddenly stifled scream as the stuff hits his cerebrum that liverishlooking object that plopped to the floor is his tongue must these kids always bite their tongues in two well half a tongue is better than none right ha ha anyway why does a guy need a tongue when hes drowning in his own blood zearsdale gestured and the three fell back behind mitch poised ready to pounce at another gesture red was recovering fast from her fear and her eyes were icy as the oil man gave her a smile of apology im sorry if i was a little rough a moment ago miss red these movies i was about to show well i thought you should see them but if youd really rather not she would rather not mitch said theyre pictures of the dice game our host and i had the other night red i think he feels there was something wrong with the game does he now red said and just what does he think hes going to do about it zearsdale obviously didnt like her tone but with what was patently an effort he managed a fatherly smile i understand your feelings youre far more a victim of this man than i am i know of course that youre not his sister so you know im not his sister red said what about it child child he shook his head gravely hes led you to believe that hes going to marry you hasnt he hes promised to marry you but what you dont know is that hes already married ive gone to a great deal of trouble to find out about this man and why why well i uh why red repeated who asked you to what business is it of yours who do you think you are anyway he thinks hes god mitch said he told me so himself zearsdale flushed angrily he said they would do well to shut up and red told him to shut up himself i mean it doggone you i know mitch is married and i know hes getting unmarried and as soon as he does hes marrying me oh yes you are darling she gave him a dazzling smile i was angry enough to kill you when i found out i went out to the airport tonight swearing that i was going to kill you but your plane was late and i began to get frightened and worried about you and and she turned back to zearsdale eyes sparkling with tears dont you tell me anything about mitch he didnt know he was married when he met me when he found out he couldnt tell me because i would have been hurt and he loved me and wanted to protect me and an never mind nnever mind its nnone of your business you big ape she broke off sniffling mitch swallowed lumpily and for a moment he would have given both of his arms just to have them around her now everything fell into place and he knew why she had been so strained and awkward with him why she had wanted to be around others for a while before facing him alone the crisis in their relationship had given her a new and mature insight and she had needed time to adjust to the unexpected depths she had found within herself also doubtless she had wanted to dispose of im afraid i was mistaken about you zearsdale frowned at her you seem to be just about as bad as corley is oh shut up you just hush said red yes just as bad zearsdale nodded grimly so youll have to suffer as he stop that corley dont snap your fingers when im talking i need a light mitch held up a cigarette tell one of your apostles to give me one zearsdale motioned curtly and one of the mugs thrust a light at mitch mitch grabbed his wrist yanked him forward then swung him backward simultaneously kicking over his chair as he lunged to his feet the thrown guy and another went down in a tangle the third came in swinging mitch ducked inside the flailing arms brought his head up sharply there was a messy crunching sound and the guys chin almost met his nose and he went down to the floor in a heap but now the other two were up were weaving in with blood in their eyes mitch sprang squarely between them his arms outflung their arms whipped around their necks locked contracted their heads smashed together and they wobbled dazedly then suddenly sat down as he kicked their legs from under them mitch take it honey red was holding a small gun out to him the gun she had thought she was going to shoot him with mitch took it and swung coldly on zearsdale all right he snapped you claim i cheated you no ifs ands and buts about it i rooked you so you get these punks out here to give red and me a hard time now i want to know just why you think you were cheated the oil man was staring at the three beaten hoods he turned to mitch a curious expression in his deepset eyes where did you learn to fight like that corley i thought i was the only person who knew how in hotel lockerrooms mostly i used to be a bellboy thats very interesting ill bet you were a very good bellboy werent you mitch began to get angry all over again three minutes ago this character was going to have him worked over and now he wanted to make conversation lets stick to the subject he said curtly you say im a cheat i say i win because im good because i go into a game with a big edge an edge ive gotten through training and experience any man who wants to be in the big time has to have one you have obviously when was the last time you went into a business deal without a better than even chance of winning what zearsdalee eyes had strayed to the hoodlums again oh come now corley youre a professional gambler you can make the dice do anything you want them to can i can i always do it then why is it that you broke me the night we played well but you came out winner but you broke me mitch insisted you took me right down the line and i was all ready to tell you good night and leave thats what i meant to do what ive done many times before when i went broke but you wouldnt have it that way you forced a loan on me to keep the game going well isnt that right or not you won and you have no one to blame but yourself for not staying winner well zearsdale wet his lips hesitantly that was purely a comeon you lost deliberately oh for gods sake i was doing my damnedest to win and those movies must have shown that i was why would i deliberately throw to you anyway to get you in another game how do i know i can do it whats the percentage in it why not take you in the game that i have he waited frowning zearsdale shrugged whatever you say im hardly in a position to argue about it why not mitch looked down at the gun you mean because of this well well fix that right now he walked over to the oil man slapped the gun into his hand and stepped back now argue all you damned please or do you want these punks to sit on me before you begin zearsdale looked a little stunned he hesitated then nodded to the three all right i wont need you anymore they sidled out the door keeping a wary eye on mitch and he shook his head bemusedly corley mr corley i i hardly know what to say i seldom make a mistake about a man but if you dont know what to say maybe youd better not say anything mitch told him maybe if you just listen to me you might learn something maybe i will zearsdale nodded why dont we see all right mitch said you asked me if i was a good bellboy the truth is that i was lousy i was like a lot of young men you see wanting a lot but not willing to do much to get it thats why i took up dice i suppose because it looked like an easy way of making out big i kept on playing with them always thinking it would suddenly get easy and by the time i found out that there was no easy way of being good at anything it was too late to stop but simply being good with the dice wasnt enough of course not if you wanted to move into the upper brackets you had to be wellinformed wellread polished you had to acquire an outlook on life a certain way of dealing with people an indefinable thing called class which could never be imitated so he had accomplished all that and in accomplishing it he had become far more than the very best man in the country with a pair of dice the trouble with you zearsdale is that youve forgotten how good a man can get through nothing but his own efforts if hes good as good as i am then he cant be for real if he beats you hes got to be cheating well im a ringer yes but im the straightest player youll ever come up against im no more a cheat than the baseball pitcher who throws nine strikes out of ten or the sharpshooter who keeps ringing up bullseyes and im good at a lot of things besides dice ill take you on for a questionandanswers game on any subject you name ill take you on at poker with you dealing all the cards ill take you on at golf and let you pick my clubs ill take you on at anything from matches to marbles zearsdale and ill beat the everlovin socks off of you because its been so damned long since you met a good man youre ready to lie down and holler foul before you ever begin red clapped her hands enthusiastically zearsdale sat scowling squirming a little he wasnt used to being talked to like that he certainly didnt have to take it he liked a man with pride of course god how he loved a man with pride and the guts to stand up and speak his mind but his broad mouth twisted into a reluctant grin then he threw back his head and laughed and he laughed until the tears came to his eyes at last after a vigorous blowing of his nose he got control of himself corley i wouldnt have missed this for the world i honestly wouldnt i he suddenly became aware of the gun he was holding my god what am i doing with this let me give it back to you keep it mitch said red and i dont have any need for guns neither do i zearsdale said ill get rid of it for us he excused himself and left the room he returned without the gun wheeling a small portable bar in front of him i think we all need a drink he declared roundly or maybe two who knows what would you like miss uh red nothing said red looking very stern not until you say youre sorry of course im sorry with sugar on it red insisted thats what you have to say when youre really and truly sorry zearsdale squirmed glanced appealingly at mitch mitch told him he might as well give in and say it red would persist until he did so the oil man said very rapidly that he was sorry with sugar on it well all right then red said and she gave him one of her very best smiles a smile that reached right inside of him and patted him on the heart i guess youre really not so bad when a person gets to know you who is said mitch hear hear said zearsdale and then they all had a drink together or maybe two who knows the end
