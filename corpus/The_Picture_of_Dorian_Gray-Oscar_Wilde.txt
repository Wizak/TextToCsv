 chapter one an extraordinarily beautiful young man the room was filled with the smell of roses sitting on a sofa smoking a cigarette was lord henry wotton through the open door came the distant sounds of the london streets in the centre of the room stood a portrait of an extraordinarily beautiful young man sitting a little distance in front of it was the artist himself basil hallward as the painter looked at the portrait he smiled it is your best work basil the best thing you have ever done said lord henry slowly you really must send it next year to the grosvenor the grosvenor is really the only place to exhibit a painting like that i dont think i shall send it anywhere the painter answered moving his head in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at oxford university no i wont send it anywhere lord henry looked at him in surprise through the thin blue smoke of his cigarette not send it anywhere my dear man why not what odd people you painters are i know you will laugh at me basil replied but i really cant exhibit it i have put too much of myself into it lord henry stretched himself out on the sofa and laughed too much of yourself in it basil this man is truly beautiful he does not look like you you dont understand me harry answered the artist of course i am not like him i would be sorry to look like him it is better not to be different from other people the stupid and ugly have the best of this world dorian gray dorian gray is that his name asked lord henry walking across the room towards basil hallward yes that is his name i wasnt going to tell you but why not oh i cant explain when i like people enormously i never tell their names to anyone i suppose you think thats very foolish not at all answered lord henry not at all my dear basil you forget that i am married so my life is full of secrets i never know where my wife is and my wife never knows what i am doing when we meet we tell each other lies with the most serious faces i hate the way you talk about your married life harry said basil hallward walking towards the door that led into the garden i believe you are really a very good husband but that you are ashamed of it you never say a good thing and you never do a wrong thing lord henry laughed and the two men went out into the garden together after a pause lord henry pulled out his watch i am afraid i have to go basil he said in a quiet voice but before i go i want you to explain to me why you wont exhibit dorian grays picture i want the real reason i told you the real reason no you did not you said that it was because there was too much of yourself in it now that is childish harry said basil hallward looking him straight in the face every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist not the sitter i will not exhibit this picture because i am afraid that i have shown in it the secret of my own soul lord henry laughed and what is that he asked oh there is really very little to tell harry answered the painter and i dont think you will understand perhaps you wont believe it lord henry smiled and picked a flower from the grass i am quite sure ill understand it he replied staring at the flower and i can believe anything the story is simply this said the painter two months ago i went to a party at lady brandons after i had been in the room for about ten minutes i suddenly realized that someone was looking at me i turned around and saw dorian gray for the first time when our eyes met i felt the blood leaving my face i knew that this boy would become my whole soul my whole art itself what did you do we were quite close almost touching our eyes met again i asked lady brandon to introduce me to him what did lady brandon say about mr dorian gray oh something like charming boy i dont know what he does i think he doesnt do anything oh yes he plays the piano or is it the violin dear mr gray dorian and i both laughed and we became friends at once laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship said the young lord picking another flower and it is the best ending for one hallward shook his head you dont understand what friendship is harry everyone is the same to you thats not true cried lord henry pushing his hat back and looking at the summer sky i choose my friends for their beauty and my enemies for their intelligence a man cannot be too careful in choosing his enemies of course i hate my relations and i hate poor people because they are ugly stupid and drunk i dont agree with a word you have said and i feel sure that you dont agree either lord henry touched his pointed brown beard with his finger and the toe of his boot with his stick how english you are basil an englishman is only interested in whether he agrees with an idea not whether it is right or wrong but tell me more about mr dorian gray how often do you see him every day i couldnt be happy if i didnt see him every day how extraordinary i thought you only cared about your art he is all my art to me now said the painter i know that the work i have done since i met dorian gray is the best work of my life in some strange way his personality has shown me a new kind of art he seems like a little boy though he is really more than twenty and when he is with me i see the world differently basil this is extraordinary i must see dorian gray hallward got up from his seat and walked up and down the garden after some time he came back harry he said dorian gray is the reason for my art you might see nothing in him i see everything in him then why wont you exhibit his portrait asked lord henry an artist should paint beautiful things but he should put nothing of his own life into them some day i will show the world what that beauty is for that reason the world will never see my portrait of dorian gray i think you are wrong basil but i wont argue with you tell me is dorian gray very fond of you the painter thought for a few moments he likes me he answered after a pause i know he likes me of course i flatter him too much and tell him things that i should not he is usually very charming to me and we spend thousands of wonderful hours together but sometimes he can be horribly thoughtless and seems to enjoy causing me pain then i feel harry that i have given my whole soul to someone who uses it like a flower to put in his coat on a summers day summer days are long basil said lord henry in a quiet voice perhaps you will get bored before he will intelligence lives longer than beauty one day you will look at your friend and you wont like his colour or something and then you will begin to think that he has behaved badly towards you harry dont talk like that as long as i live dorian gray will be everything to me you cant feel what i feel you change too often my dear basil that is exactly why i can feel it lord henry took a cigarette from his pretty silver box and lit it then he turned to hallward and said i have just remembered remembered what harry where i heard the name of dorian gray where was it asked hallward with a frown dont look so angry basil it was at my aunts lady agathas she told me that she had discovered this wonderful young man he was going to help her work with the poor people in the east end of london and his name was dorian gray of course i didnt know it was your friend i am very glad you didnt harry why i dont want you to meet him a servant came into the garden mr dorian gray is waiting in the house sir he said you must introduce me now cried lord henry laughing the painter turned to his servant ask mr gray to wait parker i will come in in a few moments then he looked at lord henry dorian gray is my dearest friend he said he is a beautiful person dont spoil him dont try and influence him your influence would be bad dont take away from me the one person who makes me a true artist what silly things you say said lord henry smiling he took hallward by the arm and almost led him into the house chapter two jealous of his own portrait as they entered they saw dorian gray he was sitting at the piano with his back to them and he was turning the pages of some music by schumann you must lend me these basil he cried i want to learn them they are perfectly charming perhaps if you sit well for me today dorian oh i am bored with sitting and i dont want a portrait of myself answered the boy turning quickly when he saw lord henry his face went red for a moment i am sorry basil i didnt know that you had anyone with you this is lord henry wotton dorian hes an old friend of mine we went to oxford together i have just been telling him what a good sitter you were and now you have spoiled everything you have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you mr gray said lord henry stepping forward and offering his hand my aunt has often spoken to me about you i am afraid lady agatha is annoyed with me at the moment i promised to go to a club in whitechapel with her last tuesday and i forgot all about it i dont know what she will say to me lord henry looked at him yes he was certainly wonderfully handsome with his curved red lips honest blue eyes and gold hair oh dont worry about my aunt you are one of her favourite people and you are too charming to waste time working tor poor people lord henry sat down on the sofa and opened his cigarette box the painter was busy mixing colours and getting his brushes ready suddenly he looked at lord henry and said harry i want to finish this picture today would you think it very rude of me if i asked you to go away lord henry smiled and looked at dorian gray shall i go mr gray he asked oh please dont lord henry i see that basil is in one of his difficult moods and i hate it when he is difficult and i want you to tell me why i should not help the poor people that would be very boring mr gray but i certainly will not run away if you do not want me to is that all right basil you have often told me that you like your sitters to have someone to talk to hallward bit his lip if that is what dorian wants dorian always gets what he wants lord henry picked up his hat and gloves no i am afraid i must go goodbye mr gray come and see me one afternoon in curzon street i am nearly always at home at five oclock basil cried dorian gray if lord henry wotton goes i will go too you never open your lips while you are painting and it is horribly boring just standing here ask him to stay all right please stay harry for dorian and for me said hallward staring at his picture it is true that i never talk when i am working and never listen either it must be very boring for my sitters sit down again harry and dorian dont move about too much or listen to what lord henry says he has a very bad influence over all his friends dorian gray stood while hallward finished his portrait he liked what he had seen of lord henry he was so different to basil and he had such a beautiful voice after a few moments he said to him have you really a very bad influence lord henry as bad as basil says influence is always bad why because to influence someone is to give them your soul each person must have his own personality turn your head a little more to the right dorian said the painter he was not listening to the conversation and only knew that there was a new look on the boys face and yet continued lord henry in his low musical voice i believe that if one man lived his life fully and completely he could change the world he would be a work of art greater than anything we have ever imagined but the bravest man among us is afraid of himself you mr gray are very young but you have had passions that have made you afraid dreams stop cried dorian gray i dont understand what you are saying i need to think for nearly ten minutes he stood there with his lips open and his eyes strangely bright the words that basils friend had spoken had touched his soul yes there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood he understood them now with his smile lord henry watched him he knew the exact moment when to say nothing he was surprised at the sudden effect of his words on the boy how fascinating the boy was hallward continued painting and did not notice that the others were silent basil i am tired cried dorian gray suddenly i must go and sit in the garden there is no air in here my dear boy i am sorry when i am painting my work is all i can think about but you never sat better i dont know what harry has been saying to you but there is a wonderful bright look in your eyes i suppose he has been flattering you you shouldnt believe a word he says he has certainly not been flattering me perhaps that is why i dont believe anything he has told me you know you believe it all said lord henry looking at him with his dreamy eyes i will go out to the garden with you its horribly hot in this room dont keep dorian too long said the painter this is going to be my best painting lord henry went out to the garden and found dorian gray holding a flower to his face he came close to him and put his hand on his shoulder dorian gray frowned and turned away he liked the tall young man who was standing by him his dark romantic face interested him there was something in his low musical voice that was fascinating but he felt a little afraid why was this stranger having a strong influence on him like this he had known basil hallward for months but the friendship between them had not changed him suddenly someone had come into his life and turned it upside down someone who seemed to have the key to the mystery of life itself and yet what was there to be afraid of he was not a schoolboy or a girl it was silly to be afraid let us go and sit out of the sun i dont want you to be burnt by the sun what does that matter cried dorian gray laughing as he sat down on the seat at the end of the garden it should matter very much to you mr gray why because you are young and to be young is the best thing in the world i dont feel that lord henry no you dont feel it now some day when you are old and ugly you will feel it terribly now wherever you go you charm the world will it always be so you have a wonderfully beautiful face mr gray i dont think dont frown it is true the gods have been good to you but what the gods give they quickly take away you have only a few years in which to really live perfectly and fully live your life now while you are still young suddenly the painter appeared at the door and waved at them to come in they turned to each other and smiled i am waiting he cried please come in the light is perfect they got up and walked towards the house together you are glad you have met me mr gray said lord henry looking at him yes i am glad now i wonder whether i will always be glad always that is a terrible word women are so fond of using it twenty minutes later hallward stopped painting he stood back and looked at the portrait for a few moments then he bent down and signed his name in red paint on the bottom lefthand corner it is finished he cried lord henry came over and examined the picture it was certainly a wonderful work of art my dear man he said it is the best portrait of our time mr gray come over and look at yourself dorian walked across to look at the painting when he saw it his cheeks went red with pleasure he felt that he recognized his own beauty for the first time but then he remembered what lord henry had said his beauty would only be there for a few years one day he would be old and ugly dont you like it cried hallward not understanding why the boy was silent of course he likes it said lord henry it is one of the greatest paintings in modern art i will pay anything you ask for it i must have it it is not mine to sell harry whose is it dorians of course answered the painter he is very lucky how sad it is said dorian gray who was still staring at his own portrait i will grow old and horrible but this painting will always stay young it will never be older than this day in june if only it were the other way what do you mean asked hallward if i could stay young and the picture grow old for that for that i would give everything yes there is nothing in the whole world i would not give i would give my soul for that i dont think you would like that basil cried lord henry laughing i certainly would not harry said hallward dorian gray turned and looked at him you like your art better than your friends the painter stared in surprise why was dorian speaking like that what had happened his face was red and he seemed quite angry you will always like this painting but how long will you like me until i start getting old lord henry wotton is perfectly right when i lose my beauty i will lose everything i shall kill myself before i get old hallward turned white and caught his hand dorian dorian he cried dont talk like that i have never had a friend like you and i will never have another how can you be jealous of a painting you are more beautiful than any work of art i am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die i am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me why should it keep what i must lose hot tears came into his eyes as he threw himself on the sofa you did this harry said the painter angrily lord henry shook his head it is the real dorian gray that is all harry i cant argue with two of my best friends at once between you both you have made me hate the best piece of work i have ever done i will destroy it dorian gray watched as hallward walked over to the painting table and picked up a knife the boy jumped from the sofa tore the knife from hallwards hand and threw it across the room dont basil he cried dont murder it i am glad that you like my work at last dorian said the painter coldly i never thought you would like it i am in love with it basil it is part of myself i feel that what silly people you are both of you said lord henry lets forget about the painting for one night and go to the theatre i would like to come to the theatre with you lord henry and you will come too wont you basil i cant said hallward i have too much work to do well you and i will go together mr gray the painter bit his lip and walked over to the picture i will stay with the real dorian he said sadly chapter three dorian in love one afternoon a month later dorian gray was sitting in the little library of lord henrys house in mayfair lord henry had not yet come in he was always late dorian gray was bored and once or twice he thought of going away at last he heard a step outside and the door opened how late you are harry he said im afraid it is not harry mr gray it is only his wife he looked around quickly and got to his feet i am sorry i thought i know you quite well by your photographs i think my husband has got seventeen of them seventeen lady henry well eighteen then and i saw you with him the other night at the theatre but here is harry lord henry smiled at them both so sorry i am late dorian i am afraid i must go said lady harry goodbye mr gray goodbye harry you are eating out i suppose i am too perhaps i will see you later perhaps my dear said lord harry shutting the door behind her then he lit a cigarette and threw himself down on the sofa never marry a woman with fair hair dorian he said why harry because they are romantic but i like romantic people never marry at all dorian i dont think i will marry harry i am too much in love who are you in love with asked lord henry after a pause with an actress said dorian gray how ordinary you would not say that if you saw her harry who is she her name is sibyl vane ive never heard of her no one has people will some day though she is an artist my dear boy no woman is an artist women never have anything to say but they say it charmingly how long have you known her about three weeks and where did you meet her i will tell you harry but you must not laugh after all it was you who gave me a passion to know everything about life for days after i met you i searched the streets for beauty i walked around the east end until i found a dirty little theatre i see you are laughing it is horrible of you i am not laughing dorian go on with your story the play was romeo and juliet at first i was annoyed at the thought of seeing shakespeare in such a terrible place and when a fat old gentleman came out as romeo i nearly walked out but then i saw juliet harry she was the loveliest thing i had ever seen in my life when did you meet her i went back the next night and the night after that on the third evening i waited for her outside the theatre what was she like sibyl oh she was shy and gentle she is only seventeen and there is something of a child in her she said to me you look like a prince i must call you prince charming miss sibyl knows how to flatter you you dont understand her harry she thinks that i am like a person in shakespeare she knows nothing of life sibyl is the only thing i care about that is the reason i suppose that you never have dinner with me now i thought it might be something romantic my dear harry we eat together every day said dorian you always come very late well i have to see sibyl play he cried can you have dinner with me tonight dorian he shook his head tonight she is ophelia he answered and tomorrow night she will be juliet when is she sibyl vane never thats good how horrible you are but when you see her you will think differently i want you and basil to come and watch her tomorrow night you are certain to recognize that she is wonderful all right tomorrow evening will you see basil before then or shall i write to him dear basil i havent seen him for a week it is rather horrible of me as he sent me my portrait a few days ago i love looking at it perhaps you should write to him i dont want to see him alone he says things that annoy me he gives me good advice lord henry smiled people are very fond of giving away advice they need themselves oh basil is a good man but i dont think he really understands about art and beauty since i have known you harry i have discovered that basil my dear boy puts everything that is charming in him into his work i must go now harry my juliet is waiting for me dont forget about tomorrow goodbye as dorian left the room lord henry began to think about what he had just learned certainly few people had ever interested him so much as dorian gray yet the mad worship of this actress did not make him annoyed or jealous he was pleased by it it made the boy more interesting to study later that night when he arrived home from dinner lord henry saw a telegram on the table near the door he opened it and read that dorian gray was going to marry sibyl vane chapter four the worship of sibyl vane i suppose you have heard the news basil said lord henry the following evening they were in the diningroom of the bristol hotel no harry answered the artist giving his hat and coat to the waiter what is it dorian gray is going to be married said lord henry watching him as he spoke hallward frowned dorian going to be married he cried impossible it is perfectly true to whom to some little actress but it would be absurd for him to marry someone like that if you want to make him marry this girl tell him that basil he is sure to do it then whenever a man does a completely stupid thing it is always for a good reason i hope this girl is good harry oh she is better than good she is beautiful said lord henry dorian says that she is beautiful and he is not often wrong about these things your portrait has helped him understand beauty in others we are to see her tonight if that boy doesnt forget but how can dorian marry an actress harry it is absurd cried the painter walking up and down the room biting his lip dorian gray falls in love with a beautiful actress who plays juliet he asks her to marry him why not i hope that dorian gray marries this girl and worships her for six months then he can suddenly become fascinated by another woman you dont mean a word of that harry i know you dont really want dorian grays life to be spoiled you are much better than you pretend to be lord henry laughed the reason we all like to think so well of others is because we are afraid for ourselves but here is dorian himself he will tell you more than i can my dear harry my dear basil you must both congratulate me said the boy throwing off his coat and shaking each of his friends hands i have never been so happy of course it is sudden all the best things are and yet it seems to me to be the one thing i have been looking for all my life i hope you will always be very happy dorian said hallward but why did you not tell me you told harry there really is not much to tell cried dorian last night i went to see her again after when we were sitting together there came into her eyes a wonderful look it was something i had never seen there before we kissed each other i cant describe to you what i felt at that moment have you seen her today asked lord henry dorian gray shook his head i have left her in shakespeares forest i will find her in his garden at what exact point did you use the word marry dorian and how did she answer perhaps you forgot all about it my dear harry it was not a business meeting i told her i loved her the whole world is nothing to me compared to her but my dear dorian hallward put his hand on lord henrys arm dont harry you have annoyed dorian he is not like other men he would never harm anyone lord henry looked across the table dorian is never annoyed with me he answered dorian gray laughed when i am with sibyl vane i dont believe in anything you have taught me i forget all your fascinating terrible ideas and those are asked lord henry helping himself to some salad oh your ideas about life your ideas about love your ideas about pleasure all your ideas harry pleasure is the only thing worth having ideas about he answered in his slow musical voice when we are happy we are always good but when we are good we are not always happy i know what pleasure is cried dorian gray it is to worship someone that is certainly better than when someone worships you harry you are terrible i dont know why i like you so much let us go down to the theatre when you see sibyl you will change your ideas they got up and put on their coats the painter was silent and thoughtful he felt very sad dorian gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past life had come between them when he arrived at the theatre it seemed to hallward that he had grown years older chapter four dorian leaves sibyl the theatre was crowded that night it was terribly hot and there were young people shouting to each other from across seats women were laughing loudly and their voices sounded horrible people were eating oranges and drinking from bottles what a place to find the perfect girl in said lord henry yes answered dorian gray it was here i found her when you see her as juliet you will forget everything these ugly people become quite different when she appears i understand what you mean dorian said the painter and i believe in this girl anyone you love must be wonderful thanks basil answered dorian gray i knew that you would understand me in a few minutes you will see the girl who i am going to give my life to the girl who i have given everything that is good in me then sibyl appeared the crowd shouted and called her name yes she was certainly lovely to look at lord henry thought basil hallward jumped to his feet excitedly dorian gray sat staring at her like he was in a dream charming charming cried lord henry a quarter of an hour later lord henry whispered to hallward shes one of the loveliest girls i have ever seen but she is a terrible actress dorian grays face turned white as he watched her speak she was so different tonight now she was not juliet but a very bad actress who did not understand shakespeares words even the crowd became bored and began to talk loudly the only person who did not seem to notice was the actress herself lord henry got up from his chair and put on his coat she is beautiful dorian he said but she cant act lets go i am going to stay until the end answered the boy in a cold voice i am awfully sorry that i have made you waste an evening harry i apologize to you both my dear dorian perhaps miss vane is ill said hallward we will come some other night come to the club with basil and myself we will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of sibyl vane she is beautiful what more do you want go away harry cried the boy i want to be alone cant you see my heart is breaking hot tears came to his eyes as lord henry and hallward left the theatre when it was over dorian gray rushed to see sibyl vane the girl was standing there alone with a look of extraordinary happiness on her face how badly i acted tonight dorian she cried horribly he answered staring at her it was terrible are you ill why did you make me suffer like that the girl smiled dorian dont yon understand understand what he asked angrily why i was so bad tonight why i will always be bad why i will never act well again you are ill i suppose when you are ill you shouldnt act my friends were bored i was bored dorian dorian she cried before i knew you acting was the one important thing in my life it was only in the theatre that i lived i thought that it was all true tonight for the first time in my life i saw that i was playing at love our love for each other is the only true love take me away with you dorian i dont want to be an actress any more he threw himself down on the sofa and turned away his face you have killed my love he said quietly then he jumped up and went to the door my god how mad i was to love you what a fool i have been you are nothing to me now i will never see you again i will never think of you i will never speak to you again the girl went white you are not serious dorian you are acting she whispered putting her hand on his arm he pushed her back dont touch me he cried then he turned and left the room after walking the streets of london all night he arrived home just after sunrise as he passed through the library he saw the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him he stared at it in surprise and walked on into his bedroom he took his coat off and stood next to his bed a few moments later he returned to the picture and looked at it closely in the poor light the face seemed to have changed a little now the mouth looked cruel it was certainly strange he walked to the window and opened the curtains the light changed the room but the face stayed the same in fact the sunlight made the mouth look even crueller going back to his bedroom he found a small mirror that had been a present from lord henry he looked at his real face and saw no sign of cruelty what did it mean he threw himself into a chair and began to think suddenly he remembered what he had said in basil hallwards house the day the picture had been finished yes he remembered it perfectly he had asked that the painting grow old so that he himself could remain young but such things were impossible it was terrible even to think about them and yet there was the picture in front of him there was the cruelty in the mouth cruelty had he been cruel no why think about sibyl vane she was nothing to him now but the picture what was he to say of that it held the secret of his life and told his story it had taught him to love his own beauty would it teach him to hate his own soul would he ever look at it again he would save himself he would not see lord henry again he would go back to sibyl vane marry her and try to love her again she had suffered more than he had poor child he had been selfish and cruel to her they would be happy together his life with her would be beautiful and pure he got up from his chair and covered the portrait how horrible he said to himself and he walked across to the window and opened it when he stepped out on to the grass he took a deep breath he thought only of sibyl the birds that were singing in the garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her chapter six love becomes tragedy it was nearly one oclock the next afternoon when he woke up his servant brought him a cup of tea and some letters one of them was from lord henry and had been brought by hand that morning he put it to one side he went into the library for breakfast feeling perfectly happy then he saw the open window and the covered portrait was it all true or had it just been a dream but he remembered that cruel mouth so clearly dorian gray sent his servant away and locked all the doors then he pulled the cover off the painting and saw himself face to face it was true the portrait had changed for hours he did not know what to do or think finally he went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved he asked her to forgive him for the terrible things he had said to her suddenly he heard a knock on the door and he heard lord henrys voice outside my dear boy i must see you let me in at once he made no answer but remained quite still the knocking continued and grew louder yes it was better to let lord henry in he would explain to him the new life he was going to lead he jumped up covered the picture and opened the door i am sorry about it all dorian said lord henry as he entered but you must not think too much about it do you mean about sibyl vine asked the boy yes of course answered lord henry sitting down and slowly pulling off his yellow gloves it is terrible but you are not to blame tell me did you go behind and see her after it was over yes i felt sure that you had did you have an argument i was cruel harry terribly cruel but it is all right now i am not sorry for anything that has happened it has taught me to know myself better oh dorian i am so glad that you see it that way i want to be good harry i dont want my soul to be ugly i am going to marry sibyl vine marry sibyl vine cried lord henry standing up and staring at him in surprise but my dear dorian yes harry i know what you are going to say something horrible about getting married dont say it sibyl will be my wife your wife dorian didnt you get my letter i wrote to you this morning your letter oh yes i remember i have not read it yet harry you know nothing yet then what do you mean lord henry walked across the room and sat down next to dorian gray taking both his hands in his own he held them dorian he said my letter was to tell you that sibyl vane is dead a cry of pain came from the boys lips and he jumped to his feet dead sibyl dead it is not true it is a horrible lie it is true dorian said lord henry it is in all the morning newspapers the police will be asking questions and you must keep your name out of any scandal things like that make a man fashionable in paris but in london they are a disaster for any gentleman i suppose they dont know your name at the theatre if they dont it is all right did anyone see you going round to her room dorian did not answer for a few moments finally he said in a strange voice harry did you say that the police are asking questions what did you mean by that did sibyl oh harry this is terrible i am sure that it was not an accident though it must be described that way officially she swallowed something horrible they use at theatres harry harry it is terrible cried the boy yes it is very sad of course but it is nothing to do with you come with me to dinner and after we will go to the theatre so i have murdered sibyl vane said dorian gray half to himself yet the roses are not less lovely the birds still sing happily in my garden and tonight i will have dinner with you and go to the theatre how extraordinary life is my first passionate love letter was to a dead girl yet why is it that i cannot feel this tragedy as much as i want to i dont think i am heartless do you you have done too many foolish things in the last fortnight to be heartless dorian answered lord henry with his sweet sad smile the boy frowned i dont like that explanation harry he said but i am glad you dont think i am heartless a woman has killed herself for the love of you said lord henry that is very beautiful they were silent the evening darkened in the room after some time dorian gray looked up how well you know me but we will not talk again of what has happened it has been something wonderful that is all now i have to dress harry i feel too tired to eat anything but i will join you later at the theatre as lord henry closed the door behind him dorian rushed to the portrait and tore off the cover no there was no further change in the picture it had received the news of sibyl vanes death before he had known of it himself tears came to his eyes as he remembered her he brushed them away and looked again at the picture he felt the time had come to choose or had he already chosen yes life had decided that for him the portrait was going to carry his shame that was all an hour later he was at the theatre and lord henry was sitting beside him chapter seven what is past is past as he was eating breakfast the next morning basil hallward was shown into the room i am so glad i have found you dorian he said i called last night and they told me that you were at the theatre of course i knew that was impossible i had a terrible evening worrying whether one tragedy would be followed by another i cant tell you how heartbroken i am about the whole thing did you go and see the girls mother what did she say about it all my dear basil i dont know said dorian gray he looked very bored i was at the theatre you went to the theatre said hallward speaking very slowly you went to the theatre where sibyl vane was lying dead stop basil i wont hear it cried dorian jumping to his feet you must not speak of such things what is done is done what is past is past you call yesterday the past dorian this is horrible something has changed you completely you look exactly the same as the wonderful boy in my picture but now there is no heart in you it is all harrys influence i see that the boy went to the window and looked out at the garden for a few moments harry has taught me many things basil he said at last you have only taught me to love my own beauty i am truly sorry for that dorian i dont know what you mean basil he said turning round i dont know what you want what do you want i want the dorian gray i used to paint said the artist sadly basil said the boy going over to him and putting his hand on his shoulder you have come too late yesterday when i heard that sibyl vane had killed herself killed herself my god is there no doubt about that cried hallward my dear basil of course she killed herself the older man put his face in his hands how terrible he said in a quiet voice no said dorian gray there is nothing terrible about it it is one of the great romantic tragedies of our time i know you are surprised at me talking to you like this you have not realized how i have changed i was a boy when you knew me i am a man now i have new passions new thoughts new ideas but dorian i am different but you must not like me less of course i am very fond of harry but i know that you are better than he is you are not stronger you are too afraid of life but you are better and how happy we used to be together dont leave me basil and dont argue with me i am what i am the painter felt strangely sad dorian gray was extraordinarily important to him the boy had changed his art perhaps his cruel talk about sibyl vane was just a mood that would pass away there was so much in him that was good well dorian he said with a sad smile i wont speak to you again about this horrible thing i only hope that your name is kept out of any scandal have the police asked to see you dorian shook his head they dont even know my name he answered she didnt know your name only my first name and i am sure that she did not tell it to anyone she told her family that i was prince charming it was pretty of her you must do me a drawing of sibyl basil i would like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses i will try and do something dorian but you must come and sit for me again i cant work so well without you i can never sit for you again basil it is impossible he cried my dear boy what is this foolishness hallward cried did you not like what i did for you where is it why have you covered it let me look at it it is the best thing i have ever done it is very bad of your servant to hide my work like that i felt the room looked different as i came in it was not my servant who covered it basil i did it myself the light was too strong on the portrait too strong no the light is perfect in here let me see it and hallward walked towards the corner of the room a terrible cry came from dorian grays lips and he rushed between the painter and the covered portrait basil you must not look at it i dont want you to not look at my own work are you serious why shouldnt i look at it cried hallward laughing if you try and look at it basil i promise i will never speak to you again i am very serious hallward looked at dorian gray in surprise he had never seen him like this before the boys face was white and angry dorian dont speak but what is the matter of course i wont look at it if you dont want me to he said coldly walking over to the window but it seems rather absurd that i cannot see my own work when i am going to exhibit it in paris in the autumn to exhibit it you want to exhibit it cried dorian gray a terrible fear was building inside him was the world going to see his secret were people going to stare at the mystery of his life that was impossible yes george petit is going to exhibit all my best pictures in october dont worry it is only for one month dorian gray passed his hand across his face it felt hot and wet he felt that he was about to face horrible danger you told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it he cried why have you changed your mind he stopped suddenly and a cruel look came into his eyes he had remembered something lord henry had said to him ask basil why he wont exhibit your picture he told me once and it is a very strange story yes perhaps basil too had his secret he would ask him and try basil he said coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face we all have secrets what was your reason for not wanting to exhibit my picture dorian if i told you you might like me less than you do now and you would certainly laugh at me if you dont want me ever to look at your picture again i wont i have always you to look at your friendship is more important to me than exhibiting a painting no basil you must tell me said dorian gray his feeling of fear had passed away now he just wanted to find out basil hallwards mystery dorian said the painter who did not look happy have you ever noticed something in the picture something strange basil cried the boy staring at him with wild eyes i see you did dorian from the moment i met you your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me i worshipped you i was jealous of everyone you spoke to i wanted to have you all to myself i was only happy when i was with you when you were away from me you were still there in my art basil no dont speak i must tell you now what i did not tell you then that i decided to paint a wonderful portrait of you i put all my feelings for you into that picture i felt dorian that i had told too much i had put too much of myself into it so i decided never to exhibit the portrait i told harry and he laughed when the picture was finished and i sat alone with it i felt that i was right later i thought that perhaps i was being foolish and when this paris offer came but i see now that the picture cannot be shown dorian gray breathed deeply the colour came back to his cheeks and a smile crossed his lips the danger was over and he was safe for a while what a sad story basil had told would he ever be so influenced by the personality of a friend lord henry had the charm of being very dangerous but that was all it is extraordinary to me dorian said hallward that you saw this in the portrait t saw something in it he answered something that seemed to me very strange well you dont mind me looking at the thing now dorian shook his head you must not ask me that basil i cannot let you stand in front of that picture you will one day wont you never well perhaps you are right and now goodbye dorian you have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art but you dont know what it cost me to tell you all that i have told you my dear basil said dorian what have you told me only that you worshipped me too much that is not even flattery it was not meant as flattery and now that i have told you something seems to have gone out of me perhaps you should never put what you worship into words you mustnt talk about worship it is foolish you and i are friends basil and we will always be friends you have got harry said the painter sadly oh harry laughed the young man harry spends his life saying and doing extraordinary things he lives the sort of life i want to live but i dont think i would go to harry if i was in trouble i would prefer to go to you basil you will sit for me again impossible there is something terrible about a portrait it has a life of its own i will come and have tea with you instead well goodbye then i am sorry that you wont let me look at the picture again but i understand what you feel about it as he left the room dorian gray smiled to himself poor basil how little he knew of the true reason and now he understood more the painters wild and jealous feelings and he felt sorry there was something tragic in a friendship so corrupted by passion he rang the bell to call his servant he had to hide the portrait immediately it had been mad of him to leave it in a place where it could be discovered by his friends chapter eight the portrait is hidden when the servant entered dorian gray asked him to send mrs leaf to him in the library mrs leaf had been with his family for many years he asked her for the key to the old schoolroom the old schoolroom mr dorian she cried but it is full of dust i must clean it first i dont want it cleaned mrs leaf i only want the key well sir youll be covered with dust if you go into it it hasnt been open for nearly five years not since your grandfather died he frowned at this reminder of his grandfather he had bad memories of all his family that does not matter he answered i just want to see the place that is all give me the key here is the key sir said the old lady but you are not going to live up there are you sir no no he cried thank you mrs leaf you can go an hour later two men arrived to move the portrait its very heavy sir said one of the men as they climbed the stairs i am afraid it is rather heavy said dorian as he opened the door of the old schoolroom where he was going to hide the secret of his corrupted soul he had not entered the room since he was a child it was a large room built by his grandfather to keep him at a distance every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round it was a room full of terrible memories but it was safe he had the key and no other person could enter it the face in the portrait could grow old and ugly what did it matter no one could see it he himself would not see it he did not have to watch the terrible corruption of his soul he would stay young that was enough when the men had gone dorian locked the door and put the key in his pocket he felt safe now no one would ever look at that horrible thing only he would ever see his shame he went back to the library and found a note from lord henry in it was a report from the newspaper about sibyl vane her death was officially described as an accident he frowned and tore the paper in two then he walked across the room and threw the pieces away how ugly it all was and how horribly real ugliness made things perhaps the servant had read the report and had begun to suspect something and yet what did it matter what had dorian gray to do with sibyl vanes death there was nothing to be afraid of dorian gray had not killed her chapter nine i will show you my soul many years passed yet the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated basil hallward stayed with dorian gray even those who had heard terrible rumours against him could not believe them when they met him he always had the look of someone who had kept himself pure many people suspected that there was something very wrong with dorians life but only he knew about the portrait some nights he would secretly enter the locked room holding a mirror in his hand he would stand in front of the picture basil hallward had painted he would look first at the horrible old face in the picture and then at the handsome young face that laughed back at him from the mirror he fell more and more in love with his own beauty and more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul then something happened that changed everything it was on the ninth of november the day before his thirtyeighth birthday he was walking home from lord henrys and the night was cold and foggy at the corner of grosvenor square and south audley street a man passed him in the fog he was walking very fast and had the collar of his coat turned up he had a bag in his hand dorian recognized him it was basil hallward a strange fear made dorian walk off quickly in the direction of his own house but hallward had seen him dorian heard him hurrying after him in a few moments his hand was on his arm dorian what an extraordinary piece of luck i have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine oclock i am going to paris on the midnight train and i wanted to see you before i left i thought it was you or at least your coat as i passed you but i wasnt sure didnt you recognize me in this fog my dear basil i cant even recognize grosvenor square i believe my house is somewhere about here but i dont feel at all certain about it i am sorry you are going away as i have not seen you for such a long time but i suppose you will be back soon no i am going to be out of england for six months here we are at your door let me come in for a moment i have something to say to you that would be lovely but wont you miss your train said dorian gray as he went up the steps and opened the door with his key i have plenty of time he answered the train doesnt go until twelvefifteen and it is only just eleven all i have with me is this bag and i can easily get to victoria station in twenty minutes dorian looked at him and smiled come in or the fog will get into my house hallward followed dorian into the library there was a bright wood fire on one side of the room and two lamps on the other would you like a drinkasked dorian no thanks i wont have anything more said the painter taking his hat and coat off and now my dear dorian i want to speak to you seriously dont frown like that you make it so much more difficult for me what is it all about cried dorian throwing himself down on the sofa i hope it is not about myself i am tired of myself tonight i would prefer to be somebody different it is about yourself answered hallward in his deep voice and i must say it to you dorian breathed deeply and lit a cigarette is it really necessary basil i think you should know some of the terrible things that people are saying about you i dont want to know anything about them i love scandals about other people but scandals about myself dont interest me every gentleman is interested in his good name dorian you dont want people to talk of you as something terrible and corrupt but i dont believe these rumours at all at least i cant believe them when i see you corruption is a thing that writes itself across a mans face it cannot be hidden my dear basil and yet i rarely see you now and you never come to my house when i hear all the terrible things people are whispering about you i dont know what to say why have so many of your friends killed themselves young men from good families like adrian singleton and that poor young soldier stop basil you are talking about things of which you know nothing said dorian i know how people talk in england this is a country where people have two faces they whisper rumours about people like myself and then do much worse things when others are not looking dorian cried hallward that is not the question i know england is bad but thats the reason i want you to be a good influence on your friends instead you have lost all belief in goodness and honesty you have filled those poor young men with a madness for pleasure dorian smiled how can you smile like that i only want you to have a clean name you have a wonderful influence let it be for good yet i wonder whether i know you but i cant answer that question i would need to see your soul to see my soul cried dorian gray he jumped up from the sofa turning almost white with fear yes answered hallward there was a deep sadness in his voice to see your soul but only god can do that a bitter laugh came from the lips of the younger man you will see it yourself tonight he cried picking up a lamp from the table come it is your own work why shouldnt you look at it you can tell the world all about it after if you want nobody will believe you if they do believe you they will like me better for it come i tell you you have talked enough about corruption now you will see it face to face there was madness in every word he said he felt a terrible delight that someone was going to share his secret the man who had painted the portrait was going to share his shame the painter would suffer for the rest of his life with the memory of what he had done yes he continued coming closer to him i will show you my soul you will see what you think only god can see hallward jumped back you cannot say things like that dorian he cried they are horrible and they dont mean anything you think so he laughed again i know so dorian you have to tell me dont touch me finish what you have to say the painter felt extraordinarily sad he walked over to the fire and stood there i am waiting basil said the young man in a hard clear voice he turned round what i have to say is this he cried you must give me some answer to the horrible things people are saying against you tell me that they are not true dorian cant you see what i am going through my god dont tell me that you are bad and corrupt and shameful dorian gray smiled come upstairs basil he said quietly i keep a diary of my life from day to day i will show it to you if you come up with me i will come with you dorian if you wish it i see i have missed my train it does not matter i can go tomorrow but dont ask me to read anything tonight all i want is a simple answer to my question i will give it to you upstairs i could not give it to you here you will not have to read for long chapter ten basil sees the portrait he passed out of the room and began climbing the stairs basil hallward followed close behind they walked softly as people always do at night the lamp made strange shadows on the wall and stairs when they reached the top dorian put the lamp down on the floor he took the key out of his pocket and turned it in the lock you really want to know basil he asked in a low voice yes i am delighted he answered smiling then he added you are the one man in the world i want to know everything about me you have influenced my life more than you think taking up the lamp he opened the door and went in cold air passed between them shut the door behind you he whispered as he placed the lamp on the table hallward looked around the room in surprise the room had clearly not been lived in for years the whole place was covered with dust and there were holes in the carpet a mouse ran across the floor so you think that it is only god who sees the soul basil take the cover off the portrait and you will see mine the voice that spoke was cold and cruel you are mad dorian said hallward frowning you wont take the cover off then i will do it myself said the young man throwing the old purple curtain to the ground a cry of fear came from the painters lips when he saw the face in the portrait it was dorian grays face he was looking at and it still had some of that wonderful beauty but now there were terrible signs of age and corruption but who had done it he held the lamp up to the picture in the left hand corner was his name painted in red what had happened he had never done that still it was his own picture he knew it and it made his blood turn to ice his own picture what did it mean why had it changed he turned and looked at dorian gray with the eyes of a sick man the young man was standing near the wall watching him he had taken the flower out of his coat and was smelling it what does this mean cried hallward at last his own voice sounded high and strange years ago when i was a boy said dorian gray closing his hand on the flower you met me and flattered me you taught me to love my beauty one day you introduced me to a friend of yours he explained to me how wonderful it was to be young you finished a portrait of me that showed me how wonderful it was to be beautiful in a mad moment i made a wish i remember it oh how well i remember it no the thing is impossible there must be something wrong with the paint i tell you the thing is impossible is anything really impossible said the young man going over to the window you told me you had destroyed it i was wrong it has destroyed me i dont believe it is my picture there was nothing bad in it nothing shameful you were perfect to me this is a face from hell it is the face of my soul each of us has heaven and hell in him basil cried dorian wildly hallward turned again to the portrait and stared at it my god is this true he cried is this what you have done with your life you must be even worse than people say hallward threw himself into the chair by the table and put his face in his hands the lamp fell to the floor and went out good god dorian what an awful lesson what an awful lesson there was no answer but he could hear the young man crying at the window we must ask god for forgiveness i worshipped you too much i am punished for it you worshipped yourself too much we are both punished dorian gray turned slowly around and looked at him there were tears in his eyes it is too late basil he said but dont you see that hellish thing staring at us dorian gray looked at the picture suddenly he felt that he hated basil hallward he hated the man sitting at the table more than he hated anything in his life he looked wildly around something shone on top of the painted cupboard that faced him it was a knife he had left there some days before he moved slowly towards it passing hallward as he did so he took the knife in his hand and turned around hallward moved in his chair he rushed at him and stuck the knife into his neck again and again he threw the knife down on the table and stood back he could hear nothing but the sound of blood falling on to the carpet he opened the door and went out on to the stairs the house was completely quiet no one was there how quickly it had all been done feeling strangely calm he walked over to the window and opened it the wind had blown the fog away and the sky was clear he looked down and saw a policeman walking down the street he was shining a lamp in all the houses closing the window he went back into the room he did not look at the murdered man he felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to think about it at all the friend who had painted the terrible portrait had gone out of his life that was enough he picked up the lamp and walked out of the room locking the door behind him as he walked down the stairs he thought that he heard what sounded like cries of pain he stopped several times and waited no everything was still when he reached the library he saw the bag and coat in the corner they must be hidden away somewhere he unlocked a secret cupboard and threw them in he could easily burn them later then he pulled out his watch it was twenty minutes to two he sat down and began to think basil hallward had left the house at eleven no one had seen him come in again the servants were in bed paris yes it was to paris that basil had gone and by the midnight train as he had planned it would be months before anyone suspected anything months he could destroy everything long before then suddenly he had a thought he put on his coat and hat and went into the front room from the window he could see the policeman passing the house he waited and held his breath after a few moments he went out of the house shutting the door very gently behind him then he began ringing the bell in about five minutes a servant appeared he was half dressed and looked very sleepy i am sorry i had to wake you up francis he said stepping in but i have forgotten my key what time is it ten minutes past two sir answered the man looking at a clock ten minutes past two how horribly late you must wake me at nine tomorrow i have some work to do all right sir did anyone call this evening mr hallward sir he stayed here until eleven and then he went away to catch his train oh i am sorry i didnt see him did he leave any message no sir he said he would write to you from paris that is all francis dont forget to call me at nine tomorrow no sir the man went off to his bedroom dorian gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the library for a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room biting his lip and thinking then he took down a book from one of the cupboards and began to turn the pages alan campbell hertford street mayfair yes that was the man he wanted chapter eleven the problem of the body at nine oclock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of chocolate and opened the curtains dorian was sleeping quite peacefully lying with one hand under his cheek as he opened his eyes a smile passed across his lips he turned round and began to drink his chocolate the november sun came into the room and the sky was bright it was almost like a morning in may slowly he remembered what had happened the night before the dead man was still sitting there and in the sunlight now how horrible that was such terrible things were for the darkness not the day after he had drunk his cup of chocolate he went over to the table and wrote two letters one he put in his pocket and the other he handed to his servant take this round to hertford street francis if mr campbell is out of town get his address when the servant had gone he lit a cigarette and began drawing on a piece of paper first he drew flowers then houses then human faces suddenly he realized that every face he drew looked like basil hallward he frowned and went over to lie on the sofa an hour went past very slowly every second he kept looking up at the clock as the minutes went by he became horribly worried he got up and walked around the room his hands were strangely cold at last the door opened and his servant entered mr campbell sir said the man the colour came back to his cheeks ask him to come in at once francis he felt himself again his fear had gone away in a few moments alan campbell walked in he looked very angry and rather worried alan this is kind of you i thank you for coming i hoped never to enter your house again gray but you said it was a question of life and death his voice was hard and cold and he kept his hands in the pockets of his coat yes it is a question of life and death alan and to more than one person sit down campbell took a chair by the table and dorian sat opposite him the two mens eyes met in dorians there was great sadness he knew that what he was going to do was terrible after a moment of silence dorian said very quietly alan in a locked room at the top of the house a dead man is sitting at a table he has been dead for ten hours now dont stir and dont look at me like that you dont need to know who this man is you dont need to know how or why he died what you have to do is this stop gray i dont want to know anything more i dont care if what you tell me is true or not true i dont want any part in your life keep your horrible secrets to yourself they dont interest me any more alan they will have to interest you i am awfully sorry for you alan but i cant help myself you are the one man who can save me alan you are a scientist you know about chemistry and things of that kind what you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs you are mad dorian i will have nothing to do with this he killed himself alan i am glad of that but who made him do it you i suppose do you still refuse to do this for me of course i refuse you have come to the wrong man go to some of your friends dont come to me alan it was murder i killed him you dont know what he made me suffer murder good god dorian is that what you have come to i will have nothing to do with it you must have something to do with it dont ask any more questions i have told you too much already but you must do this we were friends once alan dont speak of those days dorian they are dead they will hang me for this alan dont you understand they will kill me for what i have done campbell got up to leave i will not have anything to do with this you refuse yes the same look of sadness came into dorian grays eyes then he took a piece of paper and wrote something on it he read it over and pushed it across the table then he got up and went over to the window campbell looked at him in surprise and picked up the paper as he read it his face went white and he fell back in his chair after two or three minutes without speaking dorian came and stood next to him i am very sorry for you alan he said putting his hand on his shoulder but there is no other way i have a letter written already here it is you see the address if you dont help me i will send it you know what will happen but you are going to help me it is impossible for you to refuse now campbell put his face in his hands the thing is quite simple alan it has to be done face it and do it a terrible sound came from campbells lips come alan you must decide now alan paused for a moment is there a fire in the room upstairs yes there is a gas fire i must go home and get some things no alan you must not leave the house write out what you want and my servant will get the things for you it was nearly two oclock when the servant returned with an enormous wooden box filled with the things campbell had asked for you can have the rest of the day to yourself francis thank you sir when the servant had left the two men carried the box up the stairs dorian took out the key and turned it in the lock then he stopped and campbell saw that his eyes were full of tears i dont think i can go in alan he said i dont need you said campbell coldly dorian half opened the door as he did so he saw the face of the portrait staring in the sunlight he remembered that the night before he had forgotten to cover the picture he was about to rush forward when he saw something that made him jump back there was blood on one of the hands in the portrait how horrible it was he hurried into the room trying not to look at the dead man picking the curtain off the floor he threw it over the picture then he rushed out of the room and down the stairs it was long after seven when campbell came back into the library he was quiet and white in the face but very calm i have done what you asked me to do he said and now goodbye let us never see each other again you have saved me alan i cannot forget that said dorian simply when campbell had left he went upstairs there was a horrible smell in the room but the thing that had been sitting at the table was gone chapter twelve why do you look so young dont tell me that you are going to be good cried lord henry youre quite perfect dont change dorian gray shook his head no harry i have done too many terrible things in my life i am not going to do any more but tell me what is happening here in london i have been out of the country for more than a month people are still discussing poor basils disappearance are they not bored with that yet said dorian pouring out some wine and frowning my dear boy they have only been talking about it for six weeks the british only need one subject of conversation every three months they have been very lucky recently though first there was the scandal of my wife leaving me and then alan campbell killed himself now there is the mysterious disappearance of an artist the british police are saying that basil did take the midnight train on the ninth of november but the french police are sure that he never arrived in paris at all what do you think has happened to basil asked dorian holding up his wine against the light i have no idea if basil wants to hide himself it is no business of mine if he is dead i dont want to think about him death is the only thing that ever frightens me i hate it why said the younger man in a tired voice because said lord henry it is the only thing that is final let us have our coffee in the music room dorian you must play chopin to me the man who ran away with my wife played chopin beautifully poor victoria i was very fond of her the house is quite lonely without her dorian said nothing but went into the next room and sat at the piano after the coffee had been brought in he stopped playing harry he said looking over at lord henry do you think basil was murdered lord henry yawned everyone liked basil who would want to murder him he was not clever enough to have enemies of course he was a wonderful painter but a man can paint like velasquez and yet still be rather boring basil was really rather boring the only thing that interested me about him was that he worshipped you i was very fond of basil said dorian sadly but dont people say he was murdered oh some newspapers do but i dont think it is likely i know there are awful places in paris but basil was not the sort of man to go to them what would you say harry if i told you that i had murdered basil said the younger man he watched him carefully after he had spoken no dorian you would not murder anyone it is ordinary people who murder it is their way of finding the extraordinary pleasure that art gives us a way of finding the extraordinary pleasure do you think that a man who has murdered could do it again dont tell me that oh anything becomes a pleasure if you do it too often cried lord henry laughing that is one of the most important secrets of life i believe though that murder is always a mistake one should never do anything one cannot talk about after dinner but let us pass from poor basil i wish i could believe that he has died some romantic death but i cant he probably fell into the seine off a bus i can see him now lying on his back in the dirty green water during the last ten years he had not been painting well lord henry walked across the room and touched the head of a strange grey bird that he kept in the music room then he turned to face dorian yes he continued taking his handkerchief out of his pocket his painting seemed to me to have lost something when you and he stopped being great friends he stopped being a great artist what was it that separated you i suppose he bored you if so he never forgave you by the way what happened to that wonderful portrait he did of you i dont think i have ever seen it since he finished it i told you years ago that it was stolen oh i remember you never got it back what a shame it really was wonderful i remember i wanted to buy it i wish i had it now i never really liked it said dorian i am sorry i sat for it the memory of the thing is hateful to me how sad you look dont be so serious play me some music dorian and as you play tell me in a low voice why you still look so young i am only ten years older than you are and i have grey hair and yellow skin you are really wonderful dorian harry please you have never looked more charming than you do tonight you remind me of the day i first saw you you were very shy and absolutely extraordinary you have changed of course but not in appearance you are still the same i am not the same harry yes you are the same i wish i could change places with you dorian the world has cried out against us both but it has always worshipped you it always will worship you life has been your art dorian got up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair yes life has been beautiful he said quietly but i am not going to have the same life harry and you must not say these things to me you dont know everything about me i think that if you did even you would turn away from me you laugh dont laugh why have you stopped playing dorian let us go to the club it has been a charming evening and we must end it charmingly there is someone i want to introduce to you young lord poole he has already copied your ties and he very much wants to meet you he is quite charming and he reminds me of you i hope not said dorian with a sad look in his eyes but i am tired tonight harry i wont go to the club it is nearly eleven and i want to go to bed early please stay you have never played so well as tonight it is because i am going to be good he answered smiling i am a little changed already you cant change to me dorian said lord henry you and i will always be friends come round tomorrow we shall go to lunch do you really want me to come harry certainly the park is quite lovely now i dont think there have been such flowers since the year i met you very well i shall be here at eleven said dorian goodnight harry chapter thirteen to kill the past it was a lovely night he walked home with his coat on his arm smoking his cigarette two young men in evening dress passed him he heard one of them whisper to the other that is dorian gray he remembered how pleased he used to be when he was stared at or talked about he was tired of hearing his own name now when he reached home he found his servant waiting up for him he sent him to bed and threw himself down on the sofa in the library he began to think about some of the things that lord henry had said to him was it really true that one could never change there had been a time when he had been good and innocent he had corrupted himself and become a terrible influence on others he had even got pleasure from this corruption yet his soul had once been the purest of all was all that gone was there no hope for him in one terrible moment of passion he had asked to stay young for all time all his failure had been because of that he had not been punished but perhaps punishment was what he had needed punishment cleaned the soul the mirror that lord henry had given to him so many years ago now was standing on the table he picked it up remembering that horrible night when he had first noticed the change in the picture once someone who had loved him passionately had written him a mad letter it had ended with these words the world is changed because you are made of gold he repeated them to himself and suddenly realized that he hated his own beauty throwing the mirror on the floor he broke the glass into little pieces with his foot it was his beauty that had spoiled him it was better not to think of the past nothing could change that he had to think of his future alan campbell had shot himself one night and his terrible secret had died with him the interest in basil hallwards disappearance would soon pass away he was perfectly safe there what worried him was the death of his own soul basil had painted the portrait that had destroyed his life he could not forgive him that it was the portrait that had done everything the murder had just been the madness of the moment as for alan campbell he had killed himself it was nothing to do with dorian gray a new life that was what he wanted that was what he was waiting for perhaps it had begun already he would never again spoil innocence he would be good he began to wonder if the portrait in the locked room had changed was it still as horrible as it had been perhaps if his life became pure the face in the portrait would become beautiful again he would go and look he took the lamp from the table and went upstairs as he opened the door a smile of happiness passed across his young face yes he would be good and the ugly thing he had locked away would not frighten him any more he felt happier already he went in quietly locking the door behind him walking straight over to the portrait he took off the purple curtain that was covering it an angry cry of pain came from him he could see no change the thing was still hateful more hateful even than before the red mark on the hand seemed brighter and more like new blood and why was the red mark larger than it had been it was all over the fingers now there was blood on the painted feet and blood on the hand that had not held the knife what did it all mean that he should go to the police that he should tell the whole story and be put to death he laughed he felt the idea was absurd if he did tell them now who would believe him there was nothing left of the murdered man anywhere he had destroyed everything belonging to basil hallward he himself had burned the bag and the coat they would simply say he was mad was this murder to follow him all his life was he always going to suffer because of his past yet what could he do go to the police never there was only one thing they could use against him and that was the picture itself he would destroy it why had he kept it so long once it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old recently he had felt no such pleasure it had kept him awake at night when he had been away he had been frightened that another person would see it just the memory of it spoiled many moments of happiness he would destroy it he looked around and saw the knife that had killed basil hallward he had cleaned it many times until there was no mark left on it it was bright and it shone it had killed the painter now it would kill the painters work and all that it meant it would kill the past when that was dead he would be free he picked up the knife and pushed it into the picture there was a cry and a crash the cry was so horrible that frightened servants woke and came out of their rooms two gentlemen who were passing in the square below stopped and looked up at the great house they hurried on until they met a policeman and brought him back the policeman rang the bell several times but there was no answer except for a light in one of the top windows the house was all dark after a time he went away and stood in the garden of the next house and watched whose house is that asked the older of the two gentlemen mr dorian grays sir answered the policeman they looked at each other as they walked away and laughed cruelly they knew who dorian gray was inside the house the servants were talking in low whispers to each other old mrs leaf was crying francis was as white as death after about a quarter of an hour they went fearfully upstairs they knocked but there was no reply they called out everything was still they tried the door it was locked finally they got on the roof and came into the room through the window when they entered the room they found a portrait hanging on the wall it showed mr dorian gray as they had last seen him young and beautiful lying on the floor was a dead man in evening dress he had a knife in his heart he was old and horribly ugly it was not until they saw his rings that they recognized who the man was the end
