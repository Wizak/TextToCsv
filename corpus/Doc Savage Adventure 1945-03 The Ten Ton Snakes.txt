 i you ought to know about ribbons the yellow one with the two red stripes is for china service the red ribbon with the pair of triple white stripe good conduct purple with white ends purple heart blue red and white stripes distinguished service cross blue yellow and red bands the yangtze medal the years and the terrors of a mans life worn over his heart this boy had all of these ribbons except the goodconduct one he didnt have that one he was wearing them too they looked like a flag on his chest normally he didnt wear them he carried them in his pocket in a little teakwood velvetlined case wonderfully made for him by a karen in burma the boy felt very deeply about them but he wouldnt have admitted it for anything however he wasnt exactly a boy he was over twentyeight not old enough for that gray to belong in his hair he was leathery and rangy and longnosed and blueeyed and he looked at you as if he owned you that is a thing american soldiers are beginning to do look at you as if they own you and they do in a way he had a callous like a corn on a finger of his left hand his ocalibre trigger finger and now they were trying to kill him he was walking down fifth avenue looking looking at everything gladly and hungrily as if he wanted to eat it looking at the legs of the girls walking on fifth avenue ogling the plasterofparis legs of the mannikins in the store windows going woowoo at the girls walking by him on the street he wanted to jump over the buildings you could tell he would get up on his toes and dance a step or two and whirl completely around like a ballet dancer as if god had given him wings murder it was a very carefully planned thing this project of sudden death it was getting the care that a murder deserves the boy with the ribbons the boy who was so glad that he was almost sick at his stomach was going to be slain in cold blood cold blood if anyone knows why they call it that it was hard to be sure how many men were going to help do it to him thousands of people were on fifth avenue probably no more nor less than are there any days the murderers were of the crowd and like the crowd pointing them out would have been as difficult as picking four maggots who had had catfish for dinner from a basketful of other maggots who had had sunfish for dinner very difficult they werent doing anything to get fingers pointed at them keeping track of the boy was all waiting but waiting has its end suspense can draw out just about so far and then something must happen so one of the men walked up behind the boy with a long knife and started to put the blade in between the boys third and fourth ribs where it would reach the boys happy heart it was a walkupandstab murder but the sun was shining gaily making shadows the sun made the shadow of the man with the knife on the sidewalk and it looked like exactly what it was a man with a knife this the soldier saw the soldier did more than dodge the army had spent a lot in time and patience teaching him what to do when someone tried to shoot club or stab him he did it he did it so fast you could hardly see it slam slam too fast to follow but the knife was spinning in the air and he whod held it was on his back with teeth loose in his mouth and an awful feeling where hed been kicked in the belly it was an army bellykick commando stuff intended to gut a man if possible it was no fooling the man fell on the sidewalk he might as well have been dead he was noisy and he was hurting but otherwise he might as well have been dead the boy looked at the man you blank blank he said i think i know you he circled looking at the man on the sidewalk why god bless you i do know you the soldier said what do you know about that doggone and he began being unnice to the man on the sidewalk what the soldier proceeded to do was sickening but it didnt sicken he had been dealing with japs and the only safe jap was one who couldnt be anything else he kicked in some of the mans ribs the man was long and skinny like a wolf with the sickness wolves get from eating too much carrion so his ribs were close to the hide and broke easily the soldier jumped on to the mans belly with both feet this was guaranteed to rupture to burst the bladder etc the soldier got off the mans belly and leaned over the mans face and said listen bub to what im asking you is tucker french my brother all right is he going to be all right what do you suchandsuch plan to do to tucker the man on the sidewalk gargled his blood and teeth and pain come on boy the soldier said lets have an answer dont be bashful no answer come come boy the soldier said what about tucker youre not going to hurt tucker are you no answer oh yes i nearly forgot the soldier said what about the heavy stuff you boys fixing to do something bad with the heavy stuff the man on the sidewalk finally got his throat sufficiently clear of blood and teeth to form some semicoherent words when he spoke he was down to greatest fundamental of all the thing than which there is nothing much more important he said please dont kill me he said not to kill him in spanish because spanish and not english was his mother tongue as if answering his prayer his friends came to his aid the soldier was fooled this time there were no shadows to warn him there was only a mild looking man in a blue serge suit who sidled up to the scene with one hand over his mouth as if he was showing horror the way a woman shows it when he was close enough to the soldier he slugged the soldier on the side of the face the soldier wasnt greatly damaged he began to fight he wanted to fight anyway two other men drifted out of the crowd and took a hand beginning beating the soldier hey this guy tried to knife me the soldier cried cut it out call a cop if you want to help this was what he said before he understood that they were part of an organized attempt on his life when he did realize what they were he stopped talking he did everything with his fists and feet that he could the men finding the soldier was extremely tough began producing knives these knives did not resemble the knife the first man had tried to use except in one particular they were individualized knives that is each one was a knife which its owner liked which meant that they were men who carried their knives as a habit such men would know how to use knives so the soldier got away from them as fast as he could he escaped by running he didnt make the mistake of going in either direction along the sidewalk instead he popped into the nearest doorway they shot at him the bullet went past his head and buried itself somewhere in the upper pant of the luggage shop in which he found himself the soldier was afraid the place wouldnt have a back door he was right but it had a basement and a second floor he took the stairs to the second floor there was a bank of elevators and he got in one of them and rode down to the basement which was also a part of the leathergoods store he waited around there for a while looking at suitcases he had the clerk show him a tan leather case and faced the stairs and the elevators while he examined it he saw nor heard nothing alarming he asked the clerk if there was a back door and the clerk got such a funny look that the soldier walked off and left him the soldier walked out of the front door the man who had tried to knife him was no longer on the sidewalk the man was nowhere in sight none of the other knifewielders were to be seen nobody recognized the soldier as a participant in the action of a few minutes before the soldier didnt stick around long enough to give them much chance he went to a bar he had three snorts of rye he burst out in a sweat and he became sick with the feeling that nerves give to a mans stomach he was plain scared after he felt that he was able to walk down the street without falling on his face he got moving he went to a phone booth and looked in the phone book for a name renwick john civil engr john renwick civil engineer had an office in a ponderous building two blocks from grand central station on fortieth street the office was not quite seedy but it had no floss the furniture was old of walnut and the middleaged office girl also looked as if she were made of walnut she listened to the soldier state that he wanted to see renwick if renwick was in town hes in town the office girl said wait a minute she went into the inner office closed the door and put her back against the door a soldier to see you she said gives his name as bob french says he met you at yungshun wherever that is yungshun renny renwick said is in china you first noticed renny renwicks fists they were too big he was a big man more than six feet more than two hundred pounds but the fists were still too big the fists as a matter of fact were the index to the man they were capable hands almost ridiculously strong hands that were not made for soft work or for softness of any kind gentleness yes but not softness there were scars on the fists where they had hit things and the hide was leathery where the sun had beat them and the palms calloused from handling heavy things hunan province in china he said thats where we built that intermediate field for the bs holy cow was that a place for you shoot this soldier in here the middleaged office girl opened the door and told the soldier shoot you in he says the soldier came in holding out his hand and saying you remember me renwick jumped to his feet and roared hell yes holy cow he roared what are you doing here did they run out of rice whiskey in china youre the last man i expected to see my time was up and they shipped me home the soldier said when was that a week ago only a week what are you doing sober sit down what became of sleepy wilson and what about whatshisname the flopeared guy we stole the jeep from that night the soldier didnt answer the questions he started to but his words stubbed their toes on his fears and fell flat on their faces what he did say was look im in trouble renwick grinned and roared borrowing money from me is getting blood from a turnip but not for a man from yungshun how much do you need i dont need money no youve come to the wrong man then i dont know anything about women this isnt a girl renwick examined the soldier intently whats your name he asked i never did know it i dont think bob french all right bob french sit down and see if you cant talk that scared look off your face bob french sat down its a story that has its goofy aspects shoot ii renny renwicks voice was a great tumbling thing developed by bawling at steeljacks on towering skyscraper frameworks and bawling above the clatter of riveting guns the voice had been rattling the windows almost now that he was silent listening for the soldiers story there seemed almost too much stillness in the office its a shame to drag this in on you bob french said but youre the only man i could think of that i knew in new york and im scared what are you scared of heres the story i got a brother see his name is tucker he is younger than me and hes in south america colombia back in the jungles hes in the mining business in a small way american citizen bob french took his eyes off renwick and put them on the floor and didnt say anything for a moment yes i dont know why the draft missed him okay bob french shoved his jaw out and said okay or not i dont give a damn ive done enough fighting for all of our family and im glad tucker kept out of it and i hope to god he continues keeping out of it he sounded violent as if he were taking something out of his heart renny laughed was i picking a fight with you the soldier licked his lips he looked at the floor some more i got a cable from my brother that was two days ago i had cabled tucker i was back in the states and had a twentyoneday furlough that was just starting so thats how he knew i was back and where to find me this cable was funny it said for me to go see a man named sir roger powell who would be at the westland it said for me to ask powell about the heavy stuff i was to ask powell what the situation was on the heavy stuff it said the cable said to try to form a judgment about powell well i did an what renny interrupted did the cable mean by asking you to form a judgment decide about powell decide what whether he was a crook or not i guess what is the heavy stuff thats all the cable said heavy stuff you mean it just said to ask about the heavy stuff and that was all the description it gave yes and from that what did you gather the heavy stuff was i couldnt figure it out whats your guess i havent got any guess then you have no idea what the heavy stuff could be none the soldier said i told you this thing had goofy aspects thats one of them mind letting me see this cablegram id be glad to show it to you only i havent got it what became of it i destroyed it why habit i have the habit of destroying all the letters and telegrams i receive when theyre not something i have to keep ive done that for years i guess what did you do after you got the cablegram from your brother renny asked settling back to listen again bob french seemed to require a moment to get his mind back on the telling of his story then he said i went to see sir roger powell i found him at the hotel as tuckers cablegram had said i would i sent my name up to his room and he returned word for me to come right up well that name of sir roger powell had sure fooled me the soldier continued i expected an old geezer with a monocle and a white goatee sir roger powell wasnt anything like that he could have been an insurance agent in kansas city for all you could tell is he a genuine title renny asked search me if youre a genuine sir dont you have to sit in the house of lords or in parliament or something search me renny said i wouldnt know anyway powell didnt admit knowing anything about any heavy stuff he knew my brother that was all he would admit you think then that he lied to you renny asked everything he said might not be lies but he sure lied about the heavy stuff whatever it is how do you know i can tell when a man lies to me always i could tell this time bob french said he was lying all right there was another guy in the room with him i didnt like the fellows looks either well i talked to this powell fellow asking him about the heavy stuff and i didnt get a thing out of him he just said he knew nothing about any such thing and that he was very sorry but i got the feeling he wasnt sorry and that he knew plenty about the heavy stuff whatever it is and that the only thing he was sorry about was seeing me my showing up that way worried him all right well i left the soldier scowled at the floor for a moment i cabled my brother the results of the interview he said i asked him what he wanted me to do have you had an answer not yet renny said you said you were scared i dont see any reason for your being scared wait a minute i havent told you what happened just before i came up here renny waited patiently he was interested in the story he was excited about it too and his eyes were bright and intent they tried to kill me on the street the soldier said first a man tried to knife me i knocked him down i was pretty rough some other men piled in to help too many for me i figured so i cut and ran and here i am how renny asked did you connect this attack with sir roger powell the man your brother cabled you to interview about the heavy stuff this guy with the knife was with powell when we had our talk renny raised his eyebrows over this piece of information that would be a connection all right but i dont exactly see what you want me to do look youre the only man in new york i know bob french said ive got some funny trouble on my hands as you can see im scared ive had practice in being scared because ive killed japs and had japs trying to kill me and ive been scared for a week at a time and i can still get scared like when those guys tried to kill me right on the street like that they tried to kill me i tell you i never heard of such a damned thing so thats why you came to me renny said thats right the soldier said i got to know you in china and i figured you would be the man to help me or advise me the soldier hesitated then added sheepishly dont get me wrong i dont expect you to drop your business and grab a gun and rush out to fight my battles for me just kick in with some advice thats what i want when a man is scared it helps to have someone around who understands you didnt renny said come to me because you knew i was associated with doc savage eh youre what with who associated with doc savage whos he bob french asked renny thought over the answer for a moment then he laughed thats fresh he said thats wonderful what are you laughing at bob french demanded renny chuckled over it for a while the idea of you not having heard of doc savage coupled with the coincidence of your popping up with a piece of mysterious trouble like this strikes me as funny he explained whos this savage a friend with whom i frequently work renny said then he frowned and shook his head quickly no that isnt the way to put it lets change that and say that several years ago i met the most remarkable man i have ever seen a man with so much ability that it sounds silly when you start telling the truth about him ill explain what i mean by silly by saying that his profession is other peoples troubles righting wrongs and punishing evildoers in the far corners of the earth see how wild that sounds like something out of a book about knighthood it gives you an idea you work for this fellow that it bob french demanded i work with him not for him renny corrected there are five of us who do that im an engineer im the engineering specialist the others are also specialists one is an electrician one a chemist one a geologist and archaeologist and the other a lawyer renny was silent a moment grinning heres something else unusual about it none of us get paid for it bob french stared fixedly at renny when i knew you in china i figured you were a pretty levelheaded guy and now you dont think so i dont know what to think this sure sounds pixyish renny chuckled youll understand it when you meet doc savage the man of bronze as they call him sometimes bob french gave a visible jump and said the man of and didnt finish the newspapers call doc the man of bronze now and then renny said have you heard of him under that description i guess i have the soldier said renny watched the soldier curiously bob french wasnt a fellow who hid his feelings very well renny could tell what was going through frenchs mind first french mentally reviewed what he had heard about doc savage this review for some reason or other made french apprehensive french suddenly decided that he didnt want doc savage involved in the affair if you dont mind french said lets you and i work out this thing ourselves you mean you dont want doc to know about this id rather not why bob french didnt reply immediately he was becoming cautious stopping to plan his words this isnt a very important affair and savage is a man who is accustomed to large matters if what i recall about him is right i dont think we should bother him with this didnt someone try to murder you renny demanded yes but isnt that important well a murder is always important renny said well go to doc with this thing waitll i get my hat and coat renny went into an adjoining room which bob french decided must serve the bigfisted engineer as living quarters at least french got a glimpse of a cot and a dresser through the open door now that renny was out of sight some of the emotion inside french suddenly appeared on his face the emotion a sick apprehension got the best of him for a moment he went to the door leading into the reception room and opened it not as a man who was in flight but as a man who was so worried that he felt the need of moving about it was when he made the unexpected discovery that the middleaged office girl was not in the outer office that frenchs frightened brain hatched a quick plan the key in the partition door was on the inside he had already noticed that he seized the key and changed it to the other side of the door stepped through closed the door quietly and locked it he lifted his voice yelled renny watch out for gods sake he screamed the last part he snatched up the office girls chair and broke it over her desk he hurled the fragments against the connecting door he emitted a series of loud grunts and gasps and shoved the office girls desk around renny hit the other side of the partition door rattling the locked doorknob french whats happening renny yelled theyve jumped me the soldier howled he stamped and slapped the desk he seized his blouse deliberately tore it half in two up the back wrenched off the blousehalf including the sleeve and threw it on the floor then he ran out into the corridor he had been afraid someone would have heard the uproar and come into the corridor to investigate but no one had bob french ran to the door at the end of the corridor which was marked exit this led to the stairs he went down the stairs in clattering haste iii half an hour later renny renwick was saying to doc savage he got a cable from his brother to ask a man named powell about something called the heavy stuff renny went on with the story and doc listened doc savage was a taller man than renny renwick and probably as heavy but it was only when he was near renwick that this was apparent standing apart doc seemed of slighter stature most muscular men and most big men look muscular or big doc didnt there were two or three startling things about his appearance his hair was bronzecolored and only slightly darker than the sun had made his skin he had golden eyes that were unusual almost weird otherwise he was not particularly handsome he dressed with an obvious effort to make himself inconspicuous but with little success he was a man who would be conspicuous anywhere he had received an excited telephone call from renny he had hurried to renwicks office and now he listened to the story of bob frenchs visit they grabbed him renny concluded when i was in the other room getting my hat and coat they must have jerked him into the reception room and locked the door between the two offices before he began to fight the fight must have been a beaut it only lasted a couple of seconds because it was over and everybody was gone by the time i could find something heavy enough to break down the door you searched for french doc asked he had a voice which was somewhat startling because of the impression it gave of controlled volume and power it had a quality which highly trained voices have sure i looked i ran into the corridor yelling for french i didnt get an answer i dashed back and telephoned the elevator starter downstairs to keep his eyes open for a man of frenchs description but i must have been too late because french hasnt left since he might still be in the building of course where did this fight take place the reception room doc said lets have a look in the reception room he picked up the broken pieces of the office girls chair and examined them where was your office girl he asked mrs carter goes home at four renny explained it was about fourfifteen when this happened she had already gone the office girls desk was overturned on the floor where was the desk placed before doc asked lets put it back where it was renny returned the desk to its original position about here i think he said doc savage examined the desk and thoughtfully compared the parts of the chair to the marks on the top of the desk he gave more attention to scratches on the side of the desk renny said they tore half of his blouse off him here it is doc looked at the blouse would you like to hear some sherlock holmes work on this he asked what do you mean renny inquired nobody attacked your man doc said he staged the thing himself renny scratched his head doubtfully i dont see how you figure that there was only a narrow space between the desk and the wall where the office girls chair would normally have been doc stood there from the marks on the desk the chair was swung by someone standing about here he said youll notice there is hardly room for anyone to have been in front of the chair when it was swung indicating french picked up the chair and smashed it down on the desk the marks on the side of the desk indicate it was kicked several times in the same place that could happen in a fight but it is hardly likely none of the chair fragments show traces of having hit a man a chair or even a chair leg is a heavy weapon and if you struck a man with one some blood or hair or hide should adhere to the weapon renny nodded thoughtfully of course any one of those freak things could happen in a fight doc added but it isnt likely that all of them would happen in the same fight holy cow renny said now that you bring this up i remember that french didnt seem so happy about bringing you into the case oh he showed some reluctance yes he did at first he didnt seem to know who you were then it dawned on him that he had heard of you and right away he suggested that we shouldnt bother you with his trouble did he give any reason no he only said that he didnt think we should bother an important man like you with the matter renny said doggone it i should have attached more importance to his reluctance it looks as if he staged a fake attack then escaped down the stairs thats the way it seems all right doc asked when french first began asking you for help did he seem sincere as sincere as anything when did he change when he realized who you were as i understand it you first told him that you would bring me into the thing calling me by name doc said was that when french got excited no he got excited when it dawned on him who you were hed heard of you as the man of bronze i mentioned that was who you were and that was when he changed his mind about wanting you in it doc looked thoughtfully at the half portion of bob frenchs coat he wanted us to investigate the thing doc said but he didnt want to appear in it himself any more renny was startled how you figure that he must have staged the fake attack to get us excited doc pointed out otherwise he would have merely slipped away from you renny clapped a hand to his forehead by god thats right whats the matter with my brains anyway doc went through the half of bob frenchs blouse in the pockets he found cigarettes book matches two chinese cash coins with square holes in their middles an english shilling coin a cigar renny scrutinized the book matches none of this stuff means anything i thought the matches might but theyre from a chain outfit that has branches all over the city doc indicated a small white cloth tab clipped to the blouse collar it had inked markings laundry tag doc said renny brightened by golly thats as good as an address doesnt the new york police have a directory of these laundry marks i think so doc said but tracing it down is going to take time we want to talk to this sir roger powell fellow without delay so we had better turn the job of tracing down the laundry mark over to monk good idea renny agreed monk mayfair was the only other one of their group who was in new york or in the united states for that matter monk was lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair the chemist of their outfit doc got monk on the telephone the blouse with the laundry mark will be in rennys desk in his office doc said after he had told monk what had happened your job is to get it check back the laundry mark with the police and find bob french if you can better not waste any time monk had a small squeaky voice he wasnt too happy about the assignment you guys wouldnt be shoving off some routine on me so you can go after the exciting part he demanded what makes you think that monk snorted ive had some previous experience if youre not interes oh ill go after the laundry angle monk said hastily but its funny i always get this leg work doc mentioned monks reluctance to renny renwick while they were riding an elevator down to the street renny said monk always finds something to squawk about but hes worse lately i think he misses fussing with ham brooks since ham went to europe to work on that legal tangle the nazis left doc agreed that monk certainly missed ham he added that it was a relief though not to have to listen to the quarrel the two had carried on for years and not to have to put up with the practical jokes the two liked to pull on each other they got a cab the westland renny said thats on madison aint it the driver asked right during the ride renny told doc savage what he knew about bob french on the yurigshun job on which renny had been supervising engineer french had been with the army engineer group assigned to the project renny had been assigned the same living quarters as french a chinese farmers house and they had become friends in the same fashion as any two men would become friends under the same circumstances frenchs twofisted ability had impressed renny it was rennys opinion that french would have been a major or a colonel french was a buck sergeant if the man had been more amenable to discipline french was one of those fellows who didnt regard the war as a career hadnt the slightest intention of staying in the army a minute longer than was necessary and got away with anything and everything he could some of it he didnt get away with he had been busted back to private grade several times for just helling around but there was nothing wrong with bob frenchs warmaking he was a guy who was in it to lick the japs and nazis and the hell with the rest of it renny had liked him none of which shed much light on the matter at hand renny admitted heres the westland doc said looking out at a radio prowl car a detective squad car and a police ambulance iv holy cow renny said things dont look too peaceful around here doc paid off their cab and entered the westland it was a luxury hotel modernistic chrome and black with surrealist murals on the walls not garish though and not cheap in the cavernous indirectly lighted lobby business was proceeding as usual however the doorman and another man evidently the assistant manager were standing with two detectives they were okaying people who entered it was apparent when one of the plainclothes sleuths came over and stopped doc and renny you are not guests here i believe the officer said doc produced a billfold and leafed through the assortment of permits licenses memberships cards and identification cards he found what he wanted the detective looked at the document and said huh explosively doc said if whatever has happened here concerns a man named powell well want the lowdown on it the detective glanced from doc to renny dubiously then said youd better wait here a minute he went to a telephone and spoke over it reading from the card doc had given him during part of his conversation coming back the officer said okay sorry to keep you waiting this is the first time i have had one of these things sprung on me the card doc had given him was an honorary commission in the new york city police force whats going on doc asked fellow named powell got shot at the officer explained he doesnt know who did it he says were checking people in and out of the hotel in hopes of getting a line on something no luck yet can you help us i havent met powell doc said what do you want to see him about the detective asked on a private matter doc said the police detective didnt like the answer he still held docs card of identification he glanced at it as if wondering how much weight it carried people are generally better off if they give us information when we ask for it the officer said finally thinly veiling a threat im sure they are doc told him where will we find powell hes in his suite eighteeneleven the officer said reluctantly riding up in the elevator renny said the cop was disappointed doc nodded normally i would not advise anyone to withhold information from the police but unfortunately the newspapers have an uncanny facility at finding out what the police are doing and we can do without any front page splurges sir roger powell was a lithe neat youngacting middleaged man in a blue pinstripe suit and white shirt his black hair stood up like a fresh brush and his moustache was a work of art he opened a door which had two holes bullet holes in the panel after they knocked on it ah some more police he said not unpleasantly not exactly doc told him you are powell powell hesitated smiled said well you must be newspapermen then wont you come in yes im powell they entered and there was a uniformed police patrolman sitting in a chair watching the door intently he had a revolver on his lap doc went to the policeman and showed him the same identification he had shown the police detective downstairs mind if we talk to powell privately doc asked the cop knew what the identification meant he had a better idea than the detective he said be okay if i wait out in the hall sure the cop went out powell stared at doc and renny i say have a bit of influence havent you renny said my name is renwick this is doc savage mr powell powell was startled into being very english ill be damned really i will he said you know i thought there was something familiar about you weve met before doc asked ive met your reputation a number of times powell said amiably i never saw you personally before that i know about i think id have remembered old boy the suite was large airy and expensive looking through a door there was a bedroom and on the floor and on a rack were two pieces of handsome monogrammed luggage from the looks of the walls at least five bullets had clouted into the plaster the floors had not been swept and some of the plaster had been tracked on the carpet any idea why were here doc asked powell gave them his smile again considering that i have lately had a gun emptied at me that would be a logical guess as to the reason i believe you know a man named bob french doc said all amiability almost all emotion left powells face while he looked at them oh that he said know him i met powell said a man who claimed to be bob french doc said he came to see renwick here renwick knew him in china he wanted rennys help when he found out that i was associated with renny he changed his mind about the help he ducked out powell frowned he got out a cloth bag of tobacco and a book of papers and went to work on a cigarette he didnt look like a man who would be rolling his own it didnt fit him he took plenty of time to think while he was rolling the cigarette he said ordinarily i wouldnt call that a sound reason for your being here that was no reason it was something to start us talking doc explained i could powell said tell you to go to hell are you powell laughed there was utterly no humor in the laugh tell doc savage that naturally not he said because i have heard of savage i have heard that you make a business of helping people out of trouble provided the trouble is unusual enough to interest you however im going to ask you one question just whom do you think you are helping out of trouble bob french renny said powell turned to renny pardon me but i dont get it bob french ran away hes a pal of mine and he was scared renny said he came to me for help hes going to get help perhaps he doesnt want it now he hasnt said so and youre going to help him if we can powells laugh came still without heartiness in anyone else that would be unreasonable you must admit you have no actual interest in the matter the man who asked you for aid apparently doesnt want it now he examined them and suddenly smiled as if he understood them thoroughly but of course i dont consider your interest as unreasonable ive heard of you and i know that the things you do which are seemingly without motive really have a very strong motive which is your love of excitement doc asked patiently do we talk about bob french or not of course we talk powell said powell snuffed out his cigarette then took a stand facing them his back to the window so that intentionally or not the light was in their eyes and they couldnt see his face too well theres much i dont understand i want to say that first he told them renny said begin with bob frenchs brother youre supposed to know him with tucker french that was where i was going to begin anyway i got acquainted with tucker in colombia south america tucker french is one of those somewhat strange and mysterious white men who take their living in one way or another out of the jungle powell wheeled abruptly and went into the bedroom he came back with one of the neat monogrammed traveling bags opened it and showed them the contents the bag held twoway airplane radios of the smaller sort and a salesmans prospectus of larger outfits i sell this stuff powell said i sell it in south america and thats how i met tucker french he wanted a portable radio for use in the jungle and i sold him one and we became acquaintances i suppose you would call us friends except for one thing i never got to know too much about tucker he closed the suitcase then he resumed his stance with the light at his back three weeks ago i happened to mention to tucker french that i was coming to new york to brush up on my contacts with manufacturers and new postwar types of radio equipment he asked me to bring a shipment of snake skins to new york for him i agreed so i was given a very heavy box of snake skins or rather the box was put aboard the ship which was to bring me to new york after having been passed by the colombian officials who in times like these examine the things which are exported i came to new york and the customs officials here passed the box of snake skins and i had them transferred to the warehouse where i usually store my radios the case of snake skins was very heavy i was to contact a firm named blassett and morris about the snake skins i did so blassett and morris said they didnt deal in snake skins they didnt know tucker french either and said theyd never had any dealings with him powell paused and puffed his cigarette you see the thing was beginning to get strange he said doc savage asked what did you do next i cabled tucker french the facts i have not received an answer the same day this man saying he was bob french called on me and made some mysterious remarks about something he called the heavy stuff i told him i knew nothing about it powell paused again this time to get their attention remember im not sure tucker french has a brother he said tucker never mentioned having one what happened after bob frenchs visit doc asked nothing until today powell said a little over half an hour ago there was a knock on the door of this hotel room suite i opened the door a man fired a revolver at me he missed he fired in fact three shots while i was holding the door open i slammed the door he fired two more shots emptying his gun the bullets going through the door doc savage said the bullets all missed thats right the man was very excited and of course i did some dodging did you know the man no ever seen him before not that i recall doc savage had been sitting on a straightbacked chair now he came to his feet took a few strides toward the window as if to look out this brought him in a better position to study powells face the mans countenance was as pale as ivory and coated with nervous perspiration powell doc said what do you think is behind the trouble powell threw out his hands i dont know i told you i didnt know when i began talking youre sweating doc said powell blew up by god of course im sweating he yelled why wouldnt i be ive never been shot at before it was a miracle that fellow didnt kill me when he emptied his gun at me you are sure doc asked dryly that he really tried powell threw up both clenched hands preparatory to a tirade but before the words got away from him he took control of himself he lowered his hands and straightened his coat by jerking at the sleeves if he didnt he said he gave an imitation that utterly convinced me doc changed to a manner that was friendly and said we are not trying to accuse or irritate you if my questions seem pointless or too pointed its because the affair seems confusing its confusing enough powell agreed would you doc asked like to plunge into it and see if we can find out what its about youre damned right powell said vehemently then why dont we take a look at the box of snake skins doc suggested powell hesitated barely long enough for it to be evident that he had hesitated all right he agreed but i dont see what good that will do they went out into the hall and doc told the policeman mr powell is going with us will that be all right the officer nodded then said i think i ought to check on that to keep myself clear go ahead the cop was back shortly its okay they found a cab downstairs powell gave the driver an address then leaned back powell looked controlled smug righteous doc said by the way i overlooked something yes powell smiled slightly when bob french came to see you were you alone yes i powell hesitated puckering his forehead thoughtfully no i wasnt either mr jessup was there jessup d b jessup he happened to be there when bob french called and i think he was present during the interview who is he friend of yours not exactly a friend powell said d b jessup had written me a letter to my colombian headquarters saying he had some army surplus radio equipment in which i might be interested he asked to call on me when i came to new york so i got in touch with him and he called buy any radios from him doc asked no as a matter of fact i didnt why not his prices were too high i didnt even bother to go look at his stuff his prices were clear out of reason renny leaned forward this d b jessup was he a long lean man dark hair sallow skin very skinny with kind of a wolf face and an unhealthy look why yes powell bolted upright in the seat he held himself there with arms rigid fists clenched he showed utter alarm you know him is that jessup it answers his description thats the man renny said who tried to stick a knife into bob french the tip of powells tongue showed between his teeth for a moment then he leaned back very carefully as if he was afraid he would fall and said god love us in a horrified voice you know where we can find jessup doc savage asked powell shook his head slowly the man told me he was leaving town checking out of his hotel he said he was going to the coast to see what luck he would have selling his radios was it after bob french visited you that jessup said he was leaving town yes it was powell shuddered v the warehouse was far downtown on the east river not far from where the south american shipping lines had their docks it was not a beautiful neighborhood the wind brought some of the smell from fulton fish market there was a name powell export over the entrance i use this place for storage powell explained there are occasions when i have a chance to buy up a good deal of radio equipment at bargain prices and i need a place to store it this is a particularly opportune time for that with the war near its end and the army and navy contracts being canceled he unlocked the door and went inside there was some outofdate radio equipment standing around old battery sets some newer stuff but none of recent manufacture some of my bad investments powell said wryly the french case is back here the case was about three by four by four feet renny was surprised by the heaviness of its construction looks like a machinery case he said look at that iron reenforcing theres nothing but snake hides inside powell said the customs men opened it in my presence suppose we open it doc suggested powell was agreeable there is a pinch bar and a wrench somewhere around he went hunting the items found them and they started on the case lid fastenings what kinda snake hides are these supposed to be renny asked something for a museum oh no theyre commercial powell explained there are several varieties but most of them are anacondas you know what anacondas are anyone who has been to south america does sometimes theyre called boa constrictors but theyre not true boas you hear wild native stories down there about anacondas fifty feet long that can swallow a fullgrown bull however i think they only get to be about thirty feet long and not very often that whatre the hides used for womens shoes purses or whatever is made out of skin i think theyre sold by the pound much as any other hides although im not sure renny asked is that part of tucker frenchs business marketing snake hides so i understood they got the lid off finally it was bolted not nailed and as renny had remarked it was heavy the hides were heavy also most of them salted it was a messy job as they unrolled each skin and inspected it they finished the job then looked at each other foolishly blank renny said theyre just snake hides as far as i can tell what do you say doc doc eyed the hides with no approval they seem to be snake hides he said with no attempt to be funny well look at the box itself then put them back renny climbed onto the edge of the box he gave it several whacks with the pinch bar said it sounds solid enough ill take a look at the bottom he jumped to the floor grasped the box and heaved nothing happened holy cow he said doc savage frowned suddenly whats wrong the dang box weighs a ton renny said how about you helping me turn it over you should be able to handle a box that size i must be getting weak in the push give me a hand renny said doc joined him together they heaved at the box with no result renny exasperated said the danged thing must be nailed to the floor doc turned to powell you notice this thing being particularly heavy before powell hesitated well not yes i did you understand i havent handled the thing myself but it broke the sling when they were loading it off the lighter on to the steamer at cartagena but i just supposed that green hides were very heavy no box doc said should be this heavy powell showed sudden emotion you mean the box has a double bottom or something doc scooped up the pinch bar well soon find out he went to work overturning the case it became ridiculous the pinch bar split the flooring but finally he did get the case pried up about two inches renny had found an iron pipe which he rammed under the case they pried and grunted and heaved and finally got the box up on its side ill be danged renny said sheepishly did you ever see the equal of that how do you account for the empty box being so heavy powell asked the things got to have a false bottom renny told him ill see in a minute the bigfisted engineer with the end of his gas pipe gave the box bottom a wallop the solid sound he got obviously astonished him he scowled growled gimme that pinch bar and went to work by the time he had pried a board off the bottom of the case his long face had a foolish expression the case bottom was obviously solid god bless us what kinda wood is that he blurted he produced a pocket knife and took shavings off different parts of the case well doc asked oak renny said plain oak an oak box should not be that heavy youre telling me renny picked up the pinch bar again what are you going to do powell demanded im going to take this thing to pieces a board at a time renny said that seems foolish to me powell said you can see its an oak box rennys voice was becoming a rumble the way it did when he was excited brother this box weighs three tons if it weighs an ounce im an engineer and i know its an impossibility for it to weigh that i want to know why renny began beating at the stout oak planks powell looked contemptuous of the whole thing he said this is getting childish here ill find you an axe and you can split the boards he went away and came back with a fire axe that was sharp renny took the axe it was large heavy made for the sort of thing he wanted it for he came down on the oaken planks one after another splitting them he split the right side first then the left side then the bottom which was uppermost the planks split readily enough they were after all just wood disgusted puzzled renny lowered the fire axe and rested the back of the box was unhandy to get at and after he swung at it a couple of times he gave the box an angry shove the box skidded across the floor rennys eyes popped he seized the case and turned it over without much trouble holy cow he blurted doc savage himself grasped the box he found that now he could lift it entirely without difficulty whereas a few moments ago he couldnt have gotten it a quarter of an inch off the floor without leverage it had taken the utmost strength of renny and himself combined exerted on levers and the pinch bar to lift the case at all renny might have exaggerated slightly when he said it weighed three tons but he could not have been far off three tons was about what thirty heavy men would weigh at least three tons was thirty times two hundred pounds now the box didnt weigh as much as one twohundredpound man its impossible renny rumbled doc turned the box over two or three times more he made for a moment a small trilling noise it meant the same thing as a whistle of astonishment there was some salt on the floor salt from the snake skins which had stuck to the inside of the box and been dislodged by rennys pounding mixed with the dirty salt were snake skin scales dirt and small litter doc raked the fire axe through the salt and litter but it was immediately evident there was nothing of any size in it powell suddenly giggled it sounded hysterical what do you expect a couple of handfuls of salt to weigh three tons doc straightened he felt foolish and he was angry with himself for being so completely baffled he said a moment ago that box weighed as much as a heavy truck now it weighs less than i do how do you account for that powell tittered wildly maybe there was a threeton mouse in it doc said violently dont be a fool the silly merriment slid off powells face which became strained will you name one reason why i should stand around and tolerate being called a fool he demanded doc got hold of himself he had lost his temper because he was baffled and confused he became ashamed of having done so calling you a fool was uncalled for and i apologize he said powell was mollified it was my fault what just happened to that box is so unbelievable that my first impulse was to laugh at it what do you think made it suddenly lose its weight i have no idea doc told him but we are going to find out well if i can do anything to help tell me powell said a new voice said to them help is what youre going to need if you make one jittery move the voice was in the warehouse but where doc turned slowly searching stand still damn you the voice warned doc froze the voice said now turn your head to the right see it it was a rifle muzzle projecting from a large packing case that looked fragile the rifle snout waggled to get their attention the voice added youve probably got guns all right dont use them ive got brick stacked up inside here and unless you hit this crack first shot ill kill you all no one said anything there was a stir inside the box a brick sailed out over the top and hit the floor see bricks the voice said now turn your backs to me they turned their backs okay the voice said now drop your guns on the floor and kick them off to one side renny carefully produced a pistol from an underarm holster it was a spikenosed weapon which would take either a clip or a ramhorn magazine and would fire either single shot or fully automatic all right savage the voice said i do not carry a gun doc said powell i am unarmed powell said shakily there was a silence the hidden man appeared to be debating the truth of their statements he cleared his throat noisily buck i guess its safe to come out and frisk them he said buck proved to be a heavy man with a large cornplaster strip across his nose the adhesive about an inch and a half wide placed diagonally had been put on so that it pulled the upper part of his face out of shape on one side and the lower part out of shape on the other it was probably as effective a disguise as a mask and certainly more efficient buck searched them he did it as if they were red hot and he seemed to grit his teeth each time he touched them he was scared renny asked him sourly what would you do if i jumped and said boo without a word buck whipped out a blackjack and laid it against the side of rennys head hard renny fell going down in sections making a heavy noise on the floor he landed with his face in the salt that had been knocked from the packing case when they were working on it and hardly moved afterward doc the violence in his voice poorly controlled said that wasnt necessary guys who get funny make me nervous buck said they aint scared and when they aint scared theyre liable to do anything i can assure you that im scared doc said then get your hands behind you both you birds they were working to a plan because buck had lengths of rope in his pockets already cut to the length for tying wrists and ankles buck tied them he knew his knots he used a highwaymans hitch on their wrists then made them lie down carried the rope up around their necks gave it a twist carried it down and doubled their legs back and did another highwaymans hitch around their ankles it was a vicious tie if they struggled they would strangle themselves buck tied renny then he gagged them all he had the materials for that too adhesive tape and three large sponges for stuffing in their mouths the man in the box he was still in the box said if i was you buck id scatter them out around the place otherwise they might get together and untie each other in a hurry buck said yeah thats a good idea he hauled renny off to the back of the building dragged doc around to the side and hauled powell forward and dumped him behind a pile of boxes of the three doc was the only one left where he could watch what went on the man in the box came out he was stocky and darkskinned as if recently from a climate of heavy sunshine he had a thin wire of a scar on his chin and a thick cluster of pocks on the left side of the neck get the jug he said the jug was a glass one gallon size it was full of yellowish liquid the skullandcrossbones label said sulphuric acid the other man dug out a package and from a spot in the corner of the wareroom took a large pottery crock he dumped the contents of his package into the crock doc knew immediately what it must be some form of yellow prussiate of potash dump in the stuff in the jug the heavy man said there was quite a chemical commotion in the crock which was understandable the fumes which arose had no great amount of color the two men got out in a hurry there were no words of parting they slammed the door and locked it doc stared at the crock he tried the binding on his wrists tight very tight and the sponge in his mouth taped there was an effective gag the chances of making enough noise to bring help from the street were not worth mentioning shots of course would have been heard on the street that was why there hadnt been any shooting that was why they were being killed this way doc savage closed his eyes tightly trying to shut out the vision of poisoning by vapor of hydrocyanic it would be quick one breath usually brought oppression and suffering at the temples and the nape of the neck the eyes grew cloudy and it would be almost impossible to keep from throwing the head back in a moment would come vertigo then prostration that awful hypertension in the head the ghastly stiffening of the body the legs stretched and flexed and the arms flexed and the fingers splayed then respiration would cease first there would be the odor of course the odor of bitter almonds the scent a peach seed has quick he remembered drymouthed the medical aspects of the stuff which he had studied it acted directly on the nerves the only objective lesion being a spasm of the respiratory system the lungs contracting in the lower thoracic cavity would become bloodtinged and on autopsy the veins would stand out as clearly as if filled with the brightest red ink the bronchial tubes would be affected too an autopsy would show them constricted and almost entirely closed all of this in a minute or so unconsciousness first and then a stiffness and then one gigantic awful wrenching inspiration of breath and then death but first the odor of almonds and he thought he could catch it now vi the old cop who had charge of laundry marks didnt like being called back to the office after hours you might at least get around here during the day he said monk laughed at him dont tell me the police never have a laundry mark looked up except between eight and four the old man snorted he took the half of bob frenchs blouse from monk but before he would do anything about it he insisted on filling out a lengthy form name he growled monk mayfair monk said thats not your full name lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair monk said wearily height five foot four weight two hundred occupation chemist avocation chasing excitement with doc savage favorite bobby blondes preferably over twentyone youre as funny as a crutch the old man said he finished filling in the blanks had monk sign then went away with the blouse half he was hardly out of sight it seemed to monk before he was back again blouse was last cleaned or washed by the univex laundry in jackson heights he said great grief did you have the information in your hat monk gasped the ancient sneered at him its done by television properly impressed and amused monk left the police station and got in his car the car was eyefilling it was a secondhand job which had belonged to a balkan dictator who had been chased out of his country by another dictator the car a special job from end to end was but slightly less a spectacle than a grand canyon sunset in many ways the car was monk it was loud spectacular in not too good taste and unless one liked ultramodernism it was as ugly as a sore thumb on an angel monk was like that and he was homely his looks were something to scare the socks off babies except that there was a certain gleeful pleasantness about him the car was efficient the very best metals and the very finest workmanship were in it the same with monk he was one of the worlds best industrial chemists when he worked at it his difficulty was not working at it often enough he liked excitement and preferred chasing it as a member of doc savages group of five aids to working at his profession as a result his habitual financial condition was one to interest the sheriff and the wolf it certainly wasnt something to interest the incendiary blondes monk spent his spare time pursuing he crossed queensborough bridge to roosevelt boulevard and jackson heights the univex laundry was closed he spent an hour finding the office manager of the laundry and dragging him away from a dinner party the laundry was efficient enough to keep a record of their work the blouse was done for a soldier named robert french the laundry man said heres the address he wrote the address out it was a little farther out in jackson heights it was a cottage a private home there werent many of those in jackson heights which was an apartment house and duplex home development but this was out toward flushing a part of a block where there were small houses this was a frame house frame houses were scarcer than just plain houses monk drove past and looked over the place the lawn was cut but he could tell from other signs that the house hadnt been lived in for a long time the shrubs for instance had grown wild and untrimmed and the place needed painting it had that look that houses get when they arent lived in monk wondered if hed drawn a blank wondered if bob french had given a phony address at the corner was a neighborhood drugstore it was the kind of a drugstore that had pinball machines and a soda fountain and tables on the sidewalk for the customers a neighborhood loafing place he parked in front monk went in and asked a middleaged man with an apron know anybody around here by the name of bob french ive got the wrong address or something fifth house from the corner this side of the street the man said naming the address monk had swell monk said enthusiastically now if hes just home bobs living there anyway the man said just got back from the war been in china where its tough got his hat full of medals i was talking to him the other day you sound like an old family friend monk said i wheres the brother tucker now monk asked the man frowned hesitated then said i didnt ask monk thought why didnt you ask youre an old family friend there was something here tucker been gone quite a while hasnt he monk said fishing for more information the man said i dont know anything about tucker if youre from the draft board i still dont know anything about him monk got it then draft evader eh he said the man tightened up i wouldnt know monk laughed and said that bob is a great guy hes done enough fighting for the whole family buddy of mine was with him in china place called yungshun they built an air field there and i guess they had themselves a time on the side i hope bob is at home dont want to miss him saw bob around this morning the man said any of the rest of the family at home with bob monk asked mother and father are dead didnt you know that never heard it monk said car accident two years ago tucker was the kid of the family just the two boys tucker and bob house has been closed while they were away dont know of any other relatives so i guess nobody is there with bob thanks monk said he intended to leave then but didnt he changed his mind when he saw how the man was looking at him weighing him the man seemed to decide he liked monk he leaned over the counter and lowered his voice this friend of yours who was with bob in china what was his name renwick monk said renny renwick the man nodded why sure bob was talking about him laughing about the time theyd had in china they had the time i guess monk said the man dropped his voice even lower what i wanted to ask you about there was a girl in here a little while ago asked where bob french lived she was a damned goodlooking girl and so i told her where bob lived then i wished i hadnt what made you wish you hadnt the man pointed you see the black coupe parked yonder monk said he saw the car she didnt go to bobs house shes sitting in that car watching the house kind of a funny way to do monk chuckled and said maybe a disappointed girl friend i better warn old bob she aint no disappointed girlfriend the man said not her what makes you think so nobody would disappoint her the man said you walk past and take a look and youll see monk had a way with women sometimes it got him a poke in the eye but frequently it didnt his method included everything but tact monk opened the door of the black coupe and got in has he come out of the house yet he asked the girl didnt quite tear the other door of the car off getting out but it was only because the door flew open instantly she looked back into the car at monk much as one would look through the zoo bars at a jackal she didnt say anything it was monks theory that all women liked to hear you say that they were beautiful he said youre the loveliest thing ive seen as lovely as the flowers in the valley of kashmir which are supposed to be the most glorious sight that mans eyes oh brother what ended his speech was the fact that she was more beautiful than he was saying she was time out while i learn to breathe again he said weakly must you she asked coldly now now lets keep the conversation in a warm climate monk said i chill easily anyway you should only look like that at hitler and hirohito also at all other guys she examined him apparently she found nothing of which she approved just who do you think you are she demanded not the same man i was a moment ago monk said grinning rest assured of that and i doubt if ill ever be the same she continued to scrutinize him distastefully what was it you said when you got in the car she asked i asked you if bob french had come out of his house yet monk said but already i can think of much better subjects to talk about your eyes for instance and our plans for the next few years oh boy some of the things ive got to talk about may have been talked about before but ill bet you i can give them a new she astonished him by getting back in the car first things first she said what about bob french really must we is he a friend of yours i dont know yet and anyway why not why not what this isnt getting us anywhere the girl said she took an object out of her purse maybe this will the object from her purse was black made of steel and had a remarkably large hole where the bullets could come out bless us do be careful with that monk gasped can you drive a car no you can learn on this one then she said and dont be coy i saw you drive past a while ago in that combination of a sunset and an earthquake on wheels but i dont want to drive anywhere monk protested youre not being asked for an opinion i cant drive meeting a vision like you has been too much for me look im shaking all over monk protested you had better shake she poked him in the ribs with the gun rather emphatically there is nothing whatever wrong with this gun you wouldnt shoot me right in the edge of jackson heights i would she assured him get going go around the block and well pick up bill vii who the hell is bill monk did fast thinking while he drove bob french got into his thoughts which he shouldnt have bob french according to the version monk had received from doc savage over the telephone had come to renny renwick for aid bob french had told renny that he renny was the only one in new york whom he knew which was why hed come to renny this seemed to be shaping up as a darned lie who was bill your brother monk asked hopefully who bill watch where youre driving the girl said you run into the curb and blow out one of my tires and ill probably shoot you anyway monk gave more attention to piloting her car this suspense is murdering me he muttered they rounded the block and traveled a short distance and she said pull over and stop monk obeyed a tall woman leaning against a light pole stepped on the cigarette she had been smoking and came toward them the lamp post which had been propping her up it occurred to monk commanded a view of the alley behind bob frenchs house and all rear exits to the french house this could be a good reason for the woman being there monk examined the woman from the lamp pest it was his candid opinion that there must be a carnival around and she was the lady performer who straightened horseshoes with her bare hands this female peered into the car at monk in a voice reminiscent of a bullfiddle she said my goodness i thought it was a bearskin rug you had picked up somewhere her own wit apparently struck her as hilarious because she upset the whole neighborhood with laughter frightened sparrows flew out of trees monk was somewhat hairy but he didnt feel it called for that much noise go away before you lose a friend he told the thundering female my my youve got a nice voice the big girl said like a frog after something had swallowed him another laugh and more sparrows flew out of the trees why didnt i say my prayers monk muttered the female turned to the beautiful vision and asked who is he grace what tree did you get him out of he got in the car with me bill grace said what do you know they never get in the car with me bill said monk pointed at the roaring woman and asked is this bill yes grace said im not as relieved as i thought id be monk said dubiously does she bite too the two girls held a conversation about monk but omitted him from participation grace the gorgeous one said he got in the car and asked if bob french had come out yet he must be a friend of bob frenchs bill said i dont know grace said but at any rate hes not a friend of ours who is he both girls now looked at monk and bill thundered who are you handsome monk maintained a peeved silence grace said hes a wolf you should have heard the awful corny line he pulled on me that was before i got a good look at you and lost my voice monk said bill whistled admiringly say now that wasnt bad that wasnt bad at all maybe hes a higher grade of wolf than you thought he was monk said nothing bill told him i do hope youre a medium grade of wolf or better because i do some wolfing myself if offered medium grade or better material god save little andrew blodgett mayfair monk mumbled his name is andy bill said little andypandy isnt that sweet why the hell did i ever get in this car monk wondered grace was frowning at monk she hadnt at any time shifted the muzzle of her gun away from the most vulnerable part of monks anatomy bob french hasnt come back and i dont think he is going to she told bill what makes you think he wont be back bill asked because i searched the house and it looked as if he had closed up the place for quite a while his army clothes were all gone and the water was shut off it looked as if he didnt plan to be back what did the man in the drugstore know you were going to talk to him nothing grace said he knew french but he didnt know anything else that would help me i think he became suspicious when i was questioning him too i think he told andypandy that i was watching the house too stop calling me that monk pleaded my names monk mayfair they ignored him i think bob french has gotten away from us grace said could be said bill monk said well i wish i could say it has been pleasant meeting you he opened the car door and prepared to get out where you going grace demanded away monk said away to reflect on the adversities of life i may become a hermit no you dont bill said he swung out of the car then he was back in the car his midriff felt as if a blockbuster had landed there he couldnt believe it was only bills right jab bill got in the car beside him the three of them made a tight fit bill held monks head tenderly he hurt his little tummy she said grace said if he tries to get out swat him again she put the coupe in motion the lovely girl and the strongarmed character were going to take monk to their office and have a talk with him they discussed their plans quite freely if monk didnt wish to talk they were going to get the words out of him anyway bill said she knew how monk didnt doubt it the two girls talked about someone called benjy benjy was an old dear they agreed and he was supposed to be doing something for them and they hoped he had been successful monk gathered that benjy was employed by them he had been employed by them a long time in fact monk rather gathered that old benjy had been employed by the fathers of the two girls before their time the office proved to be on upper lexington avenue it was located in an impressive office building it was now getting dark after hours for office building traffic and monk wondered how they were going to get him inside he couldnt see how they would do it if he chose to try to prevent them it was simple bill said oh look isnt that a beautiful girl going yonder the next thing monk heard was grace telling somebody who proved to be the elevator operator on night duty in the office building that it was something called slivowitz that did it he got along fine as long as he stayed with gin rum and bourbon then he had to try slivowitz the elevator operator said he would help them get monk into the office you hit me again monk accused bill and bill patted his shoulder comfortingly the elevator operator finished helping with monk and went back to his work there was another man in the office benjy he was a little taller than monk and between forty and eighty years old the doubt about his exact age being the result of innumerable wrinkles he looked like a pleasant old geezer the faithful old bookkeeper type benjy was worried im afraid ive done something awful he said bill was pleased she said my god benjy dont tell me you finally have a misdeed to your credit benjy squirmed it was not a light matter to him he gave both girls a rebuking look im not at all sure were doing the right thing not at all sure skip the sermon will you benjy the girl said benjy became indignant listen to me both of you he said seriously your fathers neither one of them would approve of what you are doing and you know it i promised your father he pointed at grace and i promised your father he pointed at the herculean bill that i would look after you thats exactly what i promised them the girls had a system on the old boy they put their arms around him and patted his back and chucked him under the chin and told him he was fine he was doing a wonderful job they couldnt get along without him and they loved him like everything old benjy ate it up if hed had a tail he would have wagged it so hard he would have fallen down now tell us what happened benjy grace said i followed that fellow and he didnt see me benjy said you mean the one who hung around trying to watch us grace demanded thats him the short one with the scar on his chin and them pockmarks on his face benjy agreed well heres what happened this fellow met another one that one was heavier and meaner looking the two of them went downtown to a warehouse marked powell export bill puckered her lips and whistled then they were working for powell thats what i thought but i think i was wrong benjy said because they went in the warehouse and they hid the back windows of the warehouse were boarded over but there was a crack in the boards where i could see what went on there was a shed over the crack or rather a shed built on the back of the warehouse and the window that had the crack between the boards was in that so i could you could watch bill said what did you see well these two fellows hid themselves in packing boxes in the shed they waited they waited three or four hours monk was keeping very still he was afraid if he said anything that would draw attention to himself that they would lock him up somewhere to get him away from the conversation benjy continued three men came one was sir roger powell the other two i didnt know at the time but i thought there was something familiar about one of them later when i found out who they were i could understand why that one looked familiar well these three men had come to look what were their names grace interrupted old benjy grinned at them coyly youll be surprised he said these three men had come down to look at a box it was a big heavy box it was a box which sir roger powell had brought from south america for tucker french this had an effect on the girls wow bill said wow oh boy grace just gasped but she could gasp very prettily benjy was as proud of himself as hitler was in as soon as they began taking the snake hides out of this box i knew what it was he said snake hides grace said with another gasp sure them big boa constrictors they grow down in south america bill frowned and demanded where were these other two fellows all this time they were hid i told you that oh they got the snake hides out and then they tried to move the box benjy said they couldnt both girls said oh together they said it as if they couldnt be more excited monk didnt get it at all benjy hooked his thumbs in the armholes of his vest like a politician who had just been reelected wait until you hear the rest he said it gets more exciting as it goes along after the three men took out the snake hides they couldnt lift the box so they got suspicious they got a fire ax and you mean grace demanded that they didnt know what was in the box didnt seem to didnt powell acted as if he didnt oh oh grace said benjy said well they cut loose on the packing case with the ax and chopped and chopped they found out the case was ordinary wood then all of a sudden they found they could lift the case that surprised em some benjy paused grinning grace asked was there loose salt were the snake hides packed in salt or something and did it get scattered over the floor sure then i know what happened grace said i know what happened to make the box lighter monk wished he knew the whole story sounded farfetched to him he suspected they might be telling a pack of lies in order to confuse him grace asked didnt they find out what made the case lighter no they must have been pretty dumb oh i wouldnt say that doc savage is so dumb benjy said monk jumped straight up and yelled doc savage was doc with powell bill and grace were dumfounded as well for the next few seconds everyone stared at everyone else and benjy teetered with his thumbs in his vest armholes then grace said doc savage you mean that big bronze fellow who is such a mysterious figure when he is mentioned in the newspapers the one who is so handsome thats him benjy said and hes not so handsome monk said what do you know about him grace demanded ive never been able to understand this effect doe has on the wenches monk said gloomily he doesnt run after them and in fact hes what you would call inaccessible goods on the other hand take me im accessible and i chase em i dont savvy it bill examined monk and said oh i dont know you sort of interest me handsome monk shivered grace demanded of benjy is doc savage involved in this affair yep benjy nodded vehemently dont you want to hear the rest of the story how they almost killed doc savage his friend renny renwick and powell viii the remainder of benjys story got their close attention it was worth it those two fellows hidden in the wareroom came out benjy related they had guns they surprised doc savage renwick and powell and fled them up they gagged them too and then they did a bad thing old benjy faltered he lost his thumbsinvestarmholes pride he became an old man a timid old man who had been close to death to murder he mumbled they had some kind of chemicals something in a jug and something else they put the stuff in the jug in a crock and put the other stuff in it then they ran out and shut the door the old man shuddered i could look at doc savages face and i could see the stuff in the crock was going to kill him he said what did you do grace asked benjy shuddered i ran out of the shed i ran around to the front of the warehouse the two killers were there waiting for the men inside to die i guess i yelled help police murder and the two men ran away i scared em away monk began breathing again he believed old benjys story now the old man wasnt that good an actor benjy said i held my breath and ran into the warehouse i figured the stuff in the crock was making gas i got out my pocket knife i keep it sharp i cut doc savage and renwick and powell loose maybe i didnt save their lives because powell had his hands almost loose anyway doc savage and renwick and powell ran out of the warehouse chasing the other two fellows who had tried to kill them they told me to run out of the warehouse too and i did old benjy winked foxily after they were out of sight i ran back in the place though i picked up the crock and carried it out and dumped it down a storm sewer grating in the street i held my breath benjy began to look pleased with himself again i left the warehouse door open for the wind to blow in and i went and got a hand truck and a crowbar i borrowed the hand truck and crowbar from a place down the street that moves heavy machinery i got what had fallen out of the packing case and was lying in the loose salt kind of embedded in the floor where they hadnt seen it i was lucky i wheeled it down the street it was almost more than i could manage to move i sure got tired finally i hired a truck i didnt know where to take it finally i took it to your apartment put it on the freight elevator and wheeled it into your front room the building super at the place knew me and let me in i left it there and came here benjy let out a long breath thats all there is to it he finished the girls screamed our apartment maybe it isnt safe there they started for the door wait for me monk yelled they looked at monk as if theyd forgotten him bill said lets take him along on the way we may be able to find out who he is they didnt take the coupe this time there were four of them benjy was going along and there wasnt room in the small car benjys car was parked near so they took that it was a sedan one that had been built back during hoovers administration my feelings are hurt monk confided to them or anyway my ego is thats too bad grace said with almost no interest my name is monk mayfair so you mentioned but havent you heard of me of course not grace said such is fame monk complained bitterly anyway ill let you in on something im a spearcarrier for doc savage grace showed a disgusting amount of interest in this you work for mr savage uhhuh is he as handsome as his pictures grace asked oh hell monk said and he wouldnt answer another question the girls had an apartment in one of the fashionable buildings close to radio city to live there cost plenty monk knew because he had been thrown out of one of the place not this one but one much like it for being unable to pay his rent there was nowhere to park directly in front of the building and they finally had to use the radio city garage the girls hurried on ahead and monk and benjy fell behind theyre so excited arent they benjy said to monk everybody is excited including me monk told him whats the matter with that grace anyway i dont get any office there at all it was my idea that the prettiest girls fall for the homeliest guys theyre lovely girls both of them benjy said ive known them since they were babies both their fathers joined the army but they didnt do it until i promised them that i would look after the girls im like a second father to them that bill said monk scares the socks off me she likes you thats what scares me monk frowned at the old fellow whats this all about anyway its a little secret the girls have benjy said firmly if they want you to know theyll tell you the man they thought was dead was lying as if he had tried to crawl under the modernistic lambcolored couch in the bright livingroom he had one arm and part of his face under the couch there was considerable blood about it was a very gory mess and bill further dramatized the scene by making a sound like a large mouse and fainting monk looked around for a place to put her complaining she weighs a ton old benjy levelled both arms at the man on the floor and cried a dead man a dead man grace much more practical pointed at the floor two or three times at different places each time then turned to benjy and demanded benjy is it gone its gone isnt it benjy stopped ogling the man on the floor long enough to bleat yes its gone monk deposited the cumbersome bill on the floor he didnt like the job but he picked up the wrist of the man partly under the couch he found pulse it was evident that a firmly harmless bump on the head had made the man unconscious and that the impressive gore was the result of a fist having hit the fellows nose monk hauled him out from under the couch and turned him over bob french grace cried pointing at the man monk agreed that it was bob french recalling the secondhand description of the soldiering french brother which he had received from doc savage monk asked is this your apartment yes bill admitted what monk demanded do you mean by having dead men around the place this alarmed bill sufficiently to give monk some satisfaction but bill fooled him she went to the door examined the edge near the lock and pointed see here she said they drove something in between the door and the jamb forcing the lock you can see the marks who did it monk asked i have no idea monk turned to benjy do you benjy was calm he wasnt completely calm but he was calm enough to surprise monk the old man was evidently at his best when the going got tight it was a rare fine trait and monks opinion of the old man climbed considerably it might benjy said have been those two bad men who tried to kill doc savage renwick and powell they might have managed to trail me here thought you said they didnt i didnt think they did they might have i dont know for sure monk shook bob french maybe this guy will tell us if we can wake him up can you bring me a pan of ice cubes from your refrigerator monks methods were direct he unbuttoned bob frenchs shirt and pushed the ice cubes inside pan and all french made some tittering noises like a silly girl and came out of it monk in withdrawing the pan of ice cubes had a slight accident and spilled the contents inside frenchs shirt causing some excitement take it easy monk told french bob french got himself organized apparently he didnt know who monk was monk was fairly sure french knew the girls grace and bill but the acquaintance didnt include old benjy monk said my names mayfair monk mayfair this didnt click with french renny is a pal of mine monk said im one of doc savages group of assistants bob french moistened his lips he was doubtful are you kidding monk shrugged suit yourself bob french looked around the livingroom of the apartment he became visibly alarmed did they get it get what monk asked french blinked owlishly he decided not to confide in monk at least he did not answer old benjy leaned over bob french somebody got it benjy said can you tell us who it was renny french was looking at monk you mean renny renwick the engineer youre a friend of his thats right monk assured him french grasped his shirt front and flapped it vaguely fanning the wet cloth he fished around inside and brought out an ice cube which he had missed what time is it he asked finally monk pointed at the electric clock it said a quarter until midnight bob french became alarmed he said three of them did it they were watching this place grace demanded what did they look like and then she described the two benjy had followed the pair who had tried to kill doc savage renny and powell no french said no that sounds like the two who were watching this place first my god whos watching who monk complained this is getting confused french looked pained all five of them work together its simple he said when i first got her he hesitated glancing at monk you apparently know i went to ask renny renwick for help yeah i got a telephone call to that effect monk told him well i was seized at rennys office but i escaped from monks laugh was loud bitter skeptical french are you going to tell us any truth at all french looked uncomfortable doc figured out that nobody jumped you at rennys office you faked it monk added frenchs deeply tanned neck got darker he shook his wet shirt some more he got out a handkerchief and dabbed at the bloodstains on his chin suddenly he said okay that was a phony i was so scared i didnt know what to do so i scrammed out monk opened his mouth then closed it hed been about to ask bob french why hed been terrified when he learned doc savage was going to be involved that was what had happened but french was tough guy he had just barely decided to talk to them at all and calling him a liar would probably shut him up better let him go monk decided and try to pick the truth out of whatever he had to say go ahead monk muttered bob french scowled and spoke emphatically he had some truth to tell now monk decided and he wanted them to know that it was the truth i didnt know what to do but i knew where the girls lived so i came here to see them french said i was going to walk right in and talk to them that was what i planned but outside down the street a ways i happened to see a mug who looked familiar he hadnt seen me so i kept out of his sight i looked him over and pretty soon i realized i had seen him three or four times the last couple of days you know what that meant hed been following you monk suggested thats right part of the push that was following me around before they tried to put that knife into me then whatd you do i camped around this guy had some pals four of them they were hanging around with their eyes big watching the apartment french indicated benjy pretty soon this old gaffer slipped out and followed two of them off he did a pretty slick job i almost didnt catch him doing it i stayed here and watched the other three i was here about four hours then this old fellow came back wheeling something on one of those heavy hand trucks he took it in the apartment house the three guys watched him pretty soon the old fellow came out and left benjy looked sick the three men saw me yep benjys shame was pitiful he had been stupid and he was bitterly discouraged with himself well i could tell the three guys who had been lousing around were excited about what theyd seen the old fellow wheel in on the truck bob french said they were gonna come up to investigate i guessed so i decided to beat em to it french got up and essayed a step or two then reached out quickly and grabbed a table for support wow my head sure whirls two of them were sapping me at once the last i remember frowning monk asked didnt you leave out a little in between oh you mean how did i get in back way i didnt lose any time but damn the luck when i got up here those guys were already here they had one posted around a corner in the hall while i had my ear to the keyhole he came up behind cut loose on me and knocked me through the door into the apartment well they swarmed over me with saps and thats where i took a blackout he indicated the floor the freight handtruck was sitting right there i remember bill planted her hands on her hips angrily were sunk we dont know what to do next bob french grinned without much pleasure i got a little climax he said what do you mean i woke up before the three guys left french said i heard them talking theyre going to scram out for south america theyre going after my brother monk asked suspiciously if you regained consciousness and overheard that how come how come i was asleep again when you got here french grimaced they popped me one for the money before they left its a wonder they didnt mash my skull you know where theyre going in south america better than that french said i know where we may be able to head em off before they go monk yelled why wait until now to tell if you had my head youd know why french snarled dizzily but lets go he named an airport in new jersey lets head for there he said they decided riding down in the elevator that they would use benjys old sedan for the new jersey trip benjy seemed confident it would hold together for the journey everyone else was dubious they were arguing about it striding down the sidewalk when bob french let out his yell his squawl was hairlifting it was about the most arresting sound monk had ever heard it was formed of words not noise and it was a practiced thing it was a warning one hed used before while he was still making the sound french had scooped up both grace and bill one in the crook of either arm and yanked them across the sidewalk and behind a parked car monk realized by now what had alarmed french a black object small and round that had skipped across the sidewalk and under one of the cars a grenade bob french seemed to think it was monk reasoned that soldier bob french had seen enough grenades to know what one was so he grabbed for benjy benjy wasnt there though and got going old benjy didnt need urging he was ahead of monk they joined french and the two girls french yelled grenade get going run monk had a second thought he said i dont think that was a grenade french and the two girls were running old benjy told monk it was a hand grenade brother benjy joined the flight if it was a grenade there was no point in getting blown up to prove it so monk legged it after the others it wasnt monk puffed i know one when i see it benjy said i was in the other war they reached benjys car which was fortunately pointed the way they were going benjy landed behind the wheel the two girls bob french and monk piled in the back monk scrambling to get inside yelled it hasnt gone off so it wasnt any grenade sometimes they miss fire french said benjy was twisting and stamping on gadgets the old car began moving french on his knees on the rear seat looked back through the window he yelled watch out the guys out on the sidewalk ready to throw another monk raised up to look he got a glimpse of a man standing on the sidewalk whirling one arm above his head in what looked like a pitchers windup godamighty monk croaked and hauled the girls down on the floorboards the car took the first corner with a noise like canvas tearing there was no grenade explosion decided he couldnt throw it that far bob french said he looked at monk he was sweating he said i vote for that airport i dont want any part of guys with grenades not when im emptyhanded thats two of us monk agreed shakily three old benjy said he settled down to his driving ix renny renwick was not normally a man of many cusswords but after the car carrying monk grace bill and old benjy vanished renny spoke for approximately two minutes without using a word that could be found in a dictionary sir roger powell took it but his face got gray with rage no man has talked to me like that he said finally i should do more than talk to you renny yelled what the blueblazecoated edge of hell were you trying to do get their attention after they came out of the apartment house powell snapped why not just call to monk i wanted to get their eye furtively i thought someone might be watching i didnt want to create a disturbance no disturbance holy cow it didnt turn out like i expected powell muttered that bob french is warsimple he thought i had tossed a hand grenade and he went crazy what did you toss powell went to the curbing got down on hands and knees and fished something out from under an automobile parked there he brought it back this he said it was a wad of paper dark brown paper renny unrolled it the wrappers off a couple of candy bars loosely wadded powell explained we havent had a chance to eat dinner as you well know so i bought a couple of large candy bars to fill in these are the wrappers doc savage arrived he had been farther up the block parking their car what caused the uproar doc asked renny explained the mishap omitting the cussing i wasnt close enough to get monks attention he said that ball of paper looked like a grenade to bob french i suppose and he started a stampede powell said what kind of a fool would think a grenade would be thrown at him on a new york street look bob french is a soldier and hes been where its hot where hes been any unexpected thing the size and color of that wad of candywrapper could be a grenade renny said i know i was in china with him for a while i didnt intend to frighten him renny complained did you have to wave your arm like you were getting ready to throw another one i was trying to get their attention powell pushed his jaw out wrathfully whats the matter cant anyone but you make mistakes where have i made a mistake renny rumbled listen brother if you want doc savage said oh stop it a mistake is a mistake powell said yes and a loudmouthed fool is a loudmouthed fool meaning me renny asked ominously powell examined renny deliberately he examined rennys fists with the most care he moistened his lips i dont think i could lick you he said anyway it would be foolish to try wouldnt it i mean what would be the purpose you figure im a fool powell grinned slightly i figure we all probably feel like fools right now he said you want an apology renny finally grinned himself ah not right now he said doc savage said we might as well take up where we left off now that youve stopped acting like kids they walked to the apartment house from which monk and the others had come this doc reflected is like getting all set for the ball game and the other team not showing up he was suddenly tired hungry baffled the most baffling thing was that box in the warehouse which had been so unbelievably heavy and as unbelievably become light again he wished that he had examined the thing more closely for the last three hours they had been running their heads off the progress they had made hadnt been easy luck had been with them or they wouldnt have gotten as far as they had luck had been with them when they discovered the trucking establishment where old benjy had rented the hand truck theyd been looking for the hand truck doc had found marks in the spilled salt elsewhere on the warehouse floormarks obviously made by a hand truck a hand truck had suggested something heavy to be moved and that had started them hunting for a trucking concern that might have done the job they had found it eventually old benjy and his hand truck and something remarkably heavy on the hand truck in a small box had been brought to this apartment house one of the men with the truck knew the apartment number to which the box had been taken hed been impressed with the building and remembered the apartment number because he supposed it was the livingplace of some big shot when one looked back their finding the apartment seemed simple and direct but it had been hard work they got the apartment house superintendent because they wished to enter the apartment at least halfway legally they noted the evidences of violence the traces of the door being forced and the bloodstains on the livingroom rug docs quick search of the place turned up nothing of value it was just a rather fine apartment occupied by two girls the apartment superintendent answered questions grace blassett and willa morris were the occupants two fine girls very fine paid their rent on time no wild parties the two girls operated the firm of blassett and morris their fathers had gone to war enlisting in the army about a year previously and the two girls had taken over the firm yes the super had some idea of what sort of a firm blassett and morris was they were purchasing specialists industrial supply if you had a factory for instance and needed a special machine a supply of steel or any hardtoget raw material you employed blassett and morris they went out and bought it for you at the lowest possible price sir roger powell listened to this he smiled thinly and got out his cloth sack of tobacco and papers and made a limp cigarette doc said we might as well go back to headquarters monk will contact us as soon as he can and he will call us there they rode back in docs car all right doc said to powell what about blassett and morris eh you mentioned them before doc said powell contemplated doc and renny powell still looked welltailored neat although his pinstripe suit and white shirt were a mess it was the mans manner which gave him that prim quality he had combed his black hair and given his moustache a twisting with his fingers getting it back in shape the handmade cigarettes still seemed incongruous for him oh yes powell said finally when tucker french in south america gave me the mysteriously heavy box of snake skins to bring to new york i was to get in touch with the firm of blassett and morris thats what i told you was it the truth powell flushed certainly you said you contacted blassett and morris didnt you i did they didnt deal in snake skins they didnt know tucker french how did you contact the firm telephone i talked to a woman i presume one of the young ladies whose apartment we just left know anything more about them powell said violently dammit i wish i did they reached headquarters there was no message from monk there was a gadget which would have recorded one had monk telephoned in doc liked gadgets and he had developed this recorder affair an automatic gimmick which told a caller with a recorded voice that no one was in the office but that if the caller would speak his or her message it would be put on record the recording was done magnetically on a wire they ordered up food from an allnight restaurant while he was eating powell told them more about himself he got to talking about his birthplace which he said was epping forest near london the pleasant memories of his youth and early manhood there he said were good to have with him he talked about the deer in the forest the herons and the kingfishers and the many small songbirds he understood he said that the germans had bombed nearby high beech where tennyson was living when he wrote the talking oak and locksley hall doc said high beech is five miles south of epping forest isnt it powell drew slowly on another handmade cigarette thats about right doc looked at powell intently it wasnt when i was there powell froze he picked up his fork then put it down again slowly he muttered youve been there doc nodded and you havent powell grimaced sheepishly believe it or not this is the first time ive been caught dammit i should have remembered high beech is part of epping forest ive read enough about the place that i should have remembered that are you an englishman at all doc asked no powell confessed renny put down his own knife and fork he stared at powell then at doc is this important i dont see why it should be important powell said instantly ive been telling that lie for years if you want to know the truth i was born on the wrong side of the tracks in kirksville missouri my name is roger powell all right i put the sir on to it back in the days after the other war when titles were all the rage it helped me so i kept on doing it no one said anything powell sat there looking sulkily at his plate he didnt seem ashamed particularly just disgusted that they had found him out the telephone rang the outside wire monk santa isabel monk said its on the rio negro river brazil back in the godforsaken jungle you can find it on the map all right doc said what about it get down there monk said thats where im going why thats where everybody were chasing seems to be headed listen i cant give details just get down there ill leave a message at the biggest store in town if i get there first okay if you know what youre doing doc agreed i hope i do all right and doc will you talk to a guy here im renting a sixplace plane from him you know me always broke i want you to tell him youll pay for it and hold your hat he wants plenty for rental we have planes of our own doc said no time to get one put the man on doc said the man wasnt particularly suspicious he just wanted to be sure he got his money he was trying to overcharge and they had an argument about that but came to terms by this time it developed that monk had gone he had taken off in the rented plane just what happened out there doc demanded the man he was the operator at an airport about forty miles out in new jersey talked freely he was somewhat alarmed and wondering if he shouldnt make a report to the caa or the army four days ago a twomotored plane had arrived at his field and been hangared there which was not unusual about half an hour ago several men he didnt know exactly how many had arrived in a hurry and piled into the plane and taken off they had signed out for miami did they load anything heavy into the plane doc asked no they hadnt the man said he added but during the four days the ship was hangared here one of the men brought out stuff in boxes or suitcases at various times and put it in the plane are they gone theyre taking off so is the ship your friend rented from me what shall i do about this is there something wrong give me the nc numbers of both planes doc said and their types cruising range and radio equipment if you have it sure ive got that waitll i get the register the man soon supplied the information he asked again whatll i do let us handle it doc said he hung up renny had cut in an amplifierspeaker gadget on the telephone so that he and powell had heard both ends of the conversation south america powell blurted this is fantastic know anything about santa isabel in brazil where theyre going doc asked powell nodded ive been there its not too bad but the country around there is really something its probably the leastknown stretch of country left on the face of the earth doc nodded watching powell whatever the trail monk was following it must be hot and important monk was no fool so doc intended to go to south america he intended also to take powell because powell was part of the queer affair it would be simpler if powell agreed to go willingly going along doc asked youre damned right powell said instantly and if you wonder why ill tell you its because two attempts have been made to murder me and im mad thats reason enough doc said glad there was not going to be an argument over powells going he added say i made a dumb mistake i didnt ask who went with monk in the rented plane he called the new jersey airport operator again five people had left in the plane including monk the operator described the other four the descriptions fitted grace blasset willa morris old benjy and bob french doc told renny lets get some equipment ready in a hurry jungle stuff quinine insect repellent machetes weapons some trade stuff for natives wed better work fast powell was getting doubtful my god thats thousands of miles down there how do we know well find anything when we get there well keep track of those two planes doc said how on earth can you do that the army and navy interceptor network doc said dryly has a setup which they think can track a mallard duck from cuba to canada will they cooperate well see ill do some telephoning while you and renny get equipment together the army and navy would cooperate it took some telephoning to washington to get it done powell was impressed he told renny you fellows get things done renny said sourly it sure looks it dont it here we are busting our necks to get to south america and we havent the least idea why how powell asked do you suppose monk mayfair found out that we should go to santa isabel i wish i knew renny said x they began the southward flight renny flew doc began fishing with the radio prowling the wavelengths which monk might use to call him finally he got monk monk spoke mayan an almost unknown dialect as far as the civilized world was concerned which doc and the others had learned in central america a long time ago monk said his plane had a standardized wavelength radio transmitter he didnt dare use it much but he could receive on any of the aeronautical frequencies would doc use two hundred eightyfive a little above the standard control tower frequency and keep him posted about the whereabouts of the plane they were trailing he said he presumed that doc had the army and navy interceptor service at work tracing the ship doc said he would after that they got halfhour reports from the army in code renny had brought one of the little portable decoders used by the military he made the settings and keyed off the translations powell was skeptical they wont be able to keep track of the plane he said watch them renny told him what makes you so damned sure with some indignation and pride renny said i helped the army and navy set up their interceptor alarm system it was primarily an engineering job in communications powell raised his eyebrows didnt mean to hurt your feelings you didnt renny rumbled ignorance never does as the pair sat scowling at each other doc wondered if they were going to have a fight after all but they took it out in unpleasant looks for the time being doc relayed the army reports to monk from time to time speaking mayan on the twoeightfive waveband monks ship immediately dropped back about forty miles in order not to be sighted by the other ship so monk was receiving the information although he wasnt acknowledging it for fear that the ship they were following would pick up his signal and recognize his voice how long powell asked is this easy stuff going to last until we get well across the northern coast of south america renny told him powell whistled later he asked where do you suppose theyll refuel that had been bothering him monk said but the refueling turned out to be a simple matter the ship simply doubled right a hundred miles set down at a designated civilian field in florida took on a load of gasoline signed out for atlanta georgia which was a lie and took off ten minutes later doc knew exactly how many gallons of gas and oil they had taken aboard spotter reports showed the ship was heading out across the gulf stream doc savage refueled in miami his plane was an amphibian twomotored not particularly large and not the fastest thing in the air but it was stable capable of long range and with the flaps cracked could set down in any field capable of handling a lightplane powell expressed an interest in learning to fly renny killed time by letting him play with the duals first switching on the auto pilot and not telling powell about it so that powell thought he was handling the ship renny thought it was very funny but powell eventually became suspicious and they came near having another fight it was monotonous doc savage finally talked a little about himself it was the first time renny had heard him do that doc talked about the strangeness of his early life the different outlook it had given him he said that he had never known just what had happened to his father to cause him to put his small son doc in the hands of scientists for training it was a weird upbringing aimed entirely at making doc into a combination of mental marvel and physical giant if science could do it the elder savage had not lived to see the final outcome of his plans for the boy it was effective but probably not as effective as he hoped doc said slowly looking back on the fantastic business i feel lucky as anything because it seems to me that what i got was a psychological course guaranteed to make a freak the bronze man grinned slightly i find myself doing or on the verge of doing many queer things as a result of the training he fell silent then started again and explained that what he had missed most was a normal youth the thrills and the heartbreaks and the excitement of devilment which boys have he had not missed these at the time he was not getting them because he hadnt known about them but he missed them now he frequently suspected that being a juvenile was something a man had to work out of his system like getting rid of his baby teeth he said he still had the kid stuff in him hed never had a chance to work it off as a result he spent his time chasing excitement now whereas if his youth had been a normal one his adult life would have been normal in other words he would now be a young settled family man with a wife who dragged him out to bridge parties renny laughed at that the idea of doc being dragged out to bridge by a henpecking wife struck him as funny doc shut up made somewhat uncomfortable by the levity we all look back powell said and wish that our lives had been different i dont think there breathes a man who doesnt do that for four hours they flew above an overcast that ended at twelve thousand renny got busy with an astral sextant the maggie and stuck his head up in the astro dome he tinkered with the computer and chart south american coast should be below he said doc nodded pointed far ahead were snowcapped coastal andean peaks like muddy froth on the vast whiteness of the cloud floor from here on therell be no spotter network to keep track of monk and the plane were following doc said the thing for us to do is refuel somewhere and head straight for the rio negros country renny dug around in his navigation stuff theres open weather at fernando on the orinoeo he said according to my dope we can get ninety octane gas there that should do us for a round trip in case we cant get gas in the amazon headwater country give me a course and eta for fernando doc said flying down out of the rather open mountain country into the amazon basin was an experience that somehow discouraged talk they were going into one of the most untouched places in the world doc flew fairly low there was no sense in flying high there were no places to land because now they were traversing the immense expanses of jungle where there were many small streams but no rivers large enough to show through the overcoating of green growth the world was a green carpet not smooth but knobby and limitless certainly a drab thing to the eye but when the plane flew low the hobgoblin nature of the jungle was evident occasionally through the umbrella of foliage they could see the undermass of the jungle the fallen and decayed trunks everywhere over and about them the thickets the vines that draped from trees a hundred and fifty feet high the incredible tangle of lianas everywhere and the gaudy sickbright colors of the flowers renny knew something of this jungle country he had been into it before but for the sake of devilment he pretended complete ignorance and got powell talking powell took the bait he knew the jungle and wanted to tell about it the small blue birds you see occasionally in flocks are uirapuru or charmer bird powell said theyre called charmer birds because of their beautiful singing and the weird effect it has on other birds youll see flocks of different kinds of birds being led through the forest and the leader will be a charmer bird no kidding renny said powell nodded some of the natives make nodevil charms out of the charmer bird skins other natives buy them for very high prices the price varying according to whether the charm is a woman charm or made for a man its very fascinating but of course the funny thing is the way the charmer bird can lead all the other birds through the jungle ill be darned renny tried to keep a straight face renny caught docs eye and his glee cooled doc knew of course that renny was almost as familiar with charmer birds as he was with blackbirds or sparrows how about doing some navigating doc asked renny dryly renny went back and prepared to get another astral fix there was a foxing of cirrus clouds in front of the sun and he decided to wait until they were out of the way he cut in the radio directional loop intending to get a fix on one of the broadcasting stations at caracas venezuela and perhaps at bogota colombia as a matter of course he had the receiver tuned to the frequency which monk had last used to communicate with them he changed to broadcast wavelength and fished for the bogota station getting mostly static that powell renny thought sourly talks too much probably thats because bes a salesman and hes got that damned superior way which high pressure salesmen get a shout from doc savage blew renny out of his reverie the loop doc yelled cut the loop in on monks frequency renny grew cold hed left monks wavelength unguarded the first moment theyd done that since leaving new york but doc with the other receiver tuned from the cockpit had covered the wavelength when hed noticed renny fiddling with the loop hurry up doc shouted renny got the loop set tuned to monks frequency monks voice weak gorged with horror was saying i wasnt expecting the right one to turn out to be a crook there was considerable garbled by static then monks voice saying righthand gear up through the wing so we groundlooped one motor is out of the mounts and the gasoline tank in that wing split over everything more garbled then im pretending to be unconscious so i can talk hope you get a radio fix the men are coming into the plane now this was all rigged i can see that for gods sake be careful i think what he thought they didnt learn that was the last of monks voice renny sat there with both hands on the loop knob afraid to take them off lest he disturb the pointer setting seventythree degrees he thought ogling the pointer holy cow i hope i really had the null before monk got shut down he took his hands away from the pointer he stumbled forward to the cockpit what happened to monk he gasped did you get a null doc shouted seventythree renny said what went wrong static doc said so much static we missed just what did go wrong monks plane was forced down evidently one of the group in the plane caused it which one if monk said it was garbled by the static seventythree renny said hoarsely the pointer was on seventythree the bearing has got to be that or twofiftythree degrees which would be the opposite doc considered for a moment we will try the twofiftythree bearing he brought the plane around to correct for the mile or two they had covered since getting the bearing he leaned back to look at rennys loop on the chance renny had misread the dial it said seventythree degrees after correction for deviation and variation break out equipment doc said it may not be long doc you heard monks signal renny said did it sound close fairly close not over fifty miles doc said they could discern streams below most of them black as black as the rio negro into which they fed doc climbed the ship he cut in the engine mufflers and reduced speed somewhat to decrease the prop roar use binoculars doc said if we can spot them from high enough that they dont see or hear us we might come down in the sun and accomplish more renny rumbled who the devil do you suppose doublecrossed monk powell scowled that bob french fellow probably he struck me as a shifty sort nuts renny said renny was angered he had been through a good deal of rough stuff with young bob french in china and he was inclined to trust french bob wasnt shifty not in rennys opinion then suddenly his wrath froze for an instant he thought no man should ever get mad because his rage had almost caused him to miss monks plane there he yelled at doc about two hundred degrees five miles away monks plane doc put the big plane in a glide he cut the switches he didnt quite close the throttles powells hair seemed to visibly stand on end my god youll need motors to land he screamed renny said theyve got starters the sun was low not quite on the horizon but there wasnt more than an hour of daylight left they came down to three thousand before they could tell much about monks plane it was monks plane all right they could distinguish the nc number on the upper wing panel thats a landing field isnt it doc demanded suddenly the same idea had hit renny a landing field not a paved runway but a fairly clear landing strip monks plane was piled up at the midway point of the runway a ground loop had obviously taken it to the left and it was jammed among the small trees at the edge of the runway a figure appeared in the open waving both arms whos that powell demanded doc said he couldnt tell weve been seen so we might as well start the motors he added shutting plane motors off in the air then getting them going again with the electric starters was always ticklish business the starters wailed and the props went over jerkily then the stacks coughed blue smoke the engines got going and doc resumed breathing doc said keep your eyes open for funny stuff he sent the ship down in a spiral watching the ground powell muttered a runway the way this jungle grows it would take a young army to keep a runway like that cleared its not such a mystery renny told him i think its an old lake bed a dried mud flat that is so impregnated with minerals possibly salt that the vegetation wont grow on it watch for trouble doc warned they were getting down low enough now to make a stab at identifying the figure which was gesturing at them it was broad not tall monk renny yelled thats monk thats the suit monk was wearing in new york he always wears the same suit a week at a time he scowled wait a minute his face doesnt look right they were around six hundred feet so identifying a face even monks face was mostly guessing doc sent the ship lower seems to be blood on his face doc said uhhuh renny muttered could be red berry juice if it wasnt monk too the figure below solved their doubts by suddenly dashing into the jungle and reappearing dragging a limp man he waved his arms triumphantly jumped around went back and came out dragging another figure renny roared holy cow its monk he cleaned up on them after he radioed us that explains the blood on his face they had a fight and monk licked the pack of them this struck doc as a natural conclusion monk was phenomenal in a hand to hand fight doc put the plane across the field at a hundred and fifty feet then banked back explaining we will drag the field at about ten feet altitude to be sure its all right he arched back adjusting flaps and props and getting down the gear he could see the landing strip clear ahead it seemed okay the only moving figure in sight was the one they had identified as monk he was thinking how fine everything was when the triprope of vines flew up in front of the plane he hardly saw the thing before he hit it things began coming off the plane the first thing being the rightside motor xi there were probably no tougher vines in the world than those which grew in the amazon basin jungle they were the greatest obstruction to movement some were three or four inches thick and from that they shaded down to fine threads that were as tough as buckskin the triprope was made of vines it was no fiveminute job the main rope was a braided cable effect with stringers hanging down there must be over at the side in the jungle a devil of an efficient weight and pulley gadget to yank it up so quickly the starboard motor went out of its mount because the bent prop blades threw it off balance it just tore itself loose the shock was not too terrific the plane was heavy and it snapped the vine cable the vines were tangled in the left motor which was still running the vines beat and flailed and knocked the glass out of the cabin windows on that side tore the wing covering the noise was of many bullwhips doc cut the motorswitches he whirled the control wheel and did a fandango on the rudder bars he didnt get the ship quite level but he did get it mushed out in landing attitude the only trouble was that they werent going straight down the runway any longer the jungle was puffing up in front of them the plane fuselage dived into the jungle leaving both wings behind it shed wheels fuselageskin and other things including anything resembling its former streamlined shape the uproar was as if several sacks of very big cans were being dragged over rocky ground early in the uproar doc hit the safety catches and the cabin doors and escape hatches flew off the plane propelled by the jettisoning devices the first thing to do after any plane crackup was get out get free because nothing burns quite as vigorously as an airplane doc twisted about said renny are you hell yes renny said powell was fighting with his safety belt he couldnt get the fastener unhooked he seemed all right otherwise doc reached up the plane was on its nose and twisted powells belt fastener open powell was merely confused they piled out of the ship get away from here doc said move fast powell lost his confusion he bored into the jungle with the practice of an expert and the vigor of a mail with death blowing on his heels renny said holy cow and charged after powell renny would keep track of powell doc knew doc himself moved rapidly for a few yards or as rapidly as the tangle of the jungle would permit then gave all his attention to being silent he went back to a spot where he could see the landing strip the man they had thought was monk was gone he hadnt been monk of course the unconscious men who the pretended monk had hauled out into the clearing were gone doc surmised they had arisen and fled under their own power you mutt he thought what did you use for brains a minute ago he went back to his wrecked plane it had not burned he scouted the vicinity carefully decided it was safe to enter the ship and did so swiftly the stuff he wanted was the medical kit and portable radio he got them he left the plane quickly his plain white shirt was nothing to be wearing in the jungle if one wanted to escape discovery he stripped it off to help against the heat he used his pocket knife to make his trousers into shorts all the time he was listening nothing seemed to be stirring in the jungle that puzzled him as protection against insects he rubbed some chemical repeller into his skin the jungle mosquitoes could be a fright so bad you carried a sack and sat with your legs in that whenever you rested there were puim the little lice with wings and the maqiuim which had the habits of chiggers but considerably more voracity and others as bad after a while he caught a sound he heard it again he began moving stalking the noise it was a native an unlovely insectwelted little jungle man he had a pot belly and muscles like wires and a geestring and a blowgun as long as he was he had the tiny arrows for the blowgun tucked in his frizzled hair he was stalking the plane shortly he put an arrow into the blowgun raised the long tube to his lips and blew out his cheeks held them a moment let the air go actually the little arrows tink on the metal flank of the plane was louder than the blowgun sound the small native waited a while warily then he took another shot at the plane as if he thought it was some great wounded bird that he was going to dispatch with his arrows doc waited watching he kept his ears open lest other natives approach and surround him before he knew it they could move silently in the jungle their stealth could surprise you but they werent superghosts he was not afraid of being taken unawares now the one native was advancing the little jungle ruffian held both hands up palms out an accepted gesture of peace and walked to the plane he stood beside the plane listening anybody home he asked doc came near starting violently enough to betray his hiding place the natives english wasnt good but it was plainly understandable with a slightly slangy swing and it was so utterly the last thing doc expected the little imp to say that he was dumfounded the petbellied little man looked into the plane he stepped up on the wing stub opened the cabin door which had swung shut and looked inside he scratched his head puzzled he knew what planes were doc decided when hed fired those arrows he hadnt thought he was attacking a big bird doc watched the fellow prowl around the ship the man found the tracks made by doc renny and powell as soon as he found the tracks he whirled and dashed for the landing strip out on to the landing strip head back stomach out he sped toward the southern end of the strip he vanished into the jungle there was time to secondcount to about twenty then shots first one rifle bang then three more scattered a shotgun crashed evidently a doublebarreled gun because it went off twice someone swore in good new york english and said the little sonofagun got away another voice called you see the plane monks voice the first speaker said i can see where it crashed into the jungle down yonder now men came out on the landing strip the first was a very tall young man with stooped shoulders then in a group there were monk mayfair bob french old benjy and the two girls grace blassett and willa moms there were about a dozen natives with them these natives looked better fed and were wearing different articles of european clothing in the individualistic fashion which natives like one man had two neckties tied around each forearm the tall stooped young man was the leader he shouted theres their plane the group raced down the landing strip doc remained where he was not far from the plane but hidden among the vines monk he saw seemed to be in fair shape monk looked somewhat confused however as if things had been moving too fast for him bob french and old benjy he identified without trouble he had their description renny had described french and theyd learned about old benjy at the new york apartment house of the two girls he found it interesting to identify grace blassett monk had been acting somewhat queerly in the course of recent events doc began to see what was probably causing monks deviations the racing group reached the plane they searched it monk scrambled inside the fuselage theyre not here monk yelled angrily dammit those natives must have packed them off the tall stooped young man turned to one of the natives happening to choose the unorthodox wearer of the neckties he grunted and gurgled at the native the native looked at the ground for a while then did some grunting himself he says the tall hunched young man translated that there are not enough native tracks for the natives to have carried them off monk scratched his head he examined the ground himself and evidently decided it was logical monk lifted his voice doc he bellowed oh doc are you all right doc kept silent he wasnt sure what was going on it struck him there was something queer doc monk was howling renny hey this is monk come here before the gooks find you his roar shook the jungle obviously renny and powell heard it shortly renny called what gives monk come on outa there monk shouted at the jungle renny appeared then powell was with him doc savage watched monk and renny pound each other on the back the situation seemed to be all right and yet in the back of docs mind there was a specter of doubt a black threatening uncertainty it sat there like a dangerous beast monk was yelling wheres doc good god do you suppose they got doc his concern got the best of docs better judgment of his vague conviction that he shouldnt be doing this he walked out of the jungle joining them the tall stooped young man was tucker french bob french who was still in his army uniform made the introduction this is tucker my kid brother bob said there were family resemblances both had long noses and blue eyes and a gangling length that was almost awkwardness tucker french put out his hand savage doc savage he said as if puzzled well ive never heard of you but apparently my brother has and he seems impressed monk had a story to tell doc he said excitedly doc when we came down to land in that clearing a vine rope tripped us just how doc asked did you know about the landing strip monk indicated bob french he knew naturally i knew the location of the strip bob french said tucker french his brother put in too quickly it could have been saying bob should know ive written him about it often enough and its easy to find in the fork of two rivers the way it is thats right bob said their glibness gave doc savage a queer feeling and the reason for the queerness he didnt exactly understand he said lets go back farther than that monk how did your parry happen to head for here in the first place for south america you mean monk scratched his head well back in new york after bob french called on renny asking for help then skipped out so mysteriously you assigned me the job of tracing bob french through the laundry mark on his blouse well i traced it to his address in long island city where i met these two girls who were also hunting french we joined up with benjy here who works for the girls and then we found bob french in the girls apartment monk deviated to explain about the mysterious very heavy something which old benjy had moved from the downtown warehouse to the girls apartment the stuff having been stolen by the men who had knocked out bob french bob french had regained consciousness after they kayoed him and heard them say they were headed for south america and what airport they were leaving from monk continued we figured we could tear out there and head them off well we tried but they were already taking off so i rented a plane in a hell of a hurry telephoned you and we followed them you didnt exactly follow them doc reminded him you had santa isabel on your mind you said you thought that was where they were heading sure what put santa isabel in your head monk pointed at bob french him bob nodded thats right i remembered hearing them say they would fly a straight course from caracas to santa isabel on the negros river in brazil doc said patiently now what put this particular landing field in your head him again monk indicated bob french bob french scowled slightly i got that idea no more than an hour ago when it suddenly dawned on me that this flight course would put us over brothers landing strip so monk said we thought wed sit down and ask brother tucker what it was all about you made a queer landing doc reminded him now tucker french entered the conversation if you dont mind he said i think we had better get the more important material you wish to salvage out of the plane and head for the safety of my trading post one of the natives had been grunting uneasily and now he burst out in a series of vocal sounds interspersed with grunting and snorting to express himself tucker french evidently understood the primitive language because he showed some concern there are hostile natives nearby in the jungle tucker french told doc doc made no comment could be he thought but if there were the grunting and snorting native hadnt heard them doc had been listening himself he was willing to bet that there hadnt been any sounds in the jungle which were manmade monk said the natives wrecked my plane they seized us as soon as we crashed they were carrying us off tucker french said fortunately i heard the plane come down and so i rushed to the spot surmising what might have happened with my men i was fortunate enough to overhaul the war party which had your friends and rescue them monk grinned that was nice timing too much of a fight doc asked not much there was some dart blowing then the little devils who had us just faded away into the jungle tucker french said theyre not anxious for a pitched fight with me theyre marauders more cunning than violent he grimaced however they did surprise me when they wrecked your plane my plane you mean doc said they wrecked it of course theyre persistent tucker french laughed grimly thats right theyre after me of course but theyve been after me for a year or so theyve tried this planewrecking gag with a vine rope before doc asked curiously oh yes matter of fact thats why i no longer use the strip they nearly got me what doc asked is the trouble between you and these natives tucker french shrugged why did my grandfather have to fight indians in dakota much the same sort of thing he glanced about uneasily at the jungle and one of the natives grunted excitedly pointing tucker french walked over to the object which was exciting the grunter and plucked it from a thick leaf in which it was embedded it was one of the tiny blowgun darts i dont believe we should stand around here any longer he said he opened his shirt and showed them that he wore a metallic mesh undershirt of the type often worn by explorers in the poisonarrow country even with one of these i dont feel safe they got going xii the walk was not long about half an hour powell dropped back with doc savage and talked glibly about the jungle it sounded to doc as if powell was talking from nervousness some of what he told them was trite stuff the piranha for instance the piranha were the small flat fish with the ferocious expressions and teeth that could cut like razors the fish which suddenly appeared in a stream by the thousands at the trace of blood and in a moment or two would leave nothing but the skeleton of a man doc listened patiently everybody he supposed had heard of piranha another thing powell talked about was the difference between the black jacare and the brown one the black one frequently reached a length of twentyfive feet and was the most dangerous of the caiman family you could guess the mind of a lightcolored jacare he warned but for gods sake be careful about the black ones powell was scared doc finally decided whether powell was frightened of the natives or not doc couldnt tell the going was not hard they were on a path a welltrimmed one and they went fast tucker french dropped back and told doc savage the path were on now is my main road to the river we use it frequently my place isnt far doc said nothing he was wondering why nobody had said a word about the pink elephant in the affair he cause of all the scuffling the heavy stuff whatever it was it seemed that everyone was avoiding it they reached tucker frenchs place anywhere but in the jungle it wouldnt have been impressive in the jungle it was it was in a stretch of country which an explorer would have called palmy which meant simply that it was higher ground welldrained that there were tall babassu palms the fronds of which met overhead to form a cathedrallike effect with the last of the evening sunlight streaming down there was an outer cultivated fence of thorn trees something like the hedge fences found in iowa and missouri but thicker more rank nothing larger than a mouse could pass through the fence readily the trading post was in the center of the fenced circle the fence being far enough away that no blowgun arrow could reach it there were four buildings none of them large connected with a low wall so that the effect was somewhat that of a fort but not too much so stone was the building material used the stone had been dug up on the site and laid with a mortar of local siliceous sand and lime made by burning limestone on the spot there was nothing extraordinary about the spot except that tucker frenchs personal quarters were airconditioned the airconditioning was not too good but it was better than the jungle heat tucker french was obviously proud of it i have some good mate he said how about a highball doc said grimly you might also serve up a little more information this sounded he realized more angry and suspicious than he intended tucker frenchs innocence was almost babylike i dont understand the box of snakeskins doc said what about it tucker french looked vaguely dumfounded as if he didnt in the least know what a box of snakeskins was sir roger powell said he means the box of snake hides you gave me to take to new york oh those said tucker french vaguely why i ship a few snake hides now and then what about them the box seems to be behind this trouble doc told him tucker french smiled oh you must be mistaken they were just snake skins doc said you gave them to powell to give to blassett and morris yes thats right blassett and morris had never heard of you and they dont deal in snake hides doc countered sharply we discussed that before your plane landed tucker french said easily im afraid i made an error error i understood blassett and morris were snakeskin dealers i was wrong tucker french smiled again but it wasnt very genuine doc could feel tension growing in the room there wasnt anything visible it was just a feeling the box was pretty heavy he said no one said anything grace blassett wasnt looking at anyone her face doc thought was getting a little gray with fright it was a pretty heavy box doc said three of us could barely lift it with levers then it suddenly became as light as a normal box should be tucker french smiled is this a ghost story doc was silent it was a difficult silence because he was trying to hold down a growing impulse to smash things he was he saw being roundly lied to he turned slowly to old benjy what was it that you took from that downtown warehouse in new york to the girls apartment he asked the old man benjy looked him in the eye nothing benjy said i didnt take anything you cant prove i did doc looked intently at the ceiling does anyone have the least idea why were down here he asked wearily to have a drink with me i hope tucker french said laughing again it was a queer laugh suddenly doc was sure that tucker french was a very dangerous fellow i dont drink doc said shortly the night came on slowly now and then a native would come to consult with tucker french to the effect that there was no sign of the other natives the bad ones the marauders doc gave no inkling that he could understand the grunts and snorts and cackling that was the native language he understood it fairly well well enough to know that the natives were saying what tucker french said they were saying also he understood the lingo well enough to know that the natives were mouthing exactly what they had been told to say the natives were poor actors they had poker faces but they didnt get the necessary conviction into their grunts and other sounds doc began to find cold sweat on the backs of his hands he knew it was along his backbone too he was frightened the outward appearance of things was as social as any cocktail hour would have been in the jungle it shouldnt have been it was unnatural monk and renny felt the same way he could tell monk was fascinated by pretty grace blassett but fear was beginning to get the better of monks prowling instincts rennys long face was more composed but his big hands were gripping various things the arms of his chair for instance very tightly a native announced dinner perhaps you would like to clean up tucker french said easily doc managed to get monk and renny alone in the modern bathroom how do you feel about this doc asked them monk said im beginning to sweat icicles were being ganged up on doc said renny nodded he thought so too doc said back there in the jungle during this capture and rescue thing you fellows went through did tucker french have a chance to talk to benjy the two girls and bob french without you hearing renny scowled yes he did notice any change after that come to think of it yes all right doc said its the three of us against the rest of them monk asked what do you think theyre planning to do with us i dont want to scare myself by wondering doc told him keep your eyes open he went back to the living room he found powell and tucker french holding a lipstoear conversation they didnt quite spring apart guiltily at least powell was the only one who sprang powell was just telling me the latest war news tucker french said im a few months behind on it they hadnt been discussing any war news doc knew powell looked too relieved he looked like a man who wanted to giggle like a man who had just won the sweepstakes dont you have a radio doc asked idly its out of order tucker french said one of the fool natives broke the tubes doc said your brother bob says he received a cablegram from you tucker french smiled his worst smile thats quite a mystery isnt it he said i wonder who could have sent it quite a mystery doc agreed trying to use the same maneating cheerful tone tucker french was using dinner was uneventful but it was also as false as the gaiety of medical school students eating dinner on a dissecting table as a gag doc himself ate nothing which tucker french did not sample first he noticed that monk and renny didnt either throughout the meal tucker french kept up a running fire of questions at his brother bob what kind of action did you see in the army was china very interesting how many times were you shot at they werent the questions somehow that a brother would ask another brother and the answers werent right either they were forced doc formed a fairly certain conviction that bob french didnt like what was going on but for some reason or other felt that he couldnt do anything about it after dinner doc said i have a portable radio we might tune in some news he went to get the little portable outfit a transmitterreceiver combination affair which under favorable conditions could reach some other station probably one at manaos or bogota he found the radio smashed these damned dumb natives tucker french said with anger which must be feigned one of them smashed it im afraid doc nodded and the radio transmitters in both planes were doubtless ruined in the crash he said im afraid so tucker french said thats too bad indeed it is tucker french agreed do you and your two friends mind sharing the same bedroom not at all ill show you where it is the bedroom was large and had several very small windows which doc was particular to note were not large enough to permit a man to escape by crawling through them tucker french in the course of looking over the room emitted a startled cry and sprang forward he bent over a small object on the floor for gods sake keep away from this he cried the insect on the floor was an ant it was a peculiar ant however it was about an inch and a quarter long with a velvety appearance and an enormous head doc had a near malaria chill for a moment an isle ant the bites of the things were deadly poison tucker french told them what it was he dressed it up a little making it sound as if the isle bite was worse than that of a cobra its the work of those infernal natives who were shooting poisoned arrows at us tucker french told them emphatically now and then they catch some isle ants and let them loose near my stockade fence this one must have worked its way into the house ill help you search your bedclothing for more of them they didnt find any more isle i dont believe it is safe for you to walk around the place during the night tucker french told them yes that seems to be fairly obvious doc agreed using the maneating cheerful tone when they were alone in the bedroom monk whispered say are we gonna stay in here tonight we are not doc said vehemently then what we are going to the bathroom together again doc said they strolled to the bathroom they met tucker french en route and told him they were going to the bathroom the bathroom had a window a man could crawl through crawl out doc said hide dont move around and get yourselves seen in an hour or so or when everyone is asleep come and get me out of that bedroom because i have a hunch the door will be locked by then renny having difficulty keeping his whisper from being a roar like his voice whispered and ive got a hunch nobody plans to sleep in this house tonight out of the window doc said how you going to cover when they check up to make sure were all in our little beds ill try to sound like all three of us doc said get going renny went out of the window monk followed monk whispered if those jungle natives hanging around you can forget the jungle natives hanging around doc said yes but will they forget me they arent eh those jungle natives doc said are the figments of tucker powells imagination i hope monk shivered before he disappeared and said i hope so too doc went back to the bedroom he didnt meet anyone he closed the door and locked it on the inside after noting that there was a padlock hasp on the outside it was a very strong door he took off his shoes and lay down on one bed and turned out the light then waited for the checkup a knock on the door yes thought you might like some cold beer as a nightcap tucker frenchs voice said doc said monk do you want some cold beer imitating monks voice as closely as he could doc said no my feet are cold enough as it is renny no thanks using rennys voice i guess not doc said using his own voice again well sleep tight tucker french said he sounded as if he had been fooled surmising that the fellow might listen outside the door doc proceeded to carry on a threesided conversation using the voices of renny monk and himself he did that for a while then he had his voices agree that they might as well get some sleep lying there after he had finished he felt silly he was pretty good at voice mimicry he had practiced it a lot and he had used it before but he felt silly anyway he was somewhat pleased too it was a crazy sort of a thing to do he liked such things he thought back lying there in the darkness of the monologue he had given while flying south in the plane with renny and powell about his strange youth about the lack of a normal boys devilment and small adventures which had featured his youth of how he was convinced that having missed such things as a kid accounted for his present interest in the fantastic and the adventurous and the quixotic the selfanalysis was accurate he hoped it was a sensible explanation of the elation with which he seized upon a goofy way of accomplishing something instead of using a more normal probably more sensible method like the trick he was trying to pull now such methods probably meant he needed psychoanalysis he reflected xiii a couple of hours later monk mayfair clubbed someone over the head outside the door it didnt make much noise doc whispered watch the door it squeaks they eased the panel open carefully lucky they didnt have it padlocked monk breathed just stuck a bolt in the staple who did you hit one of the local boys monk explained he was standing here with a rifle but he turned his back they carried the native into the bedroom monk had used his fist on the fellow so he would probably revive in time tie him and gag him doc said they ran into difficulty the native had some kind of adenoidal difficulty which rendered him unable to breathe through his nose if they gagged him he would suffocate renny said ive got an idea he went away and came back with the carafe of mate which had been served earlier in the night he began pouring it down the native monk started to giggle he finally had to collapse on the edge of the bed and hold his mouth what the hells the matter with you renny demanded what you trying to do to that native make him drunk so he cant talk for a while with mate sure mate is a form of tea it has no alcoholic content and contains less caffeine than ordinary tea or coffee renny stared at the carafe intently without a word he put it down on the floor and walked out doc kept a straight face with some difficulty renny came back with a squaresided bottle he said at least i know what gin is he began pouring gin down the native who had been on guard doc shook a little with silent laughter entertained by rennys sheepish disgust it was good he suddenly realized to be able to laugh the mirth like a clean shower washed away some of the slime that continual fear was beginning to deposit on his nerves while renny was funneling gin down the native doc asked monk anything been going on plenty big powwow in the main storeroom monk said what about no idea renny and i couldnt get near enough to overhear who attended everyone the two girls uhhuh monk said sourly i cant feature grace blansett being mixed in something shady but i guess she is renny straightened lets go see what the powwow has developed into the bigfisted engineer suggested they moved warily through the house stepping cautiously stopping to listen doc found an outer door moved it carefully and got it open without enough sound to worry them they stepped out into the night something seemed to be going on around at the front of the place careful doc breathed a moment later they could see what was happening rennys holy cow theyre all going into the jungle wasnt necessary it was a grimfaced group in front of the trading post they were all there except tucker french and he appeared shortly with an electric lantern dragging a twowheeled iron cart the cart was small with widetread wheels it was something like a wheelbarrow except that it was twowheeled tucker french told benjy you bring this benjy took the cart they walked toward the gate in the hedge tucker french unfastened the gate he did not close it the gate was unguarded monk growled say theyre not much scared of the boys with the blowguns there arent any boys with blowguns besieging the place doc said but that arrow tucker french found sticking in a leaf he probably stuck it there himself doc said then found it later for our benefit come on the jungle darkness was thick because of the canopy of palms overhead nothing happened when they passed through the gate doc went ahead feeling the way there was a path not hard to follow the iron cart benjy was dragging had taken to squeaking the sound was a help the way led sharply upward there was a hill which they had not noticed particularly from the air hills in the jungle were difficult to locate because frequently the trees in the damper jungle grew a hundred feet taller than those on drier high ground this hill was rocky too the trees on it became not much more than rank bushes the path was not wide but it was solid easily followed the canopy of foliage above shut off less light now so they could see where they were going discern the path easily the cluster of lights ahead came to a stop take your time getting up on them doc warned and separate when we meet it will be on the west side toward the moon he parted from monk and renny silently because it was obvious the group ahead did not expect to be followed he went ahead boldly only using care not to make any noise powell tucker french bob french and all the others were gathered together benjy was leaning on the iron cart mopping perspiration doc frowned evidently they were where they were going but the spot did not look interesting there was just rock hard stone which could be some sort of quartz tucker french made a speech he said like every explorer i was always taking rock samples when i traveled this rock here is quartz and you find minerals in quartz veins frequently so i prospected the place as a matter of course powell said your finding it was an accident then not entirely tucker french told him my compass was acting funny as anything and that aroused my curiosity it led me to the exact spot right here yes i dont see anything tucker french laughed i hope not all the trouble i took to hide it he began kicking brush aside exposing an expanse of loose stone help me toss the loose rock aside he said how far down is it powell demanded eagerly right on top almost doc watched them remove the loose stone from a small pit all of them worked but the two girls and bob french these three stood back whitefaced and watched once tucker french said to his brother get in here and help bob bob french said nothing did not help they cleared the hole and climbed out tucker french said lets get our breath he mopped his face then continued maybe it hit in the form of a meteor centuries ago i dont know what makes you think a meteor powell asked well the only thing that science has ever heard of that is anything like it is the substance of which one of the stars is composed astronomers found a star made of something like it old benjy snorted how the hell can they tell what a star is made of they can dont kid yourself tucker french told him they analyze the light from the star somehow i cant give you the exact procedure but they get what they call a spectra by breaking up the light if the body is hot they get what they call an emission spectra and its fairly easy to make a spectrum analysis with a gadget made of flint and crown glass prisms i think thats enough to confuse me benjy said ill take your word tucker french said all right lets get a chunk out well have to use crowbars and tongs he got down in the pit with powell for the next ten minutes the men alternately struggled cursed and perspired it took four of them to lift out what they were after the object they had as nearly as doc could make out was not much larger than a marble hell this is a light piece tucker french said you kidding benjy said tucker french said they had better rest a while before trying to put it into the cart this is lighter than the one i sent to new york embedded in the bottom of the box which held the snake skins tucker french said that one was not much larger than the eraser off a pencil bob french frowned at his brother howd you get the other piece out by stripping the inside of my cargo plane tucker told him then i reinforced the ship so that it would carry it i flew it as far as cartagena made up the special box got enough snake hides locally to fill it and turned it over to powell to take north bob french wheeled to powell so you knew what it was all along powell hesitated yes and you were going to steal the sample tucker french laughed unpleasantly he was going to steal not only the sample but the whole deposit he got in touch with blassett and morris told them what he had and found out it was valuable so he got a gang together intending to come back down here and do me in powell said coldly i wasnt going to kill anybody i can imagine tucker said bitterly bob french growled now wait a minute dont start a fight let me get this straight powell i can see why you lied to me and said you didnt know anything about any heavy stuff you didnt want to give away the secret but what about that attack on you in the new york hotel fake arranged it myself powell sounded pleased with himself that was to fool doc savage make him think i didnt know anything about anything to make him think i was in danger and needed his protection as long as he was protecting me i would know what he was doing at the warehouse it was your men who tried to kill him yes you were with them why wouldnt the gas have killed you because i would have got the hell out of there before it did i wasnt tied like the others my men just pretended to tie me but old benjy came busting in and ruined the plan bob french shook his head strangely he turned to the two girls said and you were in on it too murder and all grace gasped shook her head mutely her companion bill said no no we didnt have any part in that it looks to me as if you did bill looked ill she said powell came to us and told us about the heavy stuff and we knew it was valuable but we didnt trust powell and began watching him we saw he was up to something crooked so we began trying to get the heavy stuff ourselves oh you were going to steal it yourself bill shook her head we were protecting your brothers interests we wanted to handle the heavy stuff but not if there was crooked work connected with it bob french spat violently just sheep in the wolf den he said his brother said cut it out bob bob french stared at his brother he did not say anything more old benjy leaning on the cart again said to put it all in a nutshell tucker french found this stuff tucker french couldnt go to new york to sell it himself on account of he is a draftdodger so tucker gave a sample to powell to take to new york and arrange a sale powell tried to steal the whole thing blassett and morris tried to prevent it bob french tried to prevent it doc savage tried to prevent it we all wound up here one big happy family said bob french bitterly why not his brother shouted at him we decided there was no need for violence that there was enough money in it for all of us so we would all drop our schemes and work together isnt that sensible doc savage bob french said what do you plan to do with savage and his two friends let him cool off tucker french said then tell him the truth if he wants to be contrary there is nothing he can do at the worst we may have to make him walk to civilization which will take him a couple of months grace blassett said anxiously you mean that youre not going to kill him good god no tucker french exclaimed lets get this piece loaded and get back to the post they heaved and grunted some more and finally got the small fragment of whatever it was loaded into the cart tucker french flopped down on the ground puffing im exhausted he gasped bob you and benjy and the girls go ahead with the cart powell and i will be along as soon as we catch our breath powell puffed golly thats an idea he flopped down beside tucker french old benjy began wrestling with the cart he and bob french pulled the two girls pushed they struggled down the trail with the unwieldy load doc remained where he was tucker french and powell he was sure had remained behind for some good reason tucker french did nothing but breathe heavily for a while then he growled well you know where it is now how much is in there powell asked piece the size of a small house nearly as i can tell powell whistled softly thats plenty tucker french asked anxiously youre sure its worth a lot of money hell yes powell exclaimed instantly i think the best market is to sell it in tiny bits to scientists and scientific institutions and museums divided up like that itll be worth as much as gold more theres nothing else like it on earth every scientific research laboratory will want a piece tucker french nodded i hoped it would have some specific value immediately its a new element you dont seem to realize the curiosity value of the stuff alone powell told him we would divide it up in pieces the size of a pea and get a million bucks peddling it to people who just wanted a chunk for a curiosity you reckon thats the only value its got i dont know probably not well have to find out the two were silent for a while the iron cart was squeaking in the distance powell laughed suddenly it wasnt pleasant whats the matter with you tucker french demanded nervously what are you laughing at at doc savage powell said what do you mean you know what weve got to do with savage dont you eh kill him kill monk mayfair and renny renwick too xiv the two men sat there tucker french stared sickly at the ground he didnt say anything the two girls and that benjy had better be gotten out of the way too powell said tucker french shuddered i i cant stand for that you wont have to french stared at him what do you mean powell said you know my boys in the first airplane the ones in the plane which savages plane and the other ship with monk and benjy and the girls and your brother followed down here tucker french shook his head what have they got to do with it plenty but doc savage doesnt know theyre here he doesnt know that the plane bringing them landed ahead of everyone else let them out and then the pilot took the plane on to santa isabel to make a false trail if one was necessary no he doesnt know that tucker french said uneasily i dont like your tone what the hell are you driving at my boys are hiding out in the jungle near here all right let them stay out of sight pay them whatever you agreed to pay them and dont tell them anything and you dont get the idea powell said coldly youre slow brother tucker french started to get to his feet he acted like a man halffrozen powell took a gun out of his clothing said sit down sucker tucker french sat down slowly you get it now dont you powell said yo youre not uhhuh you bet i am powell cocked his gun it was a revolver im going to take over savage and his two friends have to go why not you your brother old benjy the two girls too my god youre insane tucker frenchs voice was hoarse dont move powell said powell put two fingers between his lips and whistled shrilly three times thats the signal to bring my men he said i told them to stick around and follow us when we left the stockade follow our lights i told them doc savage came to his feet he had for the few brief seconds that he was given to have it the ghastly certainty that he and monk and renny had walked into a devilish predicament he was right from nearby a voice one of powells men yelled watch out boss savage and two of his men are around here tucker french jumped at powell then and powell shot french twice putting both bullets in tucker frenchs face the weird part of what followed was the part played by the flashlight which tucker french was holding when he died the convulsion which came when the bullets hit him caused him to throw the flashlight it spun in the air for a moment splattering light over the jungle as if there was a series of lightning flashes and when it landed it did not go out but rested in a bush with the beam planted on tucker frenchs body it remained there blazing light on the body powell backed into the jungle after he shot tucker french backed slowly holding his gun ready doc moved silently stalking him powell called you say savage and his men are here yeah how do you know they followed you up here ahead of us weve been hoping to find a fight broke out in the nearby jungle two blows a shot scuffling brush snapping monk doc knew it had to be monk anyone else would have had better sense than start a fight against odds in the jungle night doc lunged for powell it was too far and moreover he tripped the best he could do was slam his shoulder against powell violently powell didnt fall he just received a hard push and kept going doc went down tangled in vines powell whirled his gun made thunder and winking red glare doc rolled got behind a tree trunk powell screamed get together dont try to fight them here get together well go to the trading post where monk was fighting sudden silence came then monks voice said i got two gunsound crashed in the jungle again a revolver made five splitting roars emptying itself then silence suddenly footsteps were pounding madly from the direction of the post up the trail it was bob french he stopped when he saw his brother doc couldnt distinguish him in the darkness but he heard bob frenchs breathing stop who did that to tuck bob french asked hollowly powell doc said this is savage monk and renny are around so are powells men and powell be careful how many shut up doc said how many a gun cracked as someone fired at bob frenchs voice bob french shot back instantly he killed a man the man he killed didnt scream but began breathing his life away with awful labored sounds that were somewhat like snoring i was hoping theyd shoot at my voice bob french said thats one then they heard from renny he rumbled here they are the rest of them and his roar merged with the frantic splatter of gunfire doc charged the sound he heard monk going for it too but bob french was ahead of them both bob french with fury violence junglefighting experience and a gun for the next few seconds it was one of those things you dont exactly remember afterward not that things moved too fast to remember it was more the fear the frenzy of trying not to be killed and to kill maim mangle do anything to save your life doc himself had a throat when silence fell he had to force himself making quite an effort to relinquish his grip before the man he was holding should die how many bob frenchs voice asked monk said six seven including powell bob french said renny im okay rennys voice said a little like the burma jungles wasnt it uhhuh is this all renny asked thats all bob french said providing doc savage corrected the natives dont give us trouble the natives didnt give them trouble it made no difference to them their spokesman explained to doc what the white men did to each other they hadnt been enthusiastic about what was going on anyway the natives would dig graves for those who had been killed though bob french insisted that his brother not be buried with powell bob said he had no particular regret at having killed powell i blame powell more than my brother bob explained grimly tucker was a coward at heart and i knew it and i never blamed him something like that a man has or he hasnt doc said tucker did not start out trying to be crooked i dont think so bob agreed tucker was a draft dodger though i knew that thats why back in new york when i went to renwick for help i acted so queer when i found out you would get into the affair i knew you wouldnt have much sympathy for a draft dodger so i tried to back out i didnt want to see tucker in the penitentiary he was my brother and ive fought enough of this war for our whole damned family ill tell the natives about the graves thanks bob french said quietly his eyes were wet when he turned away the next two days were uneventful doc savage was trying to get enough radio parts together to make a transmitter he did not have much luck renny spent most of his time fooling with the heavy stuff it was a new element of some sort new as far as anyone having actually gotten hands on any although astronomers had discovered the stuff on a star the stuff intrigued renny he began coming up with all kinds of ideas about how they would dispose of it monk was also having ideas some of them fairly desperate his prize idea was that doc renny and bob french take the twofisted girl bill along with them on the jungle trek to civilization he monk would stay behind with grace and old benjy benjy could be chaperone benjy is getting down with malaria so hed be an ideal chaperone monk said hopefully whats the matter with you and bill doc asked monk shivered she scares me you dont scare her ive noticed doc told him she gives you quite a bit of her time yeah so damned much of it that i havent been able to make any hay with grace monk complained you know what that bill reminds me of what you know that big gangling bug around here they call a praying mantis the female mantis marries the male then eats him for her wedding breakfast thats the way bill affects me doc kept his face straight and said renny and bob french and i were talking and we thought we might leave you and bill here with benjy while the rest of us made the trip out god help me monk said in the end none of them had to walk out the man who had gone on to santa isabel with the plane came back evidently the arrangement had been for him to return with the plane in three days he made a nice landing and they did an equally nice job of taking him and the plane back intact the existence of this extremely heavy matter is not imagination scientists have discovered a star in the sky composed of extremely heavy matter as a writer on scientific oddities recently put it a piece of it the size of a golf ball would weigh one thousand four hundred and sixty tons not pounds tons
