professor wogglebugs great idea the very thing exclaimed professor wogglebug bounding into the air and upsetting his gold inkwell the very next idea who me a roundfaced little munchkin boy stuck his head in the door and regarded professor wogglebug solemnly he was working his way through the professors athletic college and one of his duties was to wait upon this eminent educator of oz certainly not snapped professor wogglebug youre a nobody or a nothing stop gaping and fetch me my hat im off to the emerald city and mind the pupils take their history pills regularly while im gone he added clapping his tall hat zif held out to him on the back of his head yes sir said the little munchkin respectfully dont hurry back sir this last remark the professor did not hear for he was already half way down the college steps ozma will be delighted with the idea how clever i am he murmured twirling his antennae and walking rapidly down the pleasant blue lane the professor whose college of art and athletic perfection is in the southwestern part of the munchkin country is the biggest bug in oz or in anyplace else for that matter he has made education painless by substituting school pills for books his students take latin history and spelling pills they swallow knowledge of every kind with ease and pleasure and spend the rest of their time in sport no wonder he is so well thought of in oz no wonder he thinks so well of himself swinging his cane jauntily the professor hurried toward the yellow brick road that leads to the emerald city and by nightfall had reached the lovely capital of oz oz that marvelous country where no one grows old where animals and birds talk as sensibly as people and adventures happen every day indeed of all fairylands in the world oz is the most delightful and of all fairy cities the emerald city is the most beautiful a soft green light shone for miles about and the gemmed turrets and spires of the palace flashed more brightly than the stars but its loveliness was familiar to professor wogglebug and without a pause he proceeded to ozmas palace and was at once admitted to the great hall a roar of merriment greeted his ears ozma the lovely girl ruler of oz was having a party and the room was full of most surprising people surprising to some that is but old friends to most of us jack holding tightly to his pumpkin head was running as fast as his wooden feet and wobbly legs would take him from dorothy a game of blindmansbuff was in full swing and scraps and tiktok the scarecrow and nick chopper the glass cat and the cowardly lion the wizard of oz and the wooden sawhorse capn bill and betsy bobbin billina and the hungry tiger were tumbling over each other in an effort to keep away from the blindfolded little girl but dorothy was too quick for them with a sudden whirl she spun round and grasped a coatsleeve the scarecrow she laughed triumphantly i can tell by the way he skwoshes and now hes it im always it chuckled the droll person but hah behold the learned professor standing so aloofly in our midst no one had noticed professor wogglebug who had been quietly watching the game i dont like to interrupt the party he began approaching ozmas throne apologetically but ive just had a most brilliant idea what another murmured the scarecrow rolling up his eyes where did you lose it asked jack pumpkinhead edging forward anxiously lose it who said id lost it snapped the professor glaring at poor jack well you said youd had it and had is the past tense so jacks voice trailed off uncertainly and ozma seeing he was embarrassed begged the professor to explain your highness began professor wogglebug while the company settled down in a resigned circle on the floor as oz is the most interesting and delightful country on the continent of imagination and its people the most unusual and talented i am about to compile a royal book which will give the names and history of all our people in other words i am to be the great grand genealogist of oz whatever that is the scarecrow whispered in dorothys ear and the professor frowned severely on the scarecrow with your majestys permission i shall start at once please do said the scarecrow with a wave toward the door and we will go on with the party scraps the patchwork girl who had been staring fixedly at the professor with her silver suspenderbutton eyes now sprang to her feet what is a genealogist its something no one here has missed what puts such notions in your head turn out your toes or go to bed she shouted gaily then catching ozmas disapproving glance fell over backwards i dont understand it at all said jack pumpkinhead in a depressed voice im afraid my heads too ripe nor i said tiktok the copper clockwork man please wind me up a little tighter dorothy i want to think dorothy obligingly took a key suspended from a hook on his back and wound him up under his left arm everybody began to talk at once and what with the cowardly lions deep growl and tiktoks squeaky voice and all the rest of the tin and meat and wooden voices the confusion was terrible wait cried ozma clapping her hands immediately the room grew so still that one could hear tiktoks machinery whirring round now said ozma one at a time please and let us hear from the scarecrow first the scarecrow rose i think your highness he said modestly that anyone who has studied his geozify already knows who we are and who you are broke in the wogglebug scornfully of course they do but i shall tell them who you were who i were gasped the scarecrow in a dazed voice raising his cotton glove to his forehead who i were well who were i thats just the point said professor wogglebug who were you who were your ancestors where is your family where is your family tree from what did you descend at each question the scarecrow looked more embarrassed he repeated the last one several times from what did i descend from what did i descend why from a bean pole he cried this was perfectly true for dorothy a little girl blown by a kansas cyclone to the kingdom of oz had discovered the scarecrow in a farmers cornfield and had lifted him down from his pole together they had made the journey to the emerald city where the wizard of oz had fitted him out with a fine set of brains at one time he had ruled oz and was generally considered its cleverest citizen before he could reply further the patchwork girl who was simply irrepressible burst out an exstrawordinary man is he a bean pole for his family tree a cornishman upon my soul descended from a tall thin pole nonsense said professor wogglebug sharply being stuffed with straw may make him extraordinary but it is quite plain that the scarecrow was nobody before he was himself he has no ancestors no family only a bean pole for a family tree and is therefore entitled to the merest mention in the royal book of oz how about my brains asked the scarecrow in a hurt voice arent they enough brains have simply nothing to do with royalty professor wogglebug waved his fountain pen firmly now but see here wasnt i ruler of oz put in the scarecrow anxiously a ruler but never a royalty snapped out the professor now if you will all answer my questions as i call your names ill get the necessary data and be off he took out a small memorandum book your highness he bowed to ozma need not bother i have already entered your name at the head of the list being descended as you are from a long line of fairies your family tree is the oldest and most illustrious in oz princess dorothy at the sound of her name the little girl stood up i know you are from kansas and were created a princess of oz by our gracious ruler but can you tell me anything of your ancestors in america demanded the professor staring over the top of his thick glasses youll have to ask uncle henry and aunt em said dorothy rather sulkily the professor had hurt the feelings of her best friend the scarecrow and ancestors did not interest her one little bit very well said the professor writing industriously in his book ill just enter you as dorothy princess of oz and sixth cousin to a president im not dorothy shook her head positively oh everyone in america can claim that said the professor easily nick chopper now up rose our old friend the tin woodman who had also been discovered by dorothy on her first trip to the fairyland of oz you were a man of meat at one time and a woodman by trade queried professor wogglebug poising his pen in the air i am a tin woodman and you may enter me in your book under the name of smith for a tin smith made me and as royal emperor of the winkies i do not care to go back to my meat connections said the tin woodman in a dignified voice the company applauded and the cowardly lion thumped the floor with his tail smith is a very good name i can work up a whole chapter on that smiled the professor the tin woodman had once been a regular person but a wicked witch enchanted his ax and first it chopped off one leg then the other and next both arms and his head after each accident nick went to a tinsmith for repairs and finally was entirely made of tin nowhere but in oz could such a thing happen but no one can be killed in this marvelous country and nick with his tin body went gaily on living and was considered so distinguished that the winkies had begged him to be their emperor scraps called the professor as nick sat stiffly down beside dorothy the patchwork girl pirouetted madly to the front putting one finger in her mouth she sang im made of patches as you see a clothes tree is my family tree but pshaw its all the same to me a clothes tree even professor wogglebug grinned who could help laughing at scraps made of odd pieces of goods and brought to life by the powder of life the comical girl was the jolliest person imaginable put me down as a man of metal drawled tiktok the copper man as the laugh following scraps rhyme had subsided tiktok was still another of dorothys discoveries and this marvelous machine man guaranteed to last a thousand years could think walk and talk when properly wound the cowardly lion was entered as a king in his own right one after the other the celebrities of oz came forward to answer professor wogglebugs questions the professor wrote rapidly in his little book ozma listened attentively to each one and they all seemed interested except the scarecrow slumped down beside dorothy he stared morosely at the ceiling his jolly face all wrinkled down on one side if i only knew who i were he muttered over and over i must think dont you mind dorothy patted his shoulder kindly royalties are out of date and ill bet the professors family tree was a milkweed but the scarecrow refused to be comforted and long after the company had retired he sat hunched sadly in his corner ill do it ill do it he exclaimed at last rising unsteadily to his feet jellia jamb ozmas little waiting maid returning somewhat later to fetch a handkerchief her mistress had dropped was surprised to see him running through the long hall why where are you going asked jellia to find my family tree said the scarecrow darkly and drawing himself up to his full height he fell through the doorway chapter the scarecrows family tree the moon shone brightly but everyone in the emerald city was fast asleep through the deserted streets hurried the scarecrow for the first time since his discovery by little dorothy he was really unhappy living as he did in a fairyland he had taken many things for granted and had rather prided himself on his unusual appearance indeed not until professor wogglebugs rude remarks concerning his family had he given his past a thought i am the only person in oz without a family he reflected sorrowfully even the cowardly lion has kingly parents and a palm tree but i must keep thinking my brains have never failed me yet who was i who were i who were i often he thought so hard that he forgot to look where he was going and ran headlong into fences stumbled down gutters and over stiles but fortunately the dear fellow could not hurt himself and he would struggle up pat his straw into shape and walk straightway into something else he made good time in between falls however and was soon well on his way down the yellow brick road that ran through the munchkin country for he had determined to return to the munchkin farm where dorothy had first discovered him and try to find some traces of his family now being stuffed with straw had many advantages for requiring neither food nor sleep the scarecrow could travel night and day without interruption the stars winked out one by one and by the time the cocks of the munchkin farmers began to crow he had come to the banks of a broad blue river the scarecrow took off his hat and scratched his head thoughtfully crossing rivers is no easy matter in oz for there isnt a ferry in the kingdom and unless one is a good swimmer or equipped with some of the wizards magic it is mighty troublesome water does not agree with the scarecrow at all and as for swimming he can no more swim than a bag of meal but he was too wise a person to give up merely because a thing appeared to be impossible it was for just such emergencies that his excellent brains had been given to him if nick chopper were here he would build a raft in no time murmured the scarecrow but as he is not i must think of another way turning his back on the river which distracted his mind he began to think with all his might before he could collect his thoughts there was a tremendous crash and next minute he was lying face down in the mud several little crashes followed and a shower of water then a wet voice called out with a cheerful chuckle come on out my dear rattles not a bad place at all and heres breakfast already waiting breakfast the scarecrow turned over cautiously a huge and curious creature was slashing through the grass toward him a smaller and still more curious one followed both were extremely damp and had evidently just come out of the river good morning quavered the scarecrow sitting up with a jerk and at the same time reaching for a stick that lay just behind him i wont eat it if it talks so there the smaller creature stopped and stared fixedly at the scarecrow the scarecrow hearing this tried to think of something else to say but the appearance of the two was so amazing that as he told dorothy afterwards he was struck dumb the larger was at least two hundred feet long and made entirely of blocks of wood on each block was a letter of the alphabet the head was a huge square block with a serpents face and long curling tapemeasure tongue the little one was very much smaller and seemed to consist of hundreds of rattles wood celluloid and rubber fastened together with wires every time it moved the rattles tinkled its face however was not unpleasant so the scarecrow took heart and made a deep bow and im not going to eat anything that squirms this time it was the big serpent who spoke thank you said the scarecrow bowing several times more you relieve my mind ive never been a breakfast yet and id rather not begin but if i cannot be your breakfast let me be your friend he extended his arms impulsively there was something so jolly about the scarecrows smile that the two creatures became friendly at once and moreover told him the story of their lives as you have doubtless noted began the larger creature i am an absea serpent i am employed in the nursery of the mer children to teach them their letters my friend here is a rattlesnake and it is his business to amuse the mer babies while the mermaids are mermarketing once a year we take a vacation and proceeding from the sea depths up a strange river we came out upon this shore perhaps you sir will be able to tell us where we are you are in the munchkin country of the land of oz explained the scarecrow politely it is a charming place for a vacation i would show you about myself if i were not bound on an important mission here the scarecrow sighed deeply have you a family he asked the absea serpent curiously yes indeed replied the monster snapping its tapemeasure tongue in and out i have five greatgrandmothers twentyone grandnieces seven brothers and six sistersinlaw ah murmured the scarecrow clasping his hands tragically how i envy you i have no one no aunts no ancestors no family no family tree but a bean pole i am alas a man without a past the scarecrow looked so dejected that the rattlesnake thought he was going to cry oh cheer up it begged in a distressed voice think of your presence here i give you permission to shake me the scarecrow was so affected by this kind offer that he cheered up immediately no past but a presence ill remember that he swelled out his straw chest complacently and leaning over stroked the rattlesnake on the head are you good at riddles asked the rattlesnake timidly well answered the scarecrow judiciously i have very good brains given me by the famous wizard of oz then why is the absea serpent like a city asked the rattlesnake promptly the scarecrow thought hard for several seconds because it is made up of blocks he roared triumphantly thats easy now its my turn why is the absea serpent such a slow talker give it up said the rattlesnake after shaking himself several times because his tongue is a tape measure and he has to measure his words cried the scarecrow snapping his clumsy fingers and thats a good one if i did make it myself i must remember to tell it to dorothy then he sobered quite suddenly for the thought of dorothy brought back the purpose of his journey interrupting the rattlesnake in the midst of a new riddle he explained how anxious he was to return to the little farm where he had been discovered and try to find some traces of his family and the real riddle he sighed with a wave of his hand is how to cross this river thats easy and no riddle at all rumbled the absea serpent who had been listening attentively to the scarecrows remarks ill stretch across and you can walk over suiting the action to the word he began backing very cautiously toward the river so as not to shake the scarecrow off his feet mind your ps and qs called the rattlesnake warningly it was well that he spoke for the absea serpent had doubled the p and q blocks under and they were ready to snap off finally however he managed to make a bridge of himself and the scarecrow stepped easily over the blocks the huge serpent holding himself rigid just as he reached y the unfortunate creature sneezed and all the blocks rattled together up flew the scarecrow and escaped falling into the stream only by the narrowest margin blockhead shrilled the rattlesnake who had taken a great fancy to the scarecrow im all right cried the scarecrow rather breathlessly thank you very much he sprang nimbly up the bank hope you have a pleasant vacation cant with a rattlepate like that the absea serpent nodded glumly in the rattlesnakes direction now dont quarrel begged the scarecrow you are both charming and unusual and if you follow that yellow road you will come to the emerald city and ozma will be delighted to welcome you the emerald city we must see that my dear rattles forgetting his momentary displeasure the absea serpent pulled himself out of the river and waving his x y z blocks in farewell to the scarecrow went clattering down the road the little rattlesnake rattling along behind him as for the scarecrow he continued his journey and the day was so delightful and the country so pleasant that he almost forgot he had no family he was treated everywhere with the greatest courtesy and had innumerable invitations from the hospitable munchkins he was anxious to reach his destination however so he refused them all and traveling night and day came without further mishap or adventure late on the second evening to the little munchkin farm where dorothy had first discovered him he was curious to know whether the pole on which he had been hoisted to scare away the crows still stood in the cornfield and whether the farmer who had made him could tell him anything further about his history it is a shame to waken him thought the kind scarecrow ill just take a look in the cornfield the moon shone so brightly that he had no trouble finding his way about with a little cry of pleasure he pushed his way through the dry cornstalks there in the center of the field stood a tall pole the very identical bean pole from which he had descended all the family or family tree ive got cried the scarecrow running toward it with emotion whats that a window in the farmhouse was thrown up and a sleepy munchkin thrust out his head what are you doing he called crossly thinking said the scarecrow leaning heavily against the bean pole well dont do it out loud snapped the farmer then catching a better view of the scarecrow he cried in surprise why its you come right in my dear fellow and give us the latest news from the emerald city ill fetch a candle the farmer was very proud of the scarecrow he had made him long ago by stuffing one of his old suits with straw painting a jolly face on a sack stuffing that and fastening the two together red boots a hat and yellow gloves had finished his man and nothing could have been jollier than the result later on when the scarecrow had run off with dorothy and got his brains from the wizard of oz and become ruler of the emerald city the little farmer had felt highly gratified the scarecrow however was not in a humor for conversation he wanted to think in peace dont bother he called up im going to spend the night here ill see you in the morning all right take care of yourself yawned the farmer and drew in his head for a long time the scarecrow stood perfectly still beside the bean pole thinking then he got a spade from the shed and began clearing away the cornstalks and dried leaves from around the base of the pole it was slow work for his fingers were clumsy but he persevered then a wonderful idea came to him perhaps if i dig down a bit i may discover he got no further for at the word discover he pushed the spade down with all his might there was a loud crash the bottom dropped out of things and the scarecrow fell through great cornstalks cried the scarecrow throwing up his arms to his surprise they came in contact with a stout pole which he embraced it was a lifesaver for he was shooting down into the darkness at a great rate why he gasped as soon as he regained his breath for he was falling at a terrific rate of speed why i believe im sliding down the bean pole chapter down the magic bean pole hugging the bean pole for dear life the scarecrow slid rapidly downward everything was dark but at times a confused roaring sounded in his ears father i hear something falling past shouted a gruff voice all at once then reach out and pull it in growled a still deeper voice there was a flash of light a door opened suddenly and a giant hand snatched the air just above the scarecrows head its a good thing i havent a heart to fail me murmured the scarecrow glancing up fearfully and clinging more tightly to the pole though i fall i shall not falter but where under the earth am i falling to at that minute a door opened far below and someone called up who are you have out your toll and be ready to salute the royal ruler of the middlings the scarecrow had learned in the course of his many and strange adventures that it was best to accede to every request that was reasonable or possible realizing that unless he answered at once he would fall past his strange questioners he shouted amiably i am the scarecrow of oz sliding down my family tree the words echoed oddly in the narrow passageway and by the time he reached the word tree the scarecrow could make out two large brown men leaning from a door somewhere below next minute he came to a sharp stop a board had shot out and closed off the passageway so sudden was the stop that the scarecrow was tossed violently upward while he endeavored to regain his balance the two middlings eyed him curiously so this is the kind of thing they grow on top said one holding a lantern close to the scarecrows head toll toll droned the other holding out a horribly twisted hand one moment your royal middleness cried the scarecrow backing as far away from the lantern as he could for with a straw stuffing one cannot be too careful of fire he felt in his pocket for an emerald he had picked up in the emerald city a few days before and handed it gingerly to the muddy monarch why do you call me middleness the king demanded angrily taking the emerald is your kingdom not in the middle of the earth and are you not royalty what could be more proper than royal middleness asked the scarecrow flecking the dust from his hat now that he had a better view he saw that the two were entirely men of mud and very roughly put together dried grass hair stood erect upon each head and their faces were large and lumpy and had a disconcerting way of changing shape indeed when the king leaned over to examine the scarecrow his features were so soft they seemed to run into his cheek which hung down alarmingly while his nose turned sideways and lengthened at least an inch muddle pushed the kings nose back and began spreading his cheek into place instead of hands and feet the middlings had gnarled and twisted roots which curled up in a perfectly terrifying manner their teeth were gold and their eyes shone like small electric lights they wore stiff coats of dried mud buttoned clumsily with lumps of coal and the king had a tall mud crown altogether the scarecrow thought he had never seen more disagreeable looking creatures what he needs spluttered the king fingering the jewel greedily is a coat of mud shall we pull him in muddle hes very poorly made your mudjesty can you work carescrow asked muddle thumping him rudely in the chest scarecrow if you please the scarecrow drew himself up and spoke with great difficulty i can work with my head he added proudly your head roared the king did you hear that muddle he works with his head whats the matter with your hands again the king lunged forward and this time his face fell on the other side and had bulged enormously before muddle could pat it into shape they began whispering excitedly together but the scarecrow made no reply for looking over their shoulder he glimpsed a dark forbidding cavern lighted only by the flashing red eyes of thousands of middlings they appeared to be digging and above the rattle of the shovels and picks came the hoarse voice of one of them singing the middling national air or so the scarecrow gathered from the words oh chop the brown clods as they fall with a thud three croaks for the middlings who stick in the mud oh mud rich and wormy oh mud sweet and squirmy oh what is so lovely as mud oh what is so lovely as mud three croaks for the middlings who delve all the day in their beautiful kingdom of soft mud and clay the croaks that came at the end of the song were so terrifying that the scarecrow shivered in spite of himself ugh hardly a place for a pleasant visit he gasped flattening himself against the wall of the passage feeling that matters had gone far enough he repeated in a loud voice i am the scarecrow of oz and desire to continue my fall i have paid my toll and unless your royal middleness release me might as well drop him a useless creature whispered muddle and before the king had time to object he jerked the board back fall on he screeched maliciously and the scarecrow shot down into the darkness the hoarse screams of the two middlings echoing after him through the gloom no use trying to think the poor scarecrow bumped and banged from side to side of the passage it was all he could do to keep hold of the bean pole so swiftly was he falling a good thing im not made of meat like little dorothy he wheezed breathlessly his gloves were getting worn through from friction with the pole and the rush of air past his ears was so confusing that he gave up all idea of thinking even magic brains refuse to work under such conditions down down down he plunged till he lost all count of time down down down hours and hours would he never stop then suddenly it grew quite light and he flashed through what appeared to be a hole in the roof of a huge silver palace whirled down several stories and landed in a heap on the floor of a great hall in one hand he clutched a small fan and in the other a parasol that had snapped off the beanstalk just before he reached the palace roof shaken and bent over double though he was the scarecrow could see that he had fallen into a company of great magnificence he had a confused glimpse of silken clad courtiers embroidered screens inlaid floors and flashing silver lanterns when there was a thundering bang that hurled him halfway to the roof again falling to a sitting position and still clinging to the bean pole he saw two giant kettle drums nearby still vibrating from the terrible blows they had received the company were staring at him solemnly and as he attempted to rise they fell prostrate on their faces up flew the poor flimsy scarecrow again such was the draught and this time landed on his face he was beginning to feel terribly annoyed but before he could open his mouth or stand up a deep voice boomed he has come he has come shrilled the rest of the company thumping their heads on the stone floor the language seemed strange to the scarecrow but oddly enough he could understand it perfectly keeping a tight grasp on the bean pole he gazed at the prostrate assemblage too astonished to speak they looked exactly like the pictures of some chinamen he had seen in one of dorothys picture books back in oz but instead of being yellow their skin was a curious gray and the hair of old and young alike was silver and worn in long stiff queues before he had time to observe any more an old old courtier hobbled forward and beckoned imperiously to a page at the door the page immediately unfurled a huge silk umbrella and running forward held it over the scarecrows head welcome home sublime and noble ancestor welcome honorable and exalted sir the old gentleman made several deep salaams welcome immortal and illustrious ancestor welcome ancient and serene father cried the others banging their heads hard on the floor so hard that their queues flew into the air ancestor father mumbled the scarecrow in a puzzled voice then collecting himself somewhat he made a deep bow and sweeping off his hat with a truly royal gesture began i am indeed honored but he got no farther the silken clad courtiers sprang to their feet in a frenzy of joy a dozen seized him bodily and carried him to a great silver throne room the same beautiful voice cried the ancient gentleman clasping his hands in an ecstasy of feeling it is he the emperor the emperor has returned long live the emperor shouted everyone at once the confusion grew worse and worse ancestor father emperor the scarecrow could scarcely believe his ears for a fallen man i am rising like yeast he murmured to himself half a dozen courtiers had run outdoors to spread the wonderful news and soon silver gongs and bells began ringing all over the kingdom and cries of the emperor the emperor added to the general excitement holding fast to the sides of the throne and still grasping the little fan and parasol the scarecrow sat blinking with embarrassment if they would just stop emperoring i could ask them who i am thought the poor scarecrow as if in answer to his thoughts the tottery old nobleman raised his long arm and at once the hall became absolutely silent now sighed the scarecrow leaning forward now i shall hear something of interest chapter dorothys lonely breakfast dorothy who occupied one of the coziest apartments in ozmas palace wakened the morning after the party with a feeling of great uneasiness at breakfast the scarecrow was missing although he the tin woodman and scraps did not require food they always livened up the table with their conversation ordinarily dorothy would have thought nothing of the scarecrows absence but she could not forget his distressed expression when professor wogglebug had so rudely remarked on his family tree the professor himself had left before breakfast and everybody but dorothy had forgotten all about the royal book of oz already many of ozmas guests who did not live in the palace were preparing to depart but dorothy could not get over her feeling of uneasiness the scarecrow was her very best friend and it was not like him to go without saying goodbye so she hunted through the gardens and in every room of the palace and questioned all the servants unfortunately jellia jamb who was the only one who had seen the scarecrow go was with her mistress ozma always breakfasted alone and spent the morning over state matters knowing how busy she was dorothy did not like to disturb her betsy bobbin and trot real little girls like dorothy also lived in the fairy palace and ozma was a great chum for them but the kingdom of oz had to be governed in between times and they all knew that unless ozma had the mornings to herself she could not play with them in the afternoons so dorothy searched by herself perhaps i didnt look hard enough thought the little girl and searched the palace all over again dont worry advised the tin woodman who was playing checkers with scraps hes probably gone home he is a man of brains why worry because hes left us in a hurry chuckled scraps with a careless wave of her hand and dorothy laughing in spite of herself ran out to have another look in the garden that is just what he has done and if i hurry i may overtake him anyway i believe ill go and pay him a visit thought dorothy trot and betsy bobbin were swinging in one of the royal hammocks and when dorothy invited them to go along they explained that they were going on a picnic with the tin woodman so without waiting to ask anyone else or even whistling for toto her little dog dorothy skipped out of the garden the cowardly lion half asleep under a rose bush caught a glimpse of her blue dress flashing by and bounding to his feet thudded after her where are you going he asked stifling a giant yawn to visit the scarecrow explained dorothy he looked so unhappy last night i am afraid he is worrying about his family tree and i thought praps i could cheer him up the cowardly lion stretched luxuriously ill go too he rumbled giving himself a shake but its the first time i ever heard of the scarecrow worrying but you see dorothy said gently professor wogglebug told him he had no family family family fiddlesticks hasnt he got us the cowardly lion stopped and waved his tail indignantly why you dear old thing dorothy threw her arms around his neck youve given me a lovely idea the cowardly lion tried not to look pleased well as long as ive given it to you you might tell me what it is he suggested mildly why said dorothy skipping along happily well let him adopt us and be his really relations ill be his sister and youll be his cousin that is if you think he wouldnt mind having a great coward like me for a cousin finished the cowardly lion in an anxious voice do you still feel as cowardly as ever asked dorothy sympathetically more so sighed the great beast glancing apprehensively over his shoulder this made dorothy laugh for although the lion trembled like a cup custard at the approach of danger he always managed to fight with great valor and the little girl felt safer with him than with the whole army of oz who never were frightened but who always ran away now anyone who is at all familiar with his geozify knows that the fairyland of oz is divided into four parts exactly like a parchesi board with the emerald city in the very center the purple gillikin country to the north the red quadling country to the south the blue munchkin country to the east and the yellow country of the winkies to the west it was toward the west that dorothy and the cowardly lion turned their steps for it was in the winkie country that the scarecrow had built his gorgeous golden tower in exactly the shape of a huge ear of corn dorothy ran along beside the cowardly lion chatting over their many adventures in oz and stopping now and then to pick buttercups and daisies that dotted the roadside she tied a big bunch to the tip of her friends tail and twined some more in his mane so that he presented a very festive appearance indeed then when she grew tired she climbed on his big back and swiftly they jogged through the pleasant land of the winkies the people waved to them from windows and fields for everyone loved little dorothy and the big lion and as they passed a neat yellow cottage a little winkie lady came running down the path with a cup of tea in one hand and a bucket in the other i saw you coming and thought you might be thirsty she called hospitably dorothy drank her cup without alighting were in an awful hurry were visiting the scarecrow she exclaimed apologetically the lion drank his bucket of tea at one gulp it was so hot that it made his eyes water how i loathe tea if i hadnt been such a coward id have upset the bucket groaned the lion as the little winkie lady went back into her house but no i was afraid of hurting her feelings ugh what a terrible thing it is to be a coward nonsense said dorothy wiping her eyes with her handkerchief youre not a coward youre just polite but lets run very fast so we can reach the scarecrows in time for lunch so like the wind away raced the cowardly lion dorothy holding fast to his mane with her curls blowing straight out behind and in exactly two oz hours and seventeen winkie minutes they came to the dazzling cornear residence of their old friend hurrying through the cornfields that surrounded his singular mansion dorothy and the cowardly lion rushed through the open door weve come for lunch announced dorothy and im hungry enough to eat crow rumbled the lion then both stopped in dismay for the big reception room was empty from a room above came a shuffling of feet and blink the scarecrows gentlemanly housekeeper came running down the stairs wheres the scarecrow asked dorothy anxiously isnt he here here isnt he there isnt he in the emerald city gasped the little winkie putting his specs on upside down no at least i dont think so oh dear i just felt that something had happened to him wailed dorothy sinking into an ebony armchair and fanning herself with a silk sofa cushion now dont be alarmed the cowardly lion rushed to dorothys side and knocked three vases and a clock off a little table just to show how calm he was think of his brains the scarecrow has never come to harm yet and all we have to do is to return to the emerald city and look in ozmas magic picture then when we know where he is we can go and find him and tell him about our little adoption plan he added looking hopefully at dorothy the scarecrow himself couldnt have spoken more sensibly observed blink with a great sigh of relief and even dorothy felt better in ozmas palace as many of you know there is a magic picture and when ozma or dorothy want to see any of their friends they have merely to wish to see them and instantly the picture shows the person wished for and exactly what he is doing at that certain time of course sighed dorothy why didnt i think of it myself better have some lunch before you start back suggested blink and bustling about had soon set out an appetizing repast dorothy was too busy worrying about the scarecrow to have much appetite but the cowardly lion swallowed seventeen roasts and a bucket of corn syrup to give me courage he explained to dorothy licking his chops theres nothing that makes me so cowardly as an empty stomach it was quite late in the afternoon before they could get away blink insisted on putting up a lunch and it took some time to make enough sandwiches for the cowardly lion but at last it was ready and packed into an old hat box belonging to mops the scarecrows cook then dorothy balancing the box carefully on her lap climbed on the cowardly lions back and assuring blink that they would return in a few days with his master they bade him farewell blink almost spoiled things by bursting into tears but he managed to restrain himself long enough to say goodbye and dorothy and the cowardly lion feeling a little solemn themselves started toward the emerald city my but its growing dark said dorothy after they had gone several miles i believe its going to storm scarcely had she finished speaking before there was a terrific crash of thunder the cowardly lion promptly sat down off of his back bounced the sandwich box and into the sandwich box rolled dorothy head first how terribly upsetting coughed the cowardly lion i should say it was dorothy crawled indignantly out of the hat box and began wiping the butter from her nose youve simply ruined the supper it was my heart explained the cowardly lion sorrowfully it jumped so hard that it upset me but climb on my back again and ill run very fast to some place of shelter but where are you dorothy asked in real alarm for it had grown absolutely dark here quavered the cowardly lion and guided by his voice dorothy stumbled over to him and climbed again on his back one crash of thunder followed another and at each crash the cowardly lion leapt forward a bit faster until they fairly flew through the dark it wont take us long to reach the emerald city at this rate called dorothy but the wind tossed the words far behind her and seeing that conversation was impossible she clung fast to the lions mane and began thinking about the scarecrow the thunder continued at frequent intervals but there was no rain and after they had been running for what seemed to dorothy hours and hours a sudden terrific bump sent her flying over the lions head into a bush too breathless to speak she felt herself carefully all over then finding that she was still in one piece she called to the cowardly lion she could hear him moaning and muttering about his heart any bones broken she asked anxiously only my head groaned the lion dismally just then the darkness lifted as suddenly as it had fallen and dorothy saw him leaning against a tree with his eyes closed there was a big bump on his head with a little cry of sympathy dorothy hurried toward him when all at once something strange about their surroundings struck her why where are we cried the little girl stopping short the lions eyes flew open and forgetting all about his bump he looked around in dismay no sign of the emerald city anywhere indeed they were in a great dim forest and considering the number of trees it is a wonder that they had not run into one long ago i must have run the wrong way faltered the cowardly lion in a distressed voice you couldnt help that anyone would lose his way in the dark said dorothy generously but i wish we hadnt fallen in the sandwiches im hungry so am i do you think anyone lives in this forest dorothy dorothy did not answer for just then she caught sight of a big sign nailed to one of the trees turn to the right directed the sign oh come on cried dorothy cheering up immediately i believe were going to have another adventure id rather have some supper sighed the cowardly lion wistfully but unless we want to spend the night here we might as well move along im to be fed up on adventure i suppose turn to the left advised the next sign and the two turned obediently and hurried on trying to keep a straight course through the trees in a fairyland like oz where there are no trains or trolleys or even horses for traveling cepting ozmas sawhorse there are bound to be unexplored portions and though dorothy had been at one time or another in almost every part of oz the country through which they were now passing was totally unfamiliar to her night was coming on and it was growing so dark that she could hardly read the third sign when they presently came upon it dont sing directed the sign sternly sing snapped dorothy indignantly who wants to sing we might as well keep to the left said the cowardly lion in a resigned voice and they walked along for some time in silence the trees were thinning out and as they came to the edge of the forest another sign confronted them slow down read dorothy with great difficulty what nonsense if we slow down how shall we ever get anywhere wait a minute mused the cowardly lion half closing his eyes arent there two roads just ahead one going up and one going down were to take the down road i suppose slow down isnt that what it says slow down it surely was for the road was so steep and full of stones that dorothy and the cowardly lion had to pick their way with utmost care but even bad roads must end somewhere and coming suddenly to the edge of the woods they saw a great city lying just below a dim light burned over the main gate and toward this the cowardly lion and dorothy hurried as fast as they could this was not very fast for an unaccountable drowsiness was stealing over them slowly and more slowly the tired little girl and her great fourfooted companion advanced toward the dimly lighted gate they were so drowsy that they had ceased to talk but they dragged on hah hoh hum yawned the cowardly lion what makes my feet so heavy he stopped short and examined each of his four feet sleepily dorothy swallowed a yawn and tried to run but a walk was all she could manage hah hoh hum she gaped stumbling along with her eyes closed by the time they had reached the gate they were yawning so hard that the cowardly lion had nearly dislocated his jaw and dorothy was perfectly breathless holding to the lions mane to steady herself dorothy blinked up uncertainly at the sign over the gate hah here we are hoh she held her hand wearily before her mouth then with a great effort she read the words of the sign um great grand and mighty slow kingdom of pokes uhhah pokes do you hear hah hoh hu uum dorothy looked about in alarm despite her sleepiness do you hear she repeated anxiously as no answer came through the gloom the cowardly lion did not hear he had fallen down and was fast asleep and so in another minute was dorothy her head pillowed against his kind comfortable cowardly heart fast asleep at the gates of a strange gray city chapter sir hokus of pokes it was long past sunup before dorothy awoke she rubbed her eyes yawned once or twice and then shook the cowardly lion the gates of the city were open and although it looked even grayer in the daytime than it looked at night the travelers were too hungry to be particular a large placard was posted just inside this is pokes dont run dont sing talk slowly dont whistle order of the chief poker read dorothy how cheerful hah hoh hummm dont begged the cowardly lion with tears in his eyes if i yawn again ill swallow my tail and if i dont have something to eat soon ill do it anyway lets hurry theres something queer about this place dorothy ah hah hoh hummm stifling their yawns the two started down the long narrow street the houses were of gray stone tall and stiff with tiny barred windows it was absolutely quiet and not a person was in sight but when they turned the corner they saw a crowd of queerlooking people creeping toward them these singular individuals stopped between each step and stood perfectly still and dorothy was so surprised at their unusual appearance that she laughed right in the middle of a yawn in the first place they never lifted their feet but pushed them along like skates the women were dressed in gray polkadot dresses with huge poke bonnets that almost hid their fat sleepy widemouthed faces most of them had pet snails on strings and so slowly did they move that it looked as though the snails were tugging them along the men were dressed like a party of congressmen but instead of high hats wore large red nightcaps and they were all as solemn as owls it seemed impossible for them to keep both eyes open at the same time and at first dorothy thought they were winking at her but as the whole company continued to stare fixedly with one open eye she burst out laughing at the unexpected sound for no one had ever laughed in pokes before the women picked up their snails in a great fright and the men clapped their fingers to their ears or to the places where their ears were under the red nightcaps these must be the slow pokes giggled dorothy nudging the cowardly lion lets go to meet them for theyll never reach us at the rate they are coming theres something wrong with my feet rumbled the cowardly lion without looking up hah hoh hum whats the use of hurrying the fact of the matter was that they couldnt hurry if they tried indeed they could hardly lift their feet at all i wish the scarecrow were with us sighed the cowardly lion shuffling along unhappily he never grows sleepy and he always knows what to do no use wishing yawned dorothy i only hope hes not as lost as we are by struggling hard they just managed to keep moving and by the time they came up with the slow pokes they were completely worn out a crosslooking poke held up his arm threateningly and dorothy and the cowardly lion stopped you said the poke then closed his mouth and stood staring vacantly for a whole minute are he brought out the word with a perfectly enormous yawn and dorothy began fanning the cowardly lion with her hat for he showed signs of falling asleep again what she asked crossly under sighed the poke after a long pause and dorothy seeing that there was no hurrying him began counting to herself just as she reached sixty the poke pushed back his red nightcap and shouted arrest arrest shouted all the other pokes so loud that the cowardly lion roused himself with a start and the pet snails stuck out their heads a rest a rest is not what we want we want breakfast growled the lion irritably and started to roar but a yawn spoiled it one simply cannot look fierce by yawning you began the poke but dorothy could not stand hearing the same slow speech again putting her fingers in her ears she shouted back what for the pokes regarded her sternly some even opened both eyes then the one who had first addressed them covering a terrific gape with one hand pointed with the other to a sign on a large post at the corner of the street speed limit mile an hour said the sign were arrested for speeding shouted dorothy in the cowardly lions ear did you say feeding asked the poor lion waking up with a start if i go to sleep again before im fed ill starve to death then keep awake yawned dorothy by this time the pokes had surrounded them and were waving them imperiously ahead they looked so threatening that dorothy and the cowardly lion began to creep in the direction of a gloomy gray castle of the journey neither of them remembered a thing for with the gaping and yawning pokes it was almost impossible to keep awake but they must have walked in their sleep for the next thing dorothy knew a harsh voice called slowly poke him greatly alarmed dorothy opened her eyes they were in a huge stone hall hung all over with rusty armor and seated on a great stone chair snoring so loudly that all the steel helmets rattled was a knight the tallest and crossest of the pokes rushed at him with a long poker giving him such a shove that he sprawled to the floor so yawned the cowardly lion awakened by the clatter knight has fallen prisoners sir hokus shouted the chief poker lifting the knights plume and speaking into the helmet as if he were telephoning the knight arose with great dignity and after straightening his armor let down his visor and dorothy saw a kind timid face with melancholy blue eyes not at all pokish as she explained to ozma later what means this unwonted clamor asked sir hokus peering curiously at the prisoners were sorry to waken you said dorothy politely but could you please give us some breakfast a lot added the cowardly lion licking his chops its safer for me to sing said the knight mournfully and throwing back his head he roared in a high hoarse voice dont yawn dont yawn were out of breath begone begone or die the death the cowardly lion growled threateningly and began lashing his tail if he werent in a can id eat him he rumbled but i never could abide tinned meat hes not in a can hes in armor explained dorothy too interested to pay much attention to the cowardly lion for at the first note of the knights song the pokes began scowling horribly and by the time he had finished they were backing out of the room faster than dorothy ever imagined they could go so thats why the sign said dont sing thought dorothy to herself the air seemed clearer somehow and she no longer felt sleepy when the last poke had disappeared the knight sighed and climbed gravely back on his stone chair my singing makes them very wroth in faith they cannot endure music it wakens them explained sir hokus but hold twas food you asked of me breakfast i believe you called it with an uneasy glance at the cowardly lion who was sniffing the air hungrily the knight banged on his steel armor with his sword and a fat lazy poke shuffled slowly into the hall pid bring the stew roared sir hokus as the poke stood blinking at them dully stew pid he repeated loudly and began to hum under his breath at which pid fairly ran out of the room returning in a few minutes with a large yellow bowl this he handed ungraciously to dorothy then he brought a great copper tub of the stuff for the cowardly lion and retired sulkily dorothy thought she had never tasted anything more delicious the cowardly lion was gulping down his share with closed eyes and both i am very sorry to say forgot even to thank sir hokus are you perchance a damsel in distress quite startled dorothy looked up from her bowl and saw the knight regarding her wistfully shes in pokes and thats the same thing said the cowardly lion without opening his eyes were lost began the little girl but there was something so quaint and gentle about the knight that she soon found herself talking to him like an old friend she told him all of their adventures since leaving the emerald city and even told about the disappearance of the scarecrow passing strange yet how refreshing murmured sir hokus and if i seem a little behind times you must not blame me for centuries i have dozed in this gray castle and it cometh over me that things have greatly changed this beast now he talks quite manfully and this kingdom that you mention this oz never heard of it never heard of oz gasped the little girl why youre a subject of oz and pokes is in oz though i dont know just where here dorothy gave him a short history of the fairy country and of the many adventures she had had since she had come there sir hokus listened with growing melancholy to think he sighed mournfully that i was prisoner here while all that was happening are you a prisoner asked dorothy in surprise i thought you were king of the pokes uds daggers thundered sir hokus so suddenly that dorothy jumped i am a knight seeing her startled expression he controlled himself i was a knight he continued brokenly long centuries ago mounted on my goodly steed i fared from my fathers castle to offer my sword to a mighty king his name sir hokus tapped his forehead uncertainly go to i have forgot could it have been king arthur exclaimed dorothy wideeyed with interest why just think of your being still alive thats just the point choked the knight ive been alive still so still that ive forgotten everything why i cant even remember how i used to talk he confessed miserably but how did you get here rumbled the cowardly lion who did not like being left out of the conversation i had barely left my fathers castle before i met a stranger said sir hokus sitting up very straight who challenged me to battle i spurred my horse forward our lances met and the stranger was unseated but by my faith twas no mortal knight sir hokus sighed deeply and lapsed into silence what happened asked dorothy curiously for sir hokus seemed to have forgotten them the knight said he with another mighty sigh struck the ground with his lance and cried live wretch for centuries in the stupidest country out of the world and disappeared and here here i am with a despairing gesture sir hokus arose big tears splashing down his armor i feel that i am brave very brave but how am i to know until i have encountered danger ah friends behold in me a knight who has never had a real adventure never killed a dragon nor championed a lady nor gone on a quest dropping on his knees before the little girl sir hokus took her hand let me go with you on this quest for the valiant scarecrow let me be your good night he begged eagerly good night coughed the cowardly lion who to tell the truth was feeling a bit jealous but dorothy was thrilled and as sir hokus continued to look at her pleadingly she took off her hair ribbon and bound it round his arm you shall be my own true knight and i your lady fair she announced solemnly and exactly as she had read in books at this interesting juncture the cowardly lion gave a tremendous yawn and sir hokus with an exclamation of alarm jumped to his feet the pokes had returned to the hall and dorothy felt herself falling asleep again up up my lieges and away we take the field again for ladies fair we fight today and king up up my merry men shrilled the knight as if he were leading an army to battle the pokes opened both eyes but did not immediately retire sir hokus bravely swallowed a yawn and hastily clearing his throat shouted another song which he evidently made up on the spur of the moment avaunt be off be gone methinks well be asleep in forty winks this time the pokes left sullenly but the effect of their presence had thrown dorothy the cowardly lion and the knight into a violent fit of the gapes if i fall asleep nothing can save you said sir hokus in an agitated voice hah hoh hum hah the knights eyes closed dont do it dont do it begged dorothy shaking him violently cant we run away ive been trying for five centuries wailed the knight in a discouraged voice but i always fall asleep before i reach the gate and they bring me back here theyre rather fond of me in their slow way he added apologetically couldnt you keep singing asked the cowardly lion anxiously for the prospect of a fivecentury stay in pokes was more than he could bear couldnt we all sing suggested dorothy surely all three of us wont fall asleep at once im not much of a singer groaned the cowardly lion beginning to tremble but im willing to do my share i like you said sir hokus going over and thumping the cowardly lion approvingly on the back you ought to be knighted the lion blinked his eyes for sir hokus iron fist bruised him severely but knowing it was kindly meant he bore it bravely i am henceforth a beknighted lion he whispered to dorothy while sir hokus was straightening his armor next the knight took down an iron poker which he handed to dorothy to wake us up with he explained and now lady dorothy if you are ready we will start on the quest for the honorable scarecrow and remember everybody sing sing for your life chapter singing their way out of pokes taking a deep breath sir hokus the cowardly lion and dorothy burst out of the hall singing at the top of their voices three blind mice sang dorothy across the plain shouted sir hokus i am the cowardly lion of oz roared the lion the pokes were so taken aback at the horrid sounds that they ran scurrying right and left in another minute the three were out of the castle and singing their way through the gloomy garden dorothy stuck to the three blind mice sir hokus sang verse after verse of an old english ballad and the cowardly lion roared and gurgled a song of his own making which considering it was a first attempt was not so bad i am the cowardly lion of oz be good begone beware becoz when i am scared full fierce i be br rah grr ruff look out for me the pokes stumbled this way and that and all went well until they rushed into a company of pokes who were playing croquet the slowness with which they raised their mallets fascinated dorothy and she stopped to watch them in spite of herself dont stop sing growled the cowardly lion in the middle of a line to make up for lost time dorothy closed her eyes and sang harder than ever but alas next instant she fell over a wicket which so deprived her of breath that she could barely scramble up let alone sing as soon as she stopped singing the pokes paused in their flight and as soon as they paused dorothy began to gape singing for dear life sir hokus jerked dorothy by the arm and the cowardly lion roared so loud that the pokes covered their ears and began backing away there was a knight come on come on sang sir hokus and dorothy came and in a few minutes was able to take up the three blind mice again but running and singing at the same time is not an easy task and running through pokes is like trying to run through water you know how hard that is three blind mice uh hah three blind mice uhhah i cant sing another note thu ree gasped poor dorothy stumbling along while the cowardly lion was puffing like an engine the pokes in the garden had recovered from their first alarm and were following at a safe distance the gates of the city were only a short distance off but it seemed to dorothy that she could not go another step a large group of pokes had gathered at the gates and unless they could sing their way through they would fall asleep and be carried ignominiously back to the castle now wheezed sir hokus remember it is for the scarecrow all of them swallowed took a deep breath and put their last remaining strength into their voices but a wily poke who had stuffed some cotton in his ears now approached pushing a little cart take he drawled and before dorothy realized what she was doing she had accepted a cone from the poke hah hoh hum why its hokey pokey spluttered dorothy and with a deep sigh of delight she took a large bite of the pink ice cream how cool it felt on her dry throat she opened her mouth for a second taste yawned terrifically and fell with a thud to the stone pavement dorothy wailed sir hokus stopping short in his song and bending over the little girl the poor cowardly lion gave a gulp of despair and began running around the two roaring and singing in a choked voice the pokes nodded to each other in a pleased fashion and the chief poker started cautiously toward them with a long thick rope the cowardly lion redoubled his efforts then seeing sir hokus about to fall he jumped on the knight with all his strength down crashed sir hokus his armor clanging against the stones that paved the gateway sing roared the cowardly lion glaring at him fiercely the fall wakened the poor knight but he had not the strength to rise sitting on the hard stones and looking reproachfully at the cowardly lion he began his ballad in a halfhearted fashion the cowardly lions heart was like to burst between lack of breath and fear but making one last tremendous effort and still roaring his song he bounded at the chief poker seized the rope and was back before the stupid creature had time to yawn tie it around your waist take dorothy in your arms gasped the cowardly lion out of the corner of his mouth sir hokus though completely dazed had just enough presence of mind to obey and the next minute the cowardly lion growling between his teeth like a good fellow was dashing through the group of pokes the other end of the rope in his mouth bumpety bump bump bump bangetybangbang went sir hokus over the cobbles holding his helmet with one hand and dorothy fast in the other arm the pokes fell this way and that and such was the determination of the cowardly lion that he never stopped till he was out of the gate and halfway up the rough road they had so recently traveled then with a mighty sigh he dropped the rope rolled over and over down the hill and lay panting with exhaustion at the bottom the bumping over the cobbles had wakened sir hokus thoroughly indeed the poor knight was black and blue and his armor dented and scraped frightfully in important places dorothy considerably shaken opened her eyes and began feebly singing three blind mice no need puffed sir hokus lifting her off his lap and rising stiffly yon noble beast has rescued us wont the pokes come up here asked dorothy staring around a bit dizzily they cannot live out of the kingdom said the knight and dorothy drew a big sigh of relief sir hokus however was looking very grave i have failed on my first adventure had it not been for the cowardly lion we would now be prisoners in pokes he murmured sadly then he unfastened the plume from his helmet it beseemeth me not to wear it sighed the knight mournfully and though dorothy tried her best to comfort him he refused to put it back finally she fastened the plume to her dress and they went down to the cowardly lion there was a little spring nearby and after they had poured six helmets of water over his head the lion opened his eyes been in a good many fights gasped the lion but i never fought one like this singing bah noble sir how can i ever repay you faltered the knight alas that i have failed in the hour of trial why it wasnt a question of courage at all rumbled the cowardly lion greatly embarrassed i had the loudest voice and the most breath thats all you got the rough end of it sir hokus looked ruefully at his armor the back was entirely squashed never mind said the knight bravely it is the front one presents to the foe now youre talking like a real knight said dorothy a while ago you said yon and beseemeth and first thing you know the talk will all come back to you sir hokus honest face shone with pleasure odds bludgeons and truncheons the little maid is right he exclaimed striking an attitude and once it does the rest will be easy dont say rest to me begged the cowardly lion getting slowly to his feet hah hoh hum just to think of it makes me yawn now dont you think we had better start off if youre rested began dorothy the cowardly lion put his paw over his ear and looked so comical that both dorothy and sir hokus laughed heartily if youre ready amended dorothy and the three adventurers started up the steep road the first thing to do said the little girl is to get back to the emerald city as quickly as we can at this very minute glinda the good sorceress of oz in her palace in the quadling country was puzzling over an entry in the magic record book this book tells everything that is happening in the world and out and while it does not give details it is a very useful possession the emperor of the silver islands read glinda has returned to his people now who is the emperor of the silver islands she asked herself she puzzled about it for a long while and then deciding that it had nothing to do with the fairy kingdom of oz she closed the book and went for a walk in the palace garden dorothy and sir hokus and the cowardly lion had meanwhile reached the first sign in the dim forest the sign directing travelers to pokes two roads branched out through the forest and after much debating they took the wider do you spose this leads to the emerald city asked cowardly lion dubiously time will tell time will tell said sir hokus cheerfully yes murmured the cowardly lion time will tell but what chapter the scarecrow is hailed as emperor leaning forward on the great throne the scarecrow waited impatiently for the ancient gentleman to speak the grayskinned courtiers were eyeing him expectantly and just as the suspense became almost unendurable the old man threw up his arms and cried sharply the prophecy of the magic beanstalk has been fulfilled in this radiant and sublime scarecrowcus the spirit of chang wang woe the mighty has returned and i the grand chew chew of the realm prostrate myself before this wonderful scarecrowcus emperor of the silver islands so likewise did all the company present and the scarecrow taken unawares flew up several feet and landed in a heap on the steps leading to the throne he climbed back hurriedly picking up the fan and parasol that he had plucked from the beanstalk i wish professor wogglebug could hear this said the scarecrow settling himself complacently but i must watch out and remember to hold on the grand chew chew was the first to rise and folding his arms he asked solemnly what are your commands ancient and honorable scarecrowcus if youd just omit the cus begged the scarecrow in an embarrassed voice i believe i could think better am i in china or where are you chinamen or what we are silvermen said the grand chew chew impressively and a much older race than our chinese cousins they are people of the sun we are people of the stars has your highness so soon forgotten i am afraid said the scarecrow rubbing his chin reflectively that i have he gazed slowly around the great throne room ozmas palace itself was not more dazzling the floor of dull silver blocks was covered with rich blue rugs furniture chairs screens and everything were made of silver inlaid with precious stones filigreed silver lanterns hung from the high ceilings and tall silver vases filled with pink and blue blossoms filled the rooms with their perfume blue flags embroidered with silver stars fluttered from the walls and the tips of the pikebearers spears and silver seemed to be so plentiful that even shoes were fashioned of it faintly through the windows came the sweet tones of a hundred silver chimes and altogether the scarecrow was quite dazed by his apparent good fortune surely they had called him emperor but how could that be he turned to address the grand chew chew then as he saw out of the corner of his eye that the assemblage were making ready to fall upon their faces he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper may i speak to you alone the grand chew chew waved his hand imperiously and the courtiers with a great crackling of silver brocade backed from the hall very kind of them to bow but i wish they wouldnt sighed the scarecrow sinking back on the great throne it blows one about so i declare if another person falls at my feet ill have nervous prostration again he took a long survey of the hall then turned to the grand chew chew would you mind he asked simply telling me again who i am and how who and how who you are illustrious sir the emperor chang wang woe or to be more exact his spirit i have always been a spirited person observed the scarecrow dubiously but never a spirit without a person i must insist on being a person how the grand chew chew proceeded without noticing the scarecrows remarks fifty years ago after your extreme highness had defeated in battle the king of the golden islands a magician entered the realm this magician in the employ of this wicked king entered a room in the palace where your highness lay sleeping and by an act of necromancy changed you to a crocus ouch exclaimed the scarecrow shuddering involuntarily and had it not been for the empress your faithful wife you would have been lost forever to the empire wife gasped the scarecrow faintly have i a wife if your highness will permit me to finish begged the grand chew chew with great dignity the scarecrow nodded your wife tsing tsing the beautiful took the crocus which was fading rapidly and planted it in a silver bowl in the center of this very hall and for three days kept it fresh with her tears waking on the third morning the empress was amazed to see in place of the crocus a giant bean pole that extended to the roof of the palace and disappeared among the clouds ah murmured the scarecrow looking up my family tree beside the bean pole lay a crumpled parchment the grand chew chew felt in the sleeve of his kimono and brought out a bit of crumpled silver paper and adjusting his horn spectacles read slowly into the first being who touches this magic pole on the other side of the world the spirit of emperor chang wang woe will enter and fifty years from this day he will return to save his people the grand chew chew took off his specs and folded up the paper the day has come you have come down the bean pole and are undoubtedly that being who has gone from emperor to crocus to scarecrowcus i have ruled the islands these fifty years have seen to the education of your sons and grandsons and now gracious and exalted master as i am an old man i ask you to relieve me from the cares of state sons grandsons choked the scarecrow beginning to feel very much alarmed indeed how old am i your highness said the grand chew chew with a deep salaam is as old as i in other words you are in the ripe and glorious eightyfifth year of your majestys illustrious and useful age eighty five gasped the scarecrow staring in dismay at the gray wrinkled face of the old silverman now see here chew chew are you sure of that quite sure immortal and honored master the scarecrow could not help but be convinced of the truth of the grand chew chews story the pole in the munchkin farmers cornfield was none other than the magic beanstalk and he thrust on the pole by the farmer to scare away the crows had received the spirit of the emperor chang wang woe which accounts for my cleverness he thought gloomily now surely he should have been pleased for he had come in search of a family but the acquisition of an empire sons and grandsons and old age all in a trice fairly took his breath away does the prophecy say anything about restoring my imperial person he asked anxiously for the thought of looking like chew chew was not a cheerful one alas no sighed the grand chew chew sorrowfully but we have very clever wizards on the island and i shall set them at work on the problem at once now dont be in such a rush begged the scarecrow secretly determined to lock up the wizards at the first opportunity im rather fond of this shape you see it requires no food and never grows tired or old the royal robes will in a measure conceal it murmured the grand chew chew politely and clapped his hands a little servitor bounced into the hall a royal robe quick silver for his radiant highness snapped the grand chew chew in a moment quick silver had returned with a magnificent purple satin robe embroidered in silver threads and heavy with jewels and a hat of silver cloth with upturned brim the scarecrow wrapped himself in the purple robe took off his old munchkin hat and substituted the imperial headpiece how do i look chew he asked anxiously quite like your old imperial self except the old prime minister ran unsteadily out of the room there was a muffled scream from the hall and the next instant he returned with a long shiny silver queue which he had evidently clipped from the head of one of the servants removing the scarecrows hat he pinned the queue to the back set it on the scarecrows head and stood regarding him with great satisfaction ah if the empress could only see you he murmured rapturously where where is she asked the scarecrow looking around nervously his long carefree life in oz had somewhat unfitted him he reflected for family life alas sighed the grand chew chew wiping his eyes on the sleeve of his kimono she has returned to her silver ancestors then show me her picture commanded the scarecrow visibly affected the grand chew chew stepped to a side wall and pulling on a silken cord disclosed the picture of a large gray lady with curiously small eyes and a curiously large nose is she not beautiful asked the grand chew chew bowing his head beautiful er er beautiful gulped the scarecrow he thought of lovely little ozma and dear little dorothy and all at once felt terribly upset and homesick he had no recollection of the silver island or his life here whatever who was he anyway the scarecrow of oz or emperor chang wang woe he couldnt be both ah whispered the grand chew chew seeing his agitation you remember her the scarecrow shook his head with an inward shudder now show me myself chew he asked curiously pulling the cord of a portrait beside the empress chew chew revealed the picture of chang wang woe as he had been fifty years ago his face was bland and jolly and to be perfectly truthful quite like the scarecrows in shape and expression i am beside myself murmured the scarecrow dazedly which in truth he was you were er are a very royal and handsome person stammered the grand chew chew the scarecrow stepping off the throne to examine himself more closely dropped the little fan and parasol he had really not had time to examine them since they snapped off the beanstalk and now looking at them carefully he found them extremely pretty dorothy will like these thought the scarecrow slipping them into a large inside pocket of his robe already in the back of his head was a queer notion that he would at some time or other return to oz he started to give the grand chew chew a spirited description of that wonderful country but the ancient gentleman yawned and waving his hands toward the door interrupted him with would not your supreme highness care to inspect your present dominions i suppose i may as well with a deep sigh the scarecrow took the grand chew chews arm and holding up his royal kimono which was rather long with the other hand walked unsteadily down the great salon they were about to pass into the garden when a little fat silverman slid around the door a huge silver drumstick upraised in his right hand and a great drum hung about his neck the drummer beamed on the scarecrow chang wang woe the beautiful the beautiful has come sublime and silver scarecrow let sound the royal drum chanted the little man in a high thin voice and started to bring the drumstick down upon the huge head of his noisy instrument no you dont cried the scarecrow leaping forward and catching his arm i positively forbid it then i shall have no work screamed the drummer falling on his face ah gracious master dont you remember me yes said the scarecrow kindly who are you oh dont you remember little happy toko wheezed the little man the tears rolling down his cheeks i was only a boy but you used to be fond of me why of course my dear tappy said the scarecrow not liking to hurt the little fellows feelings but why do you beat the drum it is customary to sound the drum at the approach of your royal highness put in the grand chew chew importantly was customary said the scarecrow firmly my dear tappy oko never sound it in my presence again it is too upsetting which was true enough for one blow of the drum sent the flimsy scarecrow flying into the air youre dismissed happy snapped the grand chew chew at this the little silver islander began weeping and roaring with distress stop what else can you do besides beat a drum asked the scarecrow kindly i can sing stand on my head and tell jokes sniffed happy toko shuffling from one foot to the other very good said the scarecrow you are henceforth imperial punster to my person come along were going to look over the island the grand chew chew frowned so terribly that happy tokos knees shook with terror it is not fitting for a slave to accompany the grand chew chew and the emperor he hissed angrily the scarecrow looked surprised for the kingdom of oz is quite democratic and no one is considered better than another but seeing this was not the time to argue he winked broadly behind the grand chew chews back ill see you again tappy my boy he called genially and passed out into the garden where a magnificent silver palanquin surrounded by pikemen and shieldbearers awaited him chapter the scarecrow studies the silver island two days had passed since the scarecrow had fallen into his kingdom he was not finding his royal duties as pleasant as he had anticipated the country was beautiful enough but being emperor of the silver islands was not the simple affair that ruling oz had been the pigtail on the back of his hat was terribly distracting and he was always tripping over his kimono to which he could not seem to accustom himself his subjects were extremely quarrelsome always pulling one anothers queues or stealing fruit umbrellas and silver polish his ministers the grand chew chew the chief chow chow and general mugwump were no better and keeping peace in the palace took all the scarecrows cleverness in the daytime he tried culprits in the royal court interviewed his seventeen secretaries rode out in the royal palanquin and made speeches to visiting princes at night he sat in the great silver salon and by the light of the lanterns studied the book of ceremonies his etiquette the grand chew chew informed him was shocking he was always doing something wrong dodging the imperial umbrella speaking kindly to a palace servant or walking unattended in the gardens the royal palace itself was richly furnished and the scarecrow had more than five hundred robes of state the gardens with their sparkling waterfalls glowing orange trees silver temples towers and bridges were too lovely for words poppies roses lotus and other lilies perfumed the air and at night a thousand silver lanterns turned them to a veritable fairyland the grass and trees were green as in other lands but the sky as always full of tiny silver clouds the waters surrounding the island were of a lovely liquid silver and as all the houses and towers were of this gleaming metal the effect was bewildering and beautiful but the silver islanders themselves were too stupid to appreciate this beauty and what use is it all when i have no one to enjoy it with me sighed the scarecrow and no time to play in oz no one thought it queer if ozma the little queen jumped rope with dorothy or betsy bobbin or had a quiet game of croquet with the palace cook but here alas everything was different if the scarecrow so much as ventured a game of ball with the gardeners boy the whole court was thrown into an uproar at first the scarecrow tried to please everybody but finding that nothing pleased the people in the palace he decided to please himself i dont care a kinkajou if i am the emperor im going to talk to whom i please he exclaimed on the second night and shaking his glove at a bronze statue he threw the book of ceremonies into the fountain the next morning therefore he ascended the throne with great firmness immediately the courtiers prostrated themselves and the scarecrows arms and legs blew about wildly stand up at once puffed the scarecrow when he had regained his balance you are giving me nervous prostration chew kindly issue an edict forbidding prostrations anyone caught bowing in my presence again shall lose the courtiers looked alarmed his pigtail finished the scarecrow and now chew you will take my place please i am going for a walk with tappy oko the grand chew chews mouth fell open with surprise but seeing the scarecrows determined expression he dared not disobey and he immediately began making strange marks on a long red parchment happy toko trembled as the scarecrow emperor took his arm and the courtiers stared at one another in dismay as the two walked quietly out into the garden nothing happened however and tappy regaining his composure took out a little silver flute and started a lively tune i had to take matters into my own hands tappy said the scarecrow listening to the music with a pleased expression are there any words to that song yes illustrious and supreme sir two spoons went down a porcelane to meet a china saucer a talking china in a way to break a white mans jaw sir sang happy and finished by standing gravely on his head your majesty used to be very fond of this song spluttered happy it is difficult to speak while upside down and if you dont think so try it ah said the scarecrow beginning to feel more cheerful tell me something about myself and my family tappy oko happy toko if it pleases your supreme amiability corrected the little silver man somersaulting to a standstill beside the scarecrow it does and it doesnt murmured the scarecrow there is something about you that reminds me of a pudding and you tapped the drum didnt you i believe i shall call you tappy oko if you dont mind the scarecrow seated himself on a silver bench and motioned for the imperial punster to sit down beside him tappy oko sat down fearfully first making sure that he was not observed saving your imperial presence this is not permitted said tappy uneasily never mind about my imperial presence chuckled the scarecrow tell me about my imperial past ah said tappy oko rolling up his eyes you were one of the most magnificent and magnanimous of monarchs was i asked the scarecrow in a pleased voice you distributed rice among the poor and advice among the rich and fought many glorious battles continued the little man i composed a little song about you perhaps you would like to hear it the scarecrow nodded and tappy throwing back his head chanted with a will chang wang woe did draw the bow and twist the queues of a thousand foe in oz murmured the scarecrow reflectively as tappy finished i twisted the necks of a flock of wild crows that was before i had my excellent brains too oh im a fighting man theres no doubt about it but tell me tappy where did i meet my wife in the water chuckled tappy oko screwing up his eyes never the scarecrow looked out over the harbor and then down at his lumpy figure your majesty forgets you were then a man like me er not stuffed with straw i mean exclaimed happy looking embarrassed she was fishing continued the little punster when a huge silver fish became entangled in her line she stood up the fish gave a mighty leap and pulled her out of the boat your majesty having seen the whole affair from the bank plunged bravely into the water and swimming out rescued her freed the fish and in due time made her your bride ive made a song about that also lets hear it said the scarecrow and this is what happy sung tsing tsing a silver fishers daughter was fishing in the silver water the moon shone on her silver hair and there were fishes everywhere then came a mighty silver fish it seized her line and with a swish of silver fins upset her boat tsing tsing could neither swim nor float she raised her silver voice in fear and who her call of help should hear but chang wang woe the emperor who saved and married her whats more did i really asked the scarecrow feeling quite flattered by happys song yes said happy positively and invited me to the wedding though i was only a small boy was chew chew there the scarecrow couldnt help wondering how the old nobleman had taken his marriage with a poor fishermans daughter happy chuckled at the memory he had a princess all picked out for you he confided merrily and there he stood in awful pride and scorned the father of the bride hoh roared the scarecrow falling off the bench thats the ozziest thing ive heard since i landed in the silver islands tappy my boy i believe we are going to be friends but lets forget the past and think of the present the scarecrow embraced his imperial punster on the spot lets find something jolly to do he suggested would your extreme highness care for kites asked happy tis a favorite sport here would i but wait i will disguise myself hiding his royal hat under the bench he put on happy tokos broadrimmed peasant hat it turned down all round and almost hid his face then he turned his robe inside out and declared himself ready they passed through a small silver town before they reached the field where the kites were to be flown and the scarecrow was delighted with its picturesque and quaint appearance the streets were narrow and full of queer shops silver lanterns and little pennants hung from each door the merchants and maidens in their gay sedans and the people afoot made a bright and lively picture if i could just live here instead of in the palace mused the scarecrow pausing before a modest rice shop it is dangerous to stop in the narrow streets and happy jerked his master aside just in time to prevent his being trodden on by a huge camel it sniffed at the scarecrow suspiciously and they were forced to flatten themselves against a wall to let it pass happy anxiously hurried the emperor through the town and they soon arrived at the kite flying field a great throng had gathered to watch the exhibition and there were more kites than one would see in a lifetime here huge fish silver paper dragons birds every sort and shape of kite was tugging at its string and hundreds of silver islanders boys girls and grownups were looking on how interesting said the scarecrow fascinated by a huge dragon that floated just over his head i wish dorothy could see this i do indeed but the dragon kite seemed almost alive and horrors just as it swooped down a hook in the tail caught in the scarecrows collar and before happy toko could even wink the emperor of the silver islands was sailing towards the clouds the scarecrow as you must know weighs almost nothing and the people shouted with glee for they thought him a dummy man and part of the performance but happy toko ran after the kite as fast as his fat little legs would carry him alas alas i shall lose my position wailed happy toko quite convinced that the scarecrow would be dashed to pieces on the rocks oh putty head that i am to set myself against the grand chew chew the scarecrow however after recovering from the first shock began to enjoy himself holding fast to the dragons tail he looked down with great interest upon his dominions rocks mountains tall silver pagodas drooping willow trees flashed beneath him truly a beautiful island his gaze strayed over the silver waters surrounding the island and he was astonished to see a great fleet sailing into the harbor a great fleet of singular vessels with silken sails whats this thought the scarecrow but just then the dragon kite became suddenly possessed it jerked him up it jerked him down and shook him this way and that his hat flew off his arms and legs whirled wildly and pieces of straw began to float downward then the hook ripped and tore through his coat and making a terrible slit in his back came out down down down flashed the scarecrow and landed in a heap on the rocks poor happy toko rushed toward him with streaming eyes oh radiant and immortal scarecrowcus what have they done to you he moaned dropping on his knees beside the flimsy shape of the emperor merely knocked out my honorable stuffing mumbled the scarecrow now tappy my dear fellow will you just turn me over theres a rock in my eye that keeps me from thinking happy toko at the sound of a voice from the rumpled heap of clothing gave a great leap is there any straw about asked the scarecrow anxiously why dont you turn me over its his ghost moaned happy toko and because he dared not disobey a royal ghost he turned the scarecrow over with trembling hands dont be alarmed said the scarecrow smiling reassuringly im not breakable like you meat people a little straw will make me good as new a little straw straw do you hear for happys pigtail was still on end and he was shaking so that his silver shoes clattered on the rocks i command you to fetch straw cried the scarecrow at last in an angry voice happy dashed away when he returned with an arm full of straw the scarecrow managed to convince him that he was quite alive it is impossible to kill a person from oz he explained proudly and that is why my present figure is so much more satisfactory than yours i do not have to eat or sleep and can always be repaired have you some safety pins happy produced several and under the scarecrows direction stuffed out his chest and pinned up his rents let us return said the scarecrow ive had enough pleasure for one day and cant you sing something tappy running and fright had somewhat affected happys voice but he squeaked out a funny little song and the two keeping time to the tune came without further mishap to the imperial gardens happy had just set the royal hat upon the scarecrows head and brushed off his robes when a company of courtiers dashed out of the palace door and came running toward them great cornstarch exclaimed the scarecrow sitting heavily down on the silver bench whats the matter now here are all the pigheads on the island and look how old chew chew is puffing one would expect a chew chew to puff observed happy slyly one would but he got no further for the whole company was upon them save us save us wailed the courtiers forgetting the royal edict and falling on their faces what from asked the scarecrow holding fast to the silver bench the king the king of the golden islands shrieked the grand chew chew ah yes murmured the scarecrow frowning thoughtfully was that his fleet coming into the harbor the grand chew chew jumped up in astonishment how could your highness see the fleet from here he stuttered not from here there said the scarecrow pointing upward and winking at happy toko my highness goes very high you see your majesty does not seem to realize the seriousness of the matter choked the grand chew chew he will set fire to the island and make us all slaves at this the courtiers began banging their heads distractedly on the grass set fire to the island exclaimed the scarecrow jumping to his feet then peace to my ashes tappy will you see that they are sent back to oz save us save us screamed the frightened silvermen the prophecy of the beanstalk has promised that you would save us you are the emperor chang wang woe persisted the grand chew chew waving his long arms woe is me murmured the scarecrow clasping his yellow gloves but let me think chapter save us with your magic exalted one for several minutes the scarecrow sat perfectly still while the company stood shaking in their shoes then he asked loudly where is the imperial army it has retired to the caves at the end of the island quavered the grand chew chew i thought as much said the scarecrow but never mind there are quite a lot of us us spluttered a tall silverman indignantly we are not common soldiers no very uncommon ones but you have hard heads and long nails and i dare say will manage somehow come on lets go chew you may take the lead go shrieked the grand chew chew us the courtiers began backing away in alarm where er what are your highness plans why just to conquer the king of the golden islands and send him back home said the scarecrow smiling engagingly thats what you wanted isnt it but it is not honorable for noblemen to fight it oh of course if you prefer burning the scarecrow rose unsteadily and started for the garden gates not a person stirred the scarecrow looked back and his reproachful face was too much for happy toko ill come exalted and radiant scarecrowcus wait honorable and valiant sir bring a watering can if you love me called the scarecrow over his shoulder and happy snatching one from a frightened gardener dashed after his master if things get too hot id like to know that you can put me out said the scarecrow his voice quivering with emotion you shall be rewarded for this my brave tappy happy did not answer for his teeth were chattering so he could not speak the harbor lay just below the imperial palace and the scarecrow and happy hurried on through the crowds of fleeing silvermen their household goods packed upon their heads some cheered faintly for chang wang woe but none offered to follow save the faithful happy is this king old asked the scarecrow looking anxiously at the small boats full of warriors that were putting out from the fleet he is the son of the king whom your majesty conquered fifty years ago gulped happy ha has your imperial highness any plan not yet said the scarecrow cheerfully but im thinking very hard then goodbye to silver island choked happy toko dropping the watering can with a crash never mind said the scarecrow kindly if they shoot me and i catch fire ill jump in the water and you must fish me out tappy now please dont talk any more i must think poor happy toko had nothing else to say for he considered his day finished the first of the invaders were already landing on the beach and standing up in a small boat encased in glittering gold armor was the king of the golden islands himself the sun was quite hot and there was a smell of gunpowder in the air now the scarecrow had encountered many dangers in oz and had usually thought his way out of them but as they came nearer and nearer to the shore and no idea presented itself he began to feel extremely nervous a bullet fired from the kings boat tore through his hat and the smoke made him more anxious than ever about his straw stuffing he felt hurriedly in his pocket and his clumsy fingers closed over the little fan he had plucked from the bean pole partly from agitation and partly because he did not know what else to do the scarecrow flipped the fan open at that minute a mighty roar went up from the enemy for at the first motion of the fan they had been jerked fifty feet into the air and there they hung suspended over their ships kicking and squealing for dear life the scarecrow was as surprised as they and as for happy toko he fell straightway on his nose magic exclaimed the scarecrow someone is helping us and he began fanning himself gently with the little fan waiting to see what would happen next at each wave of the fan the king of the golden islands and his men flew higher until at last not one of them could be seen from the shore the fan the magic is in the fan gasped happy toko jumping up and embracing the scarecrow why what do you mean asked the scarecrow closing the fan with a snap happys answer was drowned in a huge splash as soon as the fan was closed down whirled the kings army into the sea and each man struck the water with such force that the spray rose high as a skyscraper and not till then did the scarecrow realize the power of the little fan he had been saving for dorothy saved screamed happy toko dancing up and down hurrah for the emperor the emperor without a plan has won the victory with a fan the silver islanders had paused in their flight at the queer noises coming from the harbor and now all of them hearing tappy okos cries came crowding down to the shore and were soon cheering themselves hoarse no wonder the drenched soldiers of the king were climbing swiftly back into their boats and when they were all aboard the scarecrow waved his fan sidewise he did not want to blow them up again and the ships swept out of the harbor so fast that the water churned to silver suds behind them and they soon were out of sight ah cried the grand chew chew arriving breathlessly at this point we have won the day so we have chuckled the scarecrow putting his arm around happy toko call the brave army and decorate the generals it shall be done said the grand chew chew frowning at happy there shall be a great celebration a feast and fireworks fireworks quavered the scarecrow clutching his imperial punster by this time the silver islanders were crowding around the emperor shouting and squealing for joy and before he could prevent it they had placed him on their shoulders and carried him in triumph to the palace he managed to signal happy and happy nodded reassuringly and ran off as fast as his fat little legs could patter he arrived at the palace almost as soon as the scarecrow lugging a giant silver watering can and sitting calmly on the steps of the throne fanned himself with his hat the scarecrow eyed the watering can with satisfaction now let them have their old fireworks he muttered under his breath and settled himself comfortably the grand chew chew was hopping about like a ditched kite arranging for the celebration the courtiers were shaking hands with themselves and forming in a long line a great table was being set in the hall what a fuss they are making over nothing said the scarecrow to happy toko now in oz when we win a victory we all play some jolly game and sit down to dinner with ozma why they havent even set a place for you happy id rather sit here amiable master sighed happy toko happily is the little fan safely closed the scarecrow felt in his pocket to make sure then leaned forward in surprise the royal silver army were marching stiffly into the hall and the courtiers were bobbing and bowing and cheering like mad the general came straight to the great silver throne clicked his silver heels bowed and stood at attention well said the scarecrow surveying this splendid person curiously what is it they have come for their decorations announced the grand chew chew stepping up with a large silver platter full of medals but i thought tappy oko and i saved the island chuckled the scarecrow nudging the imperial punster had the imperial army not retired and left the field to you there would have been no victory faltered the general in a timid voice therefore in a way we are responsible for the victory a great general always knows when to retire theres something in that admitted the scarecrow scratching his head thoughtfully go ahead and decorate em chew chew this the grand chew chew proceeded to do making such a long speech to each soldier that half of the court fell asleep and the scarecrow fidgeted uncomfortably they remind me of the army of oz he confided to happy toko but we never have long speeches in oz i declare i wish i could go to sleep too and thats something i have never seen any use in before theyve just begun yawned happy toko nearly rolling down the steps of the throne and happy was not far wrong for all afternoon one after the other of the courtiers arose and droned about the great victory and as they all addressed themselves to the scarecrow he was forced to listen politely when the speeches were over there was still the grand banquet to be got through and as the silver islanders ate much the same fare as their chinese cousins you can imagine the poor scarecrows feelings ugh shivered the scarecrow as the strange dishes appeared im glad none of my friends are here how fortunate that im stuffed with straw the broiled mice the stewed shark fins and the bird nest soup made him stare he had ordered happy toko to be placed at his side and to watch him happily at work with his silver chopsticks and porcelain spoon was the only satisfaction he got out of the feast and what is that he asked pointing to a steaming bowl that had just been placed before happy minced cat your highness replied happy sprinkling it generously with silver polish cat shrieked the scarecrow pouncing to his feet in horror do you mean to tell me you are eating a poor innocent little cat not a poor one at all a very rich one i should say replied happy toko with his mouth full ah had your highness only your old body how you would enjoy this never shouted the scarecrow so loudly that all of the courtiers looked up in surprise how dare you eat innocent cats indignantly he thought of dorothys pet kitten back in oz oz why had he ever left that wonderful country your highness has eaten hundreds announced the grand chew chew calmly hundreds the scarecrow dropped back into his chair too shocked for speech he the scarecrow of oz had eaten hundreds of cats what would dorothy say to that ugh this was his first experience with silver island fare he had always spent the dinner hours in the garden he sighed and looked wistfully at the bean pole in the center of the hall every minute he was feeling less and less like the emperor of the silver island and more and more like the plain scarecrow of oz your majesty seems out of spirits said happy toko as he placed himself and the huge watering can beside the emperors bench in the garden later in the evening i wish i were said the scarecrow to have an emperors spirit wished on you is no joke my dear tappy its a blinking bore at that moment the fireworks commenced the garden ablaze with many shaped silver lanterns looked more like fairyland than ever but each rocket made the scarecrow wince showers of stars and butterflies fell round his head fiery dragons leaped over the trees and in all the fourth of july celebrations you could imagine there were never such marvelous fireworks as these no wonder happy toko gazing in delight forgot his promises to his royal master soon the scarecrows fears were realized and his straw stuffing began to smoke put me out put me out cried the scarecrow as a shower of sparks settled in his lap the royal band made such a din and the courtiers such a clatter that happy did not hear all of the silver islanders were intent on the display and they forgot all about their unhappy and smoking emperor help water water fire screamed the scarecrow jumping off his throne and knocking happy head over heels thus brought to his senses happy hurriedly seized the watering can and sprinkled its contents on the smoking emperor am i out gasped the emperor anxiously a fine way to celebrate a victory lighting me up like a roman candle yes dear master said the repentant happy helping the dripping scarecrow to his feet it only scorched your royal robe and its all over anyway let us go in the dripping emperor was quite ready to follow his imperial punsters advice now that i am put out let us by all means go in said the scarecrow gloomily and the two slipped off without anyone noticing their departure im afraid ill have to have some new stuffing tomorrow observed the scarecrow sinking dejectedly on his throne tappy my dear boy after this never leave me alone do you hear happy toko made no reply he had fallen asleep beside the imperial throne the scarecrow might have called his court but he was in no mood for more of the silver islanders idea of a good time he longed for the dear friends of his loved land of oz one by one the lights winked out in the gardens and the noisy company dispersed and soon no one in the palace was awake but the scarecrow his straw was wet and soggy and even his excellent brains felt damp and dull if it werent for tappy oko how lonely i should be he stared through the long dim empty hall with its shimmering silver screens and vases i wonder what little dorothy is doing sighed the scarecrow wistfully chapter princess ozma and betsy bobbin talk it over dorothy must be having a lovely time at the scarecrows remarked betsy bobbin to ozma one afternoon as they sat reading in the royal gardens several days after dorothys departure from the emerald city of oz one always has a jolly time at the scarecrows laughed the little queen of oz i must look in my magic picture and see what they are doing too bad she missed the absea serpent and rattlesnakes werent they the funniest creatures both the little girls for ozma is really just a little girl went off into a gale of laughter the two queer creatures had followed the scarecrows advice and had spent their vacation in the emerald city and partly because they were so dazzled by their surroundings and partly because they have no sort of memories whatever they never mentioned the scarecrow himself or said anything about his plan to hunt his family tree they talked incessantly of the mer city and told innumerable absea stories to scraps and the tin woodman and the children of the emerald city when they were ready to go the absea serpent snapped off its x block for ozma x he said meant almost everything and pretty well expressed his gratitude to the lovely little ruler of oz ozma in turn gave each of the visitors an emerald collar and that very morning they had started back to the munchkin river and all the celebrities of oz had gotten up to see them off maybe theyll come again some time said betsy bobbin swinging her feet but look ozma here comes a messenger a messenger it surely was dressed in the quaint red costume of the quadlings it was from glinda the good sorceress and caused the princess to sigh with vexation tell jack pumpkinhead to harness the sawhorse to the red wagon said ozma after glancing hastily at the little note the horners and hoppers are at war again and tell the wizard to make ready for a journey may i come too asked betsy ozma nodded with a troubled little frown and betsy bustled off importantly not many little girls are called upon to help settle wars and rule a country as wonderful as oz the horners and hoppers are a quarrelsome and curious folk living in the quadling mountains and soon ozma jack pumpkinhead betsy and the wizard of oz were rattling off at the best speed the sawhorse could manage this was pretty fast for the little horse being made of wood and magically brought to life never tires and could outrun anything on legs in the fairy kingdom of oz but the fact that interests us is that ozma did not look in the magic picture or see what exciting adventures the scarecrow and dorothy really were having as for professor wogglebug who had caused all the trouble he was busily at work on the twelfth chapter of the royal book of oz which he had modestly headed h m wogglebug te prince of bugs cultured and eminent educator and also great grand and general genealogist of oz chapter sir hokus overcometh the giant i dont believe well ever find the way out of this forest dorothy stopped with a discouraged little sigh and leaned against a tree they had followed the road for several hours first it had been fine and wide but it had gradually dwindled to a crooked little path that wound crazily in and out through the trees although it was almost noonday not a ray of sun penetrated through the dim green depths methinks said sir hokus peering into the gloom ahead that a great adventure is at hand the cowardly lion put back his ears what makes you methink so he rumbled anxiously hark thee said sir hokus holding up his finger warningly from a great way off sounded a curious thumping it was coming nearer and nearer good gracious cried dorothy catching hold of the cowardly lions mane this is worse than pokes perchance it is a dragon exulted the knight drawing his short sword ah how it would refresh me to slay a dragon i dont relish dragons myself scorched my tongue on one once said the cowardly lion huskily but ill fight with you brother hokus stand back dorothy dear as the thuds grew louder the knight fairly danced up and down with excitement approach villain he roared lustily approach till i impale thee on my lance ah had i but a horse id let you ride on my back if it werent for that hard tin suit said the cowardly lion but cheer up my dear hokus your voice is a little hoarse dorothy giggled nervously then seized hold of a small tree for the whole forest was rocking how now gasped the knight there was a terrific quake that threw sir hokus on his face and sent every hair in the lions mane on end and then a great foot came crashing down through the treetops not three paces from the little party before they could even swallow a giant hand flashed downward jerked up a handful of trees by the roots and disappeared while a voice from somewhere way above shouted what are little humans for to feed the giant bangladore broiled or toasted baked or roasted i smell three or maybe four you hear that quavered the cowardly lion sir hokus did not answer his helmet had been jammed down by his fall and he was tugging it upward with both hands frightened though dorothy was she ran to the knights assistance have at you cried sir hokus as soon as the opening in his helmet was opposite his eyes forward my heart is beating a retreat gulped the cowardly lion but he bounded boldly after sir hokus varlet hissed the knight and raising his sword gave a mighty slash at the giants ankle which was broad as three tree trunks while the cowardly lion gave a great spring and sank his teeth in the giants huge leg ouch roared the giant in a voice that shook every leaf in the forest you stop or ill tell my father with that he gave a hop that sent sir hokus flying into the treetops stumbled over a huge rock and came crashing to the earth smashing trees like grass blades at the giants first scream dorothy shut her eyes and putting her hands over her ears had run as far and as fast as she could at the awful crash she stopped short opened her eyes and stared round giddily the giant was flat on his back but as he was stretched as far as four city blocks only half of him was visible the cowardly lion still clung to his leg and he was gurgling and struggling in a way dorothy could not understand she looked around in a panic for the knight just then sir hokus dropped from the branch of a tree uds daggers he puffed looking ruefully at his sword which had snapped off at the handle tis a pretty rogue dont you think wed better run shiver dorothy thinking of the giants song not while i wear these colors exclaimed sir hokus proudly touching dorothys hair ribbon which still adorned his arm come my good lion let us dispatch this braggart and saucy monster father screamed the giant making no attempt to move he seems to be frightened himself whispered dorothy to the knight but whatever is the matter with the cowardly lion at that minute the cowardly lion gave a great jerk and began backing with his four feet braced the piece of giant leg that he had hold of stretched and stretched and while sir hokus and dorothy stared in amazement it snapped off and the cowardly lion rolled head over paws taffy roared the cowardly lion sitting up and trying to open his jaws which were firmly stuck together taffy at this sir hokus sprang nimbly on the giants leg ran up his chest and perched bravely on his peppermint collar surrender knave he demanded threateningly dorothy seeing she could do nothing to help the cowardly lion followed on her way up she broke off a tiny piece of his coat and found it most delicious chocolate why hes all made of candy she cried excitedly oh hush sobbed the giant rolling his great sourball eyes id be eaten in a minute if it were known you were mighty anxious to eat us a while ago said dorothy looking longingly at the giants coat buttons they seemed to be large marshmallows go away screamed the giant shaking so that dorothy slid into his vest pocket no one under forty feet is allowed in this forest dorothy climbed crossly out of the giants pocket we didnt come because we wanted to she assured him wiping the chocolate off her nose odds bodikins i cannot fight a great baby like this sighed sir hokus dodging just in time a great sugary tear that had rolled down the giants nose hes got to apologize for that song though wait cried dorothy suddenly i have an idea if you set us down on the edge of the forest and give us all your vest buttons for lunch we wont tell anyone youre made of candy well let you go she called loudly for the giant had begun to sob again wont you will you sniffed the foolish giant never sing that song again commanded the knight sternly no sir answered the giant meekly did your dog chew much of my leg sir then before dorothy or sir hokus had time to way a word they were snatched up in sticky fingers and next minute were dropped with a thump in a large field of daisies oh spluttered dorothy as the giant made off on his taffy legs oh weve forgotten the cowardly lion but at that minute the giant reappeared and the lion was dropped beside them whats this whats this growled the cowardly lion looking around wildly we got him to lift us out of the forest explained dorothy have you swallowed the taffy the lion was still dizzy from his ride and only shook his head feebly sir hokus sighed and sat heavily down on a large rock there is no sort of honor methinks in overcoming a candy giant he observed looking wistfully at the plume still pinned to dorothys dress ah had it but been a proper fight you didnt know he was candy i think you were just splendid jumping up dorothy fastened the plume in the knights helmet and youre talking just beautifully more like a knight every minute she added with conviction sir hokus tried not to look pleased give me a meat enemy my teeth ache yet first singing then candyleg pulling grugh what next growled the cowardly lion why lunch if you feel like eating said dorothy beginning to give out the vest buttons which the giant had obediently ripped off and left for them they were marshmallows the size of pie plates and dorothy and sir hokus found them quite delicious the cowardly lion however after a doubtful sniff and sneeze from the powdered sugar declined and went off to find something more to his taste we had better take some of these along said dorothy when she and sir hokus had eaten several we may need them later everything is yellow so we must be in the winkie country announced the cowardly lion who had just returned from his lunch theres a road too mayhap it will take us to the jeweled city of your gracious queen sir hokus shaded his eyes and stared curiously at the long lane stretching invitingly ahead of them well anyway were out of the forest and pokes and maybe well meet someone who will tell us about the scarecrow come on cried dorothy gaily i think were on the right track this time chapter dorothy and sir hokus come to fix city the afternoon went pleasantly for the three travelers the road was wide and shady and really seemed a bit familiar dorothy rode comfortably on the cowardly lions back and to pass the time told sir hokus all about oz he was particularly interested in the scarecrow grammercy he should be knighted he exclaimed slapping his knee as dorothy told how the clever straw man had helped outwit the gnome king when that wicked little rascal had tried to keep them prisoners in his underground kingdom but go to where is the gallant man now the knight sobered quickly mayhap in need of a strong arm mayhap at the mercy of some terrible monster oh i hope not cried dorothy dismayed at so dark a picture why oh why did he bother about his family tree trust the scarecrow to take care of himself said the cowardly lion in a gruff voice nevertheless he quickened his steps the sooner we reach the emerald city the sooner well know where he is the country through which they were passing was beautiful but quite deserted about five oclock they came to a clear little stream and after dorothy and sir hokus had washed their faces and the cowardly lion had taken a little plunge they all felt refreshed later they came to a fine pear orchard and as no one was about they helped themselves generously the more dorothy and the cowardly lion saw of sir hokus the fonder of him they grew he was so kindhearted and so polite hell be great company for us back in the emerald city whispered the cowardly lion as the knight went off to get dorothy a drink from a little spring that is if he forgets this grammercy bludgeon stuff i think it sounds lovely said dorothy and hes remembering more of it all the time but i wonder why there are no people here i do hope we meet some before night but no person did they meet as it grew darker sir hokus armor began to creak in a quite frightful manner armor is not meant for walking and the poor knight was stiff and tired but he made no complaint need oiling dont you asked the cowardly lion peering anxiously at him through the gloom joints in my armor a bit rusty puffed sir hokus easing one foot and then the other ah had i my good horse he expressively waved a piece of the giants button at which he had been nibbling better climb up behind dorothy advised the cowardly lion but sir hokus shook his head for he knew the lion was tired too ill manage famously this very night i may find me a steed how asked the lion with a yawn if i sleep beneath these trees i may have a knight mare chuckled sir hokus triumphantly brrrr roared the cowardly lion while dorothy clapped her hands but they were not to sleep beneath the trees after all for a sudden turn in the road brought them right to the gates of another city they knew it must be a city because a huge lighted sign hung over the gate fix city read dorothy what a funny name maybe they can fix us up rumbled the lion winking at sir hokus perchance we shall hear news of the valiant scarecrow cried the knight and limping forward he thumped on the gate with his mailed fist dorothy and the cowardly lion pressed close behind him and waited impatiently for someone to open the gate a bell rang loud back in the town the next instant the gates flew open so suddenly that the three adventurers were flung violently on their faces out upon them blustered sir hokus getting up stiffly and running to help dorothy what way is this to welcome strangers he pulled the little girl hastily to her feet then they all ran forward for the gates were swinging shut again it was almost as light as day for lanterns were everywhere but strangely enough they seemed to dart about like huge fireflies and dorothy ducked involuntarily as a red one bobbed down almost in her face then she gasped in real earnest and caught hold of sir hokus uds daggers wheezed the knight two large bushes were running down the path and right in front of dorothy the larger caught the smaller and began pulling out its leaves leave off leave off screamed the little bush thats what im doing said the big bush savagely there wont be a leaf on when i get through with you unhand him villain cried sir hokus waving his sword at the large bush the two bushes looked up in surprise and when they saw dorothy the cowardly lion and sir hokus they fell into each others branches and burst into the most uproarious laughter my dear magnolia this is rich oh dear fellow wait till sit sees this he will be convulsed quite forgetting their furious quarrel the two went rollicking down the path together stopping every few minutes to look back and laugh at the three strangers is this usual asked sir hokus looking quite dazed i never heard of bushes talking or running around but i confess im a few centuries behind times neither did i exclaimed dorothy but then almost anythings likely to happen in oz if these lanterns dont look out something will happen ill break em to bits growled the cowardly lion who had been dodging half a dozen at once how would we look out sniffed one flying at dorothy you could light out or go out giggled the little girl we never go out unless were put out cried another but as the cowardly lion made a few springs they flew high into the air and began talking indignantly among themselves by this time the three had become accustomed to the changing lights i wonder where the people are said dorothy peering down a wide avenue there dont seem to be any houses oh look three tables set for dinner with the most appetizing viands were walking jauntily down the street talking fluent china there must be people cried dorothy one dinner for each of us rumbled the cowardly lion licking his chops come on perchance they will invite us if we follow the dinners well come to the diners said sir hokus mildly right as usual the cowardly lion looked embarrassed for he had intended pouncing on the tables without further ceremony hush lets go quietly if they hear us they may run and upset the dishes warned dorothy so the three walked softly after the dinner tables their curiosity about the people of fix growing keener at every step several chairs a sofa and a clothes tree rushed past them but as dorothy said later to ozma after talking bushes nothing surprised them the tables turned the corner at the end of the avenue three abreast and the sight that greeted dorothy and her comrades was strange indeed down each side of a long street as far as they could see stood rows and rows of people each one was in the exact center of a chalked circle and they were so still that dorothy thought they must be statues but no sooner had the three tables made their appearance than bells began ringing furiously all up and down the street and dinner tables and chairs came running from every direction all the inhabitants of fix city looked alike they had large round heads broad placid faces double chins and no waists whatever their feet were flat and about three times as long as the longest you have ever seen the women wore plain mother hubbard dresses and straw sailor hats and the men gingham suits while the three friends were observing all this the tables had been taking their places one stopped before each fix and the chairs after much bumping and quarreling placed themselves properly at a signal from the fix in the center the whole company sat down without so much as moving their feet dorothy sir hokus and the cowardly lion had been too interested to speak but at this minute a whole flock of the mischievous lanterns clustered over their heads and at the sudden blare of light the whole street stopped eating and stared oh cried the fix nearest them pointing with his fork look at the runabouts this way please this way please dont bark your shins dont take any more steps than you can help boomed an important voice from the middle of the street so down the center marched the three feeling as the cowardly lion put it exactly like a circus stop names please the fix next to the center put up his knife commandingly sir hokus stepped forward with a bow princess dorothy of oz the cowardly lion of oz and sir hokus of pokes roared the lion as the knight modestly stepped back without announcing himself sir pokus of hoax howardly kion of boz and little girl beginning with d bellowed the fix meet his royal highness king fix it and the noble fixitives little girl beginning with d thats too long complained the king who with the exception of his crown looked like all the rest of them ill leave out the middle what do you want little with d my name is dorothy and if your highness could give us some dinner and tell us something about the scarecrow and one thing at a time please said the king reprovingly what does poker want and boz have they anything to spend only the night an it please your gracious highness said sir hokus with his best bow it doesnt please me especially said the king taking a sip of water and there youve brought up another question how do you want to spend it he folded his hands helplessly on the table and looked appealingly at the fix next to him how am i to settle all these questions sticken first they come running around like crazy chairs and you might ring for a settle suggested sticken looking curiously at sir hokus the king leaned back with a sigh of relief then touched a bell there were at least twenty bells set on a high post at his right hand and all of the fixes seemed to have similar bell posts hes talking perfect nonsense said dorothy angrily the cowardly lion began to roll his eyes ominously let me handle this my dear im used to kings whispered sir hokus most of em talk nonsense but if he grows wroth well have all the furniture in the place around our ears now just bump sir hokus and dorothy sat down quite suddenly the settle had arrived and hit them smartly behind the knees the cowardly lion dodged just in time and lay down with a growl beside it now that youre settled began the king in a resigned voice we might try again what is your motto this took even sir hokus by surprise but before he could answer the king snapped out come late and stay early hows that very good said sir hokus with a wink at dorothy next time dont come at all mumbled sticken plaster his mouth full of biscuit and you wanted the king asked uneasily dinner for three said the knight promptly and with another bow now thats talking the king looked admiringly at sir hokus this little with d had matters all tangled up one time at a thing thats my motto leaning over the king pressed another button by this time the fixes had lost interest in the visitors and went calmly on with their dinners three tables came pattering up and the settle drew itself up of its own accord dorothy placed the cowardly lions dinner on the ground and then she and sir hokus enjoyed the first good meal they had had since they left pokes they were gradually becoming used to their strange surroundings you ask him about the scarecrow begged dorothy everybody had finished and the tables were withdrawing in orderly groups the king was leaning sleepily back in his chair ahem began the knight rising stiffly has your majesty seen aught of a noble scarecrow and could your supreme fixity tell us aught the kings eyes opened youre out of turn he interrupted crossly were only to the second question how will you spend the night in sleep answered sir hokus promptly if your majesty permits i do said the king solemnly that gets me out of entertaining early to bed and late to rise thats my motto next its your turn he added irritably as sir hokus did not immediately answer have you seen aught of the noble scarecrow asked sir hokus and all of them waited anxiously for the kings reply i dont know about the scarecrow ive seen a scarecrow and a sensible chap he was hanging still like a reasonable person and letting chairs and tables chase themselves round where was he asked sir hokus in great agitation in a picture said the king wait ill ring for it no use said the knight in a disappointed voice were looking for a man would you mind telling me why you are all so still and why all your furniture runs around asked dorothy who was growing a little restless you forget where you are and youre out of turn but ill overlook it this once said the king have you ever noticed little with d that furniture lasts longer than people why yes admitted dorothy well there you are king fix sit folded his hands and regarded her complacently here we manage things better we stand still and let the furniture run around and wear itself out how does it strike you it seem sensible acknowledged dorothy but dont you ever grow tired of standing still ive heard of growing hair and flowers and corn but never of growing tired what is it asked sticken plaster leaning toward dorothy i think shes talked enough said the king closing his eyes sir hokus had been staring anxiously at the king for some time now he came close to the monarchs side and standing on tiptoe whispered hoarsely hast any dragons here did you say wagons asked the king opening his eyes with a terrible yawn dragons hissed the knight never heard of em said the king the cowardly lion chuckled behind his whiskers and sir hokus in great confusion stepped back what time is it demanded the king suddenly he touched a bell and next minute a whole company of clocks came running down the street the big ones pushed the little ones and a grandfather clock ran so fast that it tripped over a cobblestone and fell on its face which cracked all the way across youve plenty of time why dont you take it called the king angrily while two clothes trees helped the clock to its feet theyre all different giggled dorothy nudging the cowardly lion some pointed to eight oclock some to nine and others to half past ten why shouldnt they be different asked sticken haughtily some run faster than others pass the time please said the king looking hard at dorothy the lazy lump growled the cowardly lion but dorothy picked up the nearest little clock and handed it to king fix sit i thought so yawned the king pointing at the clock at this everybody began ringing bells till dorothy was obliged to cover her ears in an instant the whole street was filled with beds rolling up just as if they were taxis laughed dorothy to sir hokus the knight smiled faintly but as he had never seen a taxi he could not appreciate dorothys remark here come your beds said the king shortly tell them to take you around the corner i cant abide snoring i dont snore thank you said dorothy angrily but the king had stepped into his bed and drawn the curtains tight we might as well go to bed i spose said the little girl im so tired the three beds were swaying restlessly in the middle of the street they were tall fourpost affairs with heavy chintz hangings dorothy chose the blue one and sir hokus lifted her up carefully and then went off to catch his bed which had gotten into an argument with a lamppost when he spoke to it sharply it left off and came trotting over to him the cowardly lion contrary to his usual custom leaped into his bed and soon the three fourposters were walking quietly down the street evidently following the kings instructions dorothy slipped off her shoes and dress and nestled comfortably down among the soft covers just like sleeping in a train she thought drowsily what a lot i shall have to tell the scarecrow and ozma when i get home good night said the bed politely good night said dorothy too nearly asleep to even think it strange for a bed to talk good night chapter dancing beds and the roads that unrolled it must be a shipwreck thought dorothy sitting up in alarm she seemed to be tossing about wildly time for little girls to get up grumbled a harsh voice that seemed to come from the pillows dorothy rubbed her eyes one of the bedposts was addressing her and the big fourposter itself was dancing a regular jig oh stop cried dorothy holding on to the post to keep from bouncing out cant you see im awake well i go off duty now and youll have to hurry said the bed sulkily im due at the lecture at nine lecture gasped dorothy whats so queer about that demanded the bed coldly ive got to keep well posted havent i i belong to a polished set i do hurry up little girl or ill throw you out im glad my bed doesnt talk to me in this impertinent fashion thought dorothy slipping into her dress and combing her hair with her side comb imagine being ordered about by a bed i wonder if sir hokus is up parting the curtains she jumped down and the bed without even saying goodbye took itself off sir hokus was sitting on a stile polishing his armor with a pillowslip he had taken from his bed and the cowardly lion was lying beside him lazily thumping his tail and making fun of the passing furniture have you had breakfast asked dorothy joining her friends we were waiting for your ladyship chuckled the cowardly lion would you mind ordering two for me hokus i find one quite insufficient sir hokus threw away the pillowslip and talking cheerfully they walked toward king fix sits circle the beds had been replaced by breakfast tables and the whole street was eating busily good morning king said sir hokus four breakfasts please the king rang a bell four times without looking up from his oatmeal seeing that he did not wish to be disturbed the three waited quietly for their tables in some ways said dorothy contentedly munching a hot roll in some ways this is a very comfortable place in sooth tis that mumbled sir hokus his mouth full of baked apple as for the cowardly lion he finished his two breakfasts in no time and now said sir hokus as the tables walked off let us continue our quest couldst tell us the way to the emerald city my good king fix if you go go away and if you stay stay away thats my motto answered king fix shortly i cant have people running around here like common furniture he added in a grieved voice all the fix its nodded vigorously let them take their stand or their departure said sticken plaster firmly the king felt in his pocket and brought out three pieces of chalk go to the end of the street choose a place and draw your circle in five minutes you will find it impossible to move out of the circle and you will be saved all this unnecessary motion but we dont want to come to a standstill objected dorothy no by my good sword spluttered the knight glaring around nervously then seeing the king looked displeased he made a low bow if your highness could graciously direct us out of the city buy a piece of road and go where it takes you snapped the king seeing no more was to be got out of him they started down the long street i wonder what they do when it rains said dorothy looking curiously at the solemn rows of people call for roofs silly snapped a fix staring at her rudely if you would spend your time thinking instead of walking youd know more go to and swallow a gooseberry roared the knight waving his sword at the fix and dorothy fearing an encounter begged him to come on which he did though with many backward glances fix city seemed to consist of one long street and they had soon come to the very end uds daggers gasped sir hokus great palm trees roared the cowardly lion as for dorothy she could do nothing but stare the street ended surely enough and beyond there was nothing at all that is nothing but air well said the cowardly lion backing a few paces this is a pretty fix glad you like it said a wheezy voice the three travelers turned in surprise a huge fix was regarding them with interest his circle which was the last in the row was about twenty times as large as the other circles and on the edge stood a big sign dont you remember the king said something about buying a road said dorothy in an excited undertone to the knight canst direct us to a road my good man asked sir hokus with a bow the fix jerked his thumb back at the sign what kind of a road to you want he asked hoarsely a road that will take us back to the emerald city please said dorothy i cant guarantee anything like that declared the fix shaking his head our roads go where they please and youll have to go where they take you do you want to go on or off on shivered the cowardly lion looking with a shudder over the precipice at the end of the street what kind of a road will you have make up your minds please i am busy what kind of roads have you asked dorothy timidly it was her first experience at buying roads and she felt a bit perplexed sunny shady straight crooked and crossroads snapped the fix we wouldnt want a cross one said dorothy positively have you any with trees at both sides and water at the end how many yards asked the fix taking a pair of shears as large as himself off a long counter beside him five miles said sir hokus as dorothy looked confused that ought to take us somewhere the fix rang one of the bells in the counter the next minute a big trap door in the ground opened and a perfectly huge roll bounced out at his feet get on commanded the fix in such a sharp tone that the three jumped to obey holding fast to sir hokus dorothy stepped on the piece of road that had already unrolled the cowardly lion looking very anxious followed no sooner had they done so than the road gave a terrific leap forward that stretched the three flat upon their backs and started unwinding from its spool at a terrifying speed as it unrolled tall trees snapped erect on each side and began laughing derisively at the three travelers huddled together in the middle ggglad we only took five miles stuttered dorothy to the knight whose armor was rattling like a ford the cowardly lion had wound his tail around a tree and dug his claws into the road for he had no intention of falling off into nothingness as for the road it snapped along at about a mile a minute and before they had time to grow accustomed to this singular mode of travel it gave a final jump that sent them circling into the air and began rapidly winding itself up down down down whirled dorothy falling with a resounding splash into a broad stream of water then down down down again almost to the bottom help screamed dorothy as her head rose above water and she began striking out feebly but the fall through the air had taken all her breath what do you want a thin neat little man was watching her anxiously from the bank making careful notes in a book that he held in one hand help save me choked dorothy feeling herself going down in the muddy stream again wait ill look it up under the hs called the little man making a trumpet of his hands are you an island an island is a body of land entirely surrounded by water but this seems to be a somebody dorothy heard him mutter as he whipped over several pages of his book sorry he called back shaking his head slowly but this is the wrong day i only save lives on monday stand aside mem you villain a second little man exactly like the first except that he was exceedingly untidy plunged into the stream its no use thought dorothy closing her eyes for he had jumped in far below the spot where she had fallen and was making no progress whatever the waters rushed over her head the second time then she felt herself being dragged upward when she opened her eyes the cowardly lion was standing over her are you all right he rumbled anxiously i came as soon as i could fell in way upstream seen hokus oh hell drown cried dorothy forgetting her own narrow escape he cant swim in that heavy armor never fear ill get him puffed the cowardly lion and without waiting to catch his breath he plunged back into the stream the little man who only saved lives on monday now approached timidly id like to get a statement from you if you dont mind it might help me in the future you might have helped me in the present said dorothy wringing out her dress you ought to be ashamed of yourself ill make a note of that said the little man earnestly but how did you feel when you went down he waited his pencil poised over the little book go away cried dorothy in disgust but my dear young lady im not your dear young lady oh dear why doesnt the cowardly lion come back go away mem the second little man dripping wet came up hurriedly i was only trying to get a little information grumbled mem sulkily im sorry i couldnt swim faster said the wet little man approaching dorothy apologetically well thank you for trying said dorothy is he your brother and could you tell me where you are youre dressed in yellow so i spose it must be somewhere in the winkie country right in both cases chuckled the little fellow my name is ran and his name is memo he jerked his thumb at the retiring twin randum and memo see i think i do said dorothy half closing her eyes is that why hes always taking notes exactly said ran i do everything at random and he does everything at memorandum it must be rather confusing said dorothy then as she caught sight of the cowardly lion dragging sir hokus she jumped up excitedly ran however took one look at the huge beast and then fled calling for mem at the top of his voice and that is the last dorothy saw of these singular twins the lion dropped sir hokus in a limp heap when dorothy unfastened his armor gallons of water rushed out sho good of of you choked the poor knight trying to straighten up save your breath old fellow said the cowardly lion regarding him affectionately oh why did i ask for water on the end of the road sighed dorothy but anyway were in some part of the winkie country sir hokus though still spluttering was beginning to revive yon noble bheast shall be knighted uds daggers thats the shecond time hes shaved my life rising unsteadily he tottered over to the lion and struck him a sharp blow on the shoulder rishe shir cowardly lion he cried hoarsely and fell headlong and before dorothy or the lion had recovered from their surprise he was fast asleep mumbling happily of dragons and bludgeons well have to wait till he gets rested said dorothy and until i get dry she began running up and down then stopped suddenly before the lion and theres something else for professor wogglebug to put in his book sir cowardly lion oh that mumbled the cowardly lion looking terribly embarrassed whoever heard of a cowardly knight nonsense no it isnt nonsense said dorothy stoutly youre a knight from now on wont the scarecrow be pleased if we ever find him sighed the lion settling himself beside sir hokus we will said dorothy gaily i just feel it chapter sons and grandsons greet the scarecrow although the scarecrow had been on silver island only a few days he had already instituted many reforms and thanks to his cleverness the people were more prosperous than ever before cheers greeted him wherever he went and even old chew chew was more agreeable and no longer made bitter remarks to happy toko the scarecrow himself however had four new wrinkles and was exceedingly melancholy he missed the carefree life in oz and every minute that he was not ruling the island he was thinking about his old home and dear jolly comrades in the emerald city i almost hope they will look in the magic picture and wish me back again he mused pensively but it is my duty to stay here i have a family to support so he resolved to put the best face he could on the matter and happy toko did his utmost to cheer up his royal master the second morning after the great victory he came running into the silver throne room in a great state of excitement the honorable offspring have arriven announced happy turning a somersault come ancient and amiable sir and gaze upon your sons and grandsons the scarecrow sprang joyously from his silver throne upsetting a bowl of silver fish and three silver vases at last a real family ever since his arrival the three princes and their fifteen little sons had been cruising on the royal pleasure barge so that the scarecrow had not caught a glimpse of them this is the happiest moment of my life he exclaimed clasping his yellow gloves and watching the door intently happy looked a little uneasy for he knew the three princes to be exceedingly haughty and overbearing but he said nothing and next minute the scarecrows family stepped solemnly into the royal presence children cried the scarecrow and with his usual impetuousness rushed forward and flung his arms around the first richly clad prince take care take care ancient and honorable papa cried the young silverman backing away such excitement is not good for one of your advanced years he drew himself away firmly and adjusting a huge pair of silver spectacles regarded the scarecrow attentively ah how you have changed he looks very feeble too fang but may he live long to rule this flowery island and our humble selves said the second prince bowing stiffly do you not find the affairs of state fatiguing darling papa inquired the third prince fingering a jeweled chain that hung around his neck i as your eldest son shall be delighted to relieve you should you wish to retire get back ten paces you he roared at happy toko the poor scarecrow had been so taken aback by this cool reception that he just stared in disbelief if the three honorable princes will retire themselves i will speak with my grandsons he said dryly bowing in his most royal manner the three princes exchanged startled glances then with three low salaams they retired backward from the hall and now my dears the scarecrow looked wistfully at his fifteen silkenclad little grandsons their silver hair plaited tightly into little queues stood out stiffly on each side of their heads and gave them a very curious appearance at his first word the fifteen fell dutifully on their noses as soon as they were right side up the scarecrow beginning at the end of the row addressed a joking question to each in his most approved oz style but over they went again and answered merely yes gracious grandpapapapah or no honorable grandpapapapah and the constant bobbing up and down and papahing so confused the poor scarecrow that he nearly gave up the conversation its no use trying to talk to these children he wailed in disgust theyre so solemn dont you ever laugh he cried in exasperation for he had told them stories that would have sent the oz youngsters into hysterics it is not permissible for a prince to laugh at the remarks of his honorable grandparent whispered happy toko while the fifteen little princes banged their heads solemnly on the floor honorable fiddlesticks exclaimed the scarecrow slumping back on his throne bring cushions happy toko ran off nimbly and soon the fifteen little princes were seated in a circle at the scarecrows feet to prevent prostrations said the scarecrow yes old grandpapapapapah chorused the princes bending over as far as they could wait said the scarecrow hastily ill tell you a story once upon a time to a beautiful country called oz which is surrounded on all sides by a deadly desert there came a little girl named dorothy a terrible gale well whats the matter now the scarecrow stopped short for the oldest prince had jerked a book out of his sleeve and was flipping over the pages industriously it is not on the map great grand papapapah he announced solemnly and all of the other little princes shook their heads and said dully not on the map not on the map oz of course its not do you suppose we want all the humans in creation coming there calming down the scarecrow tried to continue his story but every time he mentioned oz the little princes shook their heads stubbornly and whispered not on the map till the usually goodtempered scarecrow flew into perfect passion not on the map you little villains he screamed forgetting they were his grandsons what difference does that make are your heads solid silver we do not believe in oz announced the oldest prince serenely there is no such place no such place as oz happy do you hear that the scarecrows voice fairly crackled with indignation why i thought everybody believed in oz perhaps your highness can convince them later suggested the imperial punster this way offspring his master he felt had had enough family for one day so the fifteen little princes with fifteen stiff little bows took themselves back to the royal nursery as for the scarecrow he paced disconsolately up and down his magnificent throne room tripping over his kimona at every other step youre a good boy tappy said the scarecrow as happy returned but i tell you being a grandparent is not what i thought it would be did you hear them tell me right to my face they did not believe in oz and my sons ugh fault of their bringing up said happy toko comfortingly if your serene highness would just tell me more of that illustrious country happy knew that nothing cheered the scarecrow like talking of oz and to tell the truth happy himself never tired of the scarecrows marvelous stories so the two slipped quietly into the palace gardens and the scarecrow related for the fourteenth time the story of his discovery by dorothy and the story of ozma and almost forgot that he was an emperor your highness knows the history of oz by heart said happy admiringly as the scarecrow paused i couldnt do that said the scarecrow gently for you see happy i have no heart then i wish we all had none exclaimed happy toko rolling up his eyes the scarecrow looked embarrassed so the little punster threw back his head and sang a song he had been making up while the scarecrow had been telling his stories the scarecrow was standing alone in a field inviting the crows to keep off when the straw in his chest began tickling his vest and he couldnt resist a loud cough the noise that was heard so surprised evry bird that the flock flew away in a fright but the scarecrow looked pleased and he said if id sneezed it wouldnt have been so polite ho roared the scarecrow youre almost as good at making verses as scraps write that down for me tappy id like to show it to her hush whispered happy holding up his finger warningly the scarecrow turned so suddenly that the silver pigtail pinned to the back of his hat wound itself tightly around his neck no wonder on the other side of the hedge the three princes were walking up and down conversing in indignant whispers what a horrible shape our honorable papa has reappeared in i hear that it never wears out muttered one he may continue just as he is for years and years how am i ever to succeed him id like to know why he may outlive us all we might throw him into the silver river said the second hopefully no use choked the third i was just talking to the imperial soothsayer and he tells me that no one from this miserable kingdom of oz can be destroyed but i have a plan incline your royal ears listen the voices dropped to such a low whisper that neither happy nor the scarecrow could hear one word treason spluttered happy making ready to spring through the hedge but the scarecrow seized him by the arm and drew him away i dont believe they like their poor papa exclaimed the scarecrow when they were safely back in the throne room im feeling older than a kinkajou ah happy oko why did i ever slide down my family tree it has brought me nothing but unhappiness chapter the three princes plot to undo the emperor let me help your imperial serenity bring a cane carefully now the three royal princes with every show of affection were supporting the scarecrow to the silver bench in the garden where he usually sat during luncheon are you quite comfortable asked the elder here happy you rogue fetch a scarf for his imperial highness you must be careful dear papa scarecrow at your age drafts are dangerous the rascally prince wound the scarf about the scarecrows neck what do you suppose they are up to asked the scarecrow staring after the three suspiciously why this sudden devotion it upsets my imperial serenity a lot trying to make you feel old grumbled happy several hours had passed since they had overheard the conversation in the garden the scarecrow had decided to watch his sons closely and fall in with any plan they suggested so they would suspect nothing then when the time came he would act just what he would do he did not know but his excellent brains would not he felt sure desert him happy toko sat as close to the scarecrow as he could and scowled terribly whenever the princes approached which was every minute or so during the afternoon how is the scarecrows celestial old head does he suffer from honorable gout should they fetch the imperial doctor the scarecrow who had never thought of age in his whole straw life became extremely nervous was he really old did his head ache when no one was looking he felt himself carefully all over then something of his old time oz spirit returned seizing the cushion that his eldest son was placing at his back he hurled it over his head leaping from his throne he began turning handsprings in a careless and sprightly manner dont you worry about your honorable old papa chuckled the scarecrow winking at happy toko hes good for a couple of centuries the three princes stared sourly at this exhibition of youth but your heart objected the eldest prince have none laughed the scarecrow snatching off the silver cord from around his waist he began skipping rope up and down the hall the princes tapping their foreheads significantly retired and the scarecrow throwing his arm around happy toko began whispering in his ear he had a plan himself they would see meanwhile off in his dark cave in one of the silver mountains the grand gheewizard of the silver island was stirring a huge kettle of magic every few moments he paused to read out of a great yellow book that he had propped up on the mantle the fire in the huge grate leaped fiercely under the big black pot and the sputtering candles on each side of the book sent creepy shadows into the dark cave dark chests books bundles of herbs and heaps of gold and silver were everywhere whenever the gheewizard turned his back a rheumatic silverscaled old dragon would crawl toward the fire and swallow a mouthful of coals until the old gheewizard caught him in the act and chained him to a ring in the corner of the cave be patient little joy of my heart our fortune is about to be made hissed the wizened little man waving a long iron spoon at the dragon you shall have a bucket of redhot coals every hour and i a silver cap with a tassel have not the royal princes promised it the dragon shuffled about and finally went to sleep smoking sulkily is it finished son of a yellow dog through the narrow opening of the cave the youngest prince stuck his head i am working as fast as i can honorable prince but the elixir must boil yet one more night tomorrow when the sun shines on the first bar of your celestial window come and all will be ready are you sure you have found it asked the prince withdrawing his head for the smoking dragon and steam from the kettle made him cough quite sure wheezed the grand gheewizard and fell to stirring the kettle with all his might the scarecrow although busy with trials in the great courtroom of the palace felt that something unusual was in the air the princes kept nodding to one another and the grand chew chew and general mugwump had their heads together at every opportunity somethings going to happen tappy i feel it in my straw whispered the scarecrow as he finished trying the last case at that very minute the grand chew chew arose and held up his hand for silence everybody paused in their way to the exits and looked with surprise at the old silverman i have to announce said the grand chew chew in a solemn voice that the great and imperial chang wang woe will tomorrow be restored to his own rightful shape the grand gheewizard of the realm has discovered a magic formula to break the enchantment and free him from this distressing scarecrow body behold for the last the scarecrow of oz tomorrow he will be our old and glorious emperor old and glorious gasped the scarecrow nearly falling from his throne tappy i forgot to lock up the wizards great cornstarch tomorrow i will be eightyfive years old such cheers greeted the grand chew chews announcement that no one even noticed the scarecrows distress i also have an announcement cried the eldest prince standing up proudly to make the celebration of my royal papas restoration complete we have chosen the lovely and charming orange blossom for his bride bride gulped the scarecrow but i do not approve of second marriages i refuse to no one paid the slightest attention to the scarecrows remarks hold my hand tappy sighed the scarecrow weakly it may be your last chance then he sat up and stared in good earnest for the prince was leading forward a tall richly clad lady orange blossom muttered the scarecrow under his breath he means lemon peel silver grandmother tappy orange blossom was a crosslooking princess of seventyfive at least she is a sister of the king of the golden islands whispered general mugwump of a richness surpassing your own let me felicitate your highness fan me tappy fan me gasped the scarecrow then he straightened himself suddenly the time had come for action he would say nothing to anyone but that night he would escape and try to find his way back to oz family or no family he bowed graciously to princess orange blossom to the grand chew chew and to his sons let everything be made ready for the ceremony and may tomorrow indeed bring me to myself he repeated solemnly nothing was talked of that evening but the emperors impending marriage and the grand gheewizards discovery the scarecrow seemed the least excited person in the palace sitting on his throne he pretended to read the royal silver journal but he was really waiting impatiently for the courtiers to retire finally when the last one had bowed himself out and only happy toko remained in the throne room the scarecrow began making his plans its no use tappy said he tying up a few little trinkets for dorothy in a silk handkerchief id rather be straw than meat id rather be a plain scarecrow in oz than emperor of the earth they may be my sons but all they want is my death im going back to my old friends id rather he got no farther a huge slave seized him suddenly from behind while another caught happy toko around his fat little waist tie them fast said the eldest prince smiling wickedly at the scarecrow here tie him to the beanstalk merely a part of the grand gheewizards formula he exclaimed maliciously as the struggling scarecrow was bound securely to his family tree good night dear papa scarecrow tomorrow you will be your old self again and in a few short years i will be emperor of the silver islands this rather upsets our plans eh tappy wheezed the scarecrow after a struggle with his bonds pigs weasels choked tappy what are we to do alas groaned the scarecrow tomorrow there will be no scarecrow in oz what will dorothy and ozma think and once i am changed into my old imperial self i can never make the journey to the emerald city eightysix is too old for traveling has your majesty forgotten the wonderful brains given to you by the wizard of oz i had for a moment confessed the scarecrow be quiet tappy while i think pressing his head against the magic beanpole the scarecrow thought and thought harder than he had ever done in the course of his adventurous life and in the great silent hall happy toko struggled to set himself free chapter dorothy and her guardians meet new friends while all these exciting things were happening to the poor scarecrow dorothy sir hokus and the cowardly lion had been having adventures of their own for three days they had wandered through a deserted part of the winkie country subsisting largely on berries sleeping under trees and looking in vain for a road to lead them back to the emerald city on the second day they had encountered an ancient woodsman too old and deaf to give them any information he did however invite them into his hut and give them a good dinner and a dozen sandwiches to carry away with them but oh for a good old pasty sighed sir hokus late on the third afternoon as they finished the last of the crumbly sandwiches do you know said dorothy looking through the straggly fields and woods ahead i believe weve been going in the wrong direction again again choked the cowardly lion you mean still ive been in a good many parts of oz but this this is the worst not even one little dragon sir hokus shook his head mournfully then seeing that dorothy was tired and discouraged he pretended to strum on a guitar and sang in his highpitched voice a rusty knight in steel bedite and lady dot so fair sir lion bold with mane of gold and might besides to spa ha hare and might beside to spare the dauntless three a company of wit and bravery are who seek the valiant scarecrow man who seek him near and fa har har who seek him near and fa har oh i like that cried dorothy jumping up and giving sir hokus a little squeeze only you should have said trusty knight the cowardly lion shook his golden mane lets do a little reconnoitering hokus he said carelessly he felt he must live up to the song somehow perhaps well find a sign i dont believe in signs anymore laughed dorothy but im coming too sir hokus song had cheered them all and it wasnt the first time the knight had helped make the best of a tiresome journey the air seemeth to grow very hot observed sir hokus after they had walked along silently for a time hast noticed it sir cowardly no but ive swallowed some of it coughed the cowardly lion looking suspiciously through the trees ill just step forward and see what it is said the knight as he disappeared the truth dawned on dorothy wait wait dont go please please sir hokus come back come back cried the little girl running after him as fast as she could whats the matter rumbled the cowardly lion thudding behind her then both coming suddenly out of the woods gave a terrible scream which so startled sir hokus that he fell over backwards just in time too for another step would have taken him straight on to the deadly desert which destroys every living thing and keeps all intruders away from oz what befell puffed sir hokus getting to his feet naturally he knew nothing of the poisonous sands you did wheezed the cowardly lion in an agitated voice was it a dragon asked the knight limping toward them hopefully sit down the cowardly lion mopped his brow with his tail one step on that desert and it would have been one long goodnight i should say it would shuddered dorothy and explained to sir hokus the deadly nature of the sands and do you know what this means dorothy was nearer to tears than even i like to think about it means weve come in exactly the wrong direction and are farther away from the emerald city than we were when we started and seek him near and fa hah har mumbled sir hokus with a very troubled light in his kindly blue eyes and seek him near and far fah har har i should say it was said the cowardly lion bitterly but you neednt sing it no i spose not uds helmets and hauberks i spose not the knight lapsed into a discouraged silence and all three sat and stared drearily at the stretch of desert before them and thought gloomily of the rough country behind its a caravan wheezed a hoarse voice i doubt that camy i doubt it very much the shrill nasal voices so startled the three travelers that they swung about in astonishment great dates and deserts burst out the cowardly lion jumping up and on the whole this exclamation was entirely suitable for ambling toward them were a longlegged camel and a wobblynecked dromedary at last a steed cried the knight bounding to his feet i doubt that the dromedary stopped and looked at him coldly try me said the camel amiably im more comfortable i doubt that too the doubtful dromedary wept as oer the desert sands he stept association with the sphinx has made him doubtful so he thinks chortled the knight with his head on one side how did you know asked the dromedary opening his eyes wide it just occurred to me admitted sir hokus clearing his throat modestly i doubt that somebody told you said the doubtful dromedary bitterly pon my honor said sir hokus i doubt it i doubt it very much persisted the dromedary wagging his head sorrowfully you seem to doubt everything dorothy laughed in spite of herself and the dromedary regarded her sulkily he does said the camel it makes him very doubtful company now i like to be comfortable and happy and you cant be if youre always doubting things and people and places eh my dear where did you comfortable and doubtful parties come from asked the cowardly lion strangers here well yes admitted the camel nibbling the branch of a tree there was a terrific sandstorm and after blowing and blowing and blowing we found ourselves in this little wood the odd part of it is that you talk in our language never knew a twoleg to understand a word of camelia before youre not talking camelia youre talking ozish laughed dorothy all animals can talk here well now thats very comfortable i must say sighed the camel and if youd just tell me where to go it would be more comfortable still i doubt that snapped the dromedary theyre no caravan where do you want to go asked the cowardly lion ignoring the doubtful dromedary anywhere just so we keep moving were used to being told when to start and stop and life is mighty lonely without our karwan bashi sighed the comfortable camel why i didnt know you smoked exclaimed dorothy in surprise she thought the camel was referring to a brand of tobacco he means his camel driver whispered sir hokus eyeing the soft pillowed seat on the camels back longingly besides the seat great sacks and bales of goods hung from its sides the doubtful dromedary was similarly loaded goodness exclaimed dorothy a sudden idea had struck her you havent anything to eat in those sacks have you plenty my child plenty answered the camel calmly three cheers for the comfortable camel roared the cowardly lion while sir hokus following the camels directions carefully unfastened a large woven basket from one of the sacks on its side you may be my karwan bashi announced the comfortable camel judiciously as sir hokus paused for breath hear that lady dot sir hokus swept the camel a bow and fairly beamed with pleasure dorothy meanwhile had set out an appetizing repast on a small rocky ledge a regular feast it appeared to the hungry travelers there were loaves of black bread figs dates cheese and a curious sort of dried meat which the cowardly lion swallowed in great quantities isnt this cozy said dorothy forgetting the long weary way ahead my im glad we met you very comforting to us too my dear said the camel swaying complacently isnt it doubty there are some silk cushions in my righthand saddle sack but i doubt very much whether youll like em mumbled the dromedary gruffly out with them cried sir hokus pouncing on the doubtful dromedary and in a minute each of the party had a cushion and was as snug as possible could anything have been more fortunate exulted the knight we can now resume our journey properly mounted i think ill ride the cowardly lion said dorothy looking uneasily at the high seat on the camels back lets start before it grows any darker they had eaten to hearts content and now packing up the remainder of the feast the little party made ready to start sir hokus using the cowardly lion as a footstool mounted the camel and then dorothy climbed on her old friends back and the little caravan moved slowly through the forest theres a tent in my lefthand saddle sack but i doubt very much whether you can put it up said the doubtful dromedary falling in behind the comfortable camel i doubt it very much indeed how now what means this doubting called sir hokus from his perilous seat ill pitch it when the time comes mind you dont pitch out when the camel goes called the cowardly lion who would have his little joke sir hokus to tell the truth was feeling tossed about and dizzy but he was too polite to mention the fact as they proceeded dorothy told the comfortable camel all about the scarecrow and oz an occasional word jolted down from above told her that the knight was singing they had gone possibly a mile when dorothy pointed in excitement to a road just ahead we must have missed it before wait ill see what its like jumping down from the cowardly lions back she peered curiously at the narrow treelined path why heres a sign what of asked the comfortable camel lurching forward eagerly and nearly unseating the knight w i s h w a y read dorothy in a puzzled voice looks like a pretty good road said the comfortable camel squinting up its eyes i doubt it camy i doubt it very much said the doubtful dromedary tremulously what does my dear karwan bashi think asked the comfortable camel looking adoringly back at the knight it is unwise to go back when the journey lieth forward said the knight and immediately returned to his song so single file the little company turned in at the narrow path the comfortable camel advancing with timid steps and the doubtful dromedary bobbing his head dubiously chapter doubty and camy vanish into space for a short time everything went well then dorothy turning to see how sir hokus was getting along discovered that the doubtful dromedary had disappeared why where in the world exclaimed dorothy the comfortable camel craned his wobbly neck and when he saw that his friend was gone burst into tears his sobs heaved sir hokus clear out of his seat and flung him helmet first into the dust go to exploded the knight sitting up if i were a bird riding in yon nest would be easier the last of his sentence ended in a hoarse croak sir hokus vanished and a great raven flopped down in the center of the road oh where is my dear karwan bashi oh where is doubty screamed the comfortable camel running around in frenzied circles i wish id never come on this path magic gasped dorothy clutching the cowardly lions mane the comfortable camel had melted into air before their very eyes i doubt it i doubt it very much coughed a faint voice close to her ear dorothy ducked her head involuntarily as a big yellow butterfly settled on the cowardly lions ear our doubtful friend whispered the lion weakly oh be careful dorothy dear we may turn into frogs or something worse any minute dorothy and the cowardly lion had had experiences with magic transformations and the little girl pressing her fingers to her eyes tried to think of something to do the raven was making awkward attempts to fly and cawing go to now every other second oh i wish dear sir hokus were himself again wailed dorothy after trying in vain to recall some magic sentences presto the knight stood before them a bit breathless from flying but hearty as ever i see i see said the cowardly lion with a little prance every wish you make on this road comes true remember the sign wish way i wish the comfortable camel were back i wish the doubtful dromedary were himself again muttered the cowardly lion rapidly and in an instant the two creatures were standing in the path uds bodikins so i did wish myself a bird gasped the knight rubbing his gauntlets together excitedly there you are there you are cried the comfortable camel stumbling toward him and resting his foolish head on his shoulder dear dear karwan bashi and doubty old fellow there you are too ah how comfortable this all is not two one wheezed the doubtful dromedary and camy i doubt very much whether id care for butterflying i just happened to wish myself one dont make any more wishes said the cowardly lion sternly methinks a proper wish might serve us well observed sir hokus he had been pacing up and down in great excitement why not wish oh stop begged dorothy wait till weve thought it all out wishings awfully particular work one person better speak for the party said the cowardly lion now i suggest oh be careful screamed dorothy again i wish you would all stop wishing sir hokus looked at her reproachfully no wonder at dorothys words they all found themselves unable to speak the doubtful dromedarys eyes grew rounder and rounder for the first time in its life it was unable to doubt anything now ill have to do it all thought dorothy and closing her eyes she tried to think of the very best wish for everybody concerned it was night and growing darker the cowardly lion the camel and dromedary and sir hokus peered anxiously at the little girl wondering what in the world was going to happen being wished around is no joke for five minutes dorothy thought and thought then standing in the middle of the road she made her wish in a clear distinct voice it was not a very long wish to be exact it had only eight words eight short little words but stars no sooner were they out of dorothys mouth than the earth opened with a splintering crash and swallowed up the whole company chapter dorothy finds the scarecrow the next thing dorothy knew she was sitting on the hard floor of a great dark hall one lantern burned feebly and in the dim silvery light she could just make out the comfortable camel scrambling awkwardly to his feet i smell straw sniffed the camel softly i doubt very much whether i am going to like this place the voice of the doubtful dromedary came hesitatingly through the gloom by sword and scepter gasped the knight are you there sir cowardly thank goodness they are said dorothy wishing other people about is a risky and responsible business theyre all here but i wonder where here is she jumped up but at a shuffle of feet drew back pigs weasels shrilled an angry voice and a fat little man hurled himself at sir hokus who happened to have fallen in the lead uds trudgeons and bludgeons and maugre thy head roared the knight shaking him off like a fly tappy tappy my dear boy caution whats all this at the sound of that dear familiar voice dorothys heart gave a skip of joy and without stopping to explain she rushed forward dorothy cried the scarecrow stepping on his kimona and falling off his silvery throne lights tappy more lights at once but tappy was too busy backing away from sir hokus of pokes approach vassal thundered the knight who understood not a word of tappys speech approach i think ive been insulted he drew his sword and glared angrily through the darkness and tappy having backed as far as possible fell heels over pigtail into the silver fountain at the loud splash dorothy hastened to the rescue theyre friends and weve found the scarecrow weve found the scarecrow she seized sir hokus and shook him till his armor rattled tappy tappy called the scarecrow where in the world did he pagota thats exactly what he said but to dorothy it sounded like no language at all why she cried in dismay its the scarecrow but i cant understand a word hes saying i think he must be talking turkey droned the comfortable camel or donkey i knew a donkey once a very uncomfortable party i i doubt its donkey put in the dromedary importantly but no one paid any attention to the two beasts for happy toko had at last dragged himself out of the fountain and set fifteen lanterns glowing oh gasped dorothy as the magnificent silver throne room was flooded with light where are we the scarecrow had picked himself up and with outstretched arms came running toward her talking a perfect niagara of silver islandish have you forgotten your ozish so soon rumbled the cowardly lion reproachfully as dorothy flung her arms around the scarecrow the scarecrow seeing the cowardly lion for the first time fairly fell upon his neck then he brushed his clumsy hand across his forehead wasnt i talking ozish he asked in a puzzled voice oh now you are exclaimed dorothy and sure enough the scarecrow was talking plain ozish again which i dont mind telling you is also plain english the knight had been watching this little reunion with hardly repressed emotion advancing hastily he dropped on one knee my good sword and lance are ever at thy service my lord scarecrow he exclaimed feelingly who is this impulsive person gulped the scarecrow staring in undisguised astonishment at the kneeling figure of the sir hokus of pokes hes my knight errant and hes taken such good care of me explained dorothy eagerly splendid fellow hissed the cowardly lion in the scarecrows other painted ear if he does talk odds and ends any friend of little dorothys is my friend said the scarecrow shaking hands with sir hokus warmly but what i want to know is how you all got here first tell us where we are begged the little girl for the scarecrows silver hat and queue filled her with alarm you are on the silver island said the scarecrow slowly and i am the emperor or his goodfornothing spirit and tomorrow the scarecrow glared around wildly tomorrow ill be eightyfive going on eightysix his voice broke and ended in a barely controlled sob doubt that drawled the doubtful dromedary sleepily eightyfive years old gasped dorothy why no one in oz grows any older we are no longer in oz the scarecrow shook his head sadly then fixing the group with a puzzled stare he exclaimed but how did you get here on a wish said the knight in a hollow voice yes said dorothy weve been hunting you all over oz and at last we came to wish way and i said i wish we were all with the scarecrow just like that and next minute we fell and fell and fell and fell wheezed the comfortable camel and fell and fell and fell and fell droned the dromedary and here you are finished the scarecrow hastily for the dromedary showed signs of going on forever now tell us every single thing that has happened to you demanded dorothy eagerly happy toko had recognized dorothy and the cowardly lion from the scarecrows description and he now approached with an arm full of cushions these he set in a circle on the floor with one for the scarecrow in the center and with a warning finger on his lips placed himself behind his master tappy is right exclaimed the scarecrow we must be as quiet as possible for a great danger hangs over me without more ado he told them of his amazing fall down the beanstalk of his adventures on silver island of his sons and grandsons and the gheewizards elixir which would turn him from a lively scarecrow into an old old emperor all that i have told you he told dorothy up to the very point where his eldest son had bound him to the bean pole and tied up poor faithful happy toko happy it seems had at last managed to free himself and they were about to make their escape when dorothy and her party had fallen into the throne room the comfortable camel and doubtful dromedary listened politely at first but worn out by their exciting adventures fell asleep in the middle of the story nothing could have exceeded dorothys dismay to learn that the jolly scarecrow of oz whom she had discovered herself was in reality chang wang woe emperor of silver island oh this spoils everything wailed the little girl the thought of oz without the scarecrow was unthinkable it spoils everything we were going to adopt you and be your truly family werent we the cowardly lion nodded i was going to be your cousin he mumbled in a choked voice but now that you have a family of your own the lion miserably slunk down beside dorothy sir hokus looked fierce and rattled his sword but he could think of nothing that would help them out of their trouble tomorrow there wont be any scarecrow in oz wailed dorothy oh dear oh dear and the little girl began to cry as if her heart would break stop stop begged the scarecrow while sir hokus awkwardly patted dorothy on the back id rather have you for my family any day i dont care a kinkajou for being emperor and as for my sons they are unnatural villains who make my life miserable by telling me how old i am just like a poem i once read said dorothy brightening up you are old father william the young man said and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is right thats it thats it exactly exclaimed the scarecrow as dorothy finished repeating the verse you are old father scarecrow thats all i hear i did stand on my head too and dorothy i cant seem to get used to being a grandparent added the scarecrow in a melancholy voice its turning my straws gray he plucked several from his chest and held them out to her why those little villains dont even believe in oz its not on the map old grandpapapapapah he mumbled imitating the tones of his little grandsons so cleverly that dorothy laughed in spite of herself this is what becomes of pride the scarecrow extended his hands expressively most people who hunt up their family trees are in for a fall and ive had mine but who do you want to be asked the knight gravely a scarecrow in oz or the er emperor that you were i dont care who i were in his excitement the scarecrow lost his grammar completely i want to be who i am i want to be myself but which one asked the cowardly lion who was still a bit confused why my best self of course said the scarecrow with a bright smile the sight of his old friends had quite restored his cheerfulness ive been here long enough to know that i am a better scarecrow than an emperor why how simple it is sighed dorothy contentedly professor wogglebug was all wrong its not what you were but what you are its being yourself that counts by my halidom the little maid is right said sir hokus slapping his knee in delight let your gheewizard but try his transformations out on him but what says yon honest henchman happy toko although he understood no word of the conversation had been watching the discussion with great interest he had been trying to attract the scarecrows attention for some time but the knight was the only one who had noticed him what is it tappy asked the scarecrow dropping easily back into silver islandish honored master the dawn approaches and with it the royal princes and the grand gheewizard and your bride happy paused significantly the scarecrow shuddered lets go back to oz said the cowardly lion uneasily the scarecrow was feeling in the pocket of his old munchkin suit which he always wore under his robes of state here said he giving a little pill to happy toko its one of professor wogglebugs language pills he exclaimed to dorothy and will enable him to speak and understand ozish happy swallowed the pill gravely greetings honorable ozites he said politely as soon as the pill was down dorothy clapped her hands in delight for it was so comfortable to have him speak their own language i could never have stood it here without tappy oko the scarecrow looked fondly at his imperial punster queer name he has rumbled the cowardly lion looking at happy toko as if he had thoughts of eating him methinks he should be knighted rumbled sir hokus beaming on the little silverman rise sir pudding the sun will do that in a minute or more and then then we shall all be thrown into prison wailed happy toko dismally we were going to escape in a small boat explained the scarecrow but it was not necessary for him to finish a boat large enough to hold dorothy the cowardly lion the scarecrow happy toko the camel and the dromedary could not very well be launched in secret oh dear sighed dorothy if id only wished you and all of us back in the emerald city you wished very well lady dot said the knight when i think of what i was going to wish for what were you going to wish hokus asked the cowardly lion curiously for a dragon faltered the knight looking terribly ashamed a dragon gasped dorothy why what good would that have done us wait interrupted the scarecrow i have thought of something why not climb my family tree it is a long long way but at the top lies oz grammercy a pretty plan exclaimed sir hokus peering up at the bean pole wouldnt that be social climbing chuckled happy toko recovering his spirits with a bound the cowardly lion said nothing but heaved a mighty sigh which no one heard for they were all running toward the bean pole it was a good family tree to climb sure enough for there were handy little notches in the stalk you go first sir hokus helped dorothy up when she had gone a few steps the scarecrow holding his robes carefully followed then honest happy toko ill go last said sir hokus bravely and had just set his foot on the first notch when a hoarse scream rang through the hall chapter planning to fly from the silver island it was the comfortable camel waking suddenly he found himself deserted oh where is my dear karwan bashi he roared dismally come back come back hush up cant you rumbled the cowardly lion do you want dorothy and everybody to be thrown into prison on our account we cant climb the bean pole and will have to wait here and face it out but how uncomfortable wailed the camel he began to sob heavily dorothy although highest up the bean pole heard all of this distinctly oh she cried remorsefully we cant desert the cowardly lion like this i never thought about him spoken like the dear little maid you are said the knight the good beast never reminded us of it either theres bravery for you let us descend at once ill not move a step without the cowardly lion in his agitation the scarecrow lost his balance and fell headlong to the ground knocking sir hokuss helmet terribly askew as he passed the others made haste to follow him and were soon gathered gravely at the foot of the beanstalk ill have to think of some other plan said the scarecrow looking nervously at the sky which showed through the long windows the first streaks of dawn the comfortable camel controlled its sobs with difficulty and pressed as close to sir hokus as it could the doubtful dromedary was still asleep it would have been a terrible climb mused the scarecrow thinking of his long long fall down the pole ah i have it what asked dorothy anxiously i wonder i did not think of it before ah my brains are working better i will abdicate exclaimed the scarecrow triumphantly i will abdicate make a farewell speech and return with you to oz what if they refuse to let your radiant highness go put in happy toko tremulously what if the gheewizard should work his magic before you finished your speech then well make a dash for it said sir hokus twirling his sword recklessly im with you said the cowardly lion huskily but you neednt have come back for me all right said the scarecrow cheerfully and now that everythings settled so nicely we might as well enjoy the little time left put out the lights tappy dorothy and i will sit on the throne and the rest of you come as close as possible sir hokus wakened the doubtful dromedary and pulled and tugged it across the hall where it immediately fell down asleep again the comfortable camel ambled about eating the flowers out of the vases the cowardly lion had placed himself at dorothys feet and sir hokus and happy toko seated themselves upon the first step of the gorgeous silver throne then while they waited for morning dorothy told the scarecrow all about the pokes and fix city and the scarecrow told once again of his victory over the king of the golden islands where is the magic fan now asked dorothy at the end of the story the scarecrow smiled broadly and feeling in a deep pocket brought out the little fan and also the parasol he had plucked from the beanstalk do you know he said smiling so much has happened i havent thought of them since the battle i was saving them for you dorothy for me exclaimed the little girl in delight let me see them the scarecrow handed them over obligingly but happy toko trembled so violently that he rolled down the steps of the throne i beg of you he scrambled to his feet and held up his hands in terror i beg of you dont open that fan shes used to magic tappy you neednt worry said the scarecrow easily of course i am said dorothy with great dignity but thisll be mighty useful if anyone tries to conquer oz again we can just fan em away dorothy pulled a hair from the cowardly lions mane and winding it around the little fan put it carefully in the pocket of her dress the parasol she hung by its ribbon to her arm perhaps ozma will look in the magic picture and wish us all back again said the little girl after they had sat for a time in silence i doubt it the dromedary stirred and mumbled in its sleep singular beast that ejaculated the knight doubting never gets one anywhere hush warned the scarecrow i hear footsteps come here sir hokus called hoarsely to the camel who was eating a paper lantern at the other end of the room the beast ran awkwardly over to the throne and swallowing the lantern with a convulsive gulp settled down beside the dromedary whatever happens we must stick together said the knight emphatically ah dorothy held fast to the scarecrow with one hand and to the throne with the other the sun had risen at last there was a loud crash of drums and trumpets a rush of feet and into the hall marched the most splendid company dorothy had seen in her whole life of adventures chapter dorothy upsets the ceremony of the island a caravan whistled the comfortable camel lurching to his feet how nice i doubt that the dromedarys eyes flew open and he stared sleepily at the magnificent procession of silver islanders first came the musicians playing their shining silver trumpets and flutes the grand chew chew and general mugwump followed attired in brilliant silk robes of state then came the three princes glittering with jeweled chains and medals and the fifteen little princes like so many silver butterflies in their satin kimonas next appeared a palanquin bearing the veiled princess orange blossom followed by a whole company of splendid courtiers and after them as many of the everyday silver islanders as the hall would hold there was a moment of silence then the whole assemblage contrary to the scarecrows edict fell upon their faces my exclaimed dorothy impressed in spite of herself are you sure you want to give up all this great emperor beautiful as the sun wise as the stars and radiant as the clouds the ceremony of restoration is about to begin quavered the grand chew chew rising slowly then he paused for he was suddenly confused by the strange company around the scarecrows throne treachery hissed the eldest prince to the others we left him tied to the bean pole ancient papa scarecrow needs watching who are these curious objects he has gathered about him pray now by some magic which even i cannot explain the people from oz found they could understand all that was being said when dorothy heard herself called an object and saw the wicked faces of the three princes and the stupid little grandsons she no longer wondered at the scarecrows decision the scarecrow himself bowed calmly first said he cheerfully let me introduce my friends and visitors from oz the silver islanders who really loved the scarecrow bowed politely as he called out the names of dorothy and the others but the three silver princes scowled and whispered indignantly among themselves i am growing very wroth choked sir hokus to the cowardly lion let the ceremony proceed called the eldest prince harshly before the scarecrow had finished his introductions let the proper body of his serene highness be immediately restored way for the grand gheewizard way for the grand gheewizard one moment put in the scarecrow in a dignified voice i have something to say the silver islanders clapped loudly at this and dorothy felt a bit reassured perhaps they would listen to reason after all and let the scarecrow depart peacefully how they were ever to escape if they didnt the little girl could not see my dear children began the scarecrow in his jolly voice nothing could have been more wonderful than my return to this lovely island but in the years i have been away from you i have changed very much and i find i no longer care for being emperor so with your kind permission i will keep the excellent body i now have and will abdicate in favor of my eldest son and return with my friends to oz for in oz i really belong a dead silence followed the scarecrows speech then perfect pandemonium no no you are a good emperor we will not let you go shrieked the people you are our honorable little father the prince shall be emperor after you have peacefully returned to your ancestors but not now no no we will not have it i feared this quavered happy toko it is not the emperor but the scarecrow who speaks shrilled the grand chew chew craftily he knows not what he says but after the transformation ah you shall see the company calmed down at this let the ceremony proceed way for the grand gheewizard they cried exultantly chew chew wailed the scarecrow youre off the track but it was too late no one would listen ill have to think of something else muttered the scarecrow sinking dejectedly back on his throne oh shuddered dorothy clutching the scarecrow here he comes way for the grand gheewizard way for the grand gheewizard the crowd parted hobbling toward the throne came the ugly little gheewizard of the silver island holding a large silver vase high above his head and after him when sir hokus caught a glimpse of what came after he leaped clean over the comfortable camel uds daggers roared the knight at last he rushed forward violently there was a sharp thrust of his good sword then an explosion like twenty giant firecrackers in one and the room became quite black with smoke before anyone realized what had happened sir hokus was back dragging something after him and shouting exuberantly a dragon i have slain a dragon what happiness everyone was coughing and spluttering from the smoke but as it cleared dorothy saw that it was indeed a dragon sir hokus had slain the rheumatic dragon of the old gheewizard himself why didnt you get the wizard rumbled the cowardly lion angrily must have exploded said the comfortable camel sniffing the skin daintily treason yelled the three princes while the grand gheewizard flung himself on the stone floor and began tearing strand after strand from his silver pigtail he has killed the little joy of my hearth screeched the old man i will turn him to a cat a miserable yellow cat and roast him for dinner oh cried dorothy looking at sir hokus sorrowfully how could you the slaying of the dragon had thrown the whole hall into utmost confusion sir hokus turned a little pale under his armor but faced the angry mob without flinching oh my dear karwan bashi this is so uncomfortable wheezed the camel glancing back of him with frightened eyes theres a shiny dagger in my lefthand saddlesack i doubt very much whether they would like it coughed the doubtful dromedary pressing close to the knight on with the ceremony cried the eldest prince seeing that the excitement was giving the scarecrows friends too much time to think the son of an iron pot shall be punished later thats right cried a voice from the crowd let the emperor be restored i guess its all over gulped the scarecrow give my love to ozma and tell her i tried to come back in helpless terror the little company watched the gheewizard approach one could fight real enemies but magic even sir hokus brave as he was felt that nothing could be done one move and you shall be so many prunes shrilled the angry old man fixing the people from oz with his wicked little eyes the great room was so still you could have heard a pin drop even the doubtful dromedary had not the heart to doubt the wizards power but stood rigid as a statue the wizard advanced slowly holding the sealed vase carefully over his head the poor scarecrow regarded it with gloomy fascination one more moment and he would be an old old silverman better to be lost forever he held convulsively to dorothy as for dorothy herself she was trembling with fright and grief when the grand gheewizard raised the vase higher and higher and made ready to hurl it at the scarecrow disregarding his dire threat she gave a shrill scream and threw up both hands great grandmothers gasped the scarecrow jumping to his feet as dorothy had thrown up her arms the little parasol swinging at her wrist had jerked open up up up and out through the broken skylight in the roof sailed the little princess of oz the grand gheewizard startled as anyone failed to throw the vase every neck was craned upward and everyone was gasping with astonishment the oldest prince as usual was the first to recover dont stand staring like an idiot nows your chance he hissed angrily in the gheewizards ear i didnt come here to be harried and hurried by foreigners sobbed the little man how is one to work magic when interrupted every other minute i want my little dragon oh come on now just throw it ill get you another dragon begged the prince his hands trembling with excitement in the face of this new disaster the scarecrow had forgotten all about the gheewizard he and the cowardly lion and sir hokus were running distractedly around the great throne trying to think up a way to rescue dorothy as for the doubtful dromedary he was doubting everything in a loud bitter voice while the comfortable camel fairly snorted with sorrow there nows your chance whispered the prince the scarecrow with his back to the crowd was gesturing frantically taking a firm hold on the neck of the vase and with a long incantation which there is no use at all in repeating the gheewizard flung the bottle straight at the scarecrows head but scarcely had it left his hand before there was a flash and a flutter and down came dorothy and the magic parasol right on top of the vase zip the vase flew in quite another direction and next minute had burst over the luckless heads of the three plotting princes while dorothy floated gently to earth sir hokus embraced the scarecrow and the scarecrow hugged the cowardly lion and i dont wonder at all for no sooner had the magic elixir touched the princes than two of them became silver pigs and the eldest a weasel they had been turned to their true shapes instead of the scarecrow and while the company hopped about in alarm they ran squealing from the hall and disappeared in the gardens seize the gheewizard and take him to his cave ordered the scarecrow asserting his authority for the first time since the proceedings has started he had noticed the old man making queer signs and passes toward sir hokus a dozen took hold of the struggling gheewizard and hurried him out of the hall sir hokus at the request of the scarecrow clapped his iron gauntlets for silence you will agree with me im sure said the scarecrow in a slightly unsteady voice that magic is a serious matter to meddle with if you will all return quietly to your homes i will try to find a way out of our difficulties the silver islanders listened respectfully and after a little arguing among themselves backed out of the throne room to tell the truth they were anxious to spread abroad the tale of the mornings happenings princess orange blossom however refused to depart magic or no magic she had come to marry the emperor and she would not leave till the ceremony had been performed but my dear old lady would you wish to marry a scarecrow coaxed the emperor all men are scarecrows snapped the princess sourly then why marry at all rumbled the cowardly lion making a playful leap at her palanquin this was too much the princess swooned on the spot and the scarecrow taking advantage of her unconscious condition ordered her chair bearers to carry her away as far and as fast as they could run now said the scarecrow when the last of the company had disappeared let us talk this over chapter the escape from the silver island well gasped dorothy fanning herself with her hat i never was so sprised in my life nor i exclaimed the scarecrow the grand gheewizard will be suing you for parassault and battery but how did it happen well began dorothy as soon as the parasol opened i flew up so fast that i could hardly breathe then after id gone ever so far it came to me that if the parasol went up when it was up it would come down when it was down i couldnt leave you all in such a fix so i closed it and came down finished the scarecrow with a wave of his hand you always do the right thing in the right place my dear it was lucky i hit the vase wasnt it sighed dorothy but im rather sorry about the princes served em right growled the cowardly lion theyll make very good pigs but whos to rule the island demanded sir hokus turning his gaze reluctantly from the smoking dragonskin this will require thought said the scarecrow pensively let us all think i doubt that i can ever think again the doubtful dromedary wagged his head from side to side in a dazed fashion just leave it to our dear karwan bashi the comfortable camel nodded complacently at the knight and began plucking sly wisps from the scarecrows boot top for a short time there was absolute silence then sir hokus who had been thinking tremendously with his elbows on his knees burst out why not sir pudding here why not this honest punster who but happy toko deserves the throne the very person cried the scarecrow clasping his yellow gloves and taking off his silver hat he set it impulsively upon the head of the fat little silver islander hell make a lovely emperor said dorothy hes so kindhearted and jolly and now the scarecrow can abdicate and come home to oz they all looked triumphantly at the imperial punster but happy toko snatching off the royal hat burst into tears dont leave me behind amiable master he sobbed disconsolately oh how i shall miss you but dont you see coaxed dorothy the scarecrow needs you here more than anyplace and think of all the fine clothes you will have and how rich you will be and tappy my dear boy said the scarecrow putting his arm around happy toko you might not like oz any more than i like silver island then think if everything goes well you can visit me just as one emperor visits another and you wont forget me sniffed happy beginning to like the idea of being emperor never cried the scarecrow with an impressive wave and if anything goes wrong will you help me out questioned happy uncertainly well look in the magic picture of oz every month declared dorothy and if you need us well surely find some way to help you an you ever require a trusty sword odds bodikins exclaimed sir hokus pressing tappys hand im your man all right dear master happy slowly picked up the imperial hat and set it sideways on his head ill do my best i dont doubt it at all said the doubtful dromedary to everyones surprise three cheers for the emperor long live the emperor of the silver island rumbled the cowardly lion and everybody from oz even the camel and dromedary fell upon their knees before happy toko you may have my bride too tappy chuckled the scarecrow with a wink at dorothy and tappy he asked sobering suddenly will you have my grandsons brought up like real children just as soon as i return i shall send them all the books of oz happy bowed too confused and excited for speech now said the scarecrow seizing dorothys hand i can return to oz with an easy mind doubt that said the doubtful dromedary you neednt announced dorothy ive thought it all out in a few short sentences she outlined her plan bravo roared the cowardly lion and now the little party began in real earnest the preparation for the journey back to oz first happy brought them a delicious luncheon with plenty of twigs and hay for the camel and dromedary and meat for the cowardly lion the scarecrow packed into the camels sacks a few little souvenirs for the people of oz then they dressed happy toko in the scarecrows most splendid robe and ordered him to sit upon the throne next the scarecrow rang for one of the palace servants and ordered the people of the silver islands to assemble in the hall presently the silvermen began to come trooping in packing the great throne room until it could hold no more everyone was chattering excitedly it was quite a different company that greeted them the scarecrow cheerful and witty in his old munchkin suit dorothy and sir hokus smiling happily and the three animal members of the party fairly blinking with contentment this said the scarecrow pleasantly when everyone was quiet is your new emperor to whom i ask you to pledge allegiance he waved proudly in the direction of happy toko who to tell the truth presented a truly royal appearance it is not possible for me to remain with you but i shall always watch over this delightful island and with the magic fan vanquish all its enemies and punish all offenders happy toko bowed to his subjects the silver islanders exchanged startled glances then as the scarecrow carelessly lifted the fan they fell prostrate to the earth ah said the scarecrow with a broad wink at happy this is delightful you agree with me i see now then three cheers for tappy oko imperial emperor of the silver island the cheers were given with a will and happy in acknowledgement made a speech that has since been written into the royal book of state as a masterpiece of eloquence having arranged affairs so satisfactorily the scarecrow embraced happy toko with deep emotion dorothy and sir hokus shook hands with him and wished him every success and happiness then the little party from oz walked deliberately to the bean pole in the center of the hall the silver islanders were still a bit dazed by the turn affairs had taken and stared in astonishment as the scarecrow and sir hokus fastened thick ropes around the cowardly lion the doubtful dromedary and the comfortable camel similar ropes they tied around their own waists and dorothys and the ends of all were fastened securely to the handle of the magic parasol which dorothy held carefully goodbye everybody called the little girl suddenly opening the parasol goodbye cried the genial scarecrow waving his hand too stupefied for speech the assemblage gaped with amazement as the party floated gently upward up up and out of sight whirled the entire party chapter the flight of the parasol holding the handle of the parasol dorothy steered it with all the skill of an aviator and in several minutes after their start the party had entered the deep black passage down which the scarecrow had fallen each one of the adventurers was fastened to the parasol with ropes of different length so that none of them bumped together but even with all the care in the world it was not possible to keep them from bumping the sides of the tube the comfortable camel grunted plaintively from time to time and dorothy could hear the doubtful dromedary complaining bitterly in the darkness it was pitch dark but by keeping one hand in touch with the bean pole dorothy managed to hold the parasol in the center how long will it take she called breathlessly to the scarecrow who was dangling just below hours wheezed the scarecrow holding fast to his hat i hope none of the parties on this line hear us he added nervously thinking of the middlings what recks it blustered sir hokus hast forgotten my trusty sword but his words were completely drowned in the rattle of his armor hush warned the scarecrow or well be pulled in so for almost an hour they flew up the dark chimneylike tube with only an occasional groan as one or another scraped against the rough sides of the passage then before they knew what was happening the parasol crashed into something half closed and the whole party started to fall head over heels over helmets o gasped dorothy turning a complete somersault catch hold of the bean pole somebody put up the parasol shrieked the scarecrow just then dorothy finding herself right side up grasped the pole herself and snapped the parasol wide open up up up they soared again faster than ever were flying up much faster than i fell down we must be at the top called the scarecrow hoarsely and somebody has closed the opening chapter safe at last in the land of oz must we keep bumping until we bump through panted dorothy anxiously no by my hilts roared sir hokus and setting his foot in a notch of the beanstalk he cut with his sword the rope that bound him to the parasol put the parasol down half way and ill climb ahead and cut an opening with great difficulty dorothy partially lowered the parasol and instantly their speed diminished indeed they barely moved at all and the knight had soon passed them on his climb to the top are you there rumbled the cowardly lion anxiously a great clod of earth landed on his head filling his eyes and mouth with mud ugh roared the lion its getting light its getting light screamed dorothy and in her excitement snapped the parasol up sir hokus having cut with his sword a large circular hole in the thin crust of earth covering the tube was about to step out when the parasol hurling up from below caught him neatly on its top and out burst the whole party and sailed up almost to the clouds welcome to oz cried dorothy looking down happily on the dear familiar munchkin landscape home at last exulted the scarecrow wafting a kiss downward lets get down to earth before we knock the sun into a cocked hat gasped the cowardly lion for dorothy in her excitement had forgotten to lower the parasol now the little girl lowered the parasol carefully at first then faster and faster and finally shut it altogether sir hokus took a high dive from the top down tumbled the others over and over but fortunately for all there was a great haystack below and upon this they landed in a jumbled heap close to the magic bean pole as it happened there was no one in sight up they jumped in a trice and while the comfortable camel and doubtful dromedary munched contentedly at the hay sir hokus and the scarecrow placed some loose boards over the opening around the bean pole and covered them with dirt and cornstalks i will get ozma to close it properly with the magic belt said the scarecrow gravely it wouldnt do to have people sliding down my family tree and scaring poor tappy as for me i shall never leave oz again i hope not growled the cowardly lion tenderly examining his scratched hide but if you hadnt id never have had such lovely adventures or found sir hokus and the comfortable camel and doubtful dromedary said dorothy and what a lot i have to tell ozma lets go straight to the emerald city its quite a journey explained the scarecrow to sir hokus who was cleaning off his armor with a handful of straw i go where lady dot goes replied the knight smiling affectionately at the little girl and straightening the ragged hair ribbon which he still wore on his arm dont forget me dear karwan bashi wheezed the comfortable camel putting his head on the knights shoulder youre a sentimental dunce camy i doubt whether theyll take us at all the doubtful dromedary looked wistfully at dorothy go to now cried sir hokus putting an arm around each neck youre just like two of the family it will be very comfortable to go to now sighed the camel were all a big jolly family here said the scarecrow smiling brightly and oz is the friendliest country in the world right said the cowardly lion but lets get started he stretched his tired muscles and began limping stiffly toward the yellow brick road wait cried dorothy have you forgotten the parasol i wish i could groaned the cowardly lion rolling his eyes sir hokus with folded arms was gazing regretfully at the bean pole it has been a brave quest he sighed but now i take it our adventures are over absently the knight felt in his boottop and drawing out a small red bean popped it into his mouth just before reaching the top of the tube he had pulled a handful of them from the beanstalk but the others had fallen out when he dove into the hay shall we use the parasol again lady dot he asked still staring pensively at the bean pole shall he got no farther nor did dorothy answer his question instead she gave a loud scream and clutched the scarecrows arm the scarecrow taken by surprise fell over backward and the comfortable camel raising his head inquiringly gave a bellow of terror from the knights shoulders a green branch had sprung and while the company gazed in roundeyed amazement it stretched toward the bean pole attached itself firmly and then shot straight up into the air the knight kicking and struggling on the end in another second he was out of sight come back come back screamed the comfortable camel running around distractedly i doubt well ever see him again groaned the doubtful dromedary craning his neck upward do something do something begged dorothy at which the scarecrow jumped up and dashed toward the little farmhouse ill get an ax he called over his shoulder and chop down the bean pole no dont do that roared the cowardly lion starting after him do you want to break him to pieces oh oh cant you think of something else cried dorothy and hurry or hell be up to the moon the scarecrow put both hands to his head and stared around wildly then with a triumphant wave of his hat declared himself ready to act the parasol cried the late emperor of silver island quick dorothy put up the parasol snatching the parasol which lay at the foot of the bean pole dorothy snapped it open and the scarecrow just had time to make a flying leap and seize the handle before it soared upward and in a trice they too had disappeared doubty doubty wailed the comfortable camel crowding up to his humpbacked friend were having a pack of trouble my knees are all atremble now dont you worry advised the cowardly lion sitting down resignedly im frightened myself but thats because im so cowardly queer things happen in oz but they usually turn out all right why hokus is just growing up with the country thats all just growing up with the country doubt that sniffed the doubtful dromedary faintly he was grown up in the beginning but think of the scarecrows brains you leave things to the scarecrow but it was no use both beasts began to roar dismally i dont want a plant i want my karwan bashi sobbed the comfortable camel brokenheartedly well dont drown me begged the cowardly lion moving out of the way of the camels tears say whats that draft what indeed in the trees overhead a very cyclone whistled and before the three had even time to catch their breath they were blown high into the air and the next instant were hurtling toward the emerald city like three furry cannonballs faster and faster chapter homeward bound to the emerald city dorothy and the scarecrow clinging fast to the magic parasol had followed the knight almost to the clouds at first it looked as if they would never catch up with him so swiftly was the branch growing but it was not long before the little umbrella began to gain and in several minutes more they were beside sir hokus himself beshrew me now gasped the knight stretching out his hand toward dorothy canst stop this reckless plant give me your sword commanded the scarecrow and ill cut you off dorothy with great difficulty kept the parasol close to the knight while the scarecrow reached for the sword but sir hokus backed away in alarm tis part of me an you cut it off i will be cut off too tis rooted in my back he puffed what shall we do cried dorothy in distress maybe if we take hold of his hands we can keep him from going any higher the scarecrow jamming down his hat so it wouldnt blow off nodded approvingly and each holding the parasol with one hand gave the other to the knight and when dorothy pointed the parasol down to her great delight sir hokus came also the thin green branch growing just about as fast as they moved just then the little fan which had been rolling around merrily in dorothys pocket slipped out and fell straight down toward the three unsuspecting beasts below draft no wonder but dorothy never missed it and quite unconscious of such a calamity anxiously talked over the knights predicament with the scarecrow they both decided that the best plan was to fly straight to the emerald city and have ozma release the knight from the enchanted beanstalk im sorry you got tangled up in my family tree old fellow said the scarecrow after they had flown some time in silence but this makes us relations doesnt it he winked broadly at the knight so it does said sir hokus jovially im a branch of your family now yet methinks i should not have swallowed that bean bean questioned dorothy what bean the knight carefully explained how he had plucked a handful of red beans from the beanstalk just before reaching the top of the tube and how he had eaten one so thats what started you growing exclaimed dorothy in surprise alas yes admitted the knight ive never felt more grownup in my life he finished solemnly an adventurous country this oz i should say it was chuckled the scarecrow but isnt it almost time we were reaching the emerald city dorothy i think im going in the right direction answered the little girl but ill fly a little lower to be sure not too fast not too fast warned sir hokus looking nervously over his shoulder at his long wriggling stem theres ozmas palace cried the scarecrow all at once and theres ozma screamed dorothy peering down delightedly and scraps and tiktok and everybody she pointed the parasol straight down when a sharp tug from sir hokus jerked them all back they were going faster than the poor knight was growing so dorothy lowered the parasol half way and slowly they floated toward the earth landing gently in one of the flower beds of ozmas lovely garden come along and meet the folks said the scarecrow as dorothy closed the parasol but sir hokus clutched him in alarm hold hold gasped the knight ive stopped growing but if you leave me ill shoot up into the air again the scarecrow and dorothy looked at each other in dismay sure enough the knight had stopped growing and it was all they could do to hold him down to earth for the stubborn branch of beanstalk was trying to straighten up they had fallen quite a distance from the palace itself and all the people of oz had their backs turned so had not seen their singular arrival hello called the scarecrow loudly then help help as the knight jerked him twice into the air but ozma trot jack pumpkinhead and all the rest were staring upward and talking so busily among themselves that they did not hear either dorothys or the scarecrows cries first one then the other was snatched off his feet and although sir hokus with tears in his eyes begged them to leave him to his fate they held on with all their might just as it looked as if they all three would fly into the air again the little wizard of oz happened to turn around look look he cried tugging ozmas sleeve why its dorothy gasped ozma rubbing her eyes its dorothy and help help screamed the scarecrow waving one arm wildly without waiting another second all the celebrities of oz came running toward the three adventurers somebody heavy come take hold puffed dorothy out of breath with her efforts to keep sir hokus on the ground the ozites seeing that help was needed at once suppressed their curiosity im heavy said tiktok solemnly clasping the knights arm the tin woodman seized his other hand and dorothy sank down exhausted on the grass princess ozma pressed forward what does it all mean where did you come from asked the little queen of oz staring in amazement at the strange spectacle before her and who is this medieval person asked professor wogglebug pushing forward importantly he had returned to the palace to collect more data for the royal book of oz he doesnt look evil to me giggled scraps dancing up to sir hokus her suspender button eyes snapping with fun he isnt said dorothy indignantly for sir hokus was too shaken about to answer hes my knight errant ah i see replied professor wogglebug a case of when knighthood was in flower and would you believe it the beanstalk at that minute burst into a perfect shower of red blossoms that came tumbling down over everyone before they had recovered from their surprise the branch snapped off close to the knights armor and tiktok the tin woodman and sir hokus rolled over in a heap the branch itself whistled through the air and disappeared oh cried dorothy hugging the knight impulsively im so glad are you all right asked the scarecrow anxiously good as ever announced sir hokus and indeed all traces of the magic stalk had disappeared from his shoulders dorothy cried ozma again what does it all mean merely that i slid down my family tree and that dorothy and this knight rescued me said the scarecrow calmly and hes a real royalty so there cried dorothy with a wave at the scarecrow and making a little face at professor wogglebug meet his supreme highness chang wang woe of silver island who had abdicated his throne and returned to be a plain scarecrow in oz then as the eminent educator of oz stood gaping at the scarecrow oh ozma ive so much to tell you begin begin cried the little wizard for everythings mighty mysterious first the cowardly lion and two unknown beasts shoot through the air and stop just outside the thirdstory windows and there they hang although ive tried all my magic to get them down then you and the scarecrow drop in with a strange knight oh the poor cowardly lion gasped dorothy as the wizard finished speaking the magic fan she felt hurriedly in her pocket its gone it must have slipped out of your pocket and blown them here and theyll never come down till that fan is closed cried the scarecrow in an agitated voice all of this was greek to ozma and the others but when dorothy begged the little queen to send for her magic belt she did it without question this belt dorothy had captured from the gnome king and it enabled the wearer to wish people and objects wherever one wanted them i wish the magic fan to close and to come safely back to me said dorothy as soon as she had clasped the belt around her waist no sooner were the words out before there was a loud crash and a series of roars and groans everybody started on a run for the palace sir hokus ahead of all the rest the fan had mysteriously returned to dorothys pocket the three animals had fallen into a huge cluster of rose bushes and though badly scratched and frightened were really unhurt i doubt that ill like oz quavered the doubtful dromedary lurching toward sir hokus you might have been more careful of that fan growled the cowardly lion reproachfully plucking thorns from his hide the comfortable camel was so overjoyed to see the knight that he rested his head on sir hokuss shoulder and began weeping down his armor and now that their adventures seemed really over what explanations were to be made sitting on the top step of the palace with all of them around her dorothy told the whole wonderful story of the scarecrows family tree when her breath gave out the scarecrow took up the tale himself and as they all realized how nearly they had lost their jolly comrade many of the party shed real tears indeed nick chopper hugged the scarecrow till there was not a whole straw in his body never leave us again begged ozma and the scarecrow crossing nick choppers heart he had none of his own promised that he never would and what a welcome they gave sir hokus the doubtful dromedary and the comfortable camel only professor wogglebug seemed disturbed during the strange recital he had grown quieter and quieter and finally with an embarrassed cough had excused himself and hurried into the palace he went directly to the study and seating himself at a desk opened a large book none other than the royal book of oz dipping an emerald pen in the ink he began a new chapter headed thus his imperial majesty the scarecrow late emperor and imperial sovereign of silver island then flipping over several pages to a chapter headed princess dorothy he wrote carefully at the end dorothy princess and royal discoverer of oz meanwhile below stairs the scarecrow was distributing his gifts there were silver chains for everyone in the palace and shining silver slippers for ozma betsy bobbin trot and dorothy and a bottle of silver polish for nick chopper dorothy presented ozma with the magic fan and parasol and they were safely put away by jellia jamb with the other magic treasures of oz next because they were all curious to see the scarecrows wonderful kingdom they hurried upstairs to look in the magic picture show us the emperor of silver island commanded ozma immediately the beautiful silver throne room appeared happy toko had removed his imperial hat and was standing on his head to the great delight of the whole court and a host of little silver islander boys were peeking in at the windows now doesnt that look cheerful asked the scarecrow delightedly i knew hed make a good emperor i wish we would hear what hes saying said dorothy oh do look at chew chew the grand chew chew was standing beside the throne scowling horribly i think i can arrange for you to hear muttered the wizard of oz and taking a queer magic instrument from his pocket he whispered aohbeeobbuy instantly they heard the jolly voice of happy toko singing oh shine his shoes of silver and brush his silver queue for i am but an emperor and hes the grand chew chew ozma laughed heartily as the picture faded away and so did the others indeed there was so much to ask and wonder about that it seemed as if they never would finish talking lets have a party an oldfashioned oz party proposed ozma when the excitement had calmed down a bit and an oldfashioned party it was with places for everybody and a special table for the cowardly lion the hungry tiger toto the glass cat the comfortable camel the doubtful dromedary and all the other dear creatures of that amazing kingdom sir hokus insisted upon stirring up a huge pasty for the occasion and there were songs speeches and cheers for everyone not forgetting the doubtful dromedary at the cheering he rose with an embarrassed jerk of his long neck in my lefthand saddlesack he said gruffly there is a quantity of silken shawls and jewels i doubt whether they are good enough but i would like dorothy and queen ozma to have them hear hear cried the scarecrow pounding on the table with his knife then everything grew quiet as ozma told how she with the help of glinda the good sorceress had stopped the war between the horners and hoppers when she had finished sir hokus sprang up impulsively i prithee lovely lady never trouble your royal head about wars again from now on i will do battle for you and little dorothy and oz and i will be your good knight every day at this the applause was tremendous ye good knight of oz full of courage and vim will do battle for us and well take care of him shouted scraps who was becoming more excited every minute ill lend you some of my polish for your armor old fellow said nick chopper as the knight sat down beaming with pleasure well said ozma with a smile when everyone had feasted and talked to hearts content is everybody happy i am cried the comfortable camel for here i am perfectly comfortable i am cried dorothy putting her arm around the scarecrow who sat next to her for i have found my old friend and made some new ones im happy cried the scarecrow waving his glass because there is no age in oz and i am still my old ozish self as for me said the knight i am happy for i have served a lady gone on a quest and slain a dragon ozma and oz forever
