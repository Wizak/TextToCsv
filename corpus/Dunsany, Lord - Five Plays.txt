beggars thahn mlan a thief oorander illanaun citizens akmos the dromedary men citizens etc the others scene the east the first act outside a city wall three beggars are seated upon the ground oogno these days are bad for beggary thahn they are bad ulf some evil has befallen the rich ones of this city they take no joy any longer in benevolence but are become sour and miserly at heart alas for them i sometimes sigh for them when i think of this oogno alas for them a miserly heart must be a sore affliction thahn a sore affliction indeed and bad for our calling oogno they have been thus for many months what thing has befallen them thahn some evil thing ulf there has been a comet come near to the earth of late and the earth has been parched and sultry so that the gods are drowsy and all those things that are divine in man such as benevolence drunkenness extravagance and song have faded and died and have not been replenished by the gods oogno it has indeed been sultry thahn i have seen the comet o nights ulf the gods are drowsy oogno if they awake not soon and make this city worthy again of our order i for one shall forsake the calling and buy a shop and sit at ease in the shade and barter for gain thahn you will keep a shop enter agmar and slag agmar though poorly dressed is tall imperious and older than ulf slag follows behind him agmar is this a beggar who speaks oogno yes master a poor beggar agmar how long has the calling of beggary existed oogno since the building of the first city master agmar and when has a beggar ever followed a trade when has he ever haggled and bartered and sat in a shop oogno why he has never done so agmar are you he that shall be first to forsake the calling oogno times are bad for the calling here thahn they are bad agmar so you would forsake the calling oogno the city is unworthy of our calling the gods are drowsy and all that is divine in man is dead to third beggar are not the gods drowsy ulf they are drowsy in their mountains away at marma the seven green idols are drowsy who is this that rebukes us thahn are you some great merchant master perhaps you will help a poor man that is starving slag my master a merchant no no he is no merchant my master is no merchant oogno i perceive that he is some lord in disguise the gods have woken and sent him to save us slag no no you do not know my master you do not know him thahn is he the soldans self that has come to rebuke us agmar i am a beggar and an old beggar slag there is none like my master no traveller has met with cunning like to his not even those that come from aethiopia ulf we make you welcome to our town upon which an evil has fallen the days being bad for beggary agmar let none who has known the mystery of roads or has felt the wind arising new in the morning or who has called forth out of the souls of men divine benevolence ever speak any more of any trade or of the miserable gains of shops and the trading men oogno i but spoke hastily the times being bad agmar i will put right the times slag there is nothing that my master cannot do agmar be silent and attend to me i do not know this city i have travelled from far having somewhat exhausted the city of ackara slag my master was three times knocked down and injured by carriages there once he was killed and seven times he was beaten and robbed and every time he was generously compensated he had nine diseases many of them mortal agmar be silent slag have you any thieves among the calling here ulf we have a few that we call thieves here master but they would scarcely seem thieves to you they are not good thieves agmar i shall need the best thief you have enter two citizens richly clad illanaun and oorander illanaun therefore we will send galleons to ardaspes oorander right to ardaspes through the silver gates agmar transfers the thick handle of his long staff to his left armpit he droops on to it and it supports his weight he is upright no longer his right arm hangs limp and useless he hobbles up to the citizens imploring alms illanaun i am sorry i cannot help you there have been too many beggars here and we must decline alms for the good of the town agmar i have come from far illanaun presently returns and gives agmar a coin exit illanaun agmar erect again walks back to the others agmar we shall need fine raiment let the thief start at once let it rather be green raiment beggar i will go and fetch the thief ulf we will dress ourselves as lords and impose upon the city oogno yes yes we will say we are ambassadors from a far land ulf and there will be good eating slag but you do not know my master now that you have suggested that we go as lords he will make a better suggestion he will suggest that we should go as kings ulf beggars as kings slag ay you do not know my master ulf what do you bid us do agmar you shall first come by the fine raiment in the manner i have mentioned ulf and what then master agmar why we shall go as gods beggars as gods agmar as gods know you the land through which i have lately come in my wanderings marma where the gods are carved from green stone in the mountains they sit all seven of them against the hills they sit there motionless and travellers worship them ulf yes yes we know those gods they are much reverenced here but they are drowsy and send us nothing beautiful agmar they are of green jade they sit crosslegged with their right elbows resting on their left hands the right forefinger pointed upward we will come into the city disguised from the direction of marma and we will claim to be these gods we must be seven as they are and when we sit we must sit crosslegged as they do with the right hand uplifted ulf this is a bad city in which to fall into the hands of oppressors for the judges lack amiability here as the merchants lack benevolence ever since the gods forgot them agmar in our ancient calling a man may sit at one street corner for fifty years doing the one thing and yet a day may come when it is well for him to rise up and do another thing while the timorous man starves ulf also it were not well to anger the gods agmar is not all life a beggary to the gods do they not see all men always begging of them and asking alms with incense and bells and subtle devices oogno yes all men indeed are beggars before the gods agmar does not the mighty soldan often sit by the agate altar in his royal temple as we sit at a street corner or by a palace gate ulf it is even so agmar then will the gods be glad when we follow the holy calling with new devices and with subtlety as they are glad when the priests sing a new song ulf yet i have a fear agmar go you into the city before us and let there be a prophecy there which saith that the gods who are carven from green rock in the mountain shall one day arise in marma and come here in the guise of men slag yes master shall i make the prophecy myself or shall it be found in some old document agmar let someone have seen it once in some rare document let it be spoken of in the market place slag it shall be spoken of master oogno this is our thief agmar ah he is a quick thief thief i could only procure you three green raiments master the city is not now well supplied with them moreover it is a very suspicious city and without shame for the baseness of its suspicions slag this is not thieving thief i could do no more master i have not practised thieving all my life agmar you have got something it may serve our purpose how long have you been thieving thief i first stole when i was ten slag when he was ten agmar we must tear them up and divide them amongst the seven bring me another beggar slag when my master was ten he had already to slip by night out of two cities oogno out of two cities slag in his native city they do not now know what became of the golden cup that stood in the lunar temple agmar yes into seven pieces ulf we will each wear a piece of it over our rags oogno yes yes we shall look fine agmar that is not the way we shall disguise ourselves oogno not cover our rags agmar no no the first who looked closely would say these are only beggars they have disguised themselves ulf what shall we do agmar each of the seven shall wear a piece of the green raiment underneath his rags and peradventure here and there a little shall show through and men shall say these seven have disguised themselves as beggars but we know not what they be slag hear my wise master oogno he is a beggar ulf he is an old beggar the second act the metropolitan hall of the city of kongros citizens etc enter the seven beggars with green silk under their rags oorander who are you and whence come you agmar who may say what we are or whence we come oorander what are these beggars and why do they come here agmar who said to you that we were beggars oorander why do these men come here agmar who said to you that we were men illanaun now by the moon agmar my sister illanaun what agmar my little sister slag our little sister the moon she comes to us at evenings away in the mountains of marma she trips over the mountains when she is young when she is young and slender she comes and dances before us and when she is old and unshapely she hobbles away from the hills agmar yet is she young again and forever nimble with youth yet she comes dancing back the years are not able to curb her nor to bring gray hairs to her brethren oorander this is not wonted illanaun it is not in accordance with custom akmos prophecy hath not thought it slag she comes to us new and nimble remembering olden loves oorander it were well that prophets should come and speak to us illanaun this hath not been in the past let prophets come let prophets speak to us of future things the beggars seat themselves upon the floor in the attitude of the seven gods of marma citizen i heard men speak today in the market place they speak of a prophecy read somewhere of old it says the seven gods shall come from marma in the guise of men illanaun is this a true prophecy oorander it is all the prophecy we have man without prophecy is like a sailor going by night over uncharted seas he knows not where are the rocks nor where the havens to the man on watch all things are black and the stars guide him not for he knows not what they are illanaun should we not investigate this prophecy oorander let us accept it it is as the small uncertain light of a lantern carried as it may be by a drunkard but along the shore of some haven let us be guided akmos it may be that they are but benevolent gods agmar there is no benevolence greater than our benevolence illanaun then we need do little they portend no danger to us agmar there is no anger greater than our anger oorander let us make sacrifices to them if they be gods akmos we humbly worship you if ye be gods illanaun you are mightier than all men and hold high rank among other gods and are lords of this our city and have the thunder as your plaything and the whirlwind and the eclipse and all the destinies of human tribes if ye be gods agmar let the pestilence not fall at once on this city as it had indeed designed to let not the earthquake swallow it all immediately up amid the howls of the thunder let not infuriated armies overwhelm those that escape if we be gods populace if we be gods oorander come let us sacrifice illanaun bring lambs akmos quick quick slag this god is a very divine god thahn he is no common god mlan indeed he has made us citizen he will not punish us master none of the gods will punish us we will make a sacrifice a good sacrifice another we will sacrifice a lamb that the priests have blessed first citizen master you are not wroth with us slag who may say what cloudy dooms are rolling up in the mind of the eldest of the gods he is not common god like us once a shepherd went by him in the mountains and doubted he sent a doom after that shepherd citizen master we have not doubted slag and the doom found him on the hills at evening second citizen it shall be a good sacrifice master reenter with a dead lamb and fruits they offer the lamb on an altar where there is fire and fruits before the altar thahn that leg is not being cooked at all illanaun it is strange that gods should be thus anxious about the cooking of a leg of lamb oorander it is strange certainly illanaun almost i had said that it was a man that spoke then oorander stroking his beard and regarding the second beggar strange strange certainly agmar is it then strange that the gods love roasted flesh for this purpose they keep the lightning when the lightning flickers about the limbs of men there comes to the gods of marma a pleasant smell even a smell of roasting sometimes the gods being pacific are pleased to have roasted instead the flesh of lamb it is all one to the gods let the roasting stop oorander no no gods of the mountains others no no oorander quick let us offer flesh to them if they eat all is well they offer it the beggars eat all but agmar who watches illanaun one who was ignorant one who did not know had almost said that they ate like hungry men others hush akmos yet they look as though they had not had a meal like this for a long time oorander they have a hungry look agmar i have not eaten since the world was very new and the flesh of men was tenderer than now these younger gods have learned the habit of eating from the lions oorander o oldest of divinities partake partake agmar it is not fitting that such as i should eat none eat but beasts and men and the younger gods the sun and the moon and the nimble lightning and i we may kill and we may madden but we do not eat akmos if he but eat of our offering he cannot overwhelm us all oh ancient deity partake partake agmar enough let it be enough that these have condescended to this bestial and human habit illanaun and yet he is not unlike a beggar whom i saw not so long since oorander but beggars eat illanaun now i never knew a beggar yet who would refuse a bowl of woldery wine akmos this is no beggar illanaun nevertheless let us offer him a bowl of woldery wine akmos you do wrong to doubt him illanaun i do but wish to prove his divinity i will fetch the woldery wine akmos he will not drink yet if he does then he will not overwhelm us let us offer him the wine first beggar it is woldery wine second beggar it is woldery third beggar a goblet of woldery wine fourth beggar o blessed day mlan o happy times slag o my wise master illanaun takes the goblet all the beggars stretch out their hands including agmar illanaun gives it to agmar agmar takes it solemnly and very carefully pours it out on the ground first beggar he has spilt it second beggar he has spilt it agmar it is a fitting libation our anger is somewhat appeased another beggar but it was woldery akmos master i am childless and i agmar trouble us not now it is the hour at which the gods are accustomed to speak to the gods in the language of the gods and if man heard us he would guess the futility of his destiny which were not well for man begone begone one lingers master agmar begone exeunt agmar takes up a piece of meat and begins to eat it the beggars rise and stretch themselves they laugh but agmar eats hungrily oogno ah now we have come into our own thahn now we have alms slag master my wise master ulf these are the good days the good days and yet i have a fear slag what do you fear there is nothing to fear no man is as wise as my master ulf i fear the gods whom we pretend to be slag the gods agmar come hither slag slag yes master agmar watch in the doorway while i eat slag goes to the doorway sit in the attitude of a god warn me if any of the citizens approach slag sits in the doorway in the attitude of a god back to the audience oogno but

death is the child of the gods agmar do you that never thwarted your child in his play ask this of the gods one master agmar weep not for all the houses that men have builded are the playfields of

trouble of a brief night long ago oogno ho ho ho to see them pray to us agmar when we were beggars did we not speak as beggars did we not whine as they was not our mien beggarly oogno we were the pride of our calling agmar then now that we are gods let us be as gods and not mock our worshippers ulf i think that the gods do mock their worshippers agmar the gods have never mocked us we are above all pinnacles that we have ever gazed at in dreams ulf i think that when man is high then most of all are the gods wont to mock him thief master i have been with those that know all and see all i have been with the thieves master they know me for one of the craft but they do not know me as being one of us agmar well well thief there is danger master there is great danger agmar you mean that they suspect we are men thief that they have long done master i mean that they will know it then we are lost agmar then they do not know it thief they do not know it yet but they will know it and we are

piety is so great that they have gone to worship even your shrines agmar i know these men that have great piety such men have often prayed to me before but their prayers are not acceptable they little love the gods their only care is their piety i know these pious ones they will say that the seven gods were still at marma they will lie and say that we were still at marma so shall they seem more pious than you all pretending that they alone have seen the gods fools shall believe them and share in their damnation oorander hush you anger the gods illanaun i am not sure who i anger oorander it

attitude of the gods sit silent man master it is terrible the beggars maintain silence it is terrible when you wander in the evening it is terrible on the edge of the desert in the evening children die when they see you agmar in the desert when did you see us man last night master you were terrible last night you were terrible in the gloaming when your hands were stretched out and groping you were feeling for the city agmar last night do you say man you were terrible in the gloaming agmar you yourself saw us man yes master you were terrible children too saw you and they died agmar you say

do not understand rock should not walk in the evening agmar there have been doubters of late are they satisfied man master they are terrified spare us master agmar it is wrong to doubt go and be faithful slag what have they seen master agmar they have seen their own fears dancing in the desert they have seen something green after the light was gone and some child has told them a tale that it was us i do not know what they have seen what should they have seen ulf something was coming this way from the desert he said slag what should come from the desert agmar they are a foolish people ulf that mans white face has seen some frightful thing agmar it is only we that have frightened them and their fears have made them foolish enter an attendant with a torch or lantern which he places in a receptacle exit thahn now we shall see the faces of the girls when they come to the banquet mlan never had beggars such a time agmar hark they are coming i hear footsteps thahn the dancing girls they are coming thief there is no sound of flutes they said they would come with music oogno what heavy boots they have they sound like feet of stone thahn i do not like to hear their heavy tread those that would dance to us must be light of foot agmar i shall not smile at them if they are not airy mlan they are coming very slowly they should come nimbly to us ulf i have a fear an old fear and a boding we have done ill in the sight of the seven gods beggars we were and beggars we should have remained we have given up our calling and come in sight of our doom i will not longer let my fear be silent it shall run about and cry it shall go from me crying like a dog from a doomed city for my fear has seen calamity and has known an evil thing slag master agmar come come they listen no one speaks the stony boots come on enter in single file through door in right of back a procession of seven green men even hands and faces are green they wear greenstone sandals they walk with knees extremely wide apart as having sat crosslegged for centuries their right arms and right forefingers point upward right elbows resting on right hands they stoop grotesquely halfway to the footlights they left wheel they pass in front of the seven beggars now in terrified attitudes and six of them sit down in the attitude described with their backs to the audience the leader stands still stooping oogno the gods of the mountain agmar be still they are dazzled by the light they may not see us the leading green thing points his finger at the lantern the flame turns green when the six are seated the leader points one by one at each of the seven beggars shooting out his forefinger at them as he does this each beggar in his turn gathers himself back on to his throne and crosses his legs his right arm goes stiffly upward with forefinger erect and a staring look of horror comes into his eyes in this attitude the beggars sit motionless while a green light falls upon their faces the gods go out presently enter the citizens some with victuals and fruit one touches a beggars arm and then anothers citizen they are cold they have turned to stone one we have doubted them we have doubted them they have turned to stone because we have doubted them another they were the true gods all they were the true gods the golden doom persons the king chamberlain chief prophet girl boy spies first prophet second prophet first sentry second sentry stranger attendants scene outside the kings great door in zericon time some while before the fall of babylon two sentries pace to and fro then halt one on each side of the great door first sentry the day is deadly sultry second sentry i would that i were swimming down the gyshon on the cool side under the fruit trees first sentry it is like to thunder or the fall of a dynasty second sentry it will grow cool by nightfall where is the king first sentry he rows in his golden barge with ambassadors or whispers with captains concerning future wars the stars spare him second sentry why do you say the stars spare him first sentry because if a doom from the stars fall suddenly on a king it swallows up his people and all things round about him and his palace falls and the walls of his city and citadel and the apes come in from the woods and the large beasts from the desert so that you would not say that a king had been there at all second sentry but why should a doom from the stars fall on the king first sentry because he seldom placates them second sentry ah i have heard that said of him first sentry who are the stars that a man should scorn them should they that rule the thunder the plague and the earthquake withhold these things save for much prayer always ambassadors are with the king and his commanders come in from distant lands prefects of cities and makers of the laws but never the priests of the stars second sentry hark was that thunder first sentry believe me the stars are angry enter a stranger he wanders towards the kings door gazing about him sentries go back go back stranger why first sentry it is death to touch the kings door stranger i am a stranger from thessaly first sentry it is death even for a stranger stranger your door is strangely sacred first sentry it is death to touch it boy i want to see the king to pray for a hoop boy i cannot open it will it do as well if i pray to the kings door sentry yes quite as well turns to talk to the other sentry is there anyone in sight second sentry nothing but a dog and he far out on the plain first sentry then we can talk awhile and eat bash buy kings door i want a little hoop the sentries take a little bash between finger and thumb from pouches and put that wholly forgotten drug to their lips girl my father is a taller soldier than that boy my father can write he taught me girl ho writing frightens nobody my father is a soldier boy i have a lump of gold i found it in stream that runs down to gyshon girl i have a poem i found it in my own head boy is it a long poem girl no but it would have been only there were no more rhymes for sky boy what is your poem girl i saw a purple bird go up against the sky and it went up and up and round

angry ill write it on the door for you girl youll write it boy yes i can write my father taught me ill write it with my lump of gold it makes a yellow mark on the iron door girl oh do write it i would like to see it written like real poetry first sentry you see well be fighting again soon second sentry only a little war we never have more than a little war with the hillfolk first sentry when a man goes to fight the curtains of the gods wax thicker than ever before between his eyes and the future he may go to a great or to a little war second sentry there can only be a little war with the hillfolk first sentry yet sometimes the gods laugh second sentry at whom first sentry at kings second sentry why have you grown uneasy about this war in the hills first sentry because the king is powerful beyond any of his fathers and has more fighting men more horses and wealth that could have ransomed his father and his grandfather and dowered their queens and daughters and every year his miners bring him more from the opalmines and from the turquoisequarries he has grown very mighty second sentry then he will the more easily crush the hillfolk in a little war first sentry when kings grow very mighty the stars grow very jealous boy ive written your poem girl oh have you really boy yes ill read it to you i saw a purple bird go up against the sky and it went up and up and round about did fly i saw it die girl it does nt scan boy that does nt matter enter furtively a spy who crosses stage and goes out the sentries cease to talk girl that man frightens me boy he is only one of the kings spies girl but i dont like the kings spies they frighten me boy come on then well run away sentry go away go away the king is coming he will eat you the boy throws a stone at the sentry and runs out enter another spy who notices the door he examines it and utters an owllike whistle no comes back they do not speak both whistle no comes all examine the door enter the king and his chamberlain the king wears a purple robe the sentries smartly transfer their spears to their left hands and return their right arms to their right sides they then lower their spears until their points are within an inch of the ground at the same time raising their right hands above their heads they stand for some moments thus then they lower their right arms to their right sides at the same time raising their spears in the next motion they take their spears into their right hands and lower the butts to the floor where they were before the spears slanting forward a little both sentries must move together precisely first spy runs forward to the king and kneels abasing his forehead to the floor something has written on the iron door chamberlain on the iron door king some fool has done it who has been here since yesterday first sentry shifts his hand a little higher on his spear brings the spear to his side and closes his heels all in one motion he then takes one pace backward with his right foot then he kneels on his right knee when he has done these he speaks but not before nobody majesty but a stranger from thessaly king did he touch the iron door first sentry no majesty he tried to but we drove him away king how near did he come first sentry nearly to our spears majesty king what was his motive in seeking to touch the iron door first sentry i do not know majesty king which way did he go first sentry that way majesty an hour ago the king whispers with one of his spies who stoops and examines the ground and steals away the sentry rises king what does this writing say a spy we cannot read majesty king a good spy should know everything second spy we watch majesty and we search out majesty we read shadows and we read footprints and whispers in secret places but we do not read writing king see what it is chamberlain it is treason majesty king read it chamberlain i saw a purple bird go up against the sky and it went up and up and round about did fly i saw it die first sentry the stars have spoken king has anyone been here but the stranger from thessaly sentry nobody majesty king you saw nothing first sentry nothing but a dog far out upon the plain and the children of the guard at play king and you second sentry nothing majesty chamberlain that is strange king it is some secret warning chamberlain it is treason king it is from the stars chamberlain no no majesty not from the stars not from the stars some man has done it yet the thing should be interpreted shall i send for the prophets of the stars king find me some prophet of the stars i fear that we may go no more my chamberlain along the winding ways of unequalled zericon nor play dahoori with the golden balls i have thought more of my people than of the stars and more of zericon than of windy heaven chamberlain believe me majesty some idle man has written it and passed by your spies shall find him and then his name will be soon forgotten king yes yes perhaps you are right though the sentries saw no one no doubt some beggar did it chamberlain yes majesty some beggar has surely done it but look here come two prophets of the stars they shall tell us that this is idle enter two prophets and a boy attending them all bow deeply to the king the two spies steal in again and stand at back king some beggar has written a rhyme on the iron gate and as the ways of rhyme are known to you i desired you rather as poets than as prophets to say whether there was any meaning in it chamberlain t is but an idle rhyme first prophet bows again and goes up to the door he glances at the writing come hither servant of those that serve the stars first prophet bring hither our golden cloaks for this may be a matter for rejoicing and bring our green cloaks also for this may tell of young new beautiful things with which the stars will one day gladden the king and bring our black cloaks also for it may be a doom exit the boy the prophet goes up to the door and reads solemnly the stars have spoken king i tell you that some beggar has written this first prophet it is written in pure gold he dons the black cloak over body and head king what do the stars mean what warning is it first prophet i cannot say king come you then and tell us what the warning is second prophet the stars have spoken king what is it what does it mean second prophet we do not know but it is from the stars chamberlain it is a harmless thing there is no harm in it majesty why should not birds die king why have the prophets covered themselves in black chamberlain they are a secret people and look for inner meanings there is no harm in it king they have covered themselves in black chamberlain they have not spoken of any evil thing they have not spoken of it king if the people see the prophets covered in black they will say that the stars are against me and believe that my luck has turned chamberlain the people must not know king some prophet must interpret to us the doom let the chief prophet of the stars be sent for chamberlain summon the chief prophet of the stars that look on zericon voices off the chief prophet of the stars the chief prophet of the stars chamberlain i have summoned the chief prophet majesty king if he interpret this aright i will put a necklace of turquoises round his neck with opals from the mines chamberlain he will not fail he is a very cunning interpreter king what if he covers himself with a huge black cloak and does not speak and goes muttering away slowly with bended head till our fear spreads to the sentries and they cry aloud chamberlain this is no doom from the stars but some idle scribe hath written it in his insolence upon the iron door wasting his hoard of gold king not for myself i have a fear of doom not for myself but i have inherited a rocky land windy and illnurtured and nursed it to prosperity by years of peace and spread its boundaries by years of war i have brought up harvests out of barren acres and given good laws unto naughty towns and my people are happy and lo the stars are angry chamberlain it is not the stars it is not the stars majesty for the prophets of the stars have not interpreted it indeed it was some reveller wasting his gold meanwhile enter chief prophet of the stars that look on zericon king chief prophet of the stars that look on zericon i would have you interpret the rhyme upon yonder door chief prophet it is from the stars king interpret it and you shall have great turquoises round your neck with opals from the mines in the frozen mountains chief prophet cloaks himself like the others in a great black cloak who should wear purple in the land but a king or who should go up against the sky but one who has troubled the stars by neglecting their ancient worship such a one has gone up and up increasing in power and wealth such a one has soared above the crowns of those that went before him such a one the stars have doomed the undying ones the illustrious king who wrote it chief prophet it is pure gold some god has written it chamberlain some god first sentry last night i saw a star go flaming earthward king is this a warning or is it a doom chief prophet the stars have spoken king is it then a doom chief prophet they speak not in jest king i have been a great king let it be said of me the stars overthrew him and they sent a god for his doom for i have not met my equal among kings that man should overthrow me and i have not oppressed my people that man should rise up against me chief prophet it is better to give worship to the stars than to do good to man it is better to be humble before the gods than proud in the face of your enemy though he do evil king let the stars hearken yet and i will sacrifice a child to them i will sacrifice a girl child to the twinkling stars and a male child to the stars that blink not the stars of the steadfast eyes to his spies let a boy and a girl be brought for sacrifice will you accept this sacrifice to the god that the stars have sent they say that the gods love children chief prophet i may refuse no sacrifice to the stars nor to the gods whom they send make ready the sacrificial knives king is it fitting that the sacrifice take place by the iron door where the god from the stars has trod or must it be in the temple chief prophet let it be offered by the iron door to the other prophets fetch hither the altar stone the owllike whistle is heard off right the third spy runs crouching toward it exit king will this sacrifice avail to avert the doom chief prophet who knows king i fear that even yet the doom will fall chief prophet it were wise to sacrifice some greater thing king what more can a man offer chief prophet his pride king what pride chief prophet your pride that went up against the sky and troubled the stars king how shall i sacrifice my pride to the stars chief prophet it is upon your pride that the doom will fall and will take away your crown and will take away your kingdom king i will sacrifice my crown and reign uncrowned among you so only i save my kingdom chief prophet if you sacrifice your crown which is your pride and if the stars accept it perhaps the god that they went may avert the doom and you may still reign in your kingdom though humbled and uncrowned king shall i burn my crown with spices and with incense or cast it into the sea chief prophet let it be laid here by the iron door where the god came who wrote the golden doom when he comes again by night to shrivel up the city or to pour an enemy in through the iron door he will see your castoff pride and perhaps accept it and take it away to the neglected stars king go after my spies and say that i make no sacrifice goodbye my brittle glory kings have sought you the stars have envied you chief prophet even now the sun has set who denies the stars and the day is departed wherein no gods walk abroad it is near the hour when spirits roam the earth and all things that go unseen and the faces of the abiding stars will be soon revealed to the fields lay your crown there and let us come away the sentries yes majesty they remain kneeling until after the king has gone king and the chief prophet walk away chief prophet it was your pride let it be forgotten may the stars accept it first sentry the stars have envied him second sentry it is an ancient crown he wore it well first sentry may the stars accept it second sentry if they do not accept it what doom will overtake us first sentry it will suddenly be as though there were never any city of zericon nor two sentries like you and me standing before the door second sentry why how do you know first sentry that is ever the way of the gods second sentry but it is unjust first sentry how should the gods know that second sentry will it happen tonight first sentry come we must march away the stage grows increasingly darker reenter the chamberlain from the right he walks across the stage and goes out to the left reenter spies from the right they cross the stage which is now nearly dark boy enters from the right dressed in white his hands out a little crying kings door kings door i want my little hoop he goes up to the kings door when he sees the kings crown there he utters a satisfied ooh he takes it up puts it on the ground and beating it before him with the sceptre goes out by the way that he entered the great door opens there is light within a furtive spy slips out and sees that the crown is gone another spy slips out their crouching heads come close together first spy the gods have come they run back through the door and the door is closed it opens again and the king and the chamberlain come through king the stars are satisfied king argimenes and the unknown warrior persons king argimenes zarb a slave born of slaves an old slave slaves of king darniak a young slave slaves king darniak the kings overseer a prophet the idolguard the servant of the kings dog queen atharlia queen oxara queens of king darniak queen cahafra queen thragolind guards and attendants time a long time ago the first act the dinnerhour on the slave fields of king darniak king argimenes is sitting on the ground bowed ragged and dirty gnawing a bone he has uncouth hair and a dishevelled beard a battered spade lies near him two or three slaves sit at back of stage eating raw cabbageleaves the tearsong the chant of the lowborn rises at intervals monotonous and mournful coming from distant slavefields king argimenes this is a good bone there is juice in this bone zarb i wish i were you argimenes king argimenes i am not to be envied any longer i have eaten up my bone zarb i wish i were you because you have been a king because men have prostrated themselves before your feet because you have ridden a horse and worn a crown and been called majesty king argimenes when i remember that i have been a king it is very terrible zarb but you are lucky to have such things in your memory as you have i have nothing in my memory once i went for a year without being flogged and i remember my cleverness in contriving it i have nothing else to remember king argimenes it is very terrible to have been a king zarb but we have nothing who have no good memories in the past it is not easy for us to hope for the future here king argimenes have you any god zarb we may not have a god because he might make us brave and we might kill our guards he might make a miracle and give us swords king argimenes ah you have no hopethen zarb i have a little hope hush and i will tell you a secret the kings great dog is ill and like to die they will throw him to us we shall have beautiful bones then king argimenes ah bones zarb yes that is what i hope for and have you no other hope do you not hope that your nation will arise some day and rescue you and cast off the king and hang him by his thumbs from the palace gateway king argimenes no i have no other hope for my god was cast down in the temple and broken into three pieces on the day that they surprised us and took me sleeping but will they throw him to us will so honorable a brute as the kings dog be thrown to us zarb when he is dead his honors are taken away even the king when he is dead is given to the worms then why should not his dog be thrown to us king argimenes we are not worms zarb you do not understand argimenes the worms are little and free while we are big and enslaved i did not say we were worms but we are like worms and if they have the king when he is dead why then king argimenes tell me more of the kings dog are there big bones on him zarb aye he is a big dog a high big black one king argimenes you know him then zarb oh yes i know him i know him well i was beaten once because of him twentyfive strokes from the treble whips two men beating me king argimenes how did they beat you because of the kings dog zarb they beat me because i spoke to him without making obeisance he was coming dancing alone over the slavefields and i spoke to him he was a friendly great dog and i spoke to him and patted his head and did not make obeisance king argimenes and they saw you do it zarb yes the slaveguard saw me they came and seized me at once and bound my arms the great dog wanted me to speak to him again but i was hurried away king argimenes you should have made obeisance zarb the great dog seemed so friendly that i forgot he was the kings great dog king argimenes but tell me more was it a hurt or a sickness zarb they say that it is a sickness king argimenes ah then he will grow thin if he does not die soon if it had been a hurt but we should not complain i complain more often than you do because i had not learned to submit while i was yet young zarb if your beautiful memories do not please you you should hope more i wish i had your memories i should not trouble to hope then it is very hard to hope king argimenes there will be nothing more to hope for when we have eaten the kings dog zarb why you might find gold in the earth while you were digging then you might bribe the commander of the guard to lend you his sword we would all follow you if you had a sword then we might take the king and bind him and lay him on the ground and fasten his tongue outside his mouth with thorns and put honey on it and sprinkle honey near then the gray ants would come from one of their big mounds my father found gold once when he was digging king argimenes did your father free himself zarb no because the kings overseer found him looking at the gold and killed him but he would have freed himself if he could have bribed the guard a prophet walks across the stage attended by two guards slaves he is going to the king he is going to the king zarb he is going to the king king argimenes going to prophesy good things to the king it is easy to prophesy good things to a king and be rewarded when the good things come what else should come to a king a prophet a prophet a deep bell tolls slowly king argimenes and zarb pick up their spades at once and the old slaves at the back of the stage go down on their knees immediately and grub in the soil with their hands the white beard of the oldest trails in the dirt as he works king argimenes digs king argimenes what is the name of that song that we always sing i like the song zarb it has no name it is our song there is no other song king argimenes once there were other songs has this no name zarb i think the soldiers have a name for it king argimenes what do the soldiers call it zarb the soldiers call it the tearsong the chant of the lowborn king argimenes it is a good song i could sing no other now king argimenes to himself as his spade touches something in the earth metal gold perhaps it is of no use here uncovers earth leisurely suddenly he drops on his knees and works excitedly in the earth with his hands then very slowly still kneeling he lifts lying flat on his hands a long greenish sword his eyes intent on it about the level of his uplifted forehead he holds it still flat on both hands and addresses it thus o holy and blessed thing then he lowers it slowly till his hands rest on his knees and looking all the while at the sword loquitur three years ago tomorrow king darniak spat at me having taken my kingdom from me three times in that year i was flogged with twelve stripes with seventeen stripes and with twenty stripes a year and eleven months ago come moonday the kings overseer struck me in the face and nine times in that year he called me dog for one month two weeks and a day i was yoked with a bullock and pulled a rounded stone all day over the paths except while we were fed i was flogged twice that year with eighteen stripes and with ten stripes this year the roof of the slavesty has fallen in and king darniak will not repair it five weeks ago one of his queens laughed at me as she came across the slavefields i was flogged again this year and with thirteen stripes and twelve times they have called me dog and these things have they done to a king and a king of the house of ithara he listens attentively for a moment then buries the sword again and pats the earth over it with his hands then digs again the old slaves do not see him their faces are to the earth enter the kings overseer carrying a whip the slaves and king argimenes kneel with their foreheads to the ground as he passes across the stage exit the kings overseer king argimenes o warrior spirit wherever thou wanderest whoever be thy gods whether they punish thee or whether they bless thee o kingly spirit that once laid here this sword behold i pray to thee having no gods to pray to for the god of my nation was broken in three by night mine arm is stiff with three years slavery and remembers not the sword but guide thy sword till i have slain six men and armed the strongest slaves and thou shalt have the sacrifice every year of a hundred goodly oxen and i will build in ithara a temple to thy memory wherein all that enter in shall remember thee so shalt thou be honored and envied among the dead for the dead are very jealous of remembrance ay though thou wert a robber that took mens lives unrighteously yet shall rare spices smoulder in thy temple and little maidens sing and newplucked flowers deck the solemn aisles and priests shall go about it ringing bells that thy soul shall find repose oh but it has a good blade this old green sword thou wouldst not like to see it miss its mark thou wouldst not like to see it go thirsting into the air so huge a sword should find its marrowy bone come into my right arm o ancient spirit o unknown warriors soul and if thou hast the ear of any gods speak there against illuriel god of king darniak he rises and goes on digging the kings overseer so you have been praying king argimenes no master the kings overseer the slaveguard saw you it is not lawful for a slave to pray king argimenes i did but pray to illuriel to make me a good slave to teach me to dig well and pull the rounded stone and to make me not to die when the food is scarce but to be a good slave to my master the great king the kings overseer who art thou to pray to illuriel dogs may not pray to an immortal god king argimenes zarb zarb do not look at me when you speak the guards are watching us look at your digging king argimenes how do the guards know we are speaking because we look at one another zarb you are very witless of course they know king argimenes zarb zarb what is it king argimenes how many guards are there in sight zarb there are six of them over there they are watching us king argimenes are there other guards in sight of these six guards zarb no king argimenes how do you know zarb because whenever their officer leaves them they sit upon the ground and play with dice king argimenes how does that show that there are not another six in sight of them zarb how witless you are argimenes of course it shows there are not because if there were another officer would see them and their thumbs would be cut off king argimenes ah zarb would the slaves follow me if i tried to kill the guards zarb no argimenes king argimenes why would they not follow me zarb because you look like a slave they will never follow a slave because they are slaves themselves and know how mean a creature is a slave if you looked like a king they would follow you king argimenes but i am a king they know that i am a king zarb it is better to look like a king it is looks that they would go by king argimenes if i had a sword would they follow me a beautiful huge sword of bronze zarb i wish i could think of things like that it is because you were once a king that you can think of a sword of bronze i tried to hope once that i should some day fight the guards but i could nt picture a sword i could nt imagine it i could only picture whips king argimenes dig a little nearer zarb i have found a very old sword in the earth it is not a sword such as common soldiers wear a king must have worn it and an angry king it must have done fearful things there are little dints in it perhaps there was a battle here long ago where all were slain and perhaps that king died last and buried his sword but the great birds swallowed him zarb you have been thinking too much of the kings dog argimenes and that has made you hungry and hunger has driven you mad king argimenes i have found such a sword zarb why then you will wear a purple cloak again and sit on a great throne and ride a prancing horse and we shall call you majesty king argimenes i shall break a long fast first and drink much water and sleep but will the slaves follow me zarb you will make them follow you if you have a sword yet is illuriel a very potent god they say that none have prevailed against king darniaks dynasty so long as illuriel stood once an enemy cast illuriel into the river and overthrew the dynasty but a fisherman found him again and set him up and the enemy was driven out and the dynasty returned king argimenes if illuriel could be cast down as my god was cast down perhaps king darniak could be overcome as i was overcome in my sleep zarb if illuriel were cast down all the people would utter a cry and flee away it would be a fearful portent king argimenes how many men are there in the armory at the palace zarb there are ten men in the palace armory when all the slaveguards are out zarb the officer of the slaveguard has gone away they are playing with dice now he throws down his spade and stretches his arms the man with the big beard has won again he is very nimble with his thumbs they are playing again but it is getting dark i cannot clearly see king argimenes furtively uncovers the sword he picks it up and grips it in his hand zarb majesty king argimenes crouches and steals away towards the slaveguard zarb argimenes has found a terrible sword and has gone to slay the slaveguard it is not a common sword it is some kings sword an old slave argimenes will be dreadfully flogged we shall hear him cry all night his cries will frighten us and we shall not sleep zarb no no the guards flog poor slaves but argimenes had an angry look the guards will be afraid when they see him look so angry and see his terrible sword it was a huge sword and he looked very angry he will bring us the swords of the slaveguard we must prostrate ourselves before him and kiss his feet or he will be angry with us too old slave will argimenes give me a sword zarb he will have swords for six of us if he slays the slaveguard yes he will give you a sword slave a sword no no i must not the king would kill me if he found that i had a sword second slave if the king found that i had a sword why then it would be an evil day for the king zarb i think that they are playing at dice again first slave i do not see argimenes zarb no because he was crouching as he walked the slaveguard is on the skyline second slave what is that dark shadow behind the slaveguard zarb it is too still to be argimenes second slave look it moves zarb the evening is too dark i cannot see they continue to gaze into the gathering darkness they raise themselves on their knees and crane their necks nobody speaks then from their lips and from others farther off goes up a long deep oh it is like the sound that goes up from the grandstand when a horse falls at a fence or in england like the first exclamation of the crowd at a great cricket match when a man is caught in the slips the second act the throne hall of king darniak the king is seated on his throne in the centre at the back of the stage a little to his left but standing out from the wall a darkgreen seated idol is set up his queens are seated about him on the ground two on his right and two between him and the idol all wear crowns beside the darkgreen idol a soldier with a pike is kneeling upon one knee the tearsong the chant of the lowborn drifts faintly up from the slavefields first queen do show us the new prophet majesty it would be very interesting to see another prophet the king ah yes he strikes upon a gong and an attendant enters walks straight past the king and bows before the idol he then walks back to the centre of the stage and bows before the king the king bring the new prophet hither exit attendant enter the kings overseer holding a roll of paper he passes the king bows to the idol returns to the front of the king kneels and remains kneeling with bended head the king speaking in the meanwhile to the second queen on his immediate right we are making a beautiful arbor for you o atharlia at an end of the great garden there shall be irisflowers that you love and all things that grow by streams and the stream there shall be small and winding like one of those in your country i shall bring a stream a new way from the mountains turning to queen oxara on his extreme right and for you too o oxara we shall make a pleasance i shall have rocks brought from the quarries for you and my idle slaves shall make a hill and plant it with mountain shrubs and you can sit there in the winter thinking of the north ah what is here the kings overseer the plans of your royal garden majesty the slaves have dug it for five years and rolled the paths the king was there not a garden in babylon the kings overseer they say there was a garden there of some sort majesty the king i shall have a greater garden let the world know and wonder the kings overseer it shall know at once majesty the king i do not like that hill it is too steep the kings overseer no majesty the king remove it the kings overseer yes majesty the king when will the garden be ready for the queens to walk in the kings overseer work is slow majesty at this season of the year because the green stuff is scarce and the slaves grow idle they even become insolent and ask for bones queen cahafra they why are they not flogged to queen thragolind it is so simple they have only to flog them but these people are so silly sometimes i want to walk in the great garden and then they tell me it is not ready majesty it is not ready majesty as though there were any reason why it should not be ready fourth queen yes they are a great trouble to us meanwhile the king hands back the plans exit the kings overseer reenter attendant with the prophet who is dressed in a long dark brown cloak his face is solemn he has a long dark beard and long hair having bowed before the idol he bows before the king and stands silent the attendant having bowed to both stands by the doorway the king perhaps we shall lure the ducks when the marches are frozen to come and swim in your stream it will be like your own country prophesy unto us the prophet there was once a king that had slaves to hate him and to toil for him and he had soldiers to guard him and to die for him and the number of the slaves that he had to hate him and to toil for him was greater than the number of the soldiers that he had to guard him and to die for him and the days of that king were few and the number of thy slaves o king that thou has to hate thee is greater than the number of thy soldiers queen cahafra and i wore the crown with the sapphires and the big emerald in it and the foreign prince said that i looked very sweet the king who has been smiling at queen atharlia gives a gracious nod to the prophet when he hears him stop speaking when the queens see the king nod graciously they applaud the prophet by idly clapping their hands third queen do ask him to make us another prophecy majesty he is so interesting he looks so clever the king prophesy unto us the prophet thine armies camped upon thy mountainous borders descry no enemy in the plains afar and within thy gates lurks he for whom thy sentinels seek upon lonely guarded frontiers there is a fear upon me and a boding even yet there is time even yet but little time and my mind is dark with trouble for thy kingdom queen cahafra i do not like the way he does his hair queen thragolind it would be all right if he would only have it cut the king to the prophet dismissing him with a nod of the head thank you that has been very interesting queen thragolind how clever he is i wonder how he thinks of things like that queen cahafra yes but i hate a man who is conceited about it look how he wears his hair queen thragolind yes of course it is perfectly dreadful queen cahafra why cant he wear his hair like other people even if he does say clever things queen thragolind yes i hate a conceited man it is not necessary for the prophets hair to be at all unusual enter an attendant he bows before the idol then kneels to the king the attendant the guests are all assembled in the chamber of banquets all rise the queens walk two abreast to the chamber of banquets queen atharlia what was he talking about queen oxara he was talking about armies on the frontier queen atharlia ah that reminds me of that young captain in the purple guard they say that he loves linoora queen oxara oh thearkos linoora probably said that when the queens come to the doorway they halt on each side of it then they turn facing one another then the king leaves his throne and passes between them into the chamber of banquets each couple curtseying low to him as he passes the queens follow then the attendants there rises the winesong the chant of the nobles drowning the chant of the lowborn only the idolguard remains behind still kneeling beside illuriel the idolguard i do not like those things the prophet said it would be terrible if they were true it would be very terrible if they were false for he prophesies in the name of illuriel ah they are singing the winesong the chant of the nobles the queens are singing how merry they are i should like to be a noble and sit and look at the queens he joins in the song the voice of a sentinel guard turn out the voice of one having authority turn out the guard there wake up you accursed pigs a voice crying to the armory to the armory reinforce the slaves have come to the armory ah mercy for awhile there is silence king argimenes go you to the slavefields say that the palaceguard is dead and that we have taken the armory ten of you hold the armory till our men come from the slavefields he comes into the hall with his slaves armed with swords throw down illuriel the idolguard you must take my life before you touch my god a slave we only want your pike all attack him they seize his sword and bind his hands behind him they all pull down illuriel the darkgreen idol who breaks into seven pieces king argimenes illuriel is fallen and broken asunder zarb immortal illuriel is dead at last king argimenes my god was broken into three pieces but illuriel is broken into seven the fortunes of darniak will prevail over mine no longer a slave breaks off a golden arm from the throne come we will arm all the slaves king darniak my throne is broken illuriel is turned against me an attendant illuriel is fallen all illuriel is fallen is fallen some drop their spears king darniak what envious god or sacrilegious man has dared to do this thing the idolguard illuriel is fallen king darniak have men been here the idolguard is fallen king darniak what way did they go the idolguard illuriel is fallen king darniak they shall be tortured here before illuriel and their eyes shall be hung upon a thread about his neck so that illuriel shall see it and on their bones we will set him up again come those that have dropped their spears pick them up but trail them along behind them on the ground all follow dejectedly voice of lamentation illuriel is fallen illuriel is fallen illuriel illuriel illuriel is fallen is fallen the song of the lowborn ceases suddenly then voices of the slaves in the slavefields chanting very loudly illuriel is fallen is fallen is fallen illuriel is fallen and broken asunder illuriel is fallen fallen fallen clamor of fighting is heard the clash of swords and voices and now and then the name of illuriel idolguard illuriel is broken they have overthrown illuriel they have done great harm to the courses of the stars the moon will be turned to blackness or fall and forsake the nights the sun will rise no more they do not know how they have wrecked the world king argimenes go you to the land of ithara and tell them that i am free and do you go to the army on the frontier offer them death or the right arm of the throne to be melted and divided amongst them all let them choose the armed slaves go to the throne and stand on each side of it loquitur majesty ascend your throne king argimenes standing with his face toward the audience lifts the sword slowly lying on both his hands a little above his head then looking up at it loquitur praise to the unknown warrior and to all gods that bless him he ascends the throne zarb prostrates himself at the foot of it and remains prostrated for the rest of the act muttering at intervals majesty an armed slave enters dragging the kings overseer king argimenes sternly watches him he is dragged before the throne he still has the roll of parchment in his hand for some moments king argimenes does not speak then pointing at the parchment what have you there the kings overseer it is a plan of the great garden majesty it was to have been a wonder to the world king argimenes show me the place that i digged for three years the kings overseer shows it with trembling hands the parchment shakes visibly let there be built there a temple to an unknown warrior and let this sword be laid on its altar evermore that the ghost of that warrior wandering by night if men do walk by night from across the grave may see his sword again and let slaves be allowed to pray there and those that are oppressed nevertheless the noble and the mighty shall not fail to repair there too that the unknown warrior shall not lack due reverence enter running a man of the household of king darniak he starts and stares aghast on seeing king argimenes king argimenes who are you man i am the servant of the kings dog king argimenes why do you come here man the kings dog is dead king argimenes and his men bones king argimenes remembering suddenly what has happened and where he is let him be buried with the late

but there is nt anywhere else bill i never forgot you jim id be pattering away with my tongue in church like all the rest but all the time id be thinking of you in that little room at putney and the man searching every corner of it for you with a revolver in one hand and a candle in the other and you almost going round with him jim what is putney bill oh jim cant you remember cant you remember the day you taught me a livelihood i was nt more than twelve and it was spring and all the may was in blossom outside the town and we cleared out no in the new street and the next day we saw the mans fat silly face it was thirty years ago jim what are years bill oh jim jim you see there is nt any hope here and when there isnt any hope there is nt any future and when there is nt any future there is nt any past its just the present here i tell you were stuck there are nt no years here nor no nothing bill cheer up jim youre thinking of a quotation abandon hope all ye that enter here i used to learn quotations they are awfully genteel a fellow named shakespeare used to make them but there is nt any sense in them whats the use of saying ye when you mean you dont be thinking of quotations jim jim i tell you there is no hope here bill cheer up jim theres plenty of hope there is nt there jim yes and thats why they keep it locked up so they wont let us have any no i begin to remember earth again now since youve been speaking it was just the same there the more theyd got the more they wanted to keep you from having a bit bill youll cheer up a bit when i tell you what ive got i say jim have you got some beer why so you have why you ought to cheer up jim jim all the beer youre ever likely to see again theyre empty bill half rising from the rock on which he has seated himself and pointing his finger at jim as he rises very cheerfully why youre the chap that said there was no hope here and youre hoping to find beer in every bottle you open jim yes i hope to see a drop of beer in one some day but i know i wont their trick might not work just once bill how many have you tried jim jim oh i dont know ive always been at it working as fast as i can ever since ever since feels his neck meditatively and up toward his ear why ever since bill bill why dont you stop it jim im too thirsty bill bill what do you think ive got jim jim i dont know nothings any use bill whos that laughing jim jim astonished at such a question loudly and emphatically whos that laughing bill looks a little disconcerted at having apparently asked a silly question is it a pal jim a pal the laugh off joins in loudly and for long bill well i dont know but jim what do you think ive got jim it isnt any use to you whatever it is not even if its a tenpound note bill its better than a tenpound note jim jim try and remember jim dont you remember the way we used to go for these iron safes do you remember anything jim jim yes i am beginning to remember now there used to be sunsets and then there were great yellow lights and one went in behind them through a swinging door bill yes yes jim that was the blue bear down at wimbledon jim yes and the room was all full of golden light and there was beer with light in it and some would be spilt on the counter and there was light in that too and there was a girl standing there with yellow hair shed be the other side of that door now with lamplight in her hair among the angels and the old smile on her lips if one of them chaffed her and her pretty teeth ashining she would be very near the throne there was never any harm in jane bill no there was never any arm in jane jim jim oh i dont want to see the angels bill but if i could see jane again he might laugh as much as he cared to whenever i wanted to cry you cant cry here you know bill bill you shall see her again jim jim takes no interest in this remark he lowers his eyes and goes on with his work bill jim you shall see her again you want to get into heaven dont you jim want bill jim do you know what ive got jim bill you remember those iron safes jim how we used to knock them open like walnuts with old nutcracker jim empty again bill well ive got old nutcracker i had him in my hand at the time and they let me keep him they thought it would be a nice proof against me jim nothing is any good here bill ill get in to heaven jim and you shall come with me because you taught me a livelihood i could nt be happy there like those angels if i knew of anyone being outside im not like that bill jim jim youll see jane there jim youll never get through those gates bill youll never do it bill theyre only gold jim golds soft like lead old nutcracker would do it if they were steel jim youll never do it bill bill puts a rock against the gates stands on it to reach the lock and gets to work on the lock a good instrument to use is an eggwhipper jim goes on wearily with his work as bill works away fragments and golden screws begin to fall on the floor bill jim old nutcracker thinks nothing of it its just like cheese to old nutcracker jim they wont let you do it bill bill they dont know what ive got im getting through it like cheese jim jim suppose its a mile thick suppose its a million miles thick suppose its a hundred million miles thick bill cant be jim those doors are meant to open outward they could nt do that if they were more than four inches thick at the most not for an archbishop theyd stick jim you remember that great safe we broke open once what had coal in it bill this is nt a safe jim this is heaven therell be the old saints with their halos shining and flickering like windows o wintry nights and angels thick as swallows along a cottage roof the day before they go and orchards full of apples as far as you can see and the rivers tigris and euphrates so the bible says and a city of gold for those that care for cities all full of precious stones but im a bit tired of cities and precious stones ill go out into the fields where the orchards are by the tigris and euphrates i should nt be surprised if my old mother was there she never cared much for the way i earned my livelihood but she was a good mother to me i dont know if they want a good mother in there who would be kind to the angels and sit and smile at them when they sang and soothe them if they were cross if they let all the good ones in shell be there all right jim they wont have brought me up against her will they thats not fair evidence jim jim it would be just like them to very like them bill if theres a glass of beer to be got in heaven or a dish of tripe and onions or a pipe of bacca shell have them for me when i come to her she used to know my ways wonderful and what i liked and she used to know when to expect me almost anywhere i used to climb in through the window at any hour and she always knew it was me shell know its me at the door now jim it will be all a blaze of light and ill hardly know its her till i get used to it but ill know her among a million angels there were nt none like her on earth and there wont be none like her in heaven jim im through jim one more turn and old nutcrackers done it its giving its giving i know the feel of it jim at last there is a noise of falling bolts the gates swing out an inch and are stopped by the rock bill jim jim ive opened it jim ive opened the gate of heaven come and help me jim looks up for a moment with open mouth then he mournfully shakes his head and goes on drawing a cork another one empty bill looks down once into the abyss that lies below the lonely place stars blooming great stars then he moves away the rock on which he stood the gates move slowly jim leaps up and runs to help they each take a gate and move backward with their faces against it bill hullo mother you there hullo you there its bill mother the gates swing heavily open revealing empty night and stars bill staggering and gazing into the revealed nothing in which far stars go wandering stars blooming great stars there aint no heaven jim ever since the revelation a cruel and violent laugh has arisen off it increases in volume and grows louder and louder jim thats like them thats very like them yes theyd do that the lost silk hat persons the caller the laborer the clerk the poet the policeman scene a fashionable london street the caller stands on a doorstep faultlessly dressed but without a hat at first he shows despair then a new thought engrosses him enter the laborer the caller excuse me a moment excuse me but id be greatly obliged to you if if you could see your way in fact you can be of great service to me if the laborer glad to do what i can sir caller well all i really want you to do is just to ring that bell and go up and say er say that youve come to see to the drains or anything like that you know and get hold of my hat for me laborer get hold of your at caller yes you see i left my hat behind most unfortunately its in the drawingroom points to window that room there half under the long sofa the far end from the door and if you could possibly go and get it why id be the laborers expression changes why whats the matter laborer i dont like this job caller dont like this job but my dear fellow dont be silly what possible harm laborer ahh thats what i dont know caller but what harm can there possibly be in so simple a request what harm does there seem to be laborer oh it seems all right caller well then laborer all these crack jobs do seem all right caller but im not asking you to rob the house laborer dont seem as if you are certainly but i dont like the looks of it what if theres things what i cant elp taking when i gets inside caller i only want my hat here i say please dont go away heres a sovereign it will only take you a minute laborer what i want to know caller yes laborer is whats in that hat caller whats in the hat laborer yes thats what i want to know caller whats in the hat laborer yes you are nt going to give me a sovereign caller ill give you two sovereigns laborer you are nt going to give me a sovereign and rise it to two sovereigns for an empty hat caller but i must have my hat i cant be seen in the streets like this theres nothing in the hat what do you thinks in the hat laborer ah im not clever enough to say that but it looks as if the papers was in that hat caller the papers laborer yes papers proving if you can get them that youre the heir to that big house and some poor innocent will be defrauded caller look here the hats absolutely empty i must have my hat if theres anything in it you shall have it yourself as well as the two pounds only get me my hat laborer well that seems all right caller thats right then youll run up and get it laborer seems all right to me and seems all right to you but its the police what you and i have got to think of will it seem all right to them caller oh for heavens sake laborer ah caller what a hopeless fool you are laborer ah caller look here laborer ah i got you there mister caller look here for goodness sake dont go laborer ah caller excuse me sir excuse me asking you but as you see i am without a hat i shall be extraordinarily obliged to you if you would be so very good as to get it for me pretend you have come to wind the clocks you know i left it in the drawingroom of this house half under the long sofa the far end clerk oh er all right only caller thanks so much i am immensely indebted to you just say youve come to wind the clocks you know caller i er dont think im very good at winding clocks you know caller oh thats all right just stand in front of the clock and fool about with it thats all they ever do i must warn you theres a lady in the room clerk oh caller but thats all right you know just walk past up to the clock clerk but i think if you dont mind as theres someone there caller oh but shes quite young and very very beautiful and clerk why dont you get it yourself caller that is impossible clerk impossible caller yes i have sprained my ankle clerk oh is it bad caller yes very bad indeed clerk i dont mind trying to carry you up caller no that would be worse my foot has to be kept on the ground clerk but how will you get home caller i can walk all right on the flat clerk im afraid i have to be going on its rather later than i thought caller but for goodness sake dont leave me you cant leave me here like this without a hat clerk im afraid i must its later than i thought caller excuse me sir excuse my stopping you but i should be immensely obliged to you if you would do me a very great favor i have unfortunately left my hat behind while calling at this house it is half under the long sofa at the far end if you could possibly be so kind as to pretend you have come to tune the piano and fetch my hat for me i should be enormously grateful to you poet but why cannot you get it for yourself caller i cannot poet if you would tell me the reason perhaps i could help you caller i cannot i can never enter that house again poet if you have committed a murder by all means tell me i am not sufficiently interested in ethics to wish to have you hanged for it caller do i look like a murderer poet no of course not i am only saying that you can safely trust me for not only does the statute book and its penalties rather tend to bore me and murder itself has always had a certain fascination for me i write delicate and fastidious lyrics yet strange as it may appear i read every murder trial and my sympathies are always with the prisoner caller but i tell you i am not a murderer poet then what have you done caller i have quarrelled with a lady in that house and have sworn to join the bosnians and die in africa poet but this is beautiful caller unfortunately i forgot my hat poet you go to die for a hopeless love and in a far country it was the wont of the troubadours caller but will you get my hat for me poet that i will gladly do for you but we must find an adequate reason for entering the house caller you pretend to tune the piano poet that unfortunately is impossible the sound of a piano being unskillfully handled is to me what the continual drop of cold water on the same part of the head is said to be in countries where that interesting torture is practiced there is caller but what are we to do poet there is a house where kind friends of mine have given me that security and comfort that are a poets necessity but there was a governess there and a piano it is years and years since i was able even to see the faces of those friends without an inward shudder caller well well have to think of something else poet you are bringing back to these unhappy days the romance of an age of which the ballads tell us that kings sometimes fought in no other armor than their ladys nightshirt caller yes but you know first of all i must get my hat poet but why caller i cannot possibly be seen in the streets without a hat poet why not caller it cant be done poet but you confuse externals with essentials caller i dont know what you call essentials but being decently dressed in london seems pretty essential to me poet a hat is not one of the essential things of life caller i dont want to appear rude but my hat is nt quite like yours poet let us sit down and talk of things that matter things that will be remembered after a hundred years they sit regarded in this light one sees at once the triviality of hats but to die and die beautifully for a hopeless love that is a thing one could make a lyric about that is the test of essential things try and imagine them in a lyric one could not write a lyric about a hat caller i dont care whether you could write a lyric about my hat or whether you could nt all i know is that i am not going to make myself absolutely ridiculous by walking about in london without a hat will you get it for me or will you not poet to take any part in the tuning of a piano is impossible for me caller well pretend youve come to look at the radiator they have one under the window and i happen to know it leaks poet i suppose it has an artistic decoration on it caller yes i think so poet then i decline to look at it or go near it i know these decorations in cast iron i once saw a potbellied egyptian god named bes and he was meant to be ugly but he was nt as ugly as these decorations that the twentieth century can make with machinery what has a plumber got to do with art that he should dare to attempt decoration caller then you wont help me poet i wont look at ugly things and i wont listen to ugly noises but if you can think of any reasonable plan i dont mind helping you caller i can think of nothing else you dont look like a plumber or a clockwinder i can think of nothing more i have had a terrible ordeal and i am not in the condition to think calmly poet then you will have to leave your hat to its altered destiny caller why cant you think of a plan if youre a poet thinkings rather in your line poet if i could bring my thoughts to contemplate so absurd a thing as a hat for any length of time no doubt i could think of a plan but the very triviality of the theme seems to drive them away caller then i must get it myself poet for heavens sake dont do that think what it means caller i know it will seem absurd but not so absurd as walking through london without it poet i dont mean that but you will make it up you will forgive each other and you will marry her and have a family of noisy pimply children like everyone else and romance will be dead no dont ring that bell go and buy a bayonet or whatever one does buy and join the bosnians caller i tell you i cant without a hat poet what is a hat will you sacrifice for it a beautiful doom think of your bones lying neglected and forgotten lying forlornly because of hopeless love on endless golden sands lying forlorn as keats said what a word forlorn in africa the careless bedouins going past by day at night the lions roar the grievous voice of the desert caller as a matter of fact i dont think youre right in speaking of it as desert the bosnians i believe are only taking it because it is supposed to be the most fertile land in the world poet what of that you will not be remembered by geography and statistics but by goldenmouthed romance and that is how romance sees africa caller well im going to get my hat poet think think if you enter by that door you will never fall among the foremost bosnians you will never die in a faroff lonely land to lie by immense sahara and she will never weep for your beautiful doom and call herself cruel in vain caller hark she is playing the piano it seems to me that she might be unhappy about it for years i dont see much good in that poet no i will comfort her caller im damned if you do look here i dont mind saying im damned if you do poet calm yourself calm yourself i do not mean in that way caller then what on earth do you mean poet i will make songs about your beautiful death glad songs and sad songs they shall be glad because they tell again the noble traditions of the troubadours and sad because they tell of your sorrowful destiny and your hopeless love i shall make legends about your lonely bones telling perhaps how some arabian men finding them in the desert by some oasis memorable in war wonder who loved them and then as i read them to her she weeps perhaps a little and i read instead of the glory of the soldier how it overtops our transitory caller look here im not aware that youve ever been introduced to her poet a trifle a trifle caller it seems to me that youre in rather an undue hurry for me to get a jubu spear in me but im going to get my hat first poet i appeal to you i appeal to you in the name of beautiful battles high deeds and lost causes in the name of lovetales told to cruel maidens and told in vain in the name of stricken hearts broken like beautiful harpstrings i appeal to you i appeal in the ancient holy name of romance do not ring that bell poet you will marry you will sometimes take a ticket with your wife as far as paris perhaps as far as cannes then the family will come a large sprawling family as far as the eye can see youll earn money and feed it and be like all the rest no monument will ever be set up to your memory but servant answers bell caller says something inaudible exit through door poet but let there be graven in brass upon this house romance was born again here out of due time and died young enter laborer and clerk with policeman the music stops policeman anything wrong here poet everythings wrong theyre going to kill romance policeman this gentleman does nt seem quite right somehow laborer theyre none of them quite right today poet my god it is a duet policeman he seems a bit wrong somehow laborer you should a seen the other one
