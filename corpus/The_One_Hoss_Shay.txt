 how the old horse won the bet the broomstick train by oliver wendell holmes with illustrations by howard pyle illustration boston and new york houghton mifflin and company the riverside press cambridge m dccc xcii copyright and by oliver wendell holmes copyright by houghton mifflin co all rights reserved the riverside press cambridge mass usa electrotyped and printed by h o houghton co preface my publishers suggested the bringing together of the three poems here presented to the reader as being to some extent alike in their general character the wonderful onehoss shay is a perfectly intelligible conception whatever material difficulties it presents it is conceivable that a being of an order superior to humanity should so understand the conditions of matter that he could construct a machine which should go to pieces if not into its constituent atoms at a given moment of the future the mind may take a certain pleasure in this picture of the impossible the event follows as a logical consequence of the presupposed condition of things there is a practical lesson to be got out of the story observation shows us in what point any particular mechanism is most likely to give way in a wagon for instance the weak point is where the axle enters the hub or nave when the wagon breaks down three times out of four i think it is at this point that the accident occurs the workman should see to it that this part should never give way then find the next vulnerable place and so on until he arrives logically at the perfect result attained by the deacon unquestionably there is something a little like extravagance in how the old horse won the bet which taxes the credulity of experienced horsemen still there have been a good many surprises in the history of the turf and the trotting course the godolphin arabian was taken from ignoble drudgery to become the patriarch of the english racing stock old dutchman was transferred from between the shafts of a cart to become a champion of the american trotters in his time old blue a famous boston horse of the early decades of this century was said to trot a mile in less than three minutes but i do not find any exact record of his achievements those who have followed the history of the american trotting horse are aware of the wonderful development of speed attained in these last years the lowest time as yet recorded is by maud s in if there are any anachronisms or other inaccuracies in this story the reader will please to remember that the narrators memory is liable to be at fault and if the event recorded interests him will not worry over any little slips or stumbles the terrible witchcraft drama of has been seriously treated as it well deserves to be the story has been told in two large volumes by the rev charles wentworth upham and in a small and more succinct volume based upon his work by his daughterinlaw caroline e upham the delusion commonly spoken of as if it belonged to salem was more widely diffused through the towns of essex county looking upon it as a pitiful and long dead and buried superstition i trust my poem will no more offend the good people of essex county than tam oshanter worries the honest folk of ayrshire the localities referred to are those with which i am familiar in my drives about essex county o w h july illustration list of illustrations the deacons masterpiece

can hear her black cats purr catch a gleam from her wicked eye tail piece illustration the deacons masterpiece or the wonderful onehossshay a logical story illustration the deacons masterpiece have you heard of the wonderful onehoss shay that was built in such a logical way it ran a hundred years to a day and then of a sudden it ah but stay ill tell you what happened without delay scaring the parson into fits frightening people out of their wits have you ever heard of that i say seventeen hundred and fiftyfive georgius secundus was then alive snuffy old drone from the german hive that was the year when lisbontown saw the earth open and gulp her down and braddocks army was done so brown left without a scalp to its crown it was on the terrible earthquakeday that the deacon finished the onehossshay now in building of chaises i tell you what there is always somewhere a weakest spot in hub tire felloe in spring or thill in panel or crossbar or floor or sill illustration a chaise breaks down but doesnt wear out in screw bolt thoroughbrace lurking still find it somewhere you must and will above or below or within or without and thats the reason beyond a doubt a chaise breaks down but doesnt wear out but the deacon swore as deacons do with an i dew vum or an i tell yeou he would build one shay to beat the taown n the keounty n all the kentry raoun it should be so built that it couldn break daown fur said the deacon ts mighty plain thut the weakes place mus stan the strain n the way t fix it uz i maintain is only jest t make that place uz strong uz the rest so the deacon inquired of the village folk where he could find the strongest oak that couldnt be split nor bent nor broke illustration that was for spokes and floor and sills he sent for lancewood to make the thills the crossbars were ash from the straightest trees the panels of whitewood that cuts like cheese but lasts like iron for things like these the hubs of logs from the settlers ellum last of its timber they couldnt sell em never an axe had seen their chips and the wedges flew from between their lip their blunt ends frizzled like celerytips step and propiron bolt and screw spring tire axle and linchpin too steel of the finest bright and blue thoroughbrace bisonskin thick and wide boot top dasher from tough old hide found in the pit when the tanner died that was the way he put her through there said the deacon naow shell dew do i tell you i rather guess she was a wonder and nothing less illustration illustration she was a wonder and nothing less colts grew horses beards turned gray deacon and deaconess dropped away children and grandchildren where were they but there stood the stout old onehossshay as fresh as on lisbonearthquakeday illustration illustration eighteen hundred it came and found the deacons masterpiece strong and sound eighteen hundred increased by ten hahnsum kerridge they called it then eighteen hundred and twenty came running as usual much the same thirty and forty at last arrive and then come fifty and fiftyfive illustration illustration little of all we value here wakes on the morn of its hundredth year without both feeling and looking queer in fact theres nothing that keeps its youth so far as i know but a tree and truth this is a moral that runs at large take it youre welcome no extra charge illustration first of november the earthquakeday there are traces of age in the onehossshay a general flavor of mild decay but nothing local as one may say there couldnt be for the deacons art had made it so like in every part that there wasnt a chance for one to start for the wheels were just as strong as the thills and the floor was just as strong as the sills and the panels just as strong as the floor and the whippletree neither less nor more and the backcrossbar as strong as the fore and spring and axle and hub encore and yet as a whole it is past a doubt in another hour it will be worn out illustration first of november fiftyfive this morning the parson takes a drive now small boys get out of the way here comes the wonderful onehossshay drawn by a rattailed ewenecked bay huddup said the parson off went they illustration illustration the parson was working his sundays text had got to fifthly and stopped perplexed at what the moses was coming next all at once the horse stood still close by the meetnhouse on the hill first a shiver and then a thrill then something decidedly like a spill illustration then something decidedly like a spill and the parson was sitting upon a rock at halfpast nine by the meetnhouse clock just the hour of the earthquake shock what do you think the parson found when he got up and stared around the poor old chaise in a heap or mound as if it had been to the mill and ground you see of course if youre not a dunce how it went to pieces all at once all at once and nothing first just as bubbles do when they burst illustration end of the wonderful onehossshay logic is logic thats all i say illustration how the old horse won the bet dedicated by a contributor to the collegian to the editor of the advocate illustration how the old horse won the bet t was on the famous trottingground the betting men were gathered round from far and near the cracks were there whose deeds the sporting prints declare the swift g m old hirams nag the fleet s h dan pfeiffers brag with these a third and who is he that stands beside his fast b g budd doble whose catarrhal name so fills the nasal trump of fame illustration there too stood many a noted steed of messenger and morgan breed green horses also not a few unknown as yet what they could do and all the hacks that know so well the scourgings of the sunday swell illustration the sunday swell blue are the skies of opening day the bordering turf is green with may the sunshines golden gleam is thrown on sorrel chestnut bay and roan the horses paw and prance and neigh fillies and colts like kittens play and dance and toss their rippled manes shining and soft as silken skeins wagons and gigs are ranged about and fashion flaunts her gay turnout here stands each youthful jehus dream the jointed tandem ticklish team illustration and there in ampler breadth expand the splendors of the fourinhand on faultless ties and glossy tiles the lovely bonnets beam their smiles the styles the man so books avow the styles the woman anyhow from

illustration illustration on faultless ties and glossy tiles the lovely bonnets beam their smiles come on ill bet you two to one ill make him do it will you done what was it who was bound to do i did not hear and cant tell you pray listen till my storys through illustration illustration scarce noticed back behind the rest by cart and wagon rudely prest the parsons lean and bony bay stood harnessed in his onehorse shay lent to his sexton for the day a funeral so the sexton said his mothers uncles wife was dead like lazarus bid to dives feast so looked the poor forlorn old beast his coat was rough his tail was bare the gray was sprinkled in his hair sportsmen and jockeys knew him not and yet they say he once could trot among the fleetest of the town till something cracked and broke him down the steeds the statesmans common lot and are we then so soon forgot ah me i doubt if one of you has ever heard the name old blue whose fame through all this region rung in those old days when i was young bring forth the horse alas he showed not like the one mazeppa rode scantmaned sharpbacked and shakykneed the wreck of what was once a steed lips thin eyes hollow stiff in joints yet not without his knowing points the sexton laughing in his sleeve as if t were all a makebelieve led forth the horse and as he laughed illustration unhitched the breeching from a shaft unclasped the rusty belt beneath drew forth the snaffle from his teeth slipped off his headstall set him free from strap and rein a sight to see illustration so worn so lean in every limb it cant be they are saddling him it is his back the pigskin strides and flaps his lank rheumatic sides with look of mingled scorn and mirth they buckle round the saddlegirth with horsey wink and saucy toss a youngster throws his leg across and so his rider on his back they lead him limping to the track far up behind the startingpoint to limber out each stiffened joint illustration illustration to limber out each stiffened joint as through the jeering crowd he past one pitying look old hiram cast go it ye cripple while ye can cried out unsentimental dan a fastday dinner for the crows budd dobles scoffing shout arose slowly as when the walkingbeam first feels the gathering head of steam with warning cough and threatening wheeze the stiff old charger crooks his knees at first with cautious step sedate as if he dragged a coach of state hes not a colt he knows full well that time is weight and sure to tell no horse so sturdy but he fears the handicap of twenty years as through the throng on either hand the old horse nears the judges stand beneath his jockeys featherweight he warms a little to his gait and now and then a step is tried that hints of something like a stride illustration go through his ear the summons stung as if a battletrump had rung the slumbering instincts long unstirred start at the old familiar word it thrills like flame through every limb what mean his twenty years to him the savage blow his rider dealt fell on his hollow flanks unfelt the spur that pricked his staring hide unheeded tore his bleeding side alike to him are spur and rein he steps a fiveyearold again before the quarter pole was past old hiram said hes going fast long ere the quarter was a half the chuckling crowd had ceased to laugh tighter his frightened jockey clung as in a mighty stride he swung the gravel flying in his track his neck stretched out his ears laid back his tail extended all the while behind him like a rattail file illustration off went a shoe away it spun shot like a bullet from a gun the quaking jockey shapes a prayer from scraps of oaths he used to swear he drops his whip he drops his rein he clutches fiercely for a mane illustration hell lose his hold he sways and reels hell slide beneath those trampling heels the knees of many a horseman quake the flowers on many a bonnet shake and shouts arise from left and right stick on stick on hould tight hould tight cling round his neck and dont let go that pace cant hold there steady whoa but like the sable steed that bore the spectral lover of lenore his nostrils snorting foam and fire no stretch his bony limbs can tire and now the stand he rushes by and stop him stop him is the cry illustration and now the stand he rushes by stand back hes only just begun hes having out three heats in one dont rush in front hell smash your brains but follow up and grab the reins old hiram spoke dan pfeiffer heard and sprang impatient at the word budd doble started on his bay old hiram followed on his gray and off they spring and round they go the fast ones doing all they know illustration illustration look twice they follow at his heels as round the circling course he wheels and whirls with him that clinging boy like hector round the walls of troy still on and on the third time round theyre tailing off theyre losing ground illustration budd dobles nag begins to fail dan pfeiffers sorrel whisks his tail and see in spite of whip and shout old hirams mare is giving out now for the finish at the turn the old horse all the rest astern comes swinging in with easy trot by jove hes distanced all the lot illustration illustration that trot no mortal could explain some said old dutchman come again some took his time at least they tried but what it was could none decide one said he couldnt understand what happened to his second hand one said that couldnt be more like two twenty two or three old hiram settled it at last the time was two too deevelish fast the parsons horse had won the bet it cost him something of a sweat back in the onehoss shay he went the parson wondered what it meant and murmured with a mild surprise and pleasant twinkle of the eyes that funeral must have been a trick or corpses drive at doublequick i shouldnt wonder i declare if brother jehu made the prayer and this is all i have to say about that tough old trotting bay huddup huddup glang goodday illustration back in the onehorseshay he went moral for which this tale is told a horse can trot for all hes old illustration the broomstick train or the return of the witches illustration the broomstick train look out look out boys clear the track the witches are here theyve all come back they hanged them high no use no use what cares a witch for a hangmans noose they buried them deep but they wouldnt lie still for cats and witches are hard to kill they swore they shouldnt and wouldnt die books said they did but they lie they lie a couple of hundred years or so they had knocked about in the world below when an essex deacon dropped in to call and a homesick feeling seized them all for he came from a place they knew full well and many a tale he had to tell illustration illustration they long to visit the haunts of men to see the old dwellings they knew again and ride on their broomsticks all around their wide domain of unhallowed ground in essex county theres many a roof well known to him of the cloven hoof the small square windows are full in view which the midnight hags went sailing through illustration on their welltrained broomsticks mounted high seen like shadows against the sky crossing the track of owls and bats hugging before them their coalblack cats well did they know those gray old wives the sights we see in our daily drives shimmer of lake and shine of sea browns bare hill with its lonely tree it wasnt then as we see it now with one scant scalplock to shade its brow dusky nooks in the essex woods dark dim dantelike solitudes where the treetoad watches the sinuous snake glide through his forests of fern and brake illustration dark dim dantelike solitudes ipswich river its old stone bridge far off andovers indian ridge and many a scene where history tells some shadow of bygone terror dwells of normans woe with its tale of dread illustration illustration of the screeching woman of marblehead the fearful story that turns men pale dont bid me tell it my speech would fail who would not will not if he can bathe in the breezes of fair cape ann rest in the bowers her bays enfold loved by the sachems and squaws of old home where the white magnolias bloom sweet with the bayberrys chaste perfume hugged by the woods and kissed by the sea where is the eden like to thee for that couple of hundred years or so there had been no peace in the world below the witches still grumbling it isnt fair come give us a taste of the upper air weve had enough of your sulphur springs and the evil odor that round them clings we long for a drink that is cool and nice great buckets of water with wenham ice illustration weve served you well upstairs you know youre a good old fellow come let us go i dont feel sure of his being good but he happened to be in a pleasant mood as fiends with their skins full sometimes are hed been drinking with roughs at a boston bar so what does he do but up and shout to a graybeard turnkey let em out to mind his orders was all he knew the gates swung open and out they flew where are our broomsticks the beldams cried illustration youre a good oldfellowcome let us go here are your broomsticks an imp replied theyve been in the place you know so long they smell of brimstone uncommon strong but theyve gained by being left alone just look and youll see how tall theyve grown illustration illustration and where is my cat a vixen squalled yes where are our cats the witches bawled and began to call them all by name as fast as they called the cats they came there was bobtailed tommy and longtailed tim and walleyed jacky and greeneyed jim and splayfoot benny and slimlegged beau and skinny and squally and jerry and joe and many another that came at call it would take too long to count them all all black one could hardly tell which was which but every cat knew his own old witch and she knew hers as hers knew her ah didnt they curl their tails and purr no sooner the withered hags were free than out they swarmed for a midnight spree i couldnt tell all they did in rhymes but the essex people had dreadful times illustration illustration the withered hags were free the swampscott fishermen still relate how a strange seamonster stole their bait how their nets were tangled in loops and knots and they found dead crabs in their lobsterpots poor danvers grieved for her blasted crops and wilmington mourned over mildewed hops a blight played havoc with beverly beans it was all the work of those hateful queans a dreadful panic began at prides where the witches stopped in their midnight rides and there rose strange rumors and vague alarms mid the peaceful dwellers at beverly farms illustration a strange seamonster stole their bait now when the boss of the beldams found that without his leave they were ramping round he called they could hear him twenty miles from chelsea beach to the misery isles the deafest old granny knew his tone without the trick of the telephone illustration come here you witches come here says he at your games of old without asking me ill give you a little job to do that will keep you stirring you godless crew they came of course at their masters call the witches the broomsticks the cats and all illustration he led the hags to a railway train the horses were trying to drag in vain now then says he youve had your fun and here are the cars youve got to run the driver may just unhitch his team we dont want horses we dont want steam you may keep your old black cats to hug but the loaded train youve got to lug since then on many a car youll see a broomstick plain as plain can be on every stick theres a witch astride the string you see to her leg is tied she will do a mischief if she can but the string is held by a careful man and whenever the evilminded witch would cut some caper he gives a twitch illustration as for the hag you cant see her but hark you can hear her black cats purr and now and then as a car goes by you may catch a gleam from her wicked eye often youve looked on a rushing train but just what moved it was not so plain it couldnt be those wires above for they could neither pull nor shove where was the motor that made it go you couldnt guess but now you know illustration catch a gleam from her wicked eye remember my rhymes when you ride again on the rattling rail by the broomstick train illustration the end transcribers note the following typographical
