 fever dream ray bradbury they put him between fresh clean laundered sheets and there was always a newly squeezed glass of thick orange juice on the table under the dim pink lamp all charles had to do was call and morn or dad would stick their heads into his room to see how sick he was the acoustics of the room were fine you could hear the toilet gargling its porcelain throat of mornings you could hear rain tap the roof or sly rnice run in the secret walls or the canary singing in its cage downstairs if you were very alert sickness wasnt too bad he was thirteen charles was it was midseptember with the land beginning to burn with antumn he lay in the bed for three days before the terror overcame him his hand began to change his right hand he looked at it and it was hot and sweating there on the counterpane alone it fluttered it moved a bit then it lay there changing color that afternoon the doctor came again and tapped his thin chest like a little drurn how are you asked the doctor smiling i know dont tell me my cold is fine doctor but i feel awful ha he laughed at his own oftrepeated joke charles lay there and for him that terrible and ancient jest was becoming a reality the joke fixed itself in his mind his mind touched and drew away from it in a pale terror the doctor did not know how cruel he was with his jokes doctor whispered charles lying flat and colorless my hand it doesnt belong to me any more this morning it changed into something else i want you to change it back doctor doctor the doctor showed his teeth and patted his hand it looks fine to me son you just had a little fever dream but it changed doctor oh doctor cried charles pitifully holding up his pale wild hand it did the doctor winked ill give you a pink pill for that he popped a tablet onto charles tongue swallow will it make my hand change back and become me again yes yes the house was silent when the doctor drove off down the road in his car under the quiet blue september sky a clock ticked far below in the kitchen world charles lay looking at his hand it did not change back it was still something else the wind blew outside leaves fell against the cool window at four oclock his other hand changed it seemed almost to become a fever it pulsed and shifted cell by cell it beat like a warm heart the fingernails turned blue and then red it took about an hour for it to change and when it was finished it looked just like any ordinary hand but it was not ordinary it no longer was him any more he lay in a fascinated horror and then fell into an exhausted sleep mother brought the soup up at six he wouldnt touch it i havent any hands he said eyes shut your hands are perfectly good said mother no he wailed my hands are gone i feel like i have stumps oh mama mama hold me hold me im scared she had to feed him herself mama he said get the doctor please again im so sick the doctorll be here tonight at eight she said and went out at seven with night dark and close around the house charles was sitting up in bed when he felt the thing happening to first one leg and then the other mama come quick he screamed but when mama came the thing was no longer happening when she went downstairs he simply lay without fighting as his legs beat and beat grew warm redhot and the room filled with the warmth of his feverish change the glow crept up from his toes to his ankles and then to his knees may i come in the doctor smiled in the doorway doctor cried charles hurry take off my blankets the doctor lifted the blankets tolerantly there you are whole and healthy sweating though a little fever i told you not to move around bad boy he pinched the moist pink cheek did the pills help did your hand change back no no now its my other hand and my legs well well ill have to give you three more pills one for each limb eh my little peach laughed the doctor will they help me please please whatve i got a mild case of scarlet fever complicated by a slight cold is it a germ that lives and has more little germs in me yes are you sure its scarlet fever you havent taken any tests i guess i know a certain fever when i see one said the doctor checking the boys pulse with cool authority charles lay there not speaking until the doctor was crisply packing his black kit then in the silent room the boys voice made a small weak pattern his eyes alight with remembrance i read a book once about petrified trees wood turning to stone about how trees fell and rotted and minerals got in and built up and they look just like trees but theyre not theyre stone he stopped in the quiet warm room his breathing sounded well asked the doctor ive been thinking said charles after a time do germs ever get big i mean in biology class they told us about onecelled animals amoebas and things and how millions of years ago they got together until there was a bunch and they made the first body and more and more cells got together and got bigger and then finally maybe there was a fish and finally here we are and all we are is a bunch of cells that decided to get together to help each other out isnt that right charles wet his feverish lips whats all this about the doctor bent over him ive got to tell you this doctor oh ive got to he cried what would happen oh just pretend please pretend that just like in the old days a lot of microbes got together and wanted to make a bunch and reproduced and made more his white hands were on his chest now crawling toward his throat and they decided to take over a person cried charles take over a person yes become a person me my hands my feet what if a disease somehow knew how to kill a person and yet live after him he screamed the hands were on his neck the doctor moved forward shouting at nine oclock the doctor was escorted out to his car by the mother and father who handed him his bag they conversed in the cool night wind for a few minutes just be sure his hands are kept strapped to his legs said the doctor i dont want him hurting himself will he be all right doctor the mother held to his arm a moment he patted her shoulder havent i been your family physician for thirty years its the fever he imagines things but those bruises on his throat he almost choked himself just you keep him strapped hell be all right in the morning the car moved off down the dark september road at three in the morning charles was still awake in his small black room the bed was damp under his head and his back he was very warm now he no longer had any arms or legs and his body was beginning to change he did not move on the bed but looked at the vast blank ceiling space with insane concentration for a while he had screamed and thrashed but now he was weak and hoarse from it and his mother had gotten up a number of times to soothe his brow with a wet towel now be was silent his hands strapped to his legs he felt the walls of his body change the organs shift the lungs catch fire like burning bellows of pink alcohol the room was lighted up as with the flickerings of a hearth now he had no body it was all gone it was under him but it was filled with a vast pulse of some burning lethargic drug it was as if a guillotine had neatly lopped off his head and his head lay shining on a midnight pillow while the body below still alive belonged to somebody else the disease had eaten his body and from the eating had reproduced itself in feverish duplicate there were the little hand hairs and the fingernails and the scars and the toenails and the tiny mole on his right hip all done again in perfect fashion i am dead he thought ive been killed and yet i live my body is dead it is all disease and nobody will know i will walk around and it will not be me it will be something else it will be something all bad all evil so big and so evil its hard to understand or think about something that will buy shoes and drink water and get married some day maybe and do more evil in the worid than has ever been done now the warmth was stealing up his neck into his cheeks like a hot wine his lips burned his eyelids like leaves caught fire his nostrils breathed out blue flame faintly faintly this will be all he thought itll take my head and my brain and fix each eye and every tooth and all the marks in my brain and every hair and every wrinkle in my ears and therell be nothing left of me he felt his brain fill with a boiling mercury he felt his left eye clench in upon itself and like a snail withdraw shift he was blind in his left eye it no longer belonged to him it was enemy territory his tongue was gone cut out his left cheek was numbed lost his left ear stopped hearing it belonged to someone else now this thing that was being born this mineral thing replacing the wooden log this disease replacing healthy animal cell he tried to scream and he was able to scream loud and high and sharply in the room just as his brain flooded down his right eye and right ear were cut out he was blind and deaf all fire all terror all panic all death his scream stopped before his mother ran through the door to his side it was a good clear morning with a brisk wind that helped carry the doctor up the path before the house in the window above the boy stood fully dressed he did not wave when the doctor waved and called whats this up my god the doctor almost ran upstairs he came gasping into the bedroom what are you doing out of bed he demanded of the boy he tapped his thin chest took his pulse and temperature absolutely amazing normal normal by god i shall never be sick again in my life declared the boy quietly standing there looking out the wide window never i hope not why youre looking fine charles doctor yes charles can i go to school now asked charles tomorrow will be time enough you sound positively eager i am i like school all the kids i want to play with them and wrestle with them and spit on them and play with the girls pigtails and shake the teachers hand and rub my hands on all the cloaks in the cloakroom and i want to grow up and travel and shake hands with people all over the world and be married and have lots of children and go to libraries and handle books and all of that i want to said the boy looking off into the september morning whats the name you called me what the doctor puzzled i called you nothing but charles its better than no name at all i guess the boy shrugged im glad you want to go back to school said the doctor i really anticipate it smiled the boy thank you for your help doctor shake hands glad to they shook hands gravely and the clear wind blew through the open window they shook hands for almost a minute the boy smiling up at the old man and thanking him then laughing the boy raced the doctor downstairs and out to his car his mother and father followed for the happy farewell fit as a fiddle said the doctor incredible and strong said the father he got out of his straps himself during the night didnt you charles did i said the boy you did how oh the boy said that was a long time ago a long time ago they all laughed and while they were laughing the quiet boy moved his bare foot on the sidewalk and merely touched brushed against a number of red ants that was scurrying about on the sidewalk secretly his eyes shining while his parents chatted with the old man he saw the ants hesitate quiver and lie still on the cement he sensed they were cold now goodby the doctor drove away waving the boy walked ahead of his parents as he walked he looked away toward the town and began to hum school days under his breath its good to have him well again said the father listen to him hes so looking forward to school the boy turned quietly he gave each of his parents a crushing hug he kissed them both several times then without a word he bounded up the steps into the house in the parlor before the others entered he quickly opened the bird cage thrust his hand in and petted the yellow canary once then he shut the cage door stood back and waited
