born in ice nora roberts prologue the wild wind raced cursing across the atlantic and pounded its fists over the fields of the west counties hard needlepoint bullets of rain beat on the ground and sliced through a mans flesh to batter his bones flowers that had bloomed brilliantly from spring through autumn blackened under the killing frost in cottages and pubs people gathered around fires and talked of their farms and their roofs the loved ones who had emigrated to germany or the states it hardly mattered whether they had left the day before or a generation ireland was losing its people as it had all but lost its language there was occasional talk about the troubles that endless war in the north but belfast was far from the village of kilmilhil in miles and in emotion people worried more about their crops their animals and the weddings and wakes that would come with winter a few miles out of the village in a kitchen warmed with the heat and scents of baking brianna concannon looked out of the window as the iceedged rain attacked her garden ill lose the columbine im thinking and the foxglove it broke her heart to think of it but shed dug up what she could and stored the plants in the crowded little cabin out back the gale had come so quickly youll plant more in spring maggie studied her sisters profile brie worried about her flowers like a mother over her babes with a sigh maggie rubbed her own bulging belly it still astonished her that it was she who was married and carrying a child and not her homeloving sister youll love every minute of it i suppose what i need is a greenhouse ive been looking at pictures i think it could be done and she could probably afford it by spring if she was careful daydreaming a little about the plants that would flourish in their new glass enclosure she slipped a fresh batch of cranberry muffins from the oven maggie had brought her the berries all the way from a dublin market youll take this home with you i will yes maggie grinned and snatched one from the basket tossing it from hand to hand to cool it enough before she bit in after ive eaten my fill i swear to you rogan all but weighs every morsel i put in my mouth he wants you and the baby healthy oh he does and i think hes worrying about how much of me is baby and how much is fat brianna eyed her sister maggie had grown round and soft and there was a rosy contentment about her as she approached the last trimester of her pregnancy that was a sharp contrast to the bundle of energy and nerve brianna was accustomed to shes happy brianna thought in love and knows her love is well returned you have put on more than a few margaret mary brianna said and watched wicked humor rather than temper light maggies eyes im having a contest with one of murphys cows and im winning she finished off the muffin reached shamelessly for another in a few weeks ill not be able to see past my belly to the end of my pipe to blow glass ill have to switch to lamp work you could take a vacation from your glass brianna pointed out i know rogans told you youve enough done already for all of his galleries and what would i do besides die of boredom ive got an idea for a special piece for the new gallery here in clare which wont open until spring by then rogan will have made good on his threat to tie me to the bed if i make a move toward my shop she sighed but brie suspected maggie didnt mind the threat so much didnt mind rogans subtle domineering ways she was afraid she was mellowing i want to work while i can maggie added and its good to be home even in such weather i suppose youve got no guests coming as it happens i do a yank next week brianna freshened maggies cup of tea then her own before sitting down the dog who had been waiting patiently beside her chair laid his big head in her lap a yank just one a man mmmm brianna stroked concobars head its a writer hes booked a room wants board as well for an indefinite period hes paid a month in advance a month at this time of year amused maggie looked out as the wind shook the kitchen windows welcoming weather it wasnt and they say artists are eccentric what sort of writer is he then a mystery type ive read a few and hes good hes won awards and had films made from them a successful writer a yank spending the dead of winter at a b and b in clare county well theyll have plenty to say about that at the pub maggie licked crumbs from her fingers and studied her sister with an artists eye brianna was a lovely woman all rose and gold with creamy skin and a fine trim figure a classic oval face a mouth that was soft unpainted and often too serious pale green eyes that tended to dream long fluid limbs hair that held quiet firethick slippery hair that often escaped its pins and she was softhearted maggie thought entirely too naive despite her contact with strangers as the owner of a b and b about what went on out in the world beyond her own garden gate i dont know as i like it brie you alone in the house with a man for weeks at a time im often alone with guests maggie thats how i make my living you rarely have only one and in the middle of winter i dont know when we might have to go back to dublin and not be here to look after me brianna smiled more amused than offended maggie im a grown woman a grown businesswoman who can look after herself youre always too busy looking after everyone else dont start on about mother briannas lips tightened i do very little now that shes settled with lottie in the cottage i know exactly what you do maggie tossed back running every time she wags her finger listening to her complaints dragging her off to the doctors every time she imagines herself with a new fatal disease maggie held up a hand furious at herself for being sucked yet again into the anger and the guilt thats not my concern just now this man grayson thane brianna supplied more than grateful the topic had turned away from their mother a respected american author who has designs on a quiet room in a wellrun establishment in the west of ireland he doesnt have designs on his landlady she picked up her tea sipped and hes going to pay for my greenhouse chapter one it wasnt unusual for brianna to have a guest or two at blackthorn cottage during the worst of winters storms but january was slow and more often than not her home was empty she didnt mind the solitude or the hellhound howl of the wind or even the leaden sky that spewed rain and ice day after bitter day it gave her time to plan she enjoyed travelers expected or not from a business standpoint the pounds and pence counted but beyond that brianna liked company and the opportunity to serve and make a temporary home for those who passed her way she had in the years since her father died and her mother moved out turned the house into the home she had longed for as a child with turf fires and lace curtains and the scents of baking coming from the kitchen still it had been maggie and maggies art that had made it possible for brianna to expand bit by bit it wasnt something brianna forgot but the house was hers their father had understood her love and her need for it she tended her legacy as she would a child perhaps it was the weather that made her think of her father he had died on a day very much like this now and again at odd moments when she found herself alone she discovered she still carried little pockets of grief with memories good and bad tucked into them work was what she needed she told herself turning away from the window before she could brood for long with the rain pelting down she decided to postpone a trip into the village and instead tackle a task she had put off for too long no one was expected that day and her single reservation wasnt due until the end of the week with her dog trooping behind her brianna carted broom bucket rags and an empty carton up to the attic she cleaned up here with regularity no dust was allowed in briannas house for long but there were boxes and trunks she had ignored in her daytoday routine no more she told herself and propped open the attic door this time she would make a clean sweep and she would not allow sentiment to prevent her from dealing with leftover memories if the room was cleaned out properly once and for all she thought she might be able to afford the materials and labor necessary to remodel it a cozy loft room it could be she mused leaning on her broom with one of those ceiling windows and perhaps a dormer soft yellow paint to bring the sun inside polish and one of her hooked rugs on the floor she could already see it the pretty bed covered by a colorful quilt a sugan chair a little writing table and if she had brianna shook her head and laughed at herself she was getting ahead of herself always dreaming con she murmured rubbing the dogs head and whats needed here is elbow grease and ruthlessness boxes first she decided it was time to clean out old papers old clothes thirty minutes later she had neat piles one she would take to the church for the poor another would be rags the last she would keep ah look at this con reverently she took out a small white christening gown gently shaking out the folds faint wisps of lavender haunted the air tiny buttons and narrow edges of lace decorated the linen her grandmothers handiwork brianna knew and smiled he saved it she murmured her mother would never had given such sentimental thought to future generations maggie and i would have worn this you see and da packed it away for our children there was a pang so familiar she barely felt it there was no babe sleeping in a cradle for her no soft bundle waiting to be held and nursed and loved but maggie she thought would want this taking care she folded the gown again the next box was filled with papers that made her sigh she would have to read them scan them at least her father had saved every scrap of correspondence there would be newspaper clippings as well his ideas he would have said for new ventures always a new venture she set aside various articles hed clipped out on inventions foresting carpentry shopkeeping none on farming she noticed with a smile a farmer hed never been she found letters from relatives from companies hed written to in america in australia in canada and here the proof of purchase for the old truck theyd had when shed been a child one document stopped her made her frown in puzzlement it looked like some sort of stock certificate triquarter mining in wales from the date it seemed hed purchased it only a few weeks before he died triquarter mining another venture da she mused spending money we barely had well she would have to write to this triquarter company and see what was to be done it was unlikely the stock was worth more than the paper it was printed on such had always been tom concannons luck with business deals that bright brass ring hed forever reached for had never fit the palm of his hand she dug further into the box amused herself with letters from cousins and uncles and aunts they had loved him everyone had loved him almost she corrected thinking of her mother pushing that thought aside she took out a trio of letters tied with a faded red ribbon the return address was new york but that was no surprise the concannons had a number of friends and relations in the states the name however was a mystery to her amanda dougherty brianna unfolded the letter scanned the neat conventschool writing as her breath caught in her throat she read again carefully word for word my darling tommy i told you i wouldnt write perhaps i wont send this letter but i need to pretend at least that i can talk to you ive been back in new york for only a day already you seem so far away and the time we had together all the more precious i have been to confession and received my penance yet in my heart nothing that passed between us is a sin love cannot be a sin and i will always love you one day if god is kind we will find a way to be together but if that never happens i want you to know that ill treasure every moment we were given i know its my duty to tell you to honor the sacrament of your marriage to devote yourself to the two babies you love so much and i do but however selfish it is i also ask that sometime when spring comes to clare and the shannon is bright with sunlight you think of me and how for those few short weeks you loved me and i love you always amanda love letters she thought dully to her father written she saw staring at the date when she was an infant her hands chilled how was a woman a grown woman of twentyeight years supposed to react when she learned her father had loved a woman other than his wife her father with his quick laugh his useless schemes these were words written for no ones eyes but his and yet how could she not read them with her heart pounding thickly in her chest brianna unfolded the next my darling tommy i have read and read your letter until i can see every word in my head my heart breaks to think of you so unhappy i too often look out to sea and picture you gazing across the water toward me there is so much i wish to tell you but im afraid it will only add to your heartache if there is no love with your wife there must be duty there is no need for me to tell you that your children are your first concern i know have known all along that they are first in your heart and in your thoughts god bless you tommy for thinking also of me and for the gift you gave me i thought my life would be empty now it will never be anything but full and rich i love you now even more than i did when we parted dont grieve when you think of me but think of me always amanda love brianna thought as her eyes welled with tears there was such love here though so little had been said who had she been this amanda how had they met and how often had her father thought of this woman how often had he wished for her dashing a tear away brianna opened the last letter my darling i have prayed and prayed before writing this ive asked the holy mother to help me know what is right what is fair to you i cant be sure i can only hope that what i tell you will give you joy not grief i remember the hours we spent together in my little room at the inn overlooking the shannon how sweet and gentle you were how blinded we both were by the love that swept through us i have never known nor will i know again that deep abiding love so am i grateful that though we can never be together i will have something precious to remind me that i was loved im carrying your child tommy please be happy for me im not alone and im not afraid perhaps i should be ashamed unmarried pregnant by another womans husband perhaps the shame will come but for now i am only full of joy i have known for weeks but could not find the courage to tell you i find it now feeling the first quickening of the life we made inside me do i have to tell you how much this child will be loved i have already imagined holding our baby in my arms please my darling for the sake of our child let there be no grief or guilt in your heart and for the sake of our child i am going away though i will think of you every day every night i will not write again i will love you all of my life and whenever i look at the life we created in those magic hours near the shannon i will love you more give whatever you feel for me to your children and be happy always amanda a child as her eyes swam with tears brianna covered her mouth with her hand a sister a brother dear god somewhere there was a man or woman bound to her by blood they would be close in age perhaps share the same coloring the same features what could she do what could her father have done all those years ago had he searched for the woman and his baby had he tried to forget no gently brianna smoothed the letters he hadnt tried to forget hed kept her letters always she closed her eyes sitting in the dimly lit attic and she thought he had loved his amanda always she needed to think before she told maggie what shed found brianna thought best when she was busy she could no longer face the attic but there were other things that could be done she scrubbed and polished and baked the simple hominess of chores the pleasure of the scents they created lightened her spirits she added turf to the fires brewed tea and settled down to sketch out ideas for her greenhouse the solution would come in time she told herself after more than twentyfive years a few days of thought would hurt no one if a part of the delay was cowardice a weak need to avoid the whip of her sisters emotions she recognized it brianna never claimed to be a brave woman in her practical way she composed a polite businesslike letter to triquarter mining in wales and set it aside to be posted the next day she had a list of chores for the morning rain or shine by the time shed banked the fires for the night she was grateful maggie had been too busy to drop by another day perhaps two brianna told herself and she would show her sister the letters but tonight she would relax let her mind empty an indulgence was what she needed brianna decided in truth her back was aching just a bit from overdoing her scrubbing a long bath with some of the bubbles maggie had brought her from paris a cup of tea a book she would use the big tub upstairs and treat herself like a guest rather than her narrow bed in the room off the kitchen she would sleep in splendor in what she thought of as the bridal suite were kings tonight con she told the dog as she poured bubbles lavishly under the stream of water a supper tray in bed a book written by our soontobe guest a very important yank remember she added as con thumped his tail on the floor she slipped out of her clothes and into the hot fragrant water the sigh rose up from her toes a love story might be more appropriate to the moment she thought than a thriller with the title of the bloodstone legacy but brianna settled back in the tub and eased into the story of a woman haunted by her past and threatened by her present it caught her so much so that when her water had chilled she held the book in one hand reading as she dried off with the other shivering she tugged on a long flannel nightgown unpinned her hair only ingrained habit had her setting the book aside long enough to tidy the bath but she didnt bother with the supper tray instead she snuggled into bed pulling the quilt up close she barely heard the wind kick at the windows the rain slash at them courtesy of grayson thanes book brianna was in the sultry summer of the southern united states hunted by a murderer it was past midnight when fatigue defeated her she fell asleep with the book still in her hands the dog snoring at the foot of the bed and the wind howling like a frightened woman she dreamed of course of terror grayson thane was a man of impulses because he recognized it he generally took the disasters that grew from them as philosophically as the triumphs at the moment he was forced to admit that the impulse to drive from dublin to clare in the dead of winter in the face of one of the most badtempered storms hed ever experienced had probably been a mistake but it was still an adventure and he lived his life by them hed had a flat outside of limerick a puncture gray corrected when in rome speak the lingo by the time hed changed the tire hed looked and felt like a drowned rat despite the macintosh hed picked up in london the week before hed gotten lost twice finding himself creeping down narrow winding roads that were hardly more than ditches his research had told him that getting lost in ireland was part of its charm he was trying hard to remember that he was hungry soaked to the skin and afraid he would run out of gaspetrolbefore he found anything remotely like an inn or village in his mind he went over the map visualizing was a talent hed been born with and he could with little effort reproduce every line of the careful map his hostess had sent him the trouble was it was pitch dark the rain washed over his windshield like a roaring river and the wind was buffeting his car on this godforsaken excuse for a road as if the mercedes was a tinkertoy he wished violently for coffee when the road forked gray took his chances and guided the car to the left if he didnt find the inn or something like in it another ten miles hed sleep in the damn car and try again in the morning it was a pity he couldnt see any of the countryside he had a feeling in the dark desolation of the storm it would be exactly what he was looking for he wanted his book here among the cliffs and fields of western ireland with the fierce atlantic threatening and the quiet villages huddled against it and he might just have his tired worldweary hero arriving in the teeth of a gale he squinted into the gloom a light he hoped to christ it was he caught a glimpse of a sign swinging hard in the wind gray reversed aimed the headlights and grinned the sign read blackthorn cottage his sense of direction hadnt failed him after all he hoped his hostess proved out the legend of irish hospitalityhe was two days early after all and it was two in the morning gray looked for a driveway saw nothing but soaked hedges with a shrug he stopped the car in the road pocketed the keys he had all hed need for the night in a knapsack on the seat beside him swinging it with him he left the car where it was and stepped into the storm it slapped him like an angry woman all teeth and nails he staggered almost plowed through the drenched hedges of fuchsia and through more luck than design all but ran into the garden gate gray opened it then fought it closed again he wished he could see the house more clearly there was only an impression of shape and size through the dark with that single light shining in the window upstairs he used it like a beacon and began to dream of coffee no one answered his knock with the wind screaming he doubted anyone would hear a battering ram it took him less than ten seconds to decide to open the door himself again there were only impressions the storm at his back the warmth within there were scentslemon polish lavender and rosemary he wondered if the old irishwoman who ran the inn made her own potpourri he wondered if shed wake up and fix him a hot meal then he heard the growl deep feral and tensed his head whipped up his eyes narrowed then his mind for one stunning moment blanked later he would think it was a scene from a book one of his own perhaps the beautiful woman the long white gown billowing her hair spilling like fired gold down her shoulders her face was pale in the swaying light of the candle she held in one hand her other hand was clutched at the collar of a dog that looked and snarled like a wolf a dog whose shoulders reached her waist she stared down at him from the top of the steps like a vision he had conjured she might have been carved from marble or ice she was so still so utterly perfect then the dog strained forward with a movement that rippled her gown she checked him youre letting the rain in she said in a voice that only added to the fantasy soft musical lilting of the ireland hed come to discover sorry he fumbled behind him for the door shutting it so that the storm became only a backdrop her heart was still thudding the noise and cons response had wakened her from a dream of pursuit and terror now brianna stared down at a man in black shapeless but for his face which was shadowed when he stepped closer she kept her trembling hand tight on cons collar a long narrow face she saw now a poets face with its dark curious eyes and solemn mouth a pirates face hardened by those prominent bones and the long sunstreaked hair that curled damp around it silly to be afraid she scolded herself he was just a man after all are you lost then she asked him no he smiled slow easy im found this is blackthorn cottage it is yes im grayson thane im a couple days early but miss concannons expecting me oh brianna murmured something to the dog gray didnt catch but it had the effect of relaxing those bunched canine muscles i was looking for you on friday mr thane but youre welcome she started down the steps the dog at her side the candlelight wavering im brianna concannon she offered a hand he stared at it a moment hed been expecting a nice homey woman with graying hair tucked back in a bun i woke you he said foolishly we usually sleep here in the middle of the night come in by the fire she walked to the parlor switching on the lights after setting the candle aside blowing it out she turned to take his wet coat its a terrible night for traveling so i discovered he wasnt shapeless under the mac though he wasnt as tall as briannas uneasy imagination had made him he was lean and wiry like a boxer she thought then smiled at herself poet pirate boxer the man was a writer and a guest warm yourself mr thane ill make you some tea shall i or would you rather i shed started to offer to show him to his room and remembered that she was sleeping in it ive been dreaming of coffee for the last hour if it isnt too much trouble its not a problem no problem at all make yourself comfortable it was too pretty a scene to spend alone he decided ill just come in the kitchen with you i feel bad enough about dragging you out of bed at this hour he held out a hand for con to sniff this is some dog for a minute i took him for a wolf a wolfhound he is her mind was busy figuring details youre welcome to sit in the kitchen are you hungry then he rubbed cons head and grinned down at her miss concannon i think i love you she flushed at his compliment well you give your heart easily then if for no more than a bowl of soup not from what ive heard of your cooking oh she led the way into the kitchen and hung his dripping coat on a hook by the rear door a friend of a cousin of my editor stayed here a year or so ago the word was that the hostess of the blackthorn cooked like an angel he hadnt heard she looked like one as well thats a fine compliment brianna put on the kettle then ladeled soup into a pot for heating im afraid i can only offer you plain fare tonight mr thane but youll not go to your bed hungry she took soda bread from a bin and sliced it generously have you traveled long today i started out late from dublin id planned to stay another day but i had the itch he smiled taking the bread she set on the table and biting into the first piece before she could offer him butter it was time to get on the road do you run this place alone i do im afraid youll have a lack of company this time of year i didnt come for company he said watching as she measured out coffee the kitchen was beginning to smell like heaven for work you said i think it must be wonderful to be able to tell stories it has its moments i like yours it was simply said as she reached into a cupboard for a stoneware bowl glazed in deep blue he raised a brow people usually began to ask dozens of questions at this point how do you write where do you get your ideasthe most hated of questionshow do you get published and questions were usually followed up by the deathless information that the inquirer had a story to tell but that was all she said gray found himself smiling again thanks sometimes i do too he leaned forward sniffed deeply when she set the bowl of soup in front of him it doesnt smell like plain fare to me its vegetable with a bit of beef i can make you a sandwich if you like no this is great he sampled sighed really great he studied her again did her skin always look so soft and flushed he wondered or was it sleepiness im trying to be sorry i woke you he said and continued to eat this is making it tough a good inns always open to a traveler mr thane she set his coffee beside him signaled the dog who immediately stood from his perch beside the kitchen table help yourself to another bowl if you like ill tend to your room she hurried out quickening her steps as she came to the stairs shed have to change the sheets on the bed the towels in the bath it didnt occur to her to offer him one of the other rooms as her only guest he was entitled to the best she had she worked quickly and was just plumping the pillows in their laceedged cases when she heard the sound at the door her first reaction was distress to see him standing in the doorway her next was resignation it was her home after all she had a right to use any part of it i was giving myself a bit of a holiday she began and tugged at the quilt odd he thought that a woman performing the simple task of tucking in sheets should look so outrageously sexy he must be more tired than hed thought i seemed to have dragged you from your bed in more ways than one it wasnt necessary for you to move out this is the room youre paying for its warm ive built the fire up and youve your own bath if you she broke off because hed come up behind her the prickling down her spine had her stiffening but he only reached for the book on the night table brianna cleared her throat and stepped back i fell asleep reading it she began then went wideeyed in distress i dont mean to say it put me to sleep i just he was smiling she noted no he was grinning at her the corners of her mouth tugged in response it gave me nightmares thank you she relaxed again automatically turning sheets and quilt down in welcome and you coming in from the storm had me imagining the worst i was sure the killer had popped right out of the book bloody knife in hand and who is he she cocked a brow i cant say but ive my suspicions youve a clever way of twisting the emotions mr thane gray he said handing her the book after all in a convoluted sort of way were sharing a bed he took her hand before she could think of how to respond then left her unsettled by raising it to his lips thanks for the soup youre welcome sleep well he didnt doubt he would brianna had hardly gone out and closed his door when he stripped off his clothes and tumbled naked into the bed there was a faint scent of lilacs in the air lilacs and some summer meadow scent he recognized as briannas hair he fell asleep with a smile on his face chapter two it was still raining the first thing gray noticed when he pried his eyes open in the morning was the gloom it could have been any time from dawn to dusk the old clock on the stone mantel said ninefifteen he was optimistic enough to bet it was am he hadnt studied the room the night before travel fatigue and the pretty sight of brianna concannon making his bed had fuzzed his brain he did so now warm under the pooling quilt the walls were papered so that tiny sprigs of violets and rosebuds climbed from floor to ceiling the fire gone cold now had been set in a stone hearth and bricks of turf were set in a painted box beside it there was a desk that looked old and sturdy its surface was polished to a high gloss a brass lamp an old inkwell and a glass bowl of potpourri stood on it a vase of dried flowers was centered on a mirrored dresser two chairs covered in a soft rose flanked a small occasional table there was a braided rug on the floor that picked up the muted tones of the room and prints of wildflowers on the wall gray leaned against the headboard yawned he didnt need ambience when he worked but he appreciated it all in all he thought hed chosen well he considered rolling over going back to sleep he hadnt yet closed the cage door behind himan analogy he often used for writing chilly rainy mornings anywhere in the world were meant to be spent in bed but he thought of his landlady pretty rosycheeked brianna curiosity about her had him gingerly setting his feet on the chilly floor at least the water ran hot he thought as he stood groggily under the shower and the soap smelled lightly and practically of a pine forest traveling as he did hed faced a great many icy showers the simple hominess of the bath the white towels with their charming touch of embroidery suited his mood perfectly then again his surroundings usually suited him from a tent in the arizona desert to plush hotels on the riviera gray liked to think he twisted his setting to fit his needsuntil of course his needs changed for the next few months he figured the cozy inn in ireland would do just fine particularly with the added benefit of his lovely landlady beauty was always a plus he saw no reason to shave and pulled on jeans and a tattered sweatshirt since the wind had died considerably he might take a tramp over the fields after breakfast soak up a little atmosphere but it was breakfast that sent him downstairs he wasnt surprised to find her in the kitchen the room seemed to have been designed for herthe smoky hearth the bright walls the neatasapin counters shed scooped her hair up this morning he noted he imagined she thought the knot on top of her head was practical and perhaps it was he mused but the fact that strands escaped to flutter and curl around her neck and cheeks made the practical alluring it probably was a bad idea all around to be allured by his landlady she was baking something and the scent of it made his mouth water surely it was the scent of food and not the sight of her in her trim white apron that had his juices running she turned then her arms full of a huge bowl the contents of which she continued to beat with a wooden spoon she blinked once in surprise then smiled in cautious welcome good morning youll want your breakfast ill have whatever im smelling no you wont in a competent manner he had to admire she poured the contents of a bowl into a pan its not done yet and what it is is a cake for tea apple he said sniffing the air cinnamon your nose is right can you handle an irish breakfast or will you be wanting something lighter light isnt what i had in mind fine then the dining rooms through the door there ill bring you in some coffee and buns to hold you can i eat in here he gave her his most charming smile and leaned against the doorjamb or does it bother you to have people watch you cook or just watch her he thought do anything at all not at all some of her guests preferred it though most liked to be served she poured him coffee she already had heating you take it black thats right he sipped it standing watching her did you grow up in this house i did she slid fat sausages in a pan i thought it seemed more of a home than an inn its meant to we had a farm you see but sold off most of the land we kept the house and the little cottage down the way where my sister and her husband live from time to time from time to time he has a home in dublin as well he owns galleries shes an artist oh what kind she smiled a little as she went about the cooking most people assumed artist meant painter a fact which irritated maggie always a glass artist she blows glass brianna gestured to the bowl in the center of the kitchen table it bled with melting pastels its rim fluid like rainwashed petals thats her work impressive curious he moved closer ran a finger tip around the wavy rim concannon he murmured then chuckled to himself damn me m m concannon the irish sensation briannas eyes danced with pleasure do they call her that really oh shell love it pride flashed in and you recognized her work i ought to i just bought ai dont know what the hell it is a sculpture worldwide galleries london two weeks ago rogans gallery her husband handy he went to the stove to top off his cup himself the frying sausages smelled almost as good as his hostess its an amazing piece icy white glass with this pulse of fire inside i thought it looked like the fortress of solitude at her blank look he laughed youre not up on your american comic books i take it supermans private sanctum in the arctic i think shell like that she will maggies big on private sanctums in an unconscious habit she tucked loose hair back into pins her nerves were humming a little she supposed it was due to the way he stared at her that frank and unapologetic appraisal that was uncomfortably intimate it was the writer in him she told herself and dropped potatoes into the spitting grease theyre building a gallery here in clare she continued itll be open in the spring heres porridge to start you off while the rest is cooking porridge it was perfect a rainy morning in an irish cottage and porridge in a thick brown bowl grinning he sat down and began to eat are you setting a book here in ireland she glanced over her shoulder is it all right to ask sure thats the plan lonely countryside rainy fields towering cliffs he shrugged tidy little villages postcards but what passions and ambitions lie beneath now she laughed turning bacon i dont know if youll find our village passions and ambitions up to your scope mr thane gray yes gray she took an egg broke it onehanded into the sizzling skillet now mine ran pretty high when one of murphys cows broke through the fence and trampled my roses last summer and as i recall tommy duggin and joe ryan had a bloody fistfight outside omalleys pub not long back over a woman no over a soccer game on the television but then they were a wee bit drunk at the time im told and made it up well enough once their heads stopped ringing well fictions nothing but a lie anyway but its not her eyes softly green and serious met his as she set a plate in front of him its a different kind of truth it would be your truth at the time of the writing wouldnt it her perception surprised and almost embarrassed him yes yes it would satisfied she turned back to the stove to heap sausage a rasher of bacon eggs potato pancakes onto a platter youll be a sensation in the village we irish are wild for writers you know im no yeats she smiled pleased when he transferred healthy portions of food onto his plate but you dont want to be do you he looked up crunching into his first slice of bacon had she pegged him so accurately so quickly he wondered he who prided himself on his own aura of mysteryno past no future before he could think of a response the kitchen door crashed open and a whirlwind of rain and woman came in some knothead left his car smack in the middle of the road outside the house brie maggie stopped dragged off a dripping cap and eyed gray guilty he said lifting a hand i forgot ill move it no rush now she waved him back into his seat and dragged off her coat finish your breakfast ive time youd be the yank writer would you twice guilty and youd be m m concannon i would my sister maggie brianna said as she poured tea grayson thane maggie sat with a little sigh of relief the baby was kicking up a storm of its own a bit early are you change of plans she was a sharper version of brianna gray thought redder hair greener eyesedgier eyes your sister was kind enough not to make me sleep in the yard oh shes a kind one brie is maggie helped herself to a piece of the bacon on the platter apple cake maggie asked sniffing the air for tea brianna took one pan out of the oven slipped another in you and rogan are welcome to some maybe well come by she took a bun from the basket on the table and began to nibble plan to stay awhile do you maggie dont harass my guest ive some extra buns if you want to take some home im not leaving yet rogans on the phone will be as far as i can tell until doomsdays come and gone i was heading to the village for some bread ive plenty to spare maggie smiled bit into the bun again i thought you might she turned those sharp green eyes on gray she bakes enough for the whole village artistic talent runs in the family gray said easily after heaping strawberry jam on a piece of bread he passed the jar companionably to maggie you with glass brianna with cooking without shame he eyed the cake cooling on top of the stove how long until tea maggie grinned at him i may like you i may like you back he rose ill move the car if youd just pull it into the street he gave brianna a blank look what street beside the housethe driveway youd call it will you need help with your luggage no i can handle it nice to have met you maggie and you maggie licked her fingers waited until she heard the door shut better to look at than his picture in back of his books he is you wouldnt think a writer would have a build like that all tough and muscled well aware maggie was looking for a reaction brianna kept her back turned i suppose hes nicely put together i wouldnt think a married woman going into her sixth month of pregnancy would pay his build much mind maggie snorted ive a notion every woman would pay him mind and if you havent wed best be having more than your eyes checked my eyes are fine thank you and arent you the one who was worried about me being alone with him that was before i decided to like him with a little sigh brianna glanced toward the kitchen doorway she doubted she had much time brianna moistened her lips kept her hands busy with tidying the breakfast dishes maggie id be glad if you could find time to come by later i need to talk to you about something talk now no i cant she glanced at the kitchen doorway we need to be private its important youre upset i dont know if im upset or not did he do something the yank despite her bulk maggie was out of her chair and ready to fight no no its nothing to do with him exasperated brianna set her hands on her hips you just said you liked him not if hes upsetting you well hes not dont press me about it now will you come by later once im sure hes settled of course i will concerned maggie brushed a hand over briannas shoulder do you want rogan to come if he can yes brianna decided thinking of maggies condition yes please ask him to come with you before tea thentwo three oclock that would be good take the buns maggie and the bread i want to help mr thane settle in there was nothing brianna dreaded more than confrontations angry words bitter emotions she had grown up in a house where the air had always simmered with them resentments boiling into blowups disappointments flashing into shouts in defense she had always tried to keep her own feelings controlled steering as far to the opposite pole as possible from the storms and rages that had served as her sisters shield to their parents misery she could admit to herself that she had often wished to wake one morning and discover her parents had decided to ignore church and tradition and go their separate ways but more often too often she had prayed for a miracle the miracle of having her parents discover each other again and reigniting the spark that had drawn them together so many years before now she understood at least in part why that miracle could never have happened amanda the womans name had been amanda had her mother known brianna wondered had she known that the husband shed come to detest had loved another did she know there was a child grown now who was a result of that reckless forbidden love she could never ask would never ask brianna promised herself the horrible scene it would cause would be more than she could bear already she had spent most of the day dreading sharing what shed discovered with her sister knowing for she knew maggie well that there would be hurt and anger and souldeep disillusionment shed put it off for hours the cowards way she knew and it shamed her but she told herself she needed time to settle her own heart before she could take on the burden of maggies gray was the perfect distraction helping him settle into his room answering his questions about the nearby villages and the countryside and questions he had by the dozen by the time she pointed him off toward ennis she was exhausted his mental energy was amazing reminding her of a contortionist shed once seen at a fair twisting and turning himself into outrageous shapes then popping out only to twist and turn again to relax she got down on hands and knees and scrubbed the kitchen floor it was barely two when she heard cons welcoming barks the tea was steeping her cakes frosted and the little sandwiches shed made cut into neat triangles brianna wrung her hands once then opened the kitchen door to her sister and brotherinlaw did you walk over then sweeney claims i need exercise maggies face was rosy her eyes dancing she took one long deep sniff of the air and i will after tea shes greedy these days rogan hung his coat and maggies on hooks by the door he might have worn old trousers and sturdy walking shoes but nothing could disguise what his wife would have termed the dublin in him tall dark elegant he would be in black tie or rags its lucky you asked us for tea brianna shes cleaned out our pantry well weve plenty here go sit by the fire and ill bring it out were not guests maggie objected the kitchenll do for us ive been in it all day it was a lame excuse there was no more appealing room in the house for her but she wanted needed the formality of the parlor for what needed to be done and theres a nice fire laid ill take the tray rogan offered the minute they were settled in the parlor maggie reached for a cake take a sandwich rogan told her he treats me more like a child than a woman whos carrying one but she took the sandwich first ive been telling rogan about your very attractive yank long goldtipped hair sturdy muscles and big brown eyes isnt he joining us for tea were early for tea rogan pointed out ive read his books he said to brianna he has a clever way of plunging the reader into the turmoil i know she smiled a little i fell asleep last night with the light on hes gone out for a drive to ennis and about he was kind enough to post a letter for me the easiest way brianna thought was often through the back door i found some papers when i was up in the attic yesterday havent we been through that business before maggie asked we left a lot of das boxes untouched when mother was here it seemed best not to bring it up shed have done nothing but rant and rave maggie scowled into her tea you shouldnt have to go through his papers on your own brie i dont mind ive been thinking i might turn the attic into a loft room for guests more guests maggie rolled her eyes youre overrun with them now spring and summer i like having people in the house it was an old argument one they would never see through the same eyes at any rate it was past time to go through things there were some clothes as well some no more than rags now but i found this she rose and went to a small box she took out the lacy white gown its grannys work im sure da would have saved it for his grandchildren oh everything about maggie softened her eyes her mouth her voice she held out her hands took the gown into them so tiny she murmured even as she stroked the linen the baby inside her stirred i thought your family might have one put aside as well rogan but well use this thank you brie one look at his wifes face had decided him here margaret mary maggie took the handkerchief he offered and wiped her eyes the books say its hormones i always seem to be spilling over ill put it back for you after replacing the gown brianna took the next step and offered the stock certificate i found this as well da must have bought it or invested whatever it is shortly before he died a glance at the paper had maggie sighing another of his moneymaking schemes she was nearly as sentimental over the stock certificate as shed been over the baby gown how like him so he thought hed go into mining did he well hed tried everything else rogan frowned over the certificate would you like me to look into this company see whats what ive written to them mr thanes posting the letter for me itll come to nothing i imagine none of tom concannons schemes ever had but you might keep the paper for me until i hear back its ten thousand shares rogan pointed out maggie and brianna smiled at each other and if its worth more than the paper its printed on hell have broken his record maggie shrugged and treated herself to a cake he was always after investing in something or starting a new business it was his dreams that were big rogan and his heart briannas smile dimmed i found something else something i need to show you letters he was famous for writing them no brianna interrupted before maggie could launch into one of her stories do it now she ordered herself when her heart shied back do it quickly these were written to him there are three of them and i think its best if you read them for yourself maggie could see briannas eyes had gone cool and remote a defense she knew against anything from temper to heartache all right brie saying nothing brianna picked up the letters put them in maggies hand maggie had only to look at the return address on the first envelope for her heartbeat to thicken she opened the letter brianna heard the quick sound of distress the fingers shed locked together twisted she saw maggie reach out grip rogans hand a change brianna thought with a little sigh even a year before maggie would have slapped any comforting hand aside amanda there were tears in maggies voice it was amanda he said before he died standing there at the cliffs at loop head at that spot he loved so much we would go there and he would joke about how wed hop in a boat and our next stop would be a pub in new york now the tears spilled over in new york amanda was in new york he said her name briannas fingers went to her mouth she stopped herself barely before she gave into her childhood habit of gnawing her nails i remember now that you said something about that at his wake did he say anything more tell you anything about her he said nothing but her name maggie dashed at tears with a furious hand he said nothing then nothing ever he loved her but he did nothing about it what could he do brianna asked maggie something there were more tears and more fury when maggie lifted her head anything sweet jesus he spent his life in hell why because the church says its a sin to do otherwise well hed sinned already hadnt he hed committed adultery do i blame him for that i dont know that i can remembering what he faced in this house but by god couldnt he have followed through on it couldnt he have finally followed through he stayed for us briannas voice was tight and cold you know he stayed for us is that supposed to make me grateful will you blame him for loving you rogan asked quietly or condemn him for loving someone else her eyes flashed but the bitterness that rose up in her throat died into grief no ill do neither but he should have had more than memories read the others maggie i will you were barely born when these were written she said as she opened the second letter i know brianna said dully i think she loved him very much theres a kindness here it isnt so much to ask love kindness maggie looked at brianna then for some sign she saw nothing but that same cool detachment with a sigh she opened the final letter while brianna sat stiff and cold i only wish he her words faltered oh my god a baby instinctively her hand went to cover her own she was pregnant we have a brother or sister somewhere i dont know what to do shock and fury had maggie lurching to her feet teacups rattled as she pushed back to stalk around the room what to do its been done hasnt it twentyeight years ago to be exact distressed brianna started to rise but rogan covered her hand let her go he murmured shell be better for it after what right did she have to tell him this and then go away maggie demanded what right did he have to let her and now are you thinking it falls to us to us to follow it through this isnt some abandoned fatherless child were speaking of now brianna but a person grown what have they to do with us our father maggie our family oh aye the concannon family god help us overwhelmed she leaned against the mantel staring blindly into the fire was he so weak then we dont know what he did or could have done we may never know brianna took a careful breath if mother had known maggie interrupted with a short bitter laugh she didnt do you think she wouldnt have used a weapon like this to beat him into the ground god knows she used everything else then theres no point in telling her now is there slowly maggie turned you want to say nothing to her what purpose would it serve to hurt her maggies mouth thinned you think it would are you so sure it wouldnt the fire went out in maggie as quickly as it had flared i dont know how can i know i feel as if theyre both strangers now he loved you maggie rogan rose now to go to her you know that i know that she let herself lean but i dont know what i feel i think we should try to find amanda dougherty brianna began and i cant think maggie closed her eyes there were too many emotions battering inside her to allow her to see as she wanted the right direction to take i need to think about this brie its rested this long it can rest awhile longer im sorry maggie dont take this on your shoulders as well a bit of the bite and briskness came back into maggies voice theyre burdened enough give me a few days brie then well decide together whats to be done all right id like to keep the letters for now of course maggie crossed over laid a hand on briannas pale cheek he loved you too brie in his way in every way you were his angel his cool rose dont worry well find a way to do whats best gray didnt mind when the leaden sky began to spit rain again he stood on a parapet of a ruined castle looking out on a sluggish river wind whistled and moaned through chinks in the stone he might have been alone not simply in this spot but in this country in the world it was he decided the perfect place for murder the victim could be lured here could be pursued up ancient winding stone steps could flee helplessly up until any crumb of hope would dissolve there would be no escape here where old blood had been spilled where it seeped into stone and earth so deep yet not so deep fresh murder would be done not for god not for country but for pleasure gray already knew his villain could picture him there slicing down so that the edge of his knife glinted silver in the dull light he knew his victim the terror and the pain the hero and the woman he would love were as clear to gray as the slow run of the river below and he knew he would have to begin soon to create them with words there was nothing he enjoyed in writing more than making his people breathe giving them flesh and blood discovering their backgrounds their hidden fears every twist and turn of their pasts it was perhaps because he had no past of his own he had made himself layer by layer as skillfully and as meticulously as he crafted his characters grayson thane was who he had decided to be and his skill in storytelling had provided a means to become who and what he wanted in some style he would never consider himself a modest man but considered himself no more than a competent writer a spinner of tales he wrote to entertain himself first and acknowledged his luck in hitting some chord in the public brianna had been right he had no desire to be a yeats being a good writer meant he could make a living and do as he chose being a great one would bring responsibilities and expectations he had no desire to face what gray didnt choose to face he simply turned his back on but there were times such as this when he wondered what it might be like to have roots ancestry a fullblooded devotion to family or country the people who had built this castle that still stood those who had fought there died there what had they felt what had they wished for and how could battles fought so long ago still ring as clear as the fatal music of sword against sword in the air hed chosen ireland for this for the history for the people whose memories were long and roots were deep for people he admitted like brianna concannon it was an odd and interesting bonus that she should be so much what he was looking for in his heroine physically she was perfect that soft luminous beauty the simple grace and quiet manner but beneath the shell in contrast to that openhanded hospitality was a remoteness and a sadness complexities he thought letting the rain slap his cheeks he enjoyed nothing better than contrasts and complexitiespuzzles to be solved what had put that haunted look in her eyes that defensive coolness in her manner it would be interesting to find out chapter three he thought she was out when he came back as focused as a hound on a scent gray headed to the kitchen it was her voice that stopped himsoft quiet and icy without giving a thought to the ethics of eavesdropping he shifted and moved to the doorway of the parlor he could see her on the phone her hand twisted in the cord a gesture of anger or nerves he couldnt see her face but the stiff set of her back and shoulders was indication enough of her mood ive just come in mother i had to pick up a few things in the village ive a guest there was a pause gray watched as brianna lifted a hand rubbed it hard at her temple yes i know im sorry it upsets you ill come around tomorrow i can she broke off obviously interrupted by some sharp comment on the other end of the phone gray pushed back an urge to move into the room and soothe those tensed shoulders ill take you wherever you want to go tomorrow i never said i was too busy and im sorry youre not feeling well ill do the marketing yes its no problem before noon i promise i have to go now i have cakes in the oven ill bring you some shall i tomorrow mother i promise she muttered a goodbye and turned the weary distress on her face turned to shock when she saw gray then a flush crept into her cheeks you move quietly she said with the faintest trace of annoyance in the tone i didnt hear you come in i didnt want to interrupt he had no shame about listening to her conversation nor about watching her varying reactions flicker over her face your mother lives nearby not far her voice was clipped now edged with the anger that stirred inside her hed listened to her personal misery and didnt think it important enough to apologize for ill get your tea now no hurry youve got cakes in the oven she leveled her eyes at his i lied i should tell you that i open my home to you but not my private life he acknowledged this with a nod i should tell you i always pry youre upset brianna maybe you should have some tea ive had mine thank you her shoulders remained stiff as she crossed the room and started to move past him he stopped her with the faintest of brushes of his hand on her arm there was curiosity in his eyesand she resented it there was sympathyshe didnt want it most writers have as open an ear as a good bartender she shifted it was only the slightest movement but it put distance between them and made her point ive always wondered about people who find it necessary to tell their personal problems to the man who serves them ale ill bring your tea into the parlor ive too much to do in the kitchen for company gray ran his tongue around his teeth as she walked away he had he knew been put ever so completely in his place brianna couldnt fault the american for curiosity she had plenty of her own she enjoyed finding out about the people who passed through her home hearing them talk about their lives and their families it might have been unfair but she preferred not to discuss hers much more comfortable was the role of onlooker it was safer that way but she wasnt angry with him experience had taught her that temper solved nothing patience manners and a quiet tone were more effective shields and weapons against most confrontations they had served her well through the evening meal and by the end of it it seemed to her that she and gray had resumed their proper positions of landlandy and guest his casual invitation to join him at the village pub had been just as casually refused brianna had spent a pleasant hour finishing his book now with breakfast served and the dishes done she prepared to drive to her mothers and devote the rest of the morning to maeve maggie would be annoyed to hear it brianna thought but her sister didnt understand that it was easier certainly less stressful to simply meet their mothers need for time and attention inconvenience aside it was only a few hours out of her life hardly a year earlier before maggies success had made it possible to set maeve up with a companion in her own home brianna had been at her beck and call twentyfour hours a day tending to imaginary illnesses listening to complaints on her own shortcomings and being reminded time after time that maeve had done her duty by giving brianna life what maggie couldnt understand and what brianna continued to be guilty about was that she was willing to pay any price for the serenity of being the sole mistress of blackthorn cottage and today the sun was shining there was a teasing hint of faroff spring in the mild breeze it wouldnt last brianna knew that made the luminous light and soft air all the more precious to enjoy it more fully she rolled down the windows of her ancient fiat she would have to roll them up again and turn on the sluggish heater when her mother joined her she glanced over at the pretty little mercedes gray had leasednot in envy or perhaps with just the slightest twinge of envy it was so efficiently flashy and sleek and suited its driver she mused perfectly she wondered what it would be like to sit behind the wheel just for a moment or two almost in apology she patted the steering wheel of her fiat before turning the key the engine strained grumbled and coughed ah now i didnt mean it she murmured and tried the key again come on sweetheart catch hold will you she hates it when im late but the engine merely stuttered then died off with a moan resigned brianna got out and lifted the hood she knew the fiat often displayed the temperament of a cranky old woman most usually she could coax it along with a few strokes or taps with the tools she carried in the trunk she was hauling out a dented toolbox when gray strolled out the front door car trouble he called shes temperamental brianna tossed back her hair and pushed up the sleeves of her sweater just needs a bit of attention thumbs tucked in the front pocket of his jeans he crossed over glanced under the hood it wasnt a swagger but it was close want me to take a look she eyed him he still hadnt shaved the stubble should have made him look unkempt and sloppy instead the combination of it and the goldtipped hair pulled back in a stubby ponytail fit briannas image of an american rock star the idea made her smile do you know about cars then or are you offering because you think you shouldbeing male that is his brow shot up and his lips quirked as he took the toolbox from her he had to admit he was relieved she wasnt angry with him any longer step back little lady he drawled in a voice thick with the rural south and dont worry that pretty head of yours let a man handle this impressed she tilted her head you sounded just as i imagined buck sounded in your book youve a good ear he flashed her a grin before he ducked under the hood he was a pompous rednecked ass wasnt he mmm she wasnt sure even though they were discussing a fictional character if it was polite to agree usually its the carburetor she began murphy promised to rebuild it when he has a few hours to spare already head and shoulders under the hood gray simply turned his head and gave her a dry look well murphys not here is he she had to admit he was not brianna bit her lip as she watched gray work she appreciated the offer truly she did but the man was a writer not a mechanic she couldnt afford to have him with all good intentions damage something usually if i just prop open that hinge thing there with a stickto show him she leaned in alongside gray and pointedthen i get in and start it he turned his head again was eye to eye and mouth to mouth with her she smelled glorious as fresh and clean as the morning as he stared color flushed into her cheeks her eyes widened fractionally her quick and obviously unplanned reaction to him might have made him smile if his system hadnt been so busy going haywire its not the carburetor this time he said and wondered what she would do if he pressed his lips just where the pulse in her throat was jumping no she couldnt have moved if her life had been threatened his eyes had gold in them she thought foolishly gold streaks along the brown just as he had in his hair she fought to get a breath in and out usually it is he shifted a test for both of them until their shoulders brushed those lovely eyes of hers clouded with confusion like a sea under uncertain skies this time its the battery cables theyre corroded its been a damp winter if he leaned just the slightest bit toward her now his mouth would be on hers the thought of it shot straight to her stomach flipped over it would be roughhe would be rough she was certain would he kiss like the hero in the book she had finished the night before with teeth nipping tongue thrusting all fierce demand and wild urgency while his hands oh god shed been wrong brianna discovered she could move if her life was threatened if felt as if it had been though he hadnt moved hadnt so much as blinked giddy from her own imagination she jerked back only to make a small distressed sound in her throat when he moved with her they stood almost embracing in the sunlight what would he do she wondered what would she do he wasnt sure why he resisted perhaps it was the subtle waves of fear vibrating from her it might have been the shock of discovering he had his own fear compressed in a small tight ball in the pit of his stomach it was he who took a step back a very vital step back ill clean them off for you he said and well try her again her hands reached for each other until her fingers were linked thank you i should go in and call my mother let her know ill be a little late brianna he waited until she stopped retreating until her eyes lifted to his again you have an incredibly appealing face as compliments went she wasnt sure how this one fit she nodded thank you i like yours he cocked his head just how careful do you want to be about this it took her a moment to understand and another to find her voice very she managed i think very gray watched her disappear into the house before he turned back to the job at hand i was afraid of that he muttered once she was on her waythe fiats engine definitely needed an overhaulgray took a long walk over the fields he told himself he was absorbing atmosphere researching priming himself to work it was a pity he knew himself well enough to understand he was working off his response to brianna a normal response he assured himself she was after all a beautiful woman and he hadnt been with a woman at all for some time if his libido was revving it was only to be expected there had been a woman an associate with his publishing house in england whom he might have tumbled for briefly but hed suspected that shed been much more interested in how their relationship might have advanced her career than in enjoying the moment it had been distressingly easy for him to keep their relationship from becoming intimate he was becoming jaded he supposed success could do that to you whatever pleasure and pride it brought carried a price a growing lack of trust a more jaundiced eye it rarely bothered him how could it when trust had never been his strong point in any case better he thought to see things as they were rather than as you wanted them to be save the wants for fiction he could turn his reaction to brianna around just that way she would be his prototype for his heroine the lovely serene and composed woman with secrets in her eyes and ice floes banked fires and conflicts stirring beneath the shell what made her tick what did she dream of what did she fear those were questions he would answer as he built a woman out of words and imagination was she jealous of her stunningly successful sister did she resent her demanding mother was there a man she wanted and who wanted her those were questions he needed to answer as he discovered brianna concannon gray began to think he would need to combine them all before he could tell his tale he smiled to himself as he walked he would tell himself that he thought because he wanted to know and he had no qualms whatsoever about prying into someones private thoughts and experiences and no guilt about hording his own he stopped turned a slow circle as he looked around him now this he decided was a place a person could lose himself in roll after roll of glistening green fields bisected with gray stone walls dotted with fat cows the morning was so clear so shining that he could see the glint of window glass in cottages in the distance the flap of clothes hung out on lines to dry in the breeze overhead the sky was a bowl of swimming bluepostcard perfect yet already at the west rim of that bowl clouds were swarming together their purpleedged tips threatened storm here in what seemed to be the center of a crystalized world he could smell grass and cow hints of the sea carried on the air and the faint faint scent of smoke from a cottage chimney there was the sound of wind in the grass the swish of cows tails and the steady trumpet of a bird who celebrated the day he almost felt guilty about bringing even fictional murder and mayhem to such a place almost he had six months gray thought six months before his next book hit the stands and he flung himself as cheerfully as possible into the fun house ride of book tours and press six months to create the story that was already growing inside his head six months to enjoy this little spot in the world and the people in it then he would leave it as he had left dozens of other spots hundreds of other people and go on to the next going on was something he excelled at gray swung over a wall and crossed the next field the circle of stones caught his eye and his imagination immediately he had seen greater monuments had stood in the shadow of stonehenge and felt the power this dance was hardly more than eight feet the king stone no taller than a man but finding it here standing silent among grazing disinterested cows seemed wonderful to him who had built it and why fascinated gray rounded the outside circumference first only two of the lintels remained in place the others having fallen off in some longago night at least he hoped it had been at night during a storm and the sound of them crashing to earth would have vibrated like a roar of a god he laid a hand on the king stone it was warm from the sun but carried an underlying iciness that thrilled could he use this he wondered somehow weave this place and the echoes of ancient magic into his book would there be murder done here he stepped into the circle into the center a sacrifice of sorts he mused a selfserving ritual where blood would splash the thriving green grass stain the base of the stones or perhaps it would be love done here a desperate and greedy tangle of limbsthe grass cool and damp beneath the full white moon swimming overhead the stones standing guard as the man and woman lost themselves in need he could imagine both with equal clarity but the second appealed more so much more he could all but see brianna lying on the grass her hair fanned out her arms lifted up her skin would be pale as milk soft as water her slim hips would arch her slender back bow and when he drove himself into her she would cry out those neat rounded nails would score his back her body would plunge like a mustang under his faster deeper stronger until good morning to you jesus gray jolted back his breathing was unsteady his mouth dust dry later he promised himself later it would be amusing but for now he fought to rip himself out of erotic fantasy and focus on the man approaching the circle of stones he was dark strikingly handsome dressed in the rough sturdy clothes of a farmer perhaps thirty gray judged one of the stunning black irish who claimed jet hair and cobalt eyes the eyes seemed friendly enough a little amused briannas dog was prancing happily at his heels recognizing gray con galloped into the circle to greet him an interesting spot the man said in a musical west county brogue i didnt expect to find it here rubbing cons head gray came through a space between stones it isnt listed on any of the tourist maps i have it isnt no its our dance you see but we dont mind sharing it occasionally youd be bries yank he offered a big workroughened hand im murphy muldoon of the rosetrampling cows murphy winced christ shell never forget it and didnt i replace every last bush youd think the cows had stepped on her firstborn he looked down at con for support the dog sat tilted his head and kept his own counsel youve settled into blackthorn then yes im trying to get a feel for the area gray glanced around again i guess i crossed over onto your land we dont shoot trespassers often these days murphy said easily glad to hear it gray studied his companion again there was something solid here he thought and easily approachable i was in the village pub last night omalleys had a beer with a man named rooney you mean you bought him a pint murphy grinned two gray grinned back he earned them with the payment of village gossip some of which was probably truth murphy took out a cigarette offered one after shaking his head gray tucked his hands in his pockets he only smoked when he was writing i believe your name was mentioned i wont doubt you what young murphy is missing gray began in such a deadly mimic of rooney that murphy snorted with laughter is a good wife and strong sons to be working the land with him hes after perfection is murphy so hes spending his nights alone in a cold bed this from rooney who spends most of his nights in the pub complaining that his wife drives him to drink he did mention that gray eased into the question he was most interested in and that since the jackeen had snapped maggie out from under your nose youd be courting her younger sister before long brie murphy shook his head as he expelled smoke itd be like cuddling my baby sister he smiled still but his eyes were sharp on grays is that what you wanted to know mr thane gray yes thats what i wanted to know then ill tell you the ways clear there but mind your step im protective of my sisters satisfied his point was made murphy took another comfortable drag youre welcome to come back to the house for a cup of tea i appreciate the offer but ill take a raincheck there are things i need to get done today well then ill let you get to them i enjoy your books he said in such an offhand way that gray was doubly complimented theres a bookstore in galway you may like to visit if you travel that way i intend to youll find it then give my best to brianna will you and you might mention that ive not a scone left in my pantry his grin flashed twill make her feel sorry for me after whistling for the dog who fell into place beside him he walked away with the easy grace of a man crossing his own land it was midafternoon when brianna returned home frazzled drained and tense she was grateful to find no trace of gray but for a note hastily scrawled and left on her kitchen table maggie called murphys out of scones an odd message she thought why would maggie call to tell her murphy wanted scones with a sigh brianna set the note aside automatically she put on the kettle for tea before setting out the ingredients she needed to go with the freerange chicken shed foundlike a prizeat the market then she sighed gave in sitting down again she folded her arms on the table laid her head on them she didnt weep tears wouldnt help wouldnt change anything it had been one of maeves bad days full of snipes and complaints and accusations maybe the bad days were harder now because over the last year or so there had been nearly as many good ones maeve loved her little house whether or not she ever admitted to it she was fond of lottie sullivan the retired nurse brianna and maggie had hired as her companion though the devil would never be able to drag that simple truth from maeves lips she had found as much contentment as brianna imagined she was capable of but maeve never forgot never that brianna was responsible for nearly every bite of bread their mother enjoyed and maeve could never seem to stop resenting that this had been one of the days when maeve had paid her younger daughter back by finding fault with everything with the added strain of the letters brianna had found she was simply exhausted she closed her eyes and indulged herself for a moment by wishing she wished her mother could be happy she wished maeve could recapture whatever joy and pleasure shed had in her youth she wished oh she wished most of all that she could love her mother with an open and generous heart instead of with cold duty and dragging dispair and she wished for family for her home to be filled with love and voices and laughter not simply for the transient guests who came and went but for permanence and brianna thought if wishes were pennies wed all be as rich as midas she pushed back from the table knowing the fatigue and depression would fade once she began to work gray would have a fine roast chicken for dinner stuffed with herbed bread and ladeled with rich gravy and murphy bless him would have his scones chapter four in a matter of days brianna had grown accustomed to grays routine and adjusted her schedule accordingly he liked to eat rarely missing a mealthough she soon discovered he had little respect for timetables she understood he was hungry when he began to haunt her kitchen whatever the time she fixed him a plate and had to admit she appreciated watching him enjoy her cooking most days he went out on what she thought of as his rambles if he asked she gave him directions or made suggestions on some sight he might like to see but usually he set out with a map a notebook and a camera she saw to his rooms when he was out anyone who tidies up after another begins to learn things brianna discovered grayson thane was neat enough when it came to what belonged to her her good guest towels were never tossed on the floor in a damp heap there were never any wet rings on her furniture from a forgotten glass or cup but he had a careless disregard for what he owned he might scrape off his boots before he came in out of the mud and onto her floors yet he never cleaned the expensive leather or bothered to polish them so she did it herself his clothes carried labels from fine shops around the world but they were never pressed and were often tossed negligently over a chair or hung crookedly in the wardrobe she began to add his laundry to her own and had to admit it was pleasant to hang his shirts on the line when the day was sunny he kept no mementos of friends or family made no attempt to personalize the room he now lived in there were books boxes of themmysteries horror novels spy thrillers romances classics nonfiction books on police procedures weapons and murder psychology mythology witchcraft auto mechanicsthat made her smileand subjects as varied as architecture and zoology there seemed to be nothing that didnt interest him she knew he preferred coffee but would drink tea in a pinch if it was strong enough he had the sweet tooth of a tenyearold boyand the energy of one he was nosythere was to be no question he wouldnt ask but there was an innate kindness in him that made him hard to rebuff he never failed to offer to do some chore or errand for herand shed seen him sneaking tidbits of food to con when he thought she wasnt looking all in all it was an excellent arrangementhe provided her company income and the work she loved she gave him a smoothly running base yet she could never quite relax around him he had never referred to that one moment of mindnumbing attraction between them but it was therein the way her pulse jumped if she walked into a room and found him there unexpectedly in the way her body heated when he turned those gilded eyes in her direction and simply looked at her brianna blamed herself for it it had been a long long time since she had been deeply attracted to a man not since rory mcavery had left her with a scar on her heart and a hole in her life had she felt such a wicked stirring for any man since she was feeling it for a guest brianna had decided it was her responsibility to still it but as she smoothed the quilt on his bed fluffed his pillows she wondered where his ramblings were taking him today he hadnt gone far gray had decided to travel on foot that morning and wandered down the narrow road under gloomy threatening skies he passed a couple of outbuildings saw a tractor shelter hay bales stacked out of the weather murphys he imagined and began to wonder what it would be like to be a farmer owning land he mused being responsible for it plowing planting tending watching things grow keeping an eye on the sky sniffing the air for a turn in the weather not a life for grayson thane he thought but imagined some would find it rewarding thered been that simple pride of ownership in murphy muldoons walka man who knew his feet were planted on his own but owning landor anythingmeant being tied to it hed have to ask murphy how he felt about that gray could see the valley from this spot and the rise of hills from the distance came the quick happy bark of a dog con perhaps out looking for adventure before heading home to lay his head in briannas lap gray had to envy the dog the privilege grimacing gray tucked his hands in his pockets hed been working hard to keep those hands off his subtly sexy landlady he told himself she didnt wear those prim aprons or pin her hair up in those fallaway knots to charm him but it worked it was unlikely she fussed around the house smelling of wildflowers and cloves to drive him crazy but he was suffering beyond the physicalwhich was difficult enoughthere was that air of secrets and sadness hed yet to slip through that thin wall of reserve and discover what was troubling her whatever it was haunted her eyes not that he intended to get involved gray assured himself he was just curious making friends was something he did easily by way of sincere interest and a sympathetic nature but close friends the kind a man kept in touch with through the years worried over missed when he was away werent in the master plan grayson thane traveled light and he traveled frequently the little cottage with the boldly painted front door had gray pausing an addition had been framed in on the south side that was as big as the original house the earth that had been displaced was now a hill of mud that would have delighted any fiveyearold the little place down the road he wondered where briannas sister and brotherinlaw lived from time to time he decided the magenta door was maggies doing and went through the gate for a closer look for the next few minutes he pleased himself poking through the new construction someone knew what they were doing here he thought the frame was sturdy the materials top of the line adding on for the baby he assumed working his way to the rear it was then he spotted the building out in the back her glass shop pleased with his new discovery he stepped off the planking and crossed the dewdampened lawn once he reached it gray cupped his hands against the window and peered in he could see furnaces benches tools that whetted his curiosity and imagination shelves were loaded with works in progress without a qualm he stepped back and reached for the door are you wanting your fingers broken he turned maggie stood in the rear doorway of the cottage a steaming cup in one hand she wore a bagging sweater worn cords and a scowl gray grinned at her not especially is this where you work it is how do you treat people who pop uninvited into your studio i havent got a studio how about a tour she didnt bother to muffle the oath or the sigh youre a bold one arent you all right then since i dont seem to be doing anything else the man goes off she complained as she crossed the grass doesnt even wake me leaves me a note is all he does telling me to eat a decent breakfast and keep my feet up and did you i might have if i hadnt heard somebody tramping around my property sorry but still he grinned at her whens the baby due in the spring despite herself she softened it took only the mention of the baby ive weeks yet and if the man keeps trying to pamper me ill have to murder him well come in then since youre here i see that gracious hospitality runs in the family it doesnt now a smile tugged at her lips brianna got all the niceness look she said as she opened the door dont touch or i will break those fingers yes maam this is great he started to explore the minute he stepped in moving to the benches bending down to check out the furnace you studied in venice didnt you i did yes what started you off god i hate when people ask me that never mind he laughed at himself and strolled toward her pipes his fingers itched to touch cautious he looked back at her measured im bigger than you she nodded im meaner but she relented enough to take up a pontil herself and hand it to him he hefted it twirled it great murder weapon ill keep that in mind the next time someone interrupts my work so whats the process he glanced toward drawings spread out on a bench you sketch out ideas often she sipped at her tea eyeing him in truth there was something about the way he moved light and fluid without any fuss that made her yearn for her sketchpad after a quick lesson always it must get pretty hot in here when the furnaces are fired you melt the stuff in there and then what i make a gather she began for the next thirty minutes she took him step by step through the process of handblowing a vessel the man was full of questions she thought intriguing questions she admitted the kind that made you go beyond the technical processes and into the creative purpose behind them she might have been able to resist that but his enthusiasm was more difficult instead of hurrying him along she found herself answering those questions demonstrating and laughing with him keep this up and ill draft you as pontil boy amused she rubbed a hand over her belly well come in and have some tea you wouldnt have any of briannas cookiesbiscuits maggies brow arched i do a few moments later gray was settled at maggies kitchen table with a plate of gingersnaps i swear she could market these he said with his mouth full make a fortune shed rather give them to the village children im surprised she doesnt have a brood of her own he waited a beat i havent noticed any man coming around and youre the noticing sort arent you grayson thane goes with the territory shes a beautiful woman i wont disagree maggie poured boiling water into a warmed teapot youre going to make me yank it out he muttered is there someone or not you could ask her yourself miffed maggie set the pot on the table frowned at him oh he had a talent she thought for making you want to tell him what he wanted to know no she snapped out and slapped a mug on the table in front of him theres no one she brushes them off freezes them out shed rather spend all her time tending to her guests or running out to ennis every time our mother sniffles selfsacrificing is what our saint brianna does best youre worried about her gray murmured whats troubling her maggie tis family business let it alone belatedly she poured his cup then her own she sighed then and sat how do you know shes troubled it shows in her eyes just like its showing in yours now itll be settled soon enough maggie made a determined effort to push it aside do you always dig into people sure he tried the tea it was strong enough to stand up and dance perfect being a writers a great cover for just being nosy then his eyes changed sobered i like her its impossible not to it bothers me to see her sad she can use a friend youve a talent for getting people to talk use it on her but mind she added before gray could speak shes soft feelings underneath bruise them and ill bruise you point taken and time he thought to change the subject he kicked back propping a booted foot on his knee so whats the story with our pal murphy did the guy from dublin really steal you out from under his nose it was fortunate that shed swallowed her tea or she might have choked her laugh started deep and grew into guffaws that had her eyes watering i missed a joke rogan said from the doorway take a breath maggie youre turning red sweeney she sucked in a giggling breath and reached for his hand this is grayson thane he was wondering if you stepped over murphys back to woo me not murphys he said pleasantly but i had to step all over maggiesending with her head which needed some sense knocked into it its nice meeting you he added offering gray his free hand ive spent many entertaining hours in your stories thanks grays been keeping me company maggie told him and now im in too fine a mood to yell at you for not waking me this morning you needed sleep he poured tea winced after the first sip christ maggie must you always brew it to death yes she leaned forward propped her chin on her hand what part of america are you from gray no part in particular i move around but your home i dont have one he bit into another cookie i dont need one with the way i travel the idea was fascinating maggie tilted her head and studied him you just go from place to place with what the clothes on your back a little more than that but basically sometimes i end up picking up something i cant resistlike that sculpture of yours in dublin i rent a place in new york kind of a catchall for stuff thats where my publisher and agent are based so i go back about once maybe twice a year i can write anywhere he said with a shrug so i do and your family youre prying margaret mary he did it first she shot back to rogan i dont have any family do you have names picked out for the baby gray asked neatly turning the subject recognizing the tactic maggie frowned at him rogan gave her knee a squeeze under the table before she could speak none that we can agree on we hope to settle on one before the childs ready to go to university smoothly rogan steered the conversation into polite impersonal topics until gray rose to leave once she was alone with her husband maggie drummed her fingers on the table id have found out more about him if you hadnt interfered its none of your business he leaned over and kissed her mouth maybe it is i like him well enough but he gets a look in his eyes when he speaks of brianna im not sure i like that thats none of your business either shes my sister and well able to take care of herself a lot youd know about it maggie grumbled men always think they know women when what they know is a pitiful nothing i know you margaret mary in a neat move he scooped her out of the chair and into his arms what are you about im about to take you to bed strip you naked and make incredibly thorough love with you oh are you she tossed back her hair youre just trying to distract me from the subject at hand lets see how well i can do she smiled wound her arms around his neck i suppose i should at least give you the chance when gray strolled back into blackthorn cottage he found brianna on her hands and knees rubbing paste wax into the parlor floor in slow almost loving circles the little gold cross she sometimes wore swung like a pendulum from its thin chain and caught quick glints of light she had music on some lilting tune she was singing along with in irish charmed he crossed over and squatted down beside her what do the words mean she jolted first he had a way of moving that no more than stirred the air she blew loose hair out of her eyes and continued to polish its about going off to war it sounds too happy to be about war oh were happy enough to fight youre back earlier than usual are you wanting tea no thanks i just had some at maggies she looked up then you were visiting maggie i thought id take a walk and ended up at her place she gave me a tour of her glass house brianna laughed then seeing he was serious sat back on her haunches and how in sweet heaven did you manage such a feat as that i asked and grinned she was a little cranky about it at first but she fell in he leaned toward brianna sniffed you smell of lemon and beeswax thats not surprising she had to clear her throat its what im polishing the floor with she made a small strangled sound when he took her hand you ought to wear gloves when you do heavy work they get in my way she shook her hand but he held on though she tried to look firm she only managed to look distressed youre in my way ill get out of it in a minute she looked so damned pretty he thought kneeling on the floor with her polishing rag and her flushed cheeks come out with me tonight brie let me take you to dinner ive aive mutton she said fumbling for making dingle pies itll keep wont it it will yes but if youre tired of my cooking brianna his voice was soft persuasive i want to take you out why because youve got a pretty face he skimmed his lips over her knuckles and made her heart stick in her throat because i think it might be nice for you to have someone else do the cooking and the washing up for one night i like to cook i like to write but its always a kick to read something someone else has sweated over its not the same sure it is head tilted he aimed that sudden razorsharp gaze at her youre not afraid to be alone with me in a public restaurant are you what a foolish thing to say what a foolish thing she realized for her to feel fine then its a date seven oclock wise enough to know when to retreat gray straightened and strolled out she told herself not to worry over her dress then fretted about it just the same in the end she chose the simple hunter green wool that maggie had brought her back from milan with its long sleeves and high neck it looked plain even serviceable until it was on cannily cut the thin soft wool had a way of draping over curves and revealing every bit as much as it concealed still brianna told herself it suited a dinner out and that it was a sin shed yet to wear it when maggie had gone to the trouble and expense and it felt so lovely against her skin annoyed at the continued flutter of nerves she picked up her coat a plain black with a mended lining and draped it over her arm it was simply the offer of a meal she reminded herself a nice gesture from a man shed been feeding for more than a week taking one last steadying breath she stepped out of her room into the kitchen then started down the hall hed just come down the stairs selfconscious she paused he stopped where he was one foot still on the bottom step his hand on the newel post for a moment they only stared at each other in one of those odd sliding instants of awareness then he stepped forward and the sensation rippled away well well his lips curved into a slow satisfied smile you make a picture brianna youre wearing a suit and looked gorgeous in it i drag one on now and again he took her coat slipped it over her shoulders you never said where we were going to eat he put an arm around her waist and swept her out of the house the interior of the car made her sigh it smelled of leather and the leather was soft as butter she skimmed her fingers over the seat as he drove it was kind of you to do this gray kindness had nothing to do with it i had an urge to go out and i wanted you with me you never come into the pub at night she relaxed a little so thats where they were going i havent lately i do like stopping in now and then seeing everyone the omalleys had another grandchild this week i know i was treated to a pint to celebrate i just finished a bunting for the baby i should have brought it with me were not going to the pub whats a bunting its a kind of sacque you button the baby into it as they passed through the village she smiled look theres mr and mrs conroy more than fifty years married and they still hold hands you should see them dance thats what i was told about you he glanced at her you won contests when i was a girl she shrugged it off regrets were a foolish indulgence i was never serious about it it was just for fun what do you do for fun now oh this and that you drive well for a yank at his bland look she chuckled what i mean is that a lot of your people have some trouble adjusting to our roads and driving on the proper side we wont debate which is the proper side but ive spent a lot of time in europe you dont have an accent i can placei mean other than american ive made kind of a game out of it you see from guessing with my guests it might be because im not from anywhere everyones from somewhere no theyre not there are more nomads in the world than you might think so youre claiming to be a gypsy she pushed her hair back and studied his profile well thats one i didnt think of meaning the night you came i thought you looked a bit like a piratethen a poet even a boxer but not a gypsy but that suits too and you looked like a visionbillowing white gown tumbled hair courage and fear warring in your eyes i wasnt afraid she glimpsed the sign just before he turned off the road here drumoland castle but we cant why not im told the cuisines exquisite sure and it is and very dear he laughed slowing to enjoy the view of the castle gray and glorious on the slope of the hill glinting under lights brianna im a very well paid gypsy stunning isnt it yes and the gardens you cant see them well now and the winters been so harsh but theyve the most beautiful gardens she looked over the slope of lawn to a bed of dormant rosebushes in the back is a walled garden its so lovely it doesnt seem real why didnt you stay at a place like this he parked the car shut it off i nearly did then i heard about your inn call it impulse he flashed a grin at her i like impulses he climbed out of the car took her hand to lead her up the stone steps into the great hall it was spacious and lush as castles should be with dark wood and deep red carpets there was the smell of woodsmoke from the fire the glint of crystal the lonely sound of harp music i stayed in a castle in scotland he began moving toward the dining room with his fingers twined with hers and one in cornwall fascinating places full of shades and shadows you believe in ghosts of course his eyes met hers as he reached out to take her coat dont you i do yes we have some you know at home the stone circle even as she felt surprise she realized she shouldnt he would have been there and he would have felt it there yes and other places gray turned to the maitre d thane he said simply they were welcomed shown to their table as gray accepted the wine list he glanced at brianna would you like wine that would be nice he took a brief glance smiled up at the sommelier the chassagnemontrachet yes sir hungry he asked brianna who was all but devouring the menu im trying to memorize it she murmured i dined here once with maggie and rogan and ive come close to duplicating this chicken in honey and wine read it for pleasure he suggested well get a copy of the menu for you she eyed him over the top they wont give one to you sure they will she gave a short laugh and chose her meal at random once theyd placed their orders and sampled the wine gray leaned forward now tell me she blinked tell you what about the ghosts oh she smiled a little running a finger down her wineglass well years ago as it happened there were lovers she was betrothed to another so they met in secret he was a poor man a simple farmer so they say and she the daughter of the english landlord but they loved and made desperate plans to run off and be together this night they met at the stone circle there they thought at that holy place that magic place they would ask the gods to bless them she carried his child now you see and they had no time to lose they knelt there at the center and she told him she was with child its said they wept together with joy and with fear as the wind whispered cold and the old stones sheltered them and there they loved each other a last time he would go he told her and take his horse from his plow gather whatever he could and come back for her they would leave that very night brianna sighed a little her eyes dreamy so he left her there in the center of the circle of stones but when he reached his farm they were waiting for him the men of the english landlord they cut him down so that his blood stained the land and they burned his house his crops his only thought as he lay dying was of his love she paused with the innate timing of one who knows and spins tales the harpist in the far corner plucked softly at a ballad of illfated love and she waited there in the center of the circle of stones while she waited she grew cold so cold she began to tremble her lovers voice came across the fields to her like tears in the air she knew he was dead and knowing she laid down closed her eyes and sent herself to him when they found her the next morning she was smiling but she was cold very cold and her heart was not beating there are nights if you stand in the center of the circle of stones you can hear them whisper their promises to each other and the grass grows damp with their tears letting out a long breath gray sat back and sipped at his wine you have talent brianna for storytelling i tell you only as it was told to me love survives you see through fear through heartache even through death have you heard them whispering i have and ive wept for them and ive envied them she sat back shook off the mood and what ghosts do you know well ill tell you a story in the hills not far from the field of cullodon a onearmed highlander roams her lips curved is this truth grayson or made up he took her hand kissed it you tell me chapter five shed never had an evening quite like it all the elements added up to one wonderful memorythe gorgeous man who seemed fascinated by her every word the romantic trappings of a castle without the medieval inconveniences glorious french food delicate wine she wasnt sure how she would ever pay him back for it particularly for the menu gray had charmed out of the maitre d she began the only way she knew by planning a special breakfast when maggie came in the kitchen was filled with sizzling scents and brianna was singing well youre having a fine morning i see i am yes brianna flipped over a thick slab of spiced toast will you have some breakfast maggie theres more than enough ive eaten already it was said with some regret is gray about he isnt down yet usually hes sniffing at the skillets by this time of day then were alone for the moment yes her light mood plummeted carefully brianna set the last piece of bread on the platter and put the meal into the oven to keep warm youve come to talk about the letters ive kept you worrying over it long enough havent i im sorry for that we both needed to think brianna folded her hands over her apron faced her sister what do you want to do maggie what i want to do is nothing to pretend ive never read them that they dont exist maggie let me finish she snapped out and began to roam the kitchen like an illtempered cat i want to go on as we are and to keep my memories of da my own i dont want to wonder or worry about a woman he knew and bedded a lifetime ago i dont want to think about a grown brother or sister somewhere youre my sister she said passionately youre my family i tell myself this amanda made a life for herself and her child somewhere somehow and they wouldnt thank us for poking into it now i want to forget it i want it to go away thats what i want brianna she stopped leaning back on the counter and sighing thats what i want she repeated but its not what must be done he said her namealmost the last thing he said in life was her name she has the right to know that i have the right to curse her for it sit down maggie it cant be good for you to be so upset of course im upset were both upset we have different ways of dealing with it with a shake of her head she waved brianna off i dont need to sit if the baby isnt used to my temper by now hell have to learn still she made an effort taking a couple of calming breaths well need to hire an investigator a detective in new york thats what you want isnt it i think its what we have to do brianna said carefully for ourselves for da how will we go about it rogan knows people hell make calls hes wonderful at making calls because she could see brianna needed it she managed a smile thatll be the easy part as to finding them i dont know how long that might take and god only knows what well do if and when were faced with them she might have married this amanda and have a dozen children and a happy life ive thought of that but we have to find out dont we we do stepping forward maggie laid her hands gently on briannas cheeks dont worry so brie i wont if you wont its a pact maggie kissed her lightly to seal it now go feed your lazy yank ive fired my furnace and have work to do nothing heavy maggie tossed back a grin as she turned for the door i know my limits no you dont margaret mary brianna called out as the door slammed shut she stood for a moment lost in thought until cons steady tail thumping roused her want out do you fine then go see what murphys up to the minute she opened the door con streaked out after one satisfied bark he was loping toward the fields she closed the door on the damp air and debated it was after ten and she had chores if gray wasnt coming down to breakfast shed take it up to him a glance at the menu on the table had her smiling again she was humming as she arranged the breakfast tray hefting it she carried it upstairs his door was closed and made her hesitate she knocked softly got no response and began to gnaw her lip perhaps he was ill concerned she knocked again more loudly and called his name she thought she heard a grunt and shifting the tray eased the door open the bed looked as though it had been the scene of a small war the sheets and blankets were tangled into knots the quilt trailing over the footboard onto the floor and the room was stone cold stepping over the threshold she saw him and stared he was at the desk his hair wild his feet bare there was a heap of books piled beside him as his fingers raced over the keys of a small computer at his elbow was an ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts the air reeked of them excuse me no response the muscles in her arms were beginning to ache from the weight of the tray grayson what the word shot out like a bullet taking her back a step his head whipped up it was the pirate again she thought he looked dangerous and inclined to violence as his eyes focused on her without any sign of recognition she wondered if he might have gone mad during the night wait he ordered and attacked the keyboard again brianna waited baffled for nearly five full minutes he leaned back then rubbed his hands hard over his face like a man just waking from a dream or she thought a nightmare then he turned to her again with that quick familiar smile is that breakfast yes i its half past ten and when you didnt come down sorry he rose took the tray from her and set it on the bed he picked up a piece of english bacon with his fingers i got it in the middle of the night it was the ghost story that clicked it i think christ its cold in here well tis no wonder youre after catching your death with nothing on your feet and the fire out he only smiled as she knelt at the hearth and began to arrange new turf shed sounded like a mother scolding a foolish child i got caught up thats all fine and good but its not healthy for you to be sitting here in the cold smoking cigarettes instead of eating a decent meal smells better than decent patient he crouched down beside her ran a carelessly friendly hand down her back brianna will you do me a favor if i can yes go away stunned she turned her head even as she gaped at him he was laughing and taking her hands in his no offence honey its just that i tend to bite if my works interrupted and its cooking for me right now i certainly dont mean to be in your way he winced bit back on annoyance he was trying to be diplomatic wasnt he i need to hang with it while its moving okay so just forget im up here but your room you need the linens changed and the bath dont worry about it the fire was glowing now and so was the impatience inside him he raised her to her feet you can shovel it out when i hit a dry spell id appreciate it if youd drop some food off outside the door now and again but thats all ill need all right but he was already guiding her to the door she huffed you dont have to be booting me out im going thanks for breakfast youre he shut the door in her face welcome she said between her teeth for the rest of that day and two more she didnt hear a peep out of him she tried not to think of the state of the room if hed remembered to keep the fire going or if he bothered to sleep she knew he was eating each time she brought up a fresh tray the old one was outside the door he rarely left so much as a crumb on a plate she might have been alone in the houseif she hadnt been so aware of him she doubted very much that he gave her a moments thought shed have been right he did sleep now and again catnaps that were ripe with dreams and visions he ate fueling his body as the story fueled his mind it was storming through him in three days he had more than a hundred pages they were rough sometimes static but he had the core of it he had murder gleeful and sly he had hopelessness and pain desperation and lies he was in heaven when it finally ground to a halt he crawled into bed pulled the covers over his head and slept like the dead when he woke he took a long look at the room and decided a woman as strong as brianna was unlikely to faint at the sight of it the sight of him however as he studied himself in the bathroom mirror was another matter he rubbed a hand over the stubble on his chin he looked he decided like something that had crawled out of a bog he peeled off his shirt winced at the smell of it and himself and stepped into the shower thirty minutes later he was pulling on fresh clothes he felt a little lightheaded more than a little stiff from lack of exercise but the excitement was still on him he pushed open the bedroom window and took a deep gulp of the rainy morning a perfect day he thought in the perfect place his breakfast tray was outside the door the food gone cold hed slept through that he realized and lifting it hoped he could charm brianna into heating it up for him again and maybe shed go for a walk with him he could use some company maybe he could talk her into driving into galway spending the day with him in crowds they could always he stopped in the kitchen doorway and his grin spread from ear to ear there she was up to her wrists in bread dough her hair scooped up her nose dusted with flour it was such a wonderful picture and his mood was high he set the tray down with a rattle that had her jolting and looking up she had just begun to smile when he strode to her framed her face firmly in his hands and kissed her hard on the mouth her hands fisted in the dough her head spun before she could react hed pulled away hi great day isnt it i feel incredible you cant count on it coming like that you know and when it does its like this train highballing right through your head you cant stop it he picked up a piece of cold toast from his tray started to bite in it was halfway to his mouth before it hit him his eyes locked on hers again he let the toast fall back to the plate the kiss had merely been a reflection of his mood light exuberant now some sort of delayed reaction was setting in tightening his muscles skimming up his spine she simply stood there staring at him her lips still parted in shock her eyes huge with it wait a minute he murmured and moved to her again wait just a minute she couldnt have moved if the roof had caved in she could barely breathe as his hands framed her face again gently this time like a man experimenting with texture his eyes stayed open the expression in them not entirely pleased as he leaned toward her this time she felt his lips brush hers soft lovely the kind of touch that shouldnt have kindled a fire in the blood yet her blood heated he turned her just enough so that their bodies met tipped her head back just enough so that the kiss would deepen some sound distress or pleasure hummed in her throat before her fisted hands went limp hers was a mouth to savor he realized full generous yielding a man shouldnt hurry a mouth such as this he scraped his teeth lightly over her bottom lip and thrilled to the low helpless purr that answered him slowly watching her eyes glaze and close he traced her lips with his tongue dipped inside so many subtle flavors it was wonderful the way he could feel her skin warm her bones soften her heart pound or maybe it was his heart something was roaring in his head throbbing in his blood it wasnt until greed began to grow with the crafty violence that mated with it that he drew back she was trembling and instinct warned him that if he let himself go hed hurt them both that was better than i imagined it would be he managed and ive got a hell of an imagination staggered she braced a hand on the counter her knees were shaking only fear of mortification kept her voice from shaking as well is this how you always behave when you come out of your cave im not always lucky enough to have a beautiful woman handy he tilted his head studying her the pulse in her throat was still jumping and her skin was still flushed but unless he was off the mark she was already rebuilding that thin defensive wall that wasnt ordinary there isnt any point in pretending it was im not ordinarily kissed by a guest while im making bread i wouldnt know whats ordinary for you would i his eyes changed darkening with a hint of temper when he stepped forward she stepped back please dont now those dark eyes narrowed be more specific i have to finish this the dough needs to rise again youre evading brianna all right dont kiss me like that again she let out a choppy breath drew another in i dont have the right defenses it doesnt have to be a battle id like to take you to bed brianna to occupy her nervous hands she snatched up a towel and rubbed at the dough clinging to her fingers well thats blunt its honest if youre not interested just say so i dont take things as casually as you with a yes or a no and no harm done fighting for calm she folded the towel neatly set it aside and ive no experience in such matters damn her for being cool when his blood was raging what matters the one youre speaking of now move aside so i can get back to my bread he simply took her arm and stared into her eyes a virgin he wondered letting the idea circle around and take root a woman who looked like this who responded like this is something wrong with the men around here he said it lightly hoping to cut some of the tension but the result was a flash of pain in her eyes that made him feel like a slug its my business isnt it how i live my life her voice had chilled now ive respected your wishes and your work these past days would you do me the same and let me get on with mine all right he let her go stepped back im going out for a while do you want me to pick up anything for you no thank you she plunged her hands into the dough again and began to knead its raining a bit she said evenly you might want a jacket he walked to the doorway turned back brianna he waited until shed lifted her head you never said whether or not you were interested ill have to assume youre thinking about it he strode out she didnt let out her next breath until she heard the door close behind him gray worked off excess energy with a long drive and a visit to the cliffs of moher to give them both time to settle he stopped in for lunch at a pub in ennis he walked off a heavy dose of fish and chips by wandering along the narrow streets something in a shop window caught his eyes and following impulse he stepped inside and had it boxed by the time he returned to blackthorn hed nearly convinced himself that what hed experienced in the kitchen with brianna was more a result of his joy over his work than chemistry still when he stepped into his room and found her kneeling on the edge of his bathroom floor a bucket beside her and a rag in her hand the scales tipped the other way if a man wasnt dazzled with sex why else would such a picture make his blood pump do you have any idea how often i come across you in that position she looked over her shoulder its an honest living she blew her hair back ill tell you this grayson thane you live like a pig when youre working he cocked a brow is that the way you talk to all your guests he had her there she flushed a little and slapped her rag back on the floor ill be done here soon if youve a mind to get back to it ive another guest coming in this evening tonight he scowled at the back of her head he liked having the place to himself having her to himself who a british gentleman he called shortly after you left this morning well who is he how longs he staying and what the hell did he want a night or two she said easily i dont interrogate my guests as you should know it just seems to me that you should ask questions you cant just let strangers waltz into your home amused she sat back and shook her head at him a combination of the scruffy and elegant she thought with his goldtipped hair pulled back piratelike those lovely eyes of his sulky the pricey boots worn jeans and crisp shirt thats exactly what i do i believe you waltzed in yourself in the dead of night not so long ago thats different at her bland look he shrugged it just is look would you get up and stop that you could eat off the damn floor obviously todays rambling didnt put a smile on your face i was fine he prowled the room then snarled youve been messing with my desk i cleaned off an inch of dust and cigarette ash if thats what youre meaning i didnt touch your little machine there except to lift it up and set it down again though shed been tempted sorely to open the lid and take a peek at the works you dont have to clean up after me all the time he hissed out a breath stuffed his hands in his pockets when she simply stood bucket in hand and looked at him goddamn it i thought id figured this out its not doing my ego any good to know youre not even trying to tie me up in knots he closed his eyes let out a breath okay lets try this again i brought you a present did you why why the hell not he snatched the bag hed put on the bed and handed it to her i saw it i thought youd like it that was kind of you she slipped the box from the bag and began to work at the tape that held it closed she smelled of soap and flowers and disinfectant gray set his teeth unless you want me to toss you on the bed youve just tidied up youd be wise to step back she looked up startled her hands freezing on the box im serious cautious she moistened her lips all right she took a step back then another is this better the absurdity of it finally struck helpless to do otherwise he grinned at her why do you fascinate me brianna i have no idea none at all that might be why he murmured open your present im trying she loosened the tape turned back the lid and dug into the tissue paper oh its lovely pleasure lit her face as she turned the porcelain cottage in her hands it was delicately made the front door open in welcome a tidy garden with each tiny petal perfect it looks as though you could move right in it made me think of you thank you her smile was easier now did you buy it to soften me up tell me if it worked first now she laughed no i wont you have advantage enough as it is do i warned by the purr in his tone she concentrated on replacing the cottage in the bed of tissue i have dinner to tend to will you be wanting a tray not tonight the first waves past the new guest is expected by five so youll have company with your meal terrific gray had been prepared to dislike the british gentlemen on sight rather like a stud dog he realized exercising territorial rights but it was difficult to feel threatened or irritated with the tidy little man with the shiny bald pate and the snooty public school accent his name was herbert smythewhite of london a retired widower who was in the first stages of a sixmonth tour of ireland and scotland pure indulgence he told gray over dinner nancy and i werent blessed with children you see shes been gone nearly two years now and i find myself brooding about the house wed planned to make a trip like this but work always kept me too busy his smile was laced with regret i decided to make it myself as a sort of tribute to her i think she would have liked that is this your first stop it is i flew into shannon leased a car he chuckled taking off his wirerimmed glasses and polishing the lenses on a handkerchief im armed with the tourists weapons of maps and guidebooks ill take a day or two here before heading north he set his glasses back on his prominent nose im very much afraid im taking the best first however miss concannon sets an excellent table you wont get an argument from me they were sharing the dining room and a succulent salmon what work were you in banking im afraid i spent too much of my life worried about figures he helped himself to another spoonful of potatoes in mustard sauce and you mr thane miss concannon tells me youre a writer we practical sorts always envy the creative ones ive never taken enough time to read for pleasure but will certainly pick up one of your books now that weve met are you traveling also not at the moment im based here for now here at the inn thats right he glanced up as brianna came in i hope youve room for dessert she set a large bowl of trifle on the table oh my dear behind his polished lenses smythewhites eyes danced with pleasure and perhaps a little greed ill be a stone heavier before i leave the room i put magic in it so the calories dont count she dished generous portions into bowls i hope your rooms comfortable sir if theres anything you need youve only to ask its exactly what i want he assured her i must come back when your gardens in bloom i hope you will she left them a coffeepot and a decanter of brandy a lovely woman smythewhite commented yes she is and so young to be running an establishment alone one would think shed have a husband a family shes nothing if not efficient the first spoonful of trifle melted on grays tongue efficient wasnt the word he realized the woman was a culinary witch she has a sister and brotherinlaw just down the road and its a close community someones always knocking on the kitchen door thats fortunate i imagine it could be a lonely place otherwise still i noticed as i was driving in that neighbors are few and far between he smiled again im afraid im spoiled by the city and not at all ashamed that i enjoy the crowds and the pace it may take me awhile to grow accustomed to the night quiet youll have plenty of it gray poured brandy into a snifter then at his companions nod into a second i was in london not long ago what part are you from i have a little flat near green park didnt have the heart to keep the house after nancy went he sighed swirled brandy let me offer some unsolicited advice mr thane make your days count dont invest all your efforts in the future you miss too much of the now thats advice i live on hours later it was thoughts of leftover trifle that pulled gray away from his warm bed and a good book the house moaned a bit around him as he dug up a pair of sweats pulled them on he padded downstairs in his bare feet with greedy dreams of gorging it certainly wasnt his first middleofthenight trip to the kitchen since hed settled into blackthorn none of the shadows or creaking boards disturbed him as he slipped down the hall and into the dark kitchen he turned on the stove light not wanting to awaken brianna then he wished he hadnt thought of her or of the fact that she was sleeping just a wall beyond in that long flannel nightgown he imagined with the little buttons at the collar so prim it made her look exoticcertainly it made a man a redblooded one wonder about the body all that material concealed and if he kept thinking along those lines all the trifle in the country wouldnt sate his appetite one vice at a time pal he told himself and got out a bowl a sound from the outside made him pause listen just as he was about to dismiss it as old house groans he heard the scratching with the bowl in one hand he went to the kitchen door looked out and saw nothing but night suddenly the glass was filled with fur and fangs gray managed to stifle a yelp and keep himself from overbalancing onto his butt on something between a curse and a laugh he opened the door for con ten years off my life thanks very much he scratched the dogs ears and since brianna wasnt around to see decided to share the trifle with his canine companion what do you think youre up to gray straightened rapped his head against the cupboard door hed failed to close a spoonful of trifle plopped into the dogs bowl and was gobbled up nothing gray rubbed his throbbing head jesus christ between you and your wolf ill be lucky if i live to see my next birthday hes not to be eating that brianna snatched the bowl away from gray it isnt good for him i was going to eat it now ill settle for a bottle of aspirin sit down and ill have a look at the knot on your head or the hole in it whatever the case may be very cute why dont you just go back to bed and he never finished the thought from his stance between them con abruptly tensed snarled and with a growl bursting from his throat leaped toward the hallway door it was grays bad luck that he happened to be in the way the force of a hundred and seventy pounds of muscle had him reeling back and smashing into the counter he saw stars as his elbow cracked against the wood and dimly heard briannas sharp command are you hurt her tone was all soothing maternal concern now here now grayson youve gone pale sit down con heel ears ringing stars circling in front of his eyes the best gray could do was slide into the chair brianna held out for him all this for a fucking bowl of cream there now you just need to get your breath back let me see your arm shit grays eyes popped wide as she flexed his elbow and pain radiated out are you trying to kill me just because i want to get you naked stop that the rebuke was mild as she tuttutted over the bruise ive got some witch hazel id rather have morphine he blew out a breath and stared narroweyed at the dog con continued to stand quivering and ready at the doorway what the hell is with him i dont know con stop being a bloody fool and sit she dampened a cloth with witch hazel its probably mr smythewhite con was out roaming when he got in they havent been introduced its likely he caught a scent its lucky the old man didnt get a yen for trifle then she only smiled and straightened up to look at the top of grays head he had lovely hair she thought all gilded and silky oh con wouldnt hurt him hed just corner him there youll have a fine bump you will you dont have to sound so pleased about it itll teach you not to give the dog sweets ill just make you an ice pack and she squealed as gray yanked her into his lap the dogs ears pricked up but he merely wandered over and sniffed at grays hands he likes me hes easily charmed let me up or ill tell him to bite you he wouldnt i just gave him trifle lets just sit here a minute brie im too weak to bother you i dont believe that for a minute she said under her breath but relented gray cradled her head on his shoulder and smiled when con rested his on her lap this is nice it is she felt a little crack around her heart as he held her quietly in the dim light from the stove while the house settled m sleep around them chapter six brianna needed a taste of spring it was chancy she knew to begin too early but the mood wouldnt pass she gathered the seeds shed been hording and her small portable radio and carted them out to the little shed shed rigged as a temporary greenhouse it wasnt much and shed have been the first to admit it no more than eight feet square with a floor of hardpacked dirt the shed was better used for storage than planting but shed imposed on murphy to put in glass and a heater the benches shed built herself with little skill and a great deal of pride there wasnt room nor was there equipment for the kind of experimentation she dreamed of still she could give her seeds an early start in the peat pots shed ordered from a gardening supply catalog the afternoon was hers after all she told herself gray was closeted with his work and mr smythewhite was taking a motor tour of the ring of kerry all the baking and mending were done for the day so it was time for pleasure there was little that made her happier than having her hands in soil grunting a bit she hefted a bag of potting mix onto the bench next year she promised herself shed have a professional greenhouse not a large one but a fine one nonetheless shed take cuttings and root them force bulbs so that she could have spring any time of year she liked perhaps shed even attempt some grafting but for the moment she was content to baby her seeds in days she mused humming along with the radio the first tender sprigs would push through the soil true it was a horrid expense the luxury of fuel to warm them it would have been wiser to use the money to have her car overhauled but it wouldnt be nearly so much fun she sowed gently patting dirt and let her mind drift how sweet gray had been the night before she remembered cuddling with her in the kitchen it hadnt been so frightening nor she admitted so exciting as when hed kissed her this had been soft and soothing and so natural it had seemed just for a moment that theyd belonged there together once long ago shed dreamed of sharing small sweet moments like that with someone with rory she thought with an old dull pang then shed believed shed be married have children to love a home to tend to what plans shed made she thought now all rosy and warm with happy ever after at the end of them but then shed only been a girl and in love a girl in love believed anything believed everything she wasnt a girl now shed stopped believing when rory had broken her heart snapped it into two aching halves she knew he was living near boston now with a wife and a family of his own and she was sure with no thought whatever of the young sweet springtime when hed courted her and promised her and pledged to her that was long ago she reminded herself now she knew that love didnt always endure and promises werent always kept if she still carried a seed of hope inside that longed to bloom it hurt no one but herself here you are eyes dancing maggie burst into the shed i heard the music what in the world are you up to in here im planting flowers distracted brianna swiped the back of her hand over her cheek and smeared it with soil close the door maggie youre letting the heat out what is it you look about to burst youll never guess not in a thousand years with a laugh maggie swung around the small shed grabbing briannas arms to twirl her go ahead try youre having triplets no praise god maggies mood was infectious enough to have brianna chuckle and fall into the rhythm of the impromptu jig youve sold a piece of your glass for a million pounds to the president of the united states oh what a thought maybe we should send him a brochure no youre miles off you are miles ill give you a bit of a hint then rogans grandmother called brianna blew her tumbling hair out of her eyes thats a hint it would be if youd put your mind to it brie shes getting married shes marrying uncle niall next week in dublin what briannas mouth fell open on the word uncle niall mrs sweeney married isnt it grand isnt it just grand you know she had a crush on him when she was a girl in galway then after more than fifty years they meet again because of rogan and me now by all the saints in heaven theyre going to take vows tossing back her head she cackled now as well as being husband and wife rogan and i will be cousins uncle niall it seemed to be all brianna could manage you should have seen rogans face when he took the call he looked like a fish his mouth opening and closing and not a word coming out snorting with laughter she leaned against briannas workbench hes never gotten accustomed to the idea that they were courting more than courting if it comes to thatbut i suppose its a difficult thing for a man to imagine his whitehaired granny snuggled up in sin maggie overcome brianna covered her mouth with her hand giggles turned into hoots of laughter well theyre making it legal now with an archbishop no less officiating she took a deep breath looked around have you anything to eat out here no when is it to be where saturday next in her dublin house a small ceremony she tells me with just family and close friends uncle nialls eighty if hes a day brie imagine it i think i can oh and i do think its grand ill call them after ive finished here and cleaned up rogan and i are leaving for dublin today hes on the phone right now god bless him making arrangements she smiled a little hes trying to be a man about it hell be happy for them once he gets used to it briannas voice was vague as she began to wonder what sort of gift she should buy the bride and groom its to be an afternoon ceremony but you may want to come out the night before so youll have some time come out brianna focused on her sister again but i cant go maggie i cant leave i have a guest of course youll go maggie straightened from the bench set her jaw its uncle niall hell expect you there its one bloody day brianna maggie i have obligations here and no way to get to dublin and back rogan will have the plane take you but oh hang grayson thane he can cook his own meals for a day youre not a servant briannas shoulders stiffened her eyes turned cool no im not im a businesswoman whos given her word i cant dance off for a weekend in dublin and tell the man to fend for himself then bring him along if youre worried the man will fall over dead without you to tend him bring him with you bring him where gray pushed open the door eyed both women cautiously hed seen maggie go dashing into the shed from his bedroom window curiosity had eventually brought him out and the shouting had done the rest shut the door brianna said automatically she fought back embarrassment that he should have walked in on a family argument she sighed once the tiny shed was now crowded with people was there something you needed grayson no he lifted a hand brushing his thumb over the dirt on her cheeka gesture that had maggies eyes narrowing you have dirt on your face brie what are you up to im trying to put in some seedsbut theres hardly room for them now mind your hands boyo maggie muttered he only grinned and stuck them in his pockets i heard my name mentioned is there a problem there wouldnt be if she wasnt so stubborn maggie tossed up her chin and decided to dump the blame at grays feet she needs to go to dublin next weekend but she wont leave you grays grin turned into a satisfied smile as his gaze shifted from maggie to brianna wont she youve paid for room and board brianna began why do you need to go to dublin he interrupted our uncles getting married maggie told him hell want her there and thats as it should be i say if she wont leave you behind she should take you along maggie gray doesnt want to be going off to a wedding with people he doesnt know hes working and he cant just sure he does gray cut her off when do we leave good youll stay at our house there thats settled maggie brushed her hands together now whos going to tell mother i no let me maggie decided before brianna could answer she smiled shell really hate it well have the plane take her out saturday morning so you wont be badgered by her the whole trip have you a suit gray one or two he murmured then youre set arent you she leaned forward kissed brianna firmly on both cheeks plan to leave friday she ordered ill call you from dublin gray ran his tongue around his teeth as maggie slammed out bossy isnt she aye brianna blinked shook her head she doesnt mean it its just that shes always sure shes right and she has a deep fondness for uncle niall and for rogans grandmother rogans grandmother thats who hes marrying she turned back to her potting hoping to clear her mind with work that sounds like a story oh it tis gray its kind of you to be so obliging but its not necessary they wont miss me really and its a lot of trouble for you a weekend in dublins no trouble for me and you want to go dont you thats not the point maggie put you in a difficult position he put a hand under her chin lifted it why do you have such a hard time answering questions you want to go dont you yes or no yes okay we go her lips started to curve until he leaned toward them dont kiss me she said weakening now thats a lot of trouble for me but he reined himself in leaned back who hurt you brianna her lashes fluttered down shielding her eyes it may be i dont answer questions because you ask too many of them yes did you love him she turned her head concentrated on her pots very much it was an answer but he found it didnt please him are you still in love with him that would be foolish thats not an answer yes it is do i breathe down your neck when youre working no but he didnt step back but you have such an appealing neck to prove it he bent down to brush his lips over the nape it didnt hurt his ego to feel her tremble i dreamed of you last night brianna and wrote of it today most of her seeds scattered on the workbench instead of in the soil she busied herself rescuing them wrote of it i made some changes in the book youre a young widow whos struggling to build on a broken past despite herself she was drawn and turned to look at him youre putting me in your book pieces of you your eyes those wonderful sad eyes your hair he lifted a hand to it thick slippery hair the color of the coolest sunset your voice that soft lilt your body slim willowy with a dancers unconscious grace your skin your hands i see you when i write so i write of you and beyond the physical theres your integrity your loyalty he smiled a little your tea cakes the heros just as fascinated with her as i am with you gray set his hands on the bench on either side of her caging her in and he keeps running into that same shield you both have i wonder how long itll take him to break it down no one had ever said such words about her before such words to her a part of her yearned to wallow in them as if they were silk another part stood cautiously back youre trying to seduce me he lifted a brow howm i doing i cant breathe thats a good start he leaned closer until his mouth was a whisper from hers let me kiss you brianna he already was in that slow sinking way he had that turned all her muscles to mush mouth to mouth it was such a simple thing but it tilted every thing in her world further and further until she was afraid she would never right it again he had skill and with skill a patience beneath both was the shimmer of repressed violence she once sensed in him the combination seeped into her like a drug weakening dizzying she wanted as a woman wanted she feared as innocence feared gently he took the fingers she gripped on the edge of the bench soothed them open with his mouth skimming over hers he lifted her arms hold me brianna god he needed her to kiss me back like a crack of a whip his quiet words spurred her suddenly she was clinging to him her mouth wild and willing staggered he rocked back gripping her her lips were hot hungry her body vibrating like a plucked harp string the eruption of her passion was like lava spewing through ice frenzied unexpected and dangerous there was the elemental smell of earth the wail of irish pipes from the radio the succulent flavor of woman in his mouth and the quivering temptation of her in his arms then he was blind and deaf to all but her her hands were fisted in his hair her panting breaths filling his mouth more only wanting more he slammed her back against the shed wall he heard her cry outin shock pain excitementbefore he muffled the sound devouring it devouring her his hands streaked over her hotly possessive invasive and her pants turned to moans please she wanted to beg him for something oh please such an ache a deep grinding glorious ache but she didnt know the beginning of it or how it would end and the fear was snapping like a wolf behind itfear of him of herself of what shed yet to know he wanted her skinthe feel and taste of her flesh he wanted to pound himself inside of her until they were both empty the breath was tearing through his lungs as he gripped her shirt his hands poised to rip and rend and his eyes met hers her lips were bruised and trembling her cheeks pale as ice her eyes were wide with terror and need warring in them he looked down saw his knuckles were white from strain and the marks his greedy fingers had put on her lovely skin he jerked back as if shed slapped him then held up his hands he wasnt sure what or who he was warding off im sorry he managed while she stood pressed back into the wall gulping air im sorry did i hurt you i dont know how could she know where there was nothing but this horrible pulsing ache she hadnt dreamed she could feel like this hadnt known it was possible to feel so much dazed she brushed at the dampness on her cheeks dont cry he dragged an unsteady hand through his hair i feel filthy enough about this no its not she swallowed the tears she had no idea why she should shed them i dont know what happened to me of course she didnt he thought bitterly hadnt she told him she was innocent and hed gone at her like an animal in another minute he would have dragged her down on the dirt and finished the job i pushed you and theres no excuse for it i can only tell you i lost my head and apologize for it he wanted to go back to her brush the tangled hair from her face but didnt dare i was rough and frightened you it wont happen again i knew you would be she was steadier now perhaps because he seemed so shaken all along i knew it wasnt that grayson im not the fragile sort he found he could smile after all oh but you are brianna and ive never been quite so clumsy this may seem like an awkward time to tell you but you dont have to be afraid of me i wont hurt you i know you and im going to try my damnedest not to rush you he interrupted but i want you she discovered she had to concentrate to breath evenly again we cant always have what we want ive never believed that i dont know who he was brie but hes gone im here she nodded for now theres only now he shook his head before she could argue this is as odd a place for philosophy as it is for sex were both a little wired up right i suppose you could say that lets go inside this time ill make you some tea her lips curved do you know how ive been watching you come on he held out a hand she looked at it hesitated after another cautious glance at his faceit was calm now without that odd feral light that was so frightening and excitingshe slipped her hand into his maybe its a good thing weve got a chaperone tonight oh she turned her head as they stepped outside otherwise you might sneak up to my room tonight and take advantage of me she let out a short laugh youre too clever for anyone to take advantage of you well you could try relieved neither of them were trembling now he slung a companionable arm around her shoulders why dont we have a bit of cake with the tea she slid her eyes toward him as they reached the kitchen door mine or the one the woman makes in your book hers is only in my imagination darling now yours he froze when he pushed the door open instinctly he shoved brianna behind him stay here right here what are youoh sweet jesus over his shoulder she could see the chaos of her kitchen tins had been turned over cupboards emptied flour and sugar spices and tea were swept onto the floor i said stay here he repeated as she tried to shove by him ill not look at this mess he blocked her with an arm across the doorway do you keep money in your tins jewelry dont be daft of course i dont she blinked up at him you think someone was after stealing something ive nothing to steal and no one would well someone did and they could still be in the house wheres that damn dog he muttered hed be off with murphy she said dully he goes off to visit most afternoons run over to murphys then or to your sisters ill take a look around she drew herself up this is my home ill remind you ill look myself stay behind me was all he said he checked her rooms first ignoring her expected shriek of outrage when she saw the pulledout drawers and tumbled clothes my things well see if theres anything missing later better check the rest what sort of mischief is this she demanded her temper heating as she trailed behind gray oh damn them she swore when she saw the parlor it had been a quick hurried and frantic search gray mused anything but professional and foolishly risky he was thinking it through when another idea slammed into him shit he took the stairs two at a time burst into the mess of his own room and bolted straight for his laptop somebody will die he muttered booting it up your work brianna stood pale and furious in the doorway did they harm your work no he skimmed through page after page until he was satisfied no its here its fine she let out a little sigh of relief before turning away to check mr smythewhites room his clothes had been turned out of the drawers and closet his bed pulled apart mary mother of god how will i explain this to him i think its more to the point to ask what they were looking for sit down brianna gray ordered lets think this through whats to think about but she did sit on the edge of the tilted mattress ive nothing of value here a few pounds a few trinkets she rubbed her eyes impatient with herself for the tears she couldnt manage to stem it wouldnt have been anyone from the village or nearby it had to be a vagrant a hitchhiker perhaps hoping to find a bit of cash well she let out a shaky breath hell have been disappointed in what he found here she looked up abruptly paling again you did you have any mostly travelers checks theyre still here he shrugged he got a few hundred pounds thats all a fewhundred she bolted off the bed he took your money its not important brie not important she cut in youre living under my roof a guest in my home and had your money stolen how much was it ill make it good you certainly will not sit down and stop it i said ill make it good patience snapped he took her firmly by the shoulders and shoved her down on the bed they paid me five million for my last book before foreign and movie rights a few hundred pounds isnt going to break me his eyes narrowed when her lips quivered again take a deep breath now okay another i dont care if youve gold dripping from your fingers her voice broke humiliating her you want to cry some more he sighed lustily sat down beside her and braced for it okay let it rip im not going to cry she sniffled used the heels of her hands to dry her cheeks ive got too much to do itll take hours to put things right here youll need to call the police for what she lifted her hands let them fail if anyone saw a stranger lurking about my phone would already be ringing someone needed money and they took it she scanned the room wondering how much her other guest might have lost and how big a hole it would put in her precious savings i want you to say nothing to maggie about this goddamn it brie shes six months along i wont have her upset i mean this she gave him a steady look through eyes still shimmering with tears your word please fine whatever you want i want yours that youll tell me exactly whats missing i will ill phone to murphy and tell him hell ask about if theres something to know ill know it by nightfall calm again she rose i need to start putting things in order ill start with your room so you can get to your work ill see to my own room its for me to youre pissing me off brianna he unfolded himself slowly until he stood toe to toe with her lets get this straight youre not my maid my mother or my wife i can hang up my own clothes as you please swearing he grabbed her arm before she could walk out on him she didnt resist but stood very still looking just over his shoulder listen to me you have a problem here and i want to help you can you get that through your head want to help do you she inclined her head and spoke with all the warmth of a glacier you might go borrow some tea from murphy we seem to be out ill call him for you gray said evenly and ask him to bring some over im not leaving you alone here whatever suits you his numbers in the book in the kitchen by the she trailed off as the image of her lovely little room flashed into her head she closed her eyes gray would you leave me alone for a little while ill be better for it brianna he touched her cheek please shed crumble completely humiliatingly if he was kind now ill be fine again once im busy and id like some tea opening her eyes she managed to smile truly i would all right ill be downstairs grateful she got to work chapter seven gray sometimes toyed with the idea of buying himself a plane something very much along the lines of the sleek little jet rogan had left at his and briannas disposal for the trip to dublin might be just the ticket he could have it customdecorated to suit him play with the engine himself occasionally there was nothing to stop him from learning how to fly it it would certainly be an interesting toy he mused as he settled into the comfortable leather seat beside brianna and having his own transportation would eliminate the minor headache of arranging for tickets and being at the mercy of the hiccups of the airlines but owning somethinganythingequaled the tesponsibility of maintaining that something that was why he rented or leased but had never actually owned a car and though there was something to be said for the privacy and convenience of a neat little lear he thought he would miss the crowds and company and all the odd expected glitches of a commercial flight but not this time he slipped his hand over briannas as the plane began to taxi do you like to fly i havent done it very often the anticipation of spearing up into the sky still gave her stomach an intriguing little flip but yes i think i do i like looking down she smiled at herself as she watched the ground tilt away below it fascinated her always to picture herself above her own home the hills streaking through the clouds to somewhere else i suppose its second nature to you its fun thinking about where youre going and where youve been i dont think about that much ive just been there as the plane climbed he put a hand under her chin turned her face toward his to study it youre still worried it doesnt feel right going off like this and so luxuriously too catholic guilt the gilt in his eyes deepened when he grinned ive heard of that particular phenomenon its like if youre not doing something constructive and actually enjoying not doing it youre going to hell right nonsense she sniffed irritated that it was even partially true ive responsibilities and shirking them he tsked and fingered the gold cross she wore thats like the near occasion of sin isnt it what is the near occasion of sin exactly you are she said batting his hand away no kidding the idea of that appealed enormously i like it you would she tucked a loose pin into place and this has nothing to do with that if im feeling guilty its because im not used to just packing up and going on a moments notice i like to plan things out takes half the fun out of it it stretches out the fun to my way of thinking but she gnawed on her lip i know its important that i be in dublin for the wedding but leaving home just now murphys dog sitting gray reminded her and keeping an eye on the place a sharp eye gray was certain since hed talked to murphy privately old smythewhite left days ago so you dont have any customers to worry about guests she said automatically brow creasing i cant imagine hell be recommending blackthorn after what happened though he was terribly good about it he didnt lose anything never travel with cash you know gray said in a mimic of smythewhites prissy voice its an invitation for trouble she smiled a little as hed hoped he may not have had anything stolen but i doubt he spent a peaceful night knowing his room had been broken into his possessions pawed through which was why shed refused to charge him for his stay oh i dont know i havent had any trouble he unfastened his seat belt and rose to wander into the galley your brotherinlaws a classy guy he is yes her brow furrowed when gray came back with a bottle of champagne and two glasses youre not going to open that tis only a short flight and sure im going to open it dont you like champagne i like it well enough but her protest was cut off by the cheerful sound of a popping cork she sighed as a mother might seeing her child leap into a mud puddle now then he sat again poured both glasses after handing her one he tapped crystal to crystal and grinned tell me about the bride and groom did you say they were eighty uncle niall yes since there could be no putting the cork back into the bottle she sipped mrs sweeneys a few years younger imagine that it tickled him entering the matrimonial cage at their age cage it has a lot of restrictions and no easy way out enjoying the wine he let it linger on his tongue before swallowing so they were childhood sweethearts not exactly she murmured still frowning over his description of marriage they grew up in galway mrs sweeney was friends with my grandmothershe was uncle nialls sister you see and mrs sweeney had a bit of a crush on uncle niall then my grandmother married and moved to clare mrs sweeney married and went to dublin they lost track of each other then maggie and rogan began working together and mrs sweeney made the connection between the families i wrote of it to uncle niall and he brought himself down to dublin she smiled over it hardly noticing when gray refilled her glass the two of them have been close as bread and jam ever since the twists and turns of fate gray raised his glass in toast fascinating isnt it they love each other she said simply sighed i only hope she cut herself off and stared out the window again what i want them to have a fine day a lovely one im worried my mother will make it awkward she turned to him again however it embarrassed her it was best he knew so that he wouldnt be too shocked if there was a scene she wouldnt go out to dublin today wouldnt sleep in maggies dublin house she told me shed come tomorrow do her duty then go back immediately he lifted a brow not happy in cities he asked though he sensed it was something entirely different mothers not a woman who finds contentment easily anywhere at all i should tell you she may be difficult she doesnt approve you see of the wedding what does she think those crazy kids are too young to get married briannas lips curved but her eyes didnt reflect it its money marrying money as she sees it and she well she has strong opinions about the fact that theyve been living together in a way outside the sacrament living together he couldnt stop the grin in away living together she said primly and as mother will tell you if you give her the chance age hardly absolves them from the sin of fornication he choked on his wine he was laughing and whooping for air when he caught the glint of briannas narrowed gaze sorryi can see that wasnt meant to be a joke some people find it easy to laugh at anothers beliefs i dont mean to but he couldnt quite get the chuckles under control christ brie youve just told me the mans eighty and his blushing bride is right behind him you dont really believe theyre going to some firey hell because they he decided hed better find a delicate way of putting it theyve had a mature mutually satisfying physical relationship no some of the ice melted from her eyes no i dont of course but mother does or says she does because it makes it easier to complain families are complicated arent they from what ive observed i dont have one to worry about myself no family the rest of the ice melted into sympathy you lost your parents in a manner of speaking it would have been more apt he supposed to say they had lost him im sorry and youve no brothers no sisters nope he reached for the bottle again to top off his glass but youve cousins surely everyone had someone she thought grandparents or aunts uncles no she only stared devastated for him to have no one she couldnt conceive of it couldnt bear it youre looking at me like im some foundling bundled in a basket on your doorstep it amused him and oddly it touched him believe me honey i like it this way no ties no strings no guilts he drank again as if to seal the words simplifies my life empties it more like she thought it doesnt bother you having no one to go home to it relieves me maybe it would if i had a home but i dont have one of those either the gypsy she recalled but she hadnt taken him literally until now but grayson to have no place of your own no mortgage no lawn to mow or neighbor to placate he leaned over her to glance out the window look theres dublin but she looked at him felt for him but when you leave ireland where will you go i havent decided thats the beauty of it youve got a great house less than three hours after landing in dublin gray stretched his legs out toward the fire in rogans parlor i appreciate your putting me up its our pleasure rogan offered him a snifter of afterdinner brandy they were alone for the moment as brianna and maggie had driven to his grandmothers to help the bride with lastminute arrangements rogan still had trouble picturing his grandmother as a nervous bridetobe and more trouble yet imagining the man even now haranguing the cook as his future stepgrandfather you dont look too happy about it what rogan glanced back at gray made himself smile no im sorry its nothing to do with you im a bit uneasy about tomorrow i suppose givingthebrideaway jitters the best rogan could come up with was a grunt reading his host well gray tucked his tongue in his cheek and stirred the unease nialls an interesting character a character rogan muttered indeed your grandmother had stars in her eyes at dinner now rogan sighed she had never looked happier theyre besotted with each other well gray swirled his brandy there are two of us and one of him we could overpower him drag him off to the docks and put him on a ship bound for australia dont think i havent considered it but he smiled now easier theres no picking family is there and im forced to admit the man adores her maggie and brie are delighted so i find myself outgunned and outvoted i like him gray said in grinning apology how can you not like a man who wears a jacket the shade of a halloween pumpkin with tasseled alligator shoes there you are rogan waved an elegant hand in any case were pleased to be able to provide you with a wedding during your stay in ireland youre comfortable at blackthorn brianna has a knack for providing the comfortable she does grays expression sobered as he frowned into his drink something happened a few days ago that i think you should know she didnt want me to mention it particularly to maggie but id like your take on it all right the cottage was broken into blackthorn startled rogan set his brandy aside we were outside in that shed she uses for potting we might have been in there for half an hour maybe a little longer when we went back in someone had tossed the place excuse me turned it upside down gray explained a fast messy search id say that doesnt make sense but he leaned forward worried was anything taken i had some cash in my room gray shrugged it off that seems to be all brianna claims none of the neighbors would have come in that way shed be right rogan sat back again picked up his brandy but didnt drink its a closely knit community and bries well loved there did you inform the garda she didnt want to didnt see the point i did speak with murphy privately that would tend to it rogan agreed id have to think it was some stranger passing through but even that seems out of place dissatisfied with any explanation he tapped his fingers against the side of his glass youve been there some time now you must have gotten a sense of the people the atmosphere next stop brigadoon gray murmured logic points to a oneshot deal and thats how shes handling it gray moved his shoulders still i dont think it would hurt for you to keep an eye out when you come back ill do that rogan frowned into his brandy you can be sure of it youve a fine cook rogan me boy niall strolled in carting a tray loaded with china and a huge chocolate torte he was a large man sporting his thirty extra pounds like a badge of honor and did indeed look somewhat like a jolly jackolantern in his orange sport coat and limegreen tie a prince of a man he is niall set down the tray and beamed hes sent out this bit of sweet to help calm my nerves im feeling nervous myself grinning gray rose to cut into the torte himself niall boomed out with a laugh and slapped gray heartily on the back theres a lad good appetite why dont we tuck into this then have a few games of snooker he winked at rogan after all its my last night as a free man no more carousing with the boyos for me any whiskey to wash this down with whiskey rogan looked at the wide grinning face of his future grandfather i could use a shot myself they had several and then a few more by the time the second bottle was opened gray had to squint to see the balls on the snooker table and then they still tended to weave he ended by closing one eye completely he heard the balls clack together then stood back my point gentlemen my point he leaned heavily on his cue yank bastard cant lose tonight niall slapped gray on the back and nearly sent him nose first onto the table set em up again rogan me boy lets have another i cant see them rogan said slowly before lifting a hand in front of his face and peering at it i cant feel my fingers another whiskeys what you need like a sailor aboard a pitching deck niall made his way to the decanter not a drop he said sadly as he upended the crystal not a bleeding drop left theres no whiskey left in dublin rogan pushed himself away from the wall that was holding him up then fell weakly back weve drank it all drunk it all oh christ i cant feel my tongue either ive lost it lets see willing to help gray laid his hands heavily on rogans shoulders stick it out eyes narrowed he nodded s okay pal its there fact is youve got two of em thats the problem im marrying my chrissy tomorrow niall stood teetering dangerously left then right his eyes glazed his smile brilliant beautiful little chrissy the belle of dublin he pitched forward falling like a redwood with their arms companionably supporting each other rogan and gray stared down at him what do we do with him gray wondered rogan ran one of his two tongues around his teeth do you think hes alive doesnt look like it dont start the wake yet niall lifted his head just get me on me feet lads ill dance till dawn his head hit the floor again with a thud hes not so bad is he rogan asked when im drunk that is a prince of a man lets haul him up he cant dance on his face right they staggered over by the time theyd hefted niall to his knees they were out of breath and laughing like fools get up you dolt its like trying to shift a beached whale niall opened his bleary eyes tossed back his head and began in a wavering but surprisingly affecting tenor to sing and its all for me grog me jolly jolly grog its all for me beer and tobacco he grunted his way up on one foot nearly sent gray flying well i spent all me tin on lassies drinking gin far across the western ocean i must wander youll be lucky to wander to bed rogan told him he simply switched tunes well if youve got a wingo take me up to ringo where the waxies singo all the day well insulated by whiskey rogan joined in as the three of them teetered on their feet if youve had your fill of porter and you cant go any further that struck gray as wonderfully funny and he snickered his way into the chorus with the harmony and affection of the drunk they staggered their way down the hall by the time they reached the base of the stairs they were well into a whiskeysoaked rendition of dicey riley well i wouldnt say it was only poor old dicey riley whod taken to the sup would you brie maggie stood halfway down the stairs with her sister studying the trio below i wouldnt no folding her hands neatly at her waist brianna shook her head from the looks of them theyve dropped in for several little drops christ shes beautiful isnt she gray mumbled yes rogan grinned brilliantly at his wife takes my breath away maggie my love come give me a kiss ill give you the back of my hand but she laughed as she started down look at the lot of you pitiful drunk uncle niall youre old enough to know better getting married maggie mae wheres my chrissy he tried to turn a circle in search and had his two supporters tipping like dominoes in her own bed sleeping as you should be come on brie lets get these warriors off the field we were playing snooker gray beamed at brianna i won yank bastard niall said affectionately then kissed gray hard on the mouth well thats nice isnt it maggie managed to get an arm around rogan come on now thats the way one foot in front of the other somehow they managed to negotiate the steps they dumped niall first get rogan off to bed maggie brianna told her ill tuck this one in then come back and pull off uncle nialls shoes oh what heads theyll have tomorrow the prospect made maggie smile here we go sweeney off to bed mind your hands since she considered him harmless in his current state the order came out with a chuckle you havent a clue what to do with them in your state ill wager i do oh but you smell of whiskey and cigars brianna sighed and draped grays arm over her shoulders braced him the mans eighty you know you should have stopped him hes a bad influence that niall feeney we had to toast chrissys eyes and her lips and her hair and her ears i think we toasted her toes too but things get blurry about then and small wonder heres your door just a bit farther now you smell so good brianna with what he thought was a smooth move he sniffed doglike at her neck come to bed with me i could show you things all sorts of wonderful things mmmhmm down you go thats the way efficiently she lifted his legs onto the bed and began to take off his shoes lie down with me i can take you places i want to be inside you her hands fumbled at that she looked up sharply but his eyes were closed his smile dreamy hush now she murmured go to sleep she tucked a blanket around him brushed the hair from his brow and left him snoring suffering was to be expected overindulgence had to be paid for and gray was always willing to pay his way but it seemed a little extreme to have to take a short vicious trip to hell because of one foolish evening his head was cracked in two it didnt show a fact that relieved him considerably when he managed to crawl into the bathroom the following morning he looked haggard but whole obviously the jagged break in his skull was on the inside hed probably be dead by nightfall his eyes were small hard balls of fire the inside of his mouth had been swabbed with something too foul to imagine his stomach clutched and seized like a nervous fist he began to hope hed be dead long before nightfall since there was no one around he indulged himself in a few whimpers as he stepped under the shower hed have sworn the smell of whiskey was seeping out of his pores moving with the care of the aged or infirm he climbed out of the tub wrapped a towel around his waist he did what he could to wash the hideous taste out of his mouth when he stepped into the bedroom he yelped slapped his hands over his eyes in timehe hopedto keep them from bursting out of his head some sadist had come in and opened his drapes to the sunlight briannas own eyes had gone wide her mouth had fallen open other than the towel hanging loosely at his hips he wore nothing but a few lingering drops of water from his shower his body was the word exquisite flashed into her mind lean muscled gleaming she found herself linking her fingers together and swallowing hard i brought you a breakfast tray she managed i thought you might be feeling poorly cautious gray spread his fingers just enough to see through then it wasnt the wrath of god his voice was rough but he feared the act of clearing it might do permanent damage for a minute i thought i was being struck down for my sins its only porridge toast and some coffee coffee he said the word like a prayer could you pour it i could i brought you some aspirin aspirin he could have wept please take them first then she brought him the pills with a small glass of water rogan looks as sad as you she said as gray gobbled down the pillsand she fought to keep her hand from stroking over all that wet curling dark hair uncle nialls fit as a fiddle figures gray moved cautiously toward the bed he eased down praying his head wouldnt roll off his neck before we go any further do i have anything to apologize for to me to anyone whiskeys not my usual poison and im fuzzy on details after we started on the second bottle he squinted up at her and found she was smiling at him something funny nowell yes but its not very kind of me to find it funny she did give in then sleeking a hand over his hair as she might over that of a child who had overindulged in cakes i was thinking it was sweet of you to offer to apologize right off that way her smile warmed but no theres nothing you were just drunk and silly there was no harm in it easy for you to say he supported his head i dont make a habit of drinking like that wincing he reached for the coffee with his free hand in fact i dont believe ive ever had that much at one time or will again youll feel better when youve had a bite to eat you have a couple of hours before you have to drive over for the weddingif youre up to it wouldnt miss it resigned gray picked up the porridge it smelled safe he took a tentative bite and waited to see if his system would accept it arent i going with you im leaving in a few minutes theres things to be done youll come over with rogan and uncle niallsince its doubtful the three of you can get into any trouble on such a short drive he grunted and scooped up more porridge do you need anything else before i go youve hit most of the vital points tilting his head he studied her did i try to talk you into going to bed with me last night you did i thought i remembered that his smile was quick and easy i cant imagine how you resisted me oh i managed ill be off then brianna he sent her one quick dangerous look i wont be plastered next time christine rogan sweeney might have been on the verge of becoming a greatgrandmother but she was still a bride no matter how often she told herself it was foolish to be nervous to feel so giddy her stomach still jumped she was to be married in only a few minutes more to pledge herself to a man she loved dearly and to take his pledge to her and she would be a wife once again after so many years a widow you look beautiful maggie stood back as christine turned in front of the chevel glass the pale rose suit gleamed with tiny pearls on the lapels against christines shining white hair sat a jaunty matching hat with a fingertip veil i feel beautiful she laughed and turned to embrace maggie then brianna i dont care who knows it i wonder if niall could be as nervous as i am hes pacing like a big cat maggie told her and asking rogan for the time every ten seconds good christine drew in a long breath thats good then it is nearly time isnt it nearly brianna kissed her on each cheek ill be going down now to make sure everythings as it should be i wish you happiness aunt christine oh dear christines eyes filled how sweet you are dont do that maggie warned youll have us all going ill signal when were ready brie with a quick nod brianna hurried out there were caterers of course and a houseful of servants but a wedding was a family thing and she wanted it perfect the guests were milling in the parlorswirls of color snatches of laughter a harpist was playing in soft dreamy notes garlands of roses had been twined along the banister and pots of them were artistically decked throughout the house she wondered if she should slip into the kitchen just to be certain all was well when she spotted her mother and lottie fixing a bright smile on her face she went forward mother you look wonderful foolishness lottie nagged me into spending good money on a new dress but she brushed a hand fussily along the soft linen sleeve its lovely and sos yours lottie maeves companion laughed heartily we splurged sinfully we did but it isnt every day you go to such a fancy wedding the archbishop she said with a whisper and a wink imagine maeve sniffed a priests a priest no matter what hat hes wearing seems to me hed think twice before officiating at such a time when two people have lived in sin mother brianna kept her voice low but icily firm not today please if youd only brianna gray stepped up took her hand kissed it you look fabulous thank you she struggled not to flush as his fingers locked possessively around hers mother lottie this is grayson thane hes a guest at blackthorn gray maeve concannon and lottie sullivan mrs sullivan he took lotties hand making her giggle when he kissed it mrs concannon my congratulations on your lovely and talented daughters maeve only scowled his hair was as long as a girls she observed and his smile had more than a bit of the devil in it a yank are you yes maam im enjoying your country very much and your daughters hospitality paying tenants dont usually come to family weddings mother no they dont gray said smoothly thats another thing i find charming about your country strangers are treated as friends and friends never as strangers may i escort you to your seats lottie was already hooking her arm through his come ahead maeve how often are we going to get an offer from a finelooking young man like this youre a book writer are you i am he swept both women off sending a quick smug smile to brianna over his shoulder she could have kissed him even as she sighed in relief maggie signaled from the top of the stairs as the harpist switched to the wedding march brianna slipped to the back of the room her throat tightened as niall took his place in front of the hearth and looked toward the stairs perhaps his hair was thin and his waist thick but just then he looked young and eager and full of nerves the room hummed with anticipation as christine walked slowly down the stairs turned and with her eyes bright behind her veil went to him the archbishop blessed them and the ceremony began here gray slipped up beside brianna a few moments later and offered his handkerchief i had a feeling youd need this its beautiful she dabbed at her eyes the words sighed through her to love to honor to cherish gray heard till death do us part a life sentence hed always figured there was a reason people cried at weddings he put an arm around her shoulders and gave her a friendly squeeze buck up he murmured its nearly over its only beginning she corrected and indulged herself by resting her head on his shoulder applause erupted when niall thoroughly and enthusiastically kissed the bride chapter eight trips on private planes champagne and glossy society weddings were all well and good brianna supposed but she was glad to be home though she knew better than to trust the skies or the balmy air she preferred to think the worst of the winter was over she dreamed of her fine new greenhouse as she tended her seedlings in the shed and planned for her converted attic room while she hung the wash in the week shed been back from dublin she all but had the house to herself gray was closeted in his room working now and again he popped off for a drive or strolled into the kitchen sniffing for food she wasnt sure whether to be relieved or miffed that he seemed too preoccupied to try to charm more kisses from her still she was forced to admit that her solitude was more pleasant knowing he was just up the stairs she could sit by the fire in the evening reading or knitting or sketching out her plans knowing he could come wandering down to join her at any time but it wasnt gray who interrupted her knitting one cool evening but her mother and lottie she heard the car outside without much surprise friends and neighbors often stopped in when they saw her light on shed set her knitting aside and started for the door when she heard her mother and lottie arguing outside it brianna only sighed for reasons that escaped her the two women seemed to enjoy their bickering good evening to you she greeted them both with a kiss what a fine surprise i hope were not disturbing you brie lottie rolled her merry eyes maeve had it in her head we would come so here we are im always pleased to see you we were out werent we maeve shot back too lazy to cook she was so i have to drag myself out to a restaurant no matter how im feeling even brie must tire of her own cooking from time to time lottie said as she hung maeves coat on the hall rack as fine as it is and its nice to get out now and again and see people theres no one i need to see you wanted to see brianna didnt you it pleased lottie to score a small point thats why were here i want some decent tea is what i want not that pap they serve in the restaurant ill make it lottie patted briannas arm you have a nice visit with your ma i know where everything is and take that hound to the kitchen with you maeve gave con a look of impatient dislike i wont have him slobbering all over me youll keep me company wont you boyo cheerful lottie ruffled con between the ears come along with lottie now theres a good lad agreeable and ever hopeful for a snack con trailed behind her ive a nice fire in the parlor mother come and sit waste of fuel maeve muttered its warm enough without one brianna ignored the headache brewing behind her eyes its comforting with one did you have a nice dinner maeve gave a snort as she sat she liked the feel and the look of the fire but was damned if she would admit it dragged me off to a place in ennis and orders pizza she does pizza of all things oh i know the place youre speaking of they have lovely food rogan says the pizza tastes just as it does in the states brianna picked up her knitting again did you know that murphys sister kate is expecting again the girl breeds like a rabbit whats thisfour of them twill be her third shes two boys now and is hoping for a girl smiling brianna held up the soft pink yarn so im making this blanket for luck god will give her what he gives her whatever color you knit briannas needles clicked quietly so he will i had a card from uncle niall and aunt christine it has the prettiest picture of the sea and mountains on it theyre having a lovely time on their cruise ship touring the islands of greece honeymoons at their age and in her heart maeve yearned to see the mountains and foreign seas herself well if youve enough money you can go where you choose and do what you choose not all of us can fly off to warm places in the winter if i could perhaps my chest wouldnt be so tight with cold are you feeling poorly the question was automatic like the answers to the multiplication tables shed learned in school it shamed her enough to have her look up and try harder im sorry mother im used to it dr hogan does no more than cluck his tongue and tell me im fit but i know how i feel dont i you do yes briannas knitting slowed as she turned over an idea i wonder if youd feel better if you could go away for some sun hah and where am i to find sun maggie and rogan have that villa in the south of france its beautiful and warm there they say remember she drew me pictures went off with him to that foreign country before they were married theyre married now brianna said mildly wouldnt you like to go there mother you and lottie for a week or two such a nice rest in the sunshine you could have and the sea airs always so healing and how would i get there mother you know rogan would have the plane take you maeve could imagine it the sun the servants the fine big house overlooking the sea she might have had such a place of her own if if ill not ask that girl for any favors you neednt ill ask for you i dont know as im fit to travel maeve said for the simple pleasure of making things difficult the trip to dublin and back tired me all the more reason for you to have a nice vacation brianna returned knowing the game well ill speak to maggie tomorrow and arrange it ill help you pack dont worry anxious to see me off are you mother the headache was growing by leaps and bounds ill go all right maeve waved a hand for my health though the good lord knows how itll affect my nerves to be among all those foreigners her eyes narrowed and where is the yank grayson hes upstairs working working she huffed out a breath since when is spinning a tale working id like to know every other person in this county spins tales putting them on paper would be different id think and there are times when he comes down after hes been at it for a while he looks as though hes been digging ditches he seems that tired he looked frisky enough in dublinwhen he had his hands all over you what brianna dropped a stitch and stared do you think im blind as well as ailing spots of pink rode high on maeves cheeks mortified i was to see the way you let him carry on with you in public too we were dancing brianna said between lips that had gone stiff and cold i was teaching him some steps i saw what i saw maeve set her jaw and im asking you right now if youre giving your body to him if im the pink wool spilled onto the floor how can you ask me such a thing im your mother and ill ask what i please of you no doubt half the village is talking of it you being here alone night after night with the man no one is talking of it i run an inn and hes my guest a convenient path to sinive said so since you insisted on starting this business she nodded as if graysons presence there only confirmed her opinion you havent answered me brianna and i shouldnt but ill answer you i havent given my body to him or to anyone maeve waited a moment then nodded again well a liar youve never been so ill believe you i cant find it in me to care what you believe it was temper she knew that had her knees trembling as she rose do you think im proud and happy to have never known a man to have never found one who would love me ive no wish to live my life alone or to forever be making baby things for some other womans child dont raise your voice to me girl what good does it do to raise it brianna took a deep breath fought for calm what good does it do not to ill help lottie with the tea youll stay where you are mouth grim maeve angled her head you should thank god on your knees for the life you lead my girl youve a roof over your head and money in your pocket it may be i dont like how you earn it but youve made some small success out of your choice in what many would consider an honest living do you think a man and babies can replace that well youre wrong if you do maeve what are you badgering the girl about now wearily lottie came in and set down the tea tray stay out of this lottie please cooly calmly brianna inclined her head let her finish finish i will i had something once i could call mine and i lost it maeves mouth trembled once but she firmed it hardened it lost any chance i had to be what id wanted to be lust and nothing more the sin of it with a baby in my belly what could i be but some mans wife my fathers wife brianna said slowly so i was i conceived a child in sin and paid for it my whole life you conceived two children brianna reminded her aye i did the first your sister carried that mark with her wild she was and will always be but you were a child of marriage and duty duty with her hands planted on either arm of her chair maeve leaned forward and her voice was bitter do you think i wanted him to touch me again do you think i enjoyed being reminded why i would never have my hearts desire but the church says marriage should produce children so i did my duty by the church and let him plant another child in me duty brianna repeated and the tears she might have shed were frozen in her heart with no love no pleasure is that what i came from there was no need to share my bed with him when i knew i carried you i suffered another labor another birth and thanked god it would be my last you never shared a bed with him all those years there would be no more children with you i had done what i could to absolve my sin you dont have maggies wildness theres a coolness in you a control youll use that to keep yourself pureunless you let some man tempt you it was nearly so with rory i loved rory she hated knowing she was so near tears for her father she thought and the woman he had loved and let go you were a child maeve dismissed the heartbreak of youth but youre a woman now and pretty enough to draw a mans eye i want you to remember what can happen if you let them persuade you to give in the one upstairs hell come and hell go as he pleases forget that and you could end up alone with a baby growing under your apron and shame in your heart so often i wondered why there was no love in this house brianna took in a shuddering breath and struggled to steady her voice i knew you didnt love da couldnt somehow it hurt me to know it but then when i learned from maggie about your singing your career and how youd lost that i thought i understood and could sympathize for the pain you must have felt you could never know what it is to lose all youve ever wanted no i cant but neither can i understand a woman any woman having no love in her heart for the children she carried and birthed she lifted her hands to her cheeks but they werent wet dry and cold they were like marble against her fingers always youve blamed maggie for simply being born now i see i was nothing more than a duty to you a sort of penance for an earlier sin i raised you with care maeve began with care no its true you never raised your hand to me the way you did with maggie its a miracle she didnt grow to hate me for that alone it was heat with her and cold discipline with me and it worked well made us i suppose what we are very carefully she sat again picked up her yarn ive wanted to love you i used to ask myself why it was i could never give you more than loyalty and duty now i see it wasnt the lack in me but in you brianna appalled and deeply shaken maeve got to her feet how can you say such things to me ive only tried to spare you to protect you ive no need of protection im alone arent i and a virgin just as you wish it im knitting a blanket for another womans child as ive done before and will do again i have my business as you say nothing has changed here mother but for an easing of my conscience ill give you no less than ive always given you only ill stop berating myself for not giving more dryeyed again she looked up will you pour the tea lottie i want to tell you about the vacation you and mother will be taking soon have you been to france no lottie swallowed the lump in her throat her heart bled for both the women she sent a look of sorrow toward maeve knowing no way to comfort with a sigh she poured the tea no she repeated ive not been there are we going then yes indeed brianna picked up the rhythm of her knitting very soon if you like ill be talking to maggie about it tomorrow she read the sympathy in lotties eyes and made herself smile youll have to go shopping for a bikini brianna was rewarded with a laugh after setting the teacup on the table beside brianna lottie touched her cold cheek theres a girl she murmured a family from helsinki stayed the weekend at blackthorn brianna was kept busy catering to the couple and their three children out of pity she scooted con off to murphy the towheaded threeyearold couldnt seem to resist pulling ears and tailan indignity which concobar suffered silently unexpected guests helped keep her mind off the emotional upheaval her mother had stirred the family was loud boisterous and as hungry as bears just out of hibernation brianna enjoyed every moment of them she bid them goodbye with kisses for the children and a dozen tea cakes for their journey south the moment their car passed out of sight gray crept up behind her are they gone oh she pressed a hand to her heart you scared the life out of me turning she pushed at the stray wisps escaping her topknot i thought youd come down to say goodbye to the svensons little jon asked about you i still have little jons sticky fingerprints over half my body and most of my papers with a wry grin gray tucked his thumbs in his front pockets cute kid but jesus he never stopped threeyearolds are usually active youre telling me give one piggyback ride and youre committed for life now she smiled remembering you looked very sweet with him i imagine hell always remember the yank who played with him at the irish inn she tilted her head and he was holding the little lorry you bought him yesterday when he left lorryoh the truck right he shrugged i just happened to see it when i was taking a breather in the village just happened to see it she repeated with a slow nod as well as the two dolls for the little girls thats right anyway i usually get a kick out of opks opks other peoples kids but nowhe slipped his hands neatly around her waistwere alone again in a quick defensive move she pressed a hand to his chest before he could draw her closer ive errands to do he looked down at her hand lifted a brow errands thats right and ive a mountain of wash to do when i get back are you going to hang out the wash i love to watch you hang it on the lineespecially when theres a breeze its incredibly sexy what a foolish thing to say his grin only widened theres something to be said for making you blush too im not blushing she could feel the heat in her cheeks im impatient i need to be off grayson how about this ill take you where you need to go before she could speak he lowered his mouth brushed it lightly over hers ive missed you brianna you cant have ive been right here ive missed you he watched her lashes lower her shy uncertain responses to him gave him an odd sense of power all ego he thought amused at himself wheres your list my list youve always got one her gaze shifted up again those mistygreen eyes were aware and just a little afraid gray felt the surge of heat spear up from the balls of his feet straight to the loins his fingers tightened convulsively on her waist before he forced himself to step back let out a breath taking it slow is killing me he muttered i beg your pardon never mind get your list and whatever ill drive you i dont have a list ive only to go to my mothers and help her and lottie pack for their trip theres no need for you to take me i could use the drive how long will you be there two hours perhaps three ill drop you off pick you up im going out anyway he continued before she could argue itll save petrol all right if youre sure ill just be a minute while he waited gray stepped into the path of the front garden in the month hed been there hed seen gales rain and the luminous light of the irish sun hed sat in village pubs and listened to gossip traditional music hed wandered down lanes where farmers herded their cows from field to field and had walked up the winding steps of ruined castles hearing the echos of war and death hed visited grave sites and had stood on the verge of towering cliffs looking out on the rolling sea of all the places hed visited none seemed quite so appealing as the view from briannas front garden but he wasnt altogether certain if it was the spot or the woman he was waiting for either way he decided his time here would certainly be one of the most satisfying slices of his life after he dropped brianna off at the tidy house outside ennis he went wandering for more than an hour he clambered over rocks at the burren taking pictures in his head the sheer vastness delighted him as did the druids altar that drew so many tourists with their clicking cameras he drove aimlessly stopping where he chosea small beach deserted but for a small boy and a huge dog a field where goats cropped and the wind whispered through tall grass a small village where a woman counted out his change for his candy bar purchase with curled arthritic fingers then offered him a smile as sweet as sunlight a ruined abbey with a round tower caught his eye and had him pulling off the road to take a closer look the round towers of ireland fascinated him but hed found them primarily on the east coast to guard he supposed from the influx of invasions across the irish sea this one was whole undamaged and set at a curious slant gray spent some time circling studying and wondering how he could use it there were graves there as well some old some new he had always been intrigued by the way generations could mingle so comfortably in death when they rarely managed it in life for himself he would take the viking waya ship out to sea and a torch but for a man who dealt in death a great deal he preferred not to linger his thoughts overmuch on his own mortality nearly all of the graves he passed were decked with flowers many of them were covered with plastic boxes misty with condensation the blossoms within all no more than a smear of color he wondered why it didnt amuse him it should have instead he was touched stirred by the devotion to the dead they had belonged once he thought maybe that was the definition of family belong once belong always hed never had that problem or that privilege he wandered through wondering when the husbands the wives the children came to lay the wreaths and flowers on the day of death the day of birth the feast day of the saint the dead had been named for or easter maybe that was a big one for catholics hed ask brianna he decided it was something he could definitely work into his book he couldnt have said why he stopped just at that moment why he looked down at that particular marker but he did and he stood alone the breeze ruffling his hair looking down at thomas michael concannons grave briannas father he wondered and felt an odd clutch around his heart the dates seemed right omalley had told him stories of tom concannon when gray had sipped at a guinness at the pub stories ripe with affection sentiment and humor gray knew he had died suddenly at the cliffs at loop head with only maggie with him but the flowers on the grave gray was certain were briannas doing theyd been planted over him though the winter had been hard on them gray could see theyd been recently weeded more than a few brave blades of green were spearing up searching for the sun hed never stood over a grave of someone hed known though he often paid visits to the dead thered been no pilgrimage to the resting place of anyone hed cared for but he felt a tug now one that made him crouch down and brush a hand lightly over the carefully tended mound and he wished hed brought flowers tom concannon he murmured youre well remembered they talk of you in the village and smile when they say your name i guess thats as fine an epitaph as anyone could ask for oddly content he sat beside tom awhile and watched sunlight and shadows play on the stones the living planted to honor the dead he gave brianna three hours it was obviously more than enough as she came out of the house almost as soon as he pulled up in front of it his smile of greeting turned to a look of speculation as he got a closer look her face was pale as he knew it became when she was upset or moved her eyes though cool showed traces of strain he glanced toward the house saw the curtain move he caught a glimpse only but maeves face was as pale as her daughters and appeared equally unhappy all packed he said keeping his tone mild yes she slipped into the car her hands tight around her purseas if it was the only thing that kept her from leaping up thank you for coming for me a lot of people find packing a chore gray pulled the car out and for once kept his speed moderate it can be normally she enjoyed it the anticipation of going somewhere and more the anticipation of returning home its done now and theyll be ready to leave in the morning god she wanted to close her eyes to escape from the pounding headache and miserable guilt into sleep do you want to tell me whats upset you im not upset youre wound up unhappy and as pale as ice its personal its family business the fact that her dismissal stung surprised him but he only shrugged and lapsed into silence im sorry now she did close her eyes she wanted peace couldnt everyone just give her a moments peace that was rude of me forget it he didnt need her problems in any case he reminded himself then he glanced at her and swore under his breath she looked exhausted i want to make a stop she started to object then kept her eyes and mouth closed hed been good enough to drive her she reminded herself she could certainly bear a few minutes longer before she buried all this tension in work he didnt speak again he was driving on instinct hoping the choice he made would bring the color back to her cheeks and the warmth to her voice she didnt open her eyes again until he braked and shut the engine off then she merely stared at the castle ruins you needed to stop here i wanted to stop here he corrected i found this my first day here its playing a prominent part in my book i like the feel of it he got out rounded the hood and opened her door come on when she didnt move he leaned down and unfastened her seat belt himself come on its great wait till you see the view from the top ive wash to do she complained and heard the sulkiness of her own voice as she stepped out of the car its not going anywhere he had her hand now and was tugging her over the high grass she didnt have the heart to point out that the ruins werent likely to go anywhere either youre using this place in your book big murder scene he grinned at her reaction the uneasiness and superstition in her eyes not afraid are you i dont usually act out my scenes dont be foolish but she shivered once as they stepped between the high stone walls there was grass growing wild on the ground bits of green pushing its way through chinks in the stone above her she could see where the floors had been once so many years ago but now time and war left the view to the sky unimpeded the clouds floated silently as ghosts what do you suppose they did here right here gray mused lived worked fought thats too general use your imagination cant you see it the people walking here its winter and its bone cold ice rings on the water barrels frost on the ground that snaps like dry twigs underfoot the air stings with smoke from the fires a babys crying hungry then stops when his mother bares her breast he drew her along with him physically emotionally until she could almost see it as he did soldiers are drilling out there and you can hear the ring of sword to sword a man hurries by limping from an old wound his breath steaming out in cold clouds come on lets go up he pulled her toward narrow tight winding stairs every so often there would be an opening in the stone a kind of cave she wondered if people had slept there or stored goods or tried to hide perhaps from the enemy who would always find them thered be an old woman carrying an oil lamp up here and she has a puckered scar on the back of her hand and fear in her eyes anothers bringing fresh rushes for the floors but shes young and thinking of her lover gray kept her hand in his stopping when they came to a level midway it must have been the cromwellians dont you think who sacked it thered have been screams the stench of smoke and blood that nasty thud of metal hacking into bone and that highpitched shriek a man makes when the pain slices him spears driving straight through bellies pinning a body to the ground where the limbs would twitch before nerves died crows circling overhead waiting for the feast he turned saw her eyes were wide and glazedand chuckled sorry i get caught up its not just a blessing to have an imagination like that she shivered again and fought to swallow i dont think i want you to make me see it so clear deaths fascinating especially the violent type men are always hunting men and this is a hell of a spot for murder of the contemporary sort your sort she murmured mmm hell toy with the victim first gray began as he started to climb again he was caught up in his own mind true but he could see brianna was no longer worrying over whatever had happened at her mothers let the atmosphere and those smoky ghosts stir into the fear like a slow poison he wont hurryhe likes the hunt craves it he can scent the fear like any wolf he can scent it its the scent that gets in his blood and makes it pump that arouses him like sex and the prey runs chasing that thin thread of hope but shes breathing fast the sound of it echoes carries on the wind she fallsthe stairs are treacherous in the dark in the rain wet and slick theyre weapons themselves but she claws her way up them air sobbing in and out of her lungs her eyes wild gray shes nearly as much of an animal as he now terrors stripped off layers of humanity the same as good sex will or true hunger most people think theyve experienced all three but its rare even to know one sensation fully but she knows the first now knows that terror as if it was solid and alive as if it could wrap its hands around her throat she wants a bolt hole but theres nowhere to hide and she can hear him climbing slowly tirelessly behind her then she reaches the top he drew brianna out of the shadows onto the wide walled ledge where sunlight streamed and shes trapped she jolted when gray swung her around nearly screamed roaring with laughter he lifted her off her feet christ what an audience you are tisnt funny she tried to wiggle free its wonderful im planning on having him mutilate her with an antique dagger but he hooked his arm under briannas knees and carried her to the wall maybe he should just dump her over the side stop out of selfpreservation she threw her arms around him and clung why didnt i think of this before your hearts pounding youve got your arms around me bully got your mind off your troubles didnt it ill keep my troubles thank you and keep out of that twisted imagination of yours no no one does he snuggled her a little closer thats what fictions all about books movies whatever it gives you a break from reality and lets you worry about someone elses problems what does it do for you who tells the tale same thing exactly the same thing he set her on her feet and turned her to the view its like a painting isnt it gently he drew her closer until her back was nestled against him as soon as i saw this place it grabbed me it was raining the first time i came here and it almost seemed as if the colors should run she sighed here was the peace shed wanted after all in his odd roundabout way hed given it to her its nearly spring she murmured you always smell of spring he bent his head to rub his lips over the nape of her neck and taste of it youre making my legs weak again then youd better hold on to me he turned her cupped a hand at her jaw i havent kissed you in days i know she built up her courage kept her eyes level ive wanted you to that was the idea he touched his lips to hers stirred when her hands slipped up his chest to frame his face she opened for him willingly her little murmur of pleasure as arousing as a caress with the wind swirling around them he drew her closer careful to keep his hands easy his mouth gentle all the strain the fatigue the frustration had vanished she was home was all that brianna could think home was always where she wanted to be on a sigh she rested her head on his shoulder curved her arms up his back ive never felt like this nor had he but that was a dangerous thought and one he would have to consider its good with us he murmured theres something good about it there is she lifted her cheek to his be patient with me gray i intend to i want you brianna and when youre ready he stepped back ran his hands down her arms until their fingers linked when youre ready chapter nine gray wondered if his appetite was enhanced due to the fact that he had another hunger that was far from satisfied he thought it best to take it philosophicallyand help himself to a latenight feast of briannas breadandbutter pudding making tea was becoming a habit as well and hed already set the kettle on the stove and warmed the pot before he scooped out pudding into a bowl he didnt think hed been so obsessed with sex since his thirteenth year then it had been sally anne howe one of the other residents of the simon brent memorial home for children good old sally anne gray thought now with her well blossomed body and sly eyes shed been three years older than he and more than willing to share her charms with anyone for smuggled cigarettes or candy bars at the time he thought she was a goddess the answer to a randy adolescents prayers he could look back now with pity and anger knowing the cycle of abuse and the flaws in the system that had made a pretty young girl feel her only true worth was nestled between her thighs hed had plenty of sweaty dreams about sally anne after lights out and had been lucky enough to steal an entire pack of marlboros from one of the counselors twenty cigarettes had equaled twenty fucks he remembered and hed been a very fast learner over the years hed learned quite a bit more from girls his own age and from professionals who plied their trade out of darkened doorways that smelled of stale grease and sour sweat hed been barely sixteen when hed broken free of the orphanage and hit the road with the clothes on his back and twentythree dollars worth of loose change and crumpled bills in his pocket freedom was what hed wanted freedom from the rules the regulations the endless cycle of the system hed been caught in most of his life hed found it and used it and paid for it hed lived and worked those streets for a long time before hed given himself a name and a purpose hed been fortunate enough to have possessed a talent that had kept him from being swallowed up by other hungers at twenty hed had his first lofty and sadly autobiographical novel under his belt the publishing world had not been impressed by twentytwo hed crafted out a neat clever little whodunit publishers did not come clamoring but a whiff of interest from an assistant editor had kept him holed up in a cheap rooming house battering at a manual typewriter for weeks that hed sold for peanuts nothing before or since had meant as much to him ten years later and he could live as he chose and he felt hed chosen well he poured the water into the pot shoveled a spoonful of pudding into his mouth as he glanced over at briannas door spotted the thin slant of light beneath it he smiled hed chosen her too covering his bases he set the pot with two cups on a tray then knocked at her door yes come in she was sitting at her little desk tidy as a nun in a flannel gown and slippers her hair in a loose braid over one shoulder gray gamely swallowed the saliva that pooled in his mouth saw your light want some tea that would be nice i was just finishing up some paperwork the dog uncurled himself from beside her feet and walked over to rub against gray me too he set down the tray to ruffle cons fur murder makes me hungry killed someone today did you brutally he said it with such relish she laughed perhaps thats what makes you so even tempered all in all she mused all those emotional murders purging your system do you ever she caught herself moving a shoulder as he handed her a cup go ahead ask you rarely ask anything about my work because i imagine everyone does they do he made himself comfortable i dont mind well i was wondering if you ever make one of the characters someone you knowthen kill them off there was this snotty french waiter in dijon i garotted him oh she rubbed a hand over her throat how did it feel for him or me for you satisfying he spooned up pudding want me to kill someone for you brie i aim to please not at the moment no she shifted and some of her papers fluttered to the floor you need a typewriter he told her as he helped her gather them up better yet a word processor it would save you time writing business letters not when id have to search for every key while he read her correspondence she cocked a brow amused tisnt very interesting hmm oh sorry habit whats triquarter mining oh just a company da must have invested it i found the stock certificate with his things in the attic ive written them once already she added mildly annoyed but had no answer so im trying again ten thousand shares gray pursed his lips thats not chump change it is if i think i know what youre saying you had to know my fatherhe was always after a new moneymaking scheme that cost more than it would ever earn still this needs to be done she held out a hand thats just a copy rogan took the original for safekeeping and made that for me you should have him check it out i dont like to bother him with it his plates full with the new galleryand with maggie he handed her back the copy even at a dollar a share its fairly substantial id be surprised if it was worth more than a pence a share god knows he couldnt have paid much more more likely it is that the whole company went out of business then your letter would have come back she only smiled youve been here long enough to know the irish mails i think they both glanced over as the dog began to growl con instead of responding the dog growled again and the fur on his back lifted in two strides gray was at the windows he saw nothing but mist fog he muttered ill go look around no he said when she started to rise its dark its cold its damp and youre staying put theres nothing out there con and i will find out lets go he snapped his fingers and to briannas surprise con responded immediately he pranced out at grays heels she kept a flashlight in the first kitchen drawer gray snagged it before he opened the door the dog quivered once then as gray murmured go leaped into the mist in seconds the sound of his racing feet was muffled to silence the fog distorted the beam from the flash gray moved carefully eyes and ears straining he heard the dog bark but from what direction or distance he couldnt say he stopped by briannas bedroom windows playing the light on the ground there in her neat bed of perennials was a single footprint small gray mused crouching down nearly small enough to be a childs it could be as simple as thatkids out on a lark but when he continued to circle the house he heard the sound of an engine turning over cursing he quickened his pace con burst through the mist like a diver spearing through the surface of a lake no luck to commiserate gray stroked cons head as they both stared out into the fog well im afraid i might know what this is about lets go back brianna was gnawing on her nails when they came through the kitchen door you were gone so long we wanted to circle the whole way around he set the flashlight on the counter combed a hand through his damp hair this could be related to your breakin i dont see how you didnt find anyone because we werent quick enough theres another possible explanation he jammed his hands in his pockets me you what do you mean ive had it happen a few times an overenthusiastic fan finds out where im staying sometimes they come calling like they were old palssometimes they just trail you like a shadow now and again they break in look for souvenirs but thats dreadful its annoying but fairly harmless one enterprising woman picked the lock on my hotel room at the paris ritz stripped and crawled into bed with me he tried for a grin it was awkward awkward brianna repeated after shed managed to close her mouth whatno i dont think i want to know what you did called security his eyes went bright with amusement there are limits to what ill do for my readers anyway this might have been kids but if it was one of my adoring fans you might want me to find other accommodations i do not her protective instincts snapped into place theyve no right to intrude on your privacy that way and youll certainly not leave here because of it she let out a huff of breath its not just your stories you know oh they draw people init all seems so real and theres always something heroic that rises above all the greed and violence and grief its your picture too he was charmed by her description of his work and answered absently what about it your face she looked at him then its such a lovely face he didnt know whether to laugh or wince really yes its she cleared her throat there was a gleam in his eyes she knew better than to trust and the little biography on the backmore the lack of it its as if you came from nowhere the mystery of its appealing i did come from nowhere why dont we go back to my face she took a step in retreat i think theres been enough excitement for the night he just kept moving forward until his hands were on her shoulders and his mouth lay quietly on hers will you be able to sleep yes her breath caught expelled lazily con will be with me lucky dog go on get some sleep he waited until she and the dog were settled then did something brianna hadnt done in all the years shed lived in the house he locked the doors the best place to spread news or to garner it was logically the village pub in the weeks hed been in clare county gray had developed an almost sentimental affection for omalleys naturally during his research hed breezed into a number of public houses in the area but omalleys had become for him as close to his own neighborhood bar as hed ever known he heard the lilt of music even as he reached for the door murphy he thought now that was lucky the moment gray stepped in he was greeted by name or a cheery wave omalley began to build him a pint of guiness before hed planted himself in a seat well hows the story telling these days omalley asked him its fine two dead no suspects with a shake of his head omalley slipped the pint under grays nose dont know how it is a man can play with murder all the day and still have a smile on his face of an evening unnatural isnt it gray grinned at him ive a story for you this came from david ryan who sat on the end of the bar and lighted one of his american cigarettes gray settled back amid the music and smoke there was always a story and he was as good a listener as he was a teller was a maid who lived in the countryside near tralee beautiful as a sunrise she was with hair like new gold and eyes as blue as kerry conversation quieted and murphy lowered his music so that it was a backdrop for the tale it happened that two men came acourting her david went on one was a bookish fellow the other a farmer in her way the maid loved them both for she was as fickle of heart as she was lovely of face so enjoying the attention as a maid might she let them both dangle for her making promises to each and there began to grow a blackness in the heart of the young farmer side by side with his love of the maid he paused as storytellers often do and studied the red glow at the end of his cigarette he took a deep drag expelled smoke so one night he waited for his rival along the roadside and when the bookish fellow came awhistlingfor the maid had given him her kisses freelythe farmer leaped out and bore the young lover to the ground he dragged him you see in the moonlight across the fields and though the poor sod still breathed he buried him deep when dawn came he sowed his crop over him and put an end to the competition david paused again drew deep on his cigarette reached for his pint and gray asked caught up he married the maid no indeed he didnt she ran off with a tinker that very day but the farmer had the best bloody crop of hay of his life there were roars of laughter as gray only shook his head he considered himself a professional liar and a good one but the competition here was fierce amid the chuckles gray picked up his glass and went to join murphy daveys a tale for every day of the week murphy told him gently running his hands along the buttons of his squeeze box i imagine my agent would scoop him up in a heartbeat heard anything murphy no nothing helpful mrs leery thought she might have seen a car go by the day of your troubles she thinks it was green but didnt pay it any mind someone was poking around the cottage last night lost him in the fog gray remembered in disgust but he was close enough to leave a footprint in bries flower bed might have been kids gray took a contemplative sip of beer has anyone been asking about me youre a daily topic of conversation murphy said dryly ah fame no i mean a stranger not that ive heard youd better to ask over at the post office why i think it might be an overenthusiastic fan ive run into it before then again he shrugged its the way my mind works always making more out of whats there theres a dozen men or more a whistle away if anyone gives you or brie any trouble murphy glanced up as the door to the pub opened brianna came in flanked by rogan and maggie his brow lifted as he looked back at gray and a dozen men or more wholl haul you off to the altar if you dont mind that gleam in your eye what gray picked up his beer again and his lips curved just looking aye im a rover murphy sang and seldom sober im a rover of high degree for when im drinking im always thinking how to gain my loves company theres still half a pint in this glass gray muttered and rose to walk to brianna i thought you had mending i did we bullied her into coming out maggie explained and gave a little sigh as she levered herself onto a stool persuaded rogan corrected a glass of harp brie thank you i will tea for maggie tim rogan began and grinned as his wife muttered a glass of harp for brie a pint of guiness for me another pint gray thisll do me gray leaned against the bar i remember the last time i went drinking with you speaking of uncle niall maggie put in he and his bride are spending a few days on the island of crete play something bright will you murphy obligingly he reeled into whiskey in the jar and set her feet tapping after listening to the lyrics gray shook his head why is it you irish always sing about war do we maggie smiled sipping at her tea as she waited to join in the chorus sometimes its betrayal or dying but mostly its war is that a fact she smiled over the rim of her cup i couldnt say then again it might be that weve had to fight for every inch of our own ground for centuries or dont get her started rogan pleaded theres a rebels heart in there theres a rebels heart inside every irish man or woman murphys a fine voice he does why dont you sing with him brie enjoying the moment she sipped her harp id rather listen id like to hear you gray murmured and stroked a hand down her hair maggie narrowed her eyes at the gesture brie has a voice like a bell she said we always wondered where she got it until we found out our mother had one as well how about danny boy maggie rolled her eyes count on a yank to ask for it a brit wrote that tune outlander do james connolly murphy brie sing with you with a resigned shake of her head brianna went to sit with murphy they make lovely harmony maggie murmured watching gray mmm she sings around the house when she forgets someones there and how long do you plan to be there maggie asked ignoring rogans warning scowl until im finished gray said absently then onto the next thats right onto the next despite the fact that rogan now had his hand clamped at the back of her neck maggie started to make some pithy comment it was grays eyes rather than her husbands annoyance that stopped her the desire in them had stirred her protective instincts but there was something more now she wondered if he was aware of it when a man looked at a woman that way more than hormones were involved shed have to think it over maggie decided and see how it set with her in the meantime she picked up her tea again still watching gray well see about that she murmured well just see about it one song became two and two three the war songs the love songs the sly and the sad in his mind gray began to craft a scene the smoky pub was filled with noise and musica sanctuary from the horrors outside the womans voice drawing the man who didnt want to be drawn here he thought just here was where his hero would lose the battle she would be sitting in front of the turf fire her hands neatly folded in her lap her voice soaring effortless and lovely her eyes as haunted as the tune and he would love her then to the point of giving his life if need be certainly of changing it he could forget the past with her and look toward the future you look pale gray maggie tugged on his arm until he backed onto a stool how many pints have you had just this he scrubbed a hand over his face to bring himself back i was just working he finished that was it of course hed only been thinking of characters of crafting the lie nothing personal looked like a trance same thing he let out a little breath laughed at himself i think ill have another pint after all chapter ten with the pub scene hed spun in his imagination replaying in his head gray did not spend a peaceful night though he couldnt erase it neither could he seem to write it at least not well the one thing he despised was even the idea of writers block normally he could shrug it off continue working until the nasty threat of it passed much he sometimes thought like a blackedged cloud that would then hover over some other unfortunate writer but this time he was stuck he couldnt move into the scene nor beyond it and spent a great deal of the night scowling at the words hed written cold he thought he was just running cold thats why the scene was cold itchy was what he was he admitted bitterly sexually frustrated by a woman who could hold him off with no more than one quiet look served him right for obsessing over his landlady when he should be obsessing about murder muttering to himself he pushed away from his desk and stalked to the window it was just his luck that brianna should be the first thing he saw there she was below his window neat as a nun in some prim pink dress her hair all swept up and pinned into submission why was she wearing heels he wondered and leaned closer to the glass he supposed shed call the unadorned pumps sensible shoes but they did senselessly wonderful things to her legs as he watched she climbed behind the wheel of her car her movements both practical and graceful shed set her purse on the seat beside her first he thought and so she did then carefully buckle her seat belt check her mirrors no primping in the rearview for brianna he noted just a quick adjustment to be certain it was aligned properly now turn the key even through the glass he could hear the coughing fatigue of the engine she tried it again and a third time by then gray was shaking his head and heading downstairs why the hell dont you get that thing fixed he shouted at her as he strode out the front door oh she was out of the car by now and trying to lift the hood it was working just fine a day or two ago this heap hasnt worked fine in a decade he elbowed her aside annoyed that she should look and smell so fresh when he felt like old laundry look if you need to go to the village for something take my car ill see what i can do with this in automatic defense against the terse words she angled her chin thank you just the same but im going to ennistymon ennistymon even as he placed the village on his mental map he lifted his head from under the hood long enough to glare at her what for to look at the new gallery theyll be opening it in a couple of weeks and maggie asked if id come see she stared at his back as he fiddled with wires and cursed i left you a note and food you can heat since ill be gone most of the day youre not going anywhere in this fan belts busted fuel lines leaking and its a pretty good bet your starter motors had it he straightened noted that she wore earrings today thin gold hoops that just brushed the tips of her lobes they added a celebrational air that irritated him unreasonably youve got no business driving around in this junkyard well its what i have to drive isnt it ill thank you for your trouble grayson ill just see if murphy can dont pull that ice queen routine on me he slammed the hood hard enough to make her jolt good he thought it proved she had blood in her veins and dont throw murphy up in my face he couldnt do any more with it than i can go get in my car ill be back in a minute and why would i be getting in your car so i can drive you to goddamn ennistymon teeth set she slapped her hands on her hips its so kind of you to offer but get in the car he snapped as he headed for the house i need to soak my head id soak it for you she muttered yanking open her car door she snatched out her purse whod asked him to drive her shed like to know why shed rather walk every step than sit in the same car with such a man and if she wanted to call murphy well shed damn well call him but first she wanted to calm down she took a deep breath then another before walking slowly among her flowers they soothed her as always the tender green just beginning to bud they needed some work and care she thought bending down to tug out an invading weed if tomorrow was fine shed begin by easter her garden would be in its glory the scents the colors she smiled a little at a brave young daffodil then the door slammed her smile gone she roseturned he hadnt bothered to shave she noted his hair was damp and pulled back by a thin leather thong his clothes clean if a bit ragged she knew very well the man had decent clothes why didnt she wash and iron them herself he flicked a glance at her tugged the keys out of his jeans pocket in the car oh he needed a bit of a coming down he did she walked to him slowly ice in her eyes and heat on her tongue and what do you have to be so cheerful about this morning sometimes even a writer understood that actions can speak louder than words without giving either of them time to think he hauled her against him took one satisfied look at the shock that raced over her face then crushed her mouth with his it was rough and hungry and full of frustration her heart leaped seemed to burst in her head she had an instant to fear a moment to yearn then he was yanking her away again his eyes oh his eyes were fierce a wolfs eyes she thought dully full of violence and stunning strength got it he tossed out furious with her with himself when she only stared like a child he thought whod just been slapped for no reason it was a feeling he remembered all too well christ im going crazy he scrubbed his hands over his face and fought back the beast im sorry get in the car brianna im not going to jump you his temper flashed again when she didnt move didnt blink im not going to fucking touch you she found her voice then though it wasnt as steady as she might have liked why are you angry with me im not he stepped back control he reminded himself he was usually pretty good at it im sorry he repeated stop looking at me as if id just punched you but he had didnt he know that anger harsh words hard feelings wounded her more than a violent hand im going inside she found her defenses the thin walls that blocked out temper i need to call maggie and tell her i cant be there brianna he started to reach out then lifted both hands in a gesture that was equal parts frustration and a plea for peace how bad do you want me to feel i dont know but i imagine youll feel better after some food now shes going to fix me breakfast he closed his eyes took a steadying breath even tempered he muttered and looked at her again isnt that what you said i was not too long ago you were more than a little off the mark writers are miserable bastards brie moody mean selfish selfabsorbed youre none of those things she couldnt explain why she felt bound to come to his defense moody perhaps but none of the others i am depending on how the books going right now its going badly so i behaved badly i hit a snag a wall a goddamn fortress and i took it out on you do you want me to apologize again no she softened reached out and laid a hand on his stubbled cheek you look tired gray i havent slept he kept his hands in his pockets his eyes on hers be careful how sympathetic you are brianna the books only part of the reason im feeling raw this morning youre the rest of it she dropped her hand as if shed touched an open flame her quick withdrawal had his lips curling i want you it hurts wanting you this way it does that wasnt supposed to make you look pleased with yourself her color bloomed i didnt mean to thats part of the problem come on get in the car please he added ill drive myself insane trying to write today if i stay here it was exactly the right button to push she slipped into the car and waited for him to join her perhaps if you just murdered someone else he found he could laugh after all oh im thinking about it worldwide gallery of clare county was a gem newly constructed it was designed like an elegant manor house complete with formal gardens it wasnt the lofty cathedral of the gallery in dublin nor the opulent palace of rome but a dignified building specifically conceived to house and showcase the work of irish artists it had been rogans dream and now his and maggies reality brianna had designed the gardens though she hadnt been able to plant them herself the landscapers had used her scheme so that brick walkways were flanked with roses and wide semicircular beds were planted with lupins and poppies dianthus and foxglove columbine and dahlias and all of her favorites the gallery itself was built of brick soft rose in color with tall graceful windows trimmed in muted gray inside the grand foyer the floor was tiled in deep blue and white with a waterford chandelier overhead and the sweep of mahogany stairs leading to the second floor tis maggies brianna murmured caught by the sculpture that dominated the entranceway gray saw two figures intwined the cool glass just hinting of heat the form strikingly sexual oddly romantic its her surrender rogan bought it himself before they were married he wouldnt sell it to anyone i can see why he had to swallow the sinuous glass was an erotic slap to his already suffering system it makes a stunning beginning to a tour she has a special gift doesnt she gently with fingertips only brianna stroked the cool glass that her sister had created from fire and dreams special gifts make a person moody i suppose smiling a little she looked over her shoulder at gray he looked so restless she thought so impatient with everything especially himself and difficult because theyll always ask so much of themselves and make life hell for everyone around them when they dont get it he reached out touched her instead of the glass dont hold grudges do you whats the point in them with a shrug she turned a circle admiring the clean and simple lines of the foyer rogan wanted the gallery to be a home you see for art so theres a parlor a drawing room even a dining room and sitting rooms upstairs brianna took his hand and drew him toward open double doors all the paintings the sculptures even the furniture are by irish artists and craftsmen andoh she stopped dead and stared cleverly arranged over the back and side of a low divan was a soft throw in bold teal that faded into cool green she moved forward ran her hand over it i made this she murmured for maggies birthday they put it here they put it here in an art gallery why shouldnt they its beautiful curious he took a closer look did you weave this yes i dont have much time for weaving but she trailed off afraid she might weep imagine it in an art gallery with all these wonderful paintings and things brianna joseph gray watched the man stride across the room and envelope brianna in a hard and very warm embrace artistic type gray thought with a scowl turquoise stud in the ear ponytail streaming down the back italian suit the look clicked he remembered seeing the man at the wedding in dublin you get lovelier every time i see you you get more full of nonsense but she laughed i didnt know you were here i just came in for the day to help rogan with a few details and patricia shes in dublin still between the baby and the school she couldnt get away oh the baby and how is she beautiful looks like her mother joseph looked at gray then held out a hand youd be grayson thane im joseph donahue oh im sorry gray joseph manages rogans gallery in dublin i thought youd met at the wedding not technically but gray shook in a friendly manner he remembered joseph had a wife and daughter ill have to get it out of the way and tell you im a big fan its never in the way it happens i brought a book along with me thinking i could pass it along to brie to pass it to you i was hoping you wouldnt mind signing it for me gray decided he could probably learn to like joseph donohue after all id be glad to its kind of you i should tell maggie youre here she wants to tour you about herself its a lovely job youve done here joseph all of you and worth every hour of insanity he gave the room a quick satisfied glance ill fetch maggie wander around if you like he stopped at the doorway turned and grinned oh be sure to ask her about selling a piece to the president the president brianna repeated of ireland darling he offered for her unconquered this morning imagine it brianna whispered as joseph hurried off maggie being known to the president of ireland i can tell you shes becoming known everywhere yes i knew it but it seems she laughed unable to describe it how wonderful this is da would have been so proud and maggie oh she must be flying youd know how it feels wouldnt you the way it is when someone reads your books yeah i know it must be wonderful to be talented to have something to give that touches people brie gray lifted the end of the soft teal throw what do you call this oh anyone can do thatjust takes time what i mean is art something that lasts she crossed to a painting a bold colorful oil of busy dublin ive always wished its not that im envious of maggie though i was a little when she went off to study in venice and i stayed home but we both did what we needed to do and now shes doing something so important so are you why do you do that he demanded irritated with her why do you think of what you do and who you are as second place you can do more than anyone ive ever known she smiled turning toward him again you just like my cooking yes i like your cooking he didnt smile back and your weaving your knitting your flowers the way you make the air smell the way you tuck the corners of the sheets in when you make the bed how you hang the clothes on the line and iron my shirts you do all of those things more and make it all seem effortless well it doesnt take much to it does he cut her off his temper rolling again for no reason he could name dont you know how many people cant make a home or dont give a damn who havent a clue how to nurture theyd rather toss away what they have instead of caring for it time things children he stopped himself stunned by what had come out of him stunned it had been there to come out how long had that been hiding he wondered and what would it take to bury it again gray brianna lifted a hand to his cheek to soothe but he stepped back hed never considered himself vulnerable or not in too many years to count but at the moment he felt too off balance to be touched what i mean is what you do is important you shouldnt forget that i want to look around he turned abruptly to the side doorway of the parlor and hurried through well maggie stepped in from the hallway that was an interesting outburst he needs family brianna murmured brie hes a grown man not a babe age doesnt take away the need hes too alone maggie and doesnt even know it you cant take him in like a stray tilting her head maggie stepped closer or can you i have feelings for him i never thought id have these feelings for anyone again she looked down at her hands that shed clutched together in front of her deliberately loosened then no thats not true its not what i felt for rory rory be damned so you always say and because of it brianna smiled thats family she kissed maggies cheek tell me how does it feel having the president buy your work as long as his moneys good then maggie threw back her head and laughed its like going to the moon and back i cant help it we concannons just arent sophisticated enough to take such things in stride oh i wish da i know well maggie took a deep breath i should tell you that the detective rogan hired hasnt found amanda dougherty as yet hes following leads whatever that may mean so many weeks maggie the expense dont start nagging me about taking your housekeeping money i married a rich man and everyone knows you wanted only his wealth no i wanted his body she winked and hooked her arm through briannas and your friend grayson thane has one a woman wouldnt sneeze at ive noticed ive noticed myself good shows you havent forgotten how to look i had a card from lottie so did i do you mind if they stay the third week for myself mother could stay in that villa for the rest of her natural life she sighed at briannas expression all right all right its happy i am that shes enjoying herself though she wont admit to it shes grateful to you maggie its just not in her to say so i dont need her to say so anymore maggie laid a hand on her belly i have my own and it makes all the difference i never knew i could feel so strongly about anyone then there was rogan after that i thought i could never feel so strongly about anything or anyone else and now i do so maybe i understand a little how if you didnt love and didnt want the child growing in you it could blight your life as much as loving and wanting it can brighten it she didnt want me either what makes you say such a thing she told me it was a load lifted brianna discovered to say it aloud duty twas only duty not even to da but to the church its a cold way to be brought into the world it wasnt anger brianna needed now maggie knew and bit back on it instead she cupped briannas face its her loss brie not yours never yours and for myself if the duty hadnt been done id have been lost he loved us da loved us yes he did and thats been enough come dont worry on it ill take you upstairs and show you what weve been up to from the back of the hallway gray let out a long breath the acoustics in the building were much too good for secrets to be told he thought he understood now some of the sadness that haunted briannas eyes odd that they should have the lack of a mothers care in common not that the lack haunted him he assured himself hed gotten over that long ago hed left the scared lonely child behind in the cheerless rooms of the simon brent memorial home for children but who he wondered was rory and why had rogan hired detectives to look for a woman named amanda dougherty gray had always found the very best way to find the answers was to ask the questions whos rory the question snapped brianna out from her quiet daydream as gray drove easily down narrow winding roads away from ennistymon what not what who he nipped the car closer to the edge as a loaded vw rounded a curve on his side of the road probably an inexperienced yank he thought with a superior degree of smugness whos rory he repeated youve been listening to pub gossip have you rather than warn him off the coolness in her voice merely egged him on sure but thats not where i heard the name you mentioned him to maggie back at the gallery then you were eavesdropping on a private conversation thats redundant its not eavesdropping unless its a private conversation she straightened in her seat theres no need to correct my grammar thank you that wasnt grammar it was never mind he let it and her stew a moment so who was he and why would it be your business youre only making me more curious he was a boy i knew youre taking the wrong road there is no wrong road in ireland read the guidebooks is he the one who hurt you he flicked a glance in her direction nodded well that answers that what happened are you after putting it in one of your books maybe but its personal first did you love him i loved him i was going to marry him he caught himself scowling over that and tapping a finger against the steering wheel why didnt you because he jilted me two paces from the altar does that satisfy your curiosity no it only tells me that rory was obviously an idiot he couldnt stop the next question was surprised he wanted to do you still love him that would be remarkably idiotic of me as it was ten years ago but it still hurts being tossed aside hurts she said tersely being the object of pity in the community hurts poor brie poor dear brie thrown over two weeks before her wedding day left with a wedding dress and her sad little trousseau while her lad runs off to america rather than make her a wife is that enough for you she shifted to stare at him do you want to know if i cried i did did i wait for him to come back i did that as well you can punch me if it makes you feel better i doubt it would why did he leave she made a sound that came as much from annoyance as memory i dont know ive never known that was the worst of it he came to me and said he didnt want me wouldnt have me would never forgive me for what id done and when i tried to ask him what he meant he pushed me away knocked me down grays hands tightened on the wheel he what he knocked me down she said calmly and my pride wouldnt let me go after him so he left went to america bastard ive often thought so myself but i dont know why he left me so after a time i gave away my wedding dress murphys sister kate wore it the day she married her patrick he isnt worth the sadness you carry around in your eyes perhaps not but the dream was what are you doing pulling over lets walk out to the cliffs im not dressed for walking over rough ground she protested but he was already out of the car ive the wrong shoes gray i can wait here if you want a look i want to look with you he tugged her out of the car then swung her up in his arms what are you doing are you mad its not far and think of what nice pictures those nice tourists over there are going to take home of us can you speak french no baffled she angled back to look at his face why i was just thinking if we spoke french theyd think we werefrench you know then theyd tell cousin fred back in dallas the story about this romantic french couple theyd seen near the coast he kissed her lightly before setting her on her feet near the verge of a rocky slope the water was the color of her eyes today he noted that cool misty green that spoke of dreaming it was clear enough that he could see the sturdy humps of the aran islands and a little ferryboat that sailed between innismore and the mainland the smell was fresh the sky a moody blue that could and would change at any moment the tourists a few yards away were speaking in a rich texas twang that made him smile its beautiful here everything youve only to turn your head in this part of the world to see something else breathtaking deliberately he turned to brianna absolutely breathtaking now youre trying to flatter me to make up for prying into my business no im not and i havent finished prying and i like to pry so itd be hypocritical to apologize whos amanda dougherty and why is rogan looking for her shock flashed over her face had her mouth tremble open and closed youre the most rude of men i know all that already tell me something i dont know im going back but as she turned he simply took her arm ill carry you back in a minute youll break your ankle in those shoes especially if youre going to flounce i dont flounce as you so colorfully put it and this is none of your she trailed off blew out a huff of breath why would i waste my time telling you its none of your business i havent got a clue her gaze narrowed on his face bland was what it was she noted and stubborn as two mules youll just keep hammering at me until i tell you now youre catching on but he didnt smile instead he tucked away a tendril of hair that fluttered into her face his eyes were intense unwavering thats whats worrying you shes whats worrying you its nothing youd understand youd be surprised what i understand here sit he guided her to a rock urged her down then sat beside her tell me a story it comes easier that way perhaps it would and perhaps it would help this heaviness in her heart to say it all years ago there was a woman who had a voice like an angelor so they say and ambition to use it to make her mark she was discontent with her life as an innkeepers daughter and went roaming paying her way with a song one day she came back for her mother was ailing and she was a dutiful daughter if not a loving one she sang in the village pub for her pleasure and the patrons pleasure and a few pounds it was there she met a man brianna looked out to sea as she imagined her father catching sight of her mother hearing her voice something hot flashed between them it might have been love but not the lasting kind still they didnt or couldnt resist it and so before long she found herself with child the church her upbringing and her own beliefs left her no choice but to marry and give up the dream shed had she was never happy after that and had not enough compassion in her to make her husband happy soon after the first child was born she conceived another not out of that flash of something hot this time but out of a cold sense of duty and that duty satisfied she refused her husband her bed and her body it was her sigh that had gray reaching out covering her hand with his but he didnt speak not yet one day somewhere near the river shannon he met another there was love there a deep abiding love whatever their sin the love was greater but he had a wife you see and two small daughters and he and the woman who loved him knew there was no future for them so she left him went back to america she wrote him three letters lovely letters full of love and understanding and in the third she told him that she was carrying his child she was going away she said and he wasnt to worry for she was happy to have a part of him inside her growing a sea bird called drew her gaze up she watched it wing off toward the horizon before she continued her story she never wrote to him again and he never forgot her those memories may have comforted him through the chill of his dutiful marriage and all the years of emptiness i think they did for it was her name he said before he died he said amanda as he looked out to the sea and a lifetime after the letters were written one of his daughters found them tucked in the attic where hed kept them tied in a faded red ribbon she shifted to gray then theres nothing she can do you see to turn back the clock to make any of those lives better than they might have been but doesnt a woman who was loved so deserve to know she was never forgotten and hasnt the child of that woman and that man a right to know his own blood it may hurt you more to find them he looked down at their joined hands the past has a lot of nasty trapdoors its a tenuous tie brianna between you and amandas child stronger ones are broken every day my father loved her she said simply the child she bore is kin theres nothing else to do but look not for you he murmured as his eyes scanned her face there was strength there mixed with the sadness let me help you how i know a lot of people finding someones mostly research phone tag connections rogans hired a detective in new york thats a good start if he doesnt turn up something soon will you let me try he lifted a brow dont say its kind of me all right i wont though it is she brought their joined hands to her cheek i was angry with you for pushing me to tell you but it helped she tilted her face toward his you knew it would im innately nosy you are yes but you knew it would help it usually does he stood scooped her from the rock its time to go back im ready to work chapter eleven the chain the story had around his throat kept gray shackled to his desk for days curiosity turned the key in the lock now and again as guests came and went from the cottage hed had it to himself or nearly so for so many weeks he thought he might find the noise and chatter annoying instead it was cozy like the inn itself colorful like the flowers that were beginning to bloom in briannas garden bright as those first precious days of spring when he didnt leave his room he would always find a tray outside his door and when he did there was a meal and some new company in the parlor most stayed only a night which suited him gray had always preferred quick uncomplicated contacts but one afternoon he came down stomach rumbling and tracked brianna to the front garden are we empty she glanced up from under the brim of her garden hat for a day or two yes are you ready for a meal it can wait until youre finished what are you doing there planting i want pansies here their faces always look so arrogant and smug she sat back on her heels have you heard the cuckoo calling grayson a clock no she laughed and patted earth tenderly around roots i heard the cuckoo call when i walked with con early this morning so were in for fine weather and there were two magpies chattering which means prosperity will follow she bent back to her work so perhaps another guest will find his way here superstitious brianna you surprise me i dont see why ah theres the phone now a reservation ill get it as he was already on his feet he beat her to the parlor phone blackthorn cottage arlene yeah its me hows it going beautiful with a faint frown around her mouth brianna stood in the doorway and wiped her hands on the rag shed tucked in her waistband any place i hang my hat he said in response to her question of whether he was feeling at home in ireland when he saw brianna start to step back and fade from the room he held out a hand in invitation whats it like in new york he watched brianna hesitate step forward gray linked his fingers with hers and began to nuzzle her knuckles no i havent forgotten that was coming up i havent given it much thought if the spirit moves me sweetheart though brianna tugged on her hand and frowned he only grinned and kept his grip firm im glad to hear that whats the deal he paused listening and smiling into briannas eyes thats generous arlene but you know how i feel about longterm commitments i want it one at a time just like always as he listened he made little sounds of agreement hums of interest and nipped his way down to briannas wrist it didnt do his ego any harm to feel her pulse scrambling it sounds more than fine to me sure push the brits a bit further if you think you can no i havent seen the london times really well thats handy isnt it no im not being a smartass its great thanks iwhat a fax here he snickered leaned forward and gave brianna a quick friendly kiss on the mouth bless you arlene no just send it through the mail my ego can wait right back at you beautiful ill be in touch he said his goodbyes and hung up with briannas hand still clutched in his when she spoke the chill in her voice lowered the temperature of the room by ten degrees dont you think its rude to be flirting with one woman on the phone and kissing another his already pleased expression brightened jealous darling certainly not just a little he caught her other hand before she could evade and brought both to his lips now thats progress i almost hate to tell you that was my agent my very married agent who though dear to my heart and my bankbook is twenty years older than i and the proud grandmother of three oh she hated to feel foolish almost as much as she hated to feel jealous i suppose you want that meal now for once foods the last thing on my mind what was on it was very clear in his eyes as he tugged her closer you look really cute in that hat she turned her head just in time to avoid his mouth his lips merely skimmed over her cheek was it good news then her calling very good my publisher liked the sample chapters i sent them a couple weeks ago and made an offer thats nice he seemed hungry enough to her the way he was nibbling at her ear i suppose i thought you sold books before you wrote them like a contract i dont do multiples makes me feel caged in so much so that he had just turned down a spectacular offer for three projected novels we deal one at a time and with arlene in my corner we deal nicely a warmth was spreading in her stomach as he worked his way leisurely down her neck five million you told me i cant imagine so much not this time he cruised up her jaw arlene strongarmed them up to six point five stunned she jerked back million american dollars sounds like monopoly money doesnt it he chuckled shes not satisfied with the british offerand since my current book is steady at number one on the london times shes squeezing them a bit absently he nipped her by the waist pressed his lips to her brow her temple sticking point opens in new york next month opens mmm the movie arlene thought i might like to go to the premiere of your own movie you must theres no musts seems like old news flashbacks now his lips teased the corner of her mouth and her breath began to hitch flashback the book im working on its the only one that matters his eyes narrowed lost focus he has to find the book shit how could i have missed that its the whole thing he jerked back dragged a hand through his hair once he finds it he wont have any choice will he thats what makes it personal every nerve ending in her body was humming from the imprint of his lips what are you talking about what book deliahs diary thats what links past and present therell be no walking away after he reads it hell have to gray shook his head like a man coming out or moving into a trance ive got to get to work he was halfway up the stairs and briannas heart was still thudding dully grayson what he was already steeped in his own world she noted torn between amusement and irritation that impatient gleam was in his eyes eyes she doubted were even seeing her dont you want some food just leave a tray when you have a chance thanks and he was gone well brianna set her hands on her hips and managed to laugh at herself the man had all but seduced her into a puddle and didnt even know it off he went with deliah and her diary murder and mayhem leaving her system ticking like an overwound watch for the best she assured herself all that hand kissing and nibbling had weakened her and it was foolish wasnt it to go weak over a man who would be gone from her home and her country as carelessly as hed gone from her parlor but oh she thought as she walked to the kitchen it made her wonder what it would be like what it would be like to have all that energy all that attention all that skill focused only on her even for a short time even for only one night she would know then wouldnt she what it felt like to give pleasure to a man and to take it loneliness might be bitter after but the moment might be sweet might too many mights she warned herself and fixed gray a generous plate of cold lamb and cheese croquettes she carried it up taking it into his room without speaking he didnt acknowledge her nor did she expect it now not when he was hulked over his little machine his eyes slitted his fingers racing he did grunt when she poured the tea and set a cup at his elbow when she caught herself smiling checking an urge to run a hand down that lovely goldtipped hair she decided it was a very good time to walk over to murphys and ask him about fixing her car the exercise helped work out those last jittery frissons of need it was her time of year the spring when the birds called the flowers bloomed and the hills glowed so green your throat ached to look at them the light was gilded the air so clear that she could hear the puttputt of murphys tractor two fields over charmed by the day she swung the basket she carried and sang to herself as she climbed over a low stone wall she smiled at the spindly legged foal that nursed greedily while his mother cropped grass she spent a moment in admiration another few stroking both mother and baby before wandering on perhaps she would walk to maggies after seeing murphy she thought it was only a matter of weeks now before the baby was due someone needed to tend maggies garden do a bit of wash laughing she stopped crouching down when con raced over the field toward her been farming have you or just chasing rabbits no tisnt for you she said hooking the basket higher as the dog sniffed around it but ive a fine bone at home waiting hearing murphys hail she straightened waved her arm in greeting he shut off his tractor and hopped down as she walked over the newly turned earth a fine day for planting the finest he agreed and eyed the basket what have you there brie a bribe oh im made of stronger stuff than that sponge cake he closed his eyes and gave an exaggerated sigh im your man that you are but she held the basket tantalizingly out of reach tis my car again murphy now his look was pained brianna darling its time for the wake there past time couldnt you just take a peek he looked at her then at the basket the whole of the sponge cake every crumb done he took the basket set it up on the tractor seat but im warning you youll need a new one before summer if i do i do but ive my heart set on the greenhouse so the car has to last a wee bit longer did you have time to look at my drawings for the greenhouse murphy i did could be done taking advantage of the break he pulled out a cigarette lighted it i made a few adjustments youre a darling man murphy grinning she kissed his cheek so all the ladies tell me he tugged on a loose curl of hair and what would your yank think if he came across you charming me in my own field hes not my yank she shifted as murphy only lifted one black brow you like him dont you hard not to like him is he worrying you brianna maybe a little she sighed gave up there was nothing in her heart and mind she couldnt tell murphy a lot i care for him im not sure what to do about it but i care for him so much its different than even it was with rory at the mention of the name murphy scowled and stared down at the tip of his cigarette rorys not worth a single thought in your head i dont spend time thinking of him but now with gray it brings it back you see murphy hell leave you know as rory left she looked away she could say it brianna thought but she couldnt deal with the sympathy in murphys eyes when she did i try to understand that to accept it i tell myself itll be easier for at least ill know why not knowing my whole life with rory what was lacking in me theres nothing lacking in you murphy said shortly put it aside i have i didor nearly but i overwhelmed she turned away to stare out over the hills but what is it in me or not in me that sends a man away do i ask too much from him or not enough is there a coldness in me that freezes them out theres nothing cold about you stop blaming yourself for someone elses cruelty but ive only myself to ask ten years its been and this is the first time since ive felt any stirring it frightens me because i dont know how ill live through heartbreak again hes not rory i know and yet no hes not rory furious at seeing her so lost so unhappy murphy tossed his cigarette down and ground it out rory was a fool who couldnt see what he had and wanted to believe whatever lies he heard you should thank god hes gone what lies the heat stirred in murphys eyes then cooled whatever the days wasting brie ill come look at your car tomorrow what lies she put a hand on his arm there was a faint ringing in her ears a hard fist in her belly what do you know about it murphy that you havent told me what would i know rory and i were never mates no you werent she said slowly he never liked you he was jealous he was because we were close he couldnt see that it was like having a brother he couldnt see that she continued watching murphy carefully and once or twice we argued over it and he said how i was too free with kisses when it came to you something flickered over murphys face before he checked it well didnt i tell you he was a fool did you say something to him about it did he say something to you she waited then the chill that was growing in her heart spread and cloaked her youll tell me by god you will ive a right i wept my heart out over him i suffered from the pitying looks of everyone i knew i watched your sister marry in the dress id made with my own hands to be a bride for ten years theres been an emptiness in me brianna youll tell me rigid braced she faced him for i can see you have the answer if youre my friend youll tell me that tisnt fair is doubting myself all this time any fairer i dont want to hurt you brianna gently he touched a hand to her cheek id cut off my arm before ill hurt less knowing maybe maybe he couldnt know had never known maggie and i both thought maggie she broke in stunned maggie knows as well oh he was in it now he realized and there was no way out without sinking the lot of them her love for you is so fierce brianna shed do anything to protect you and ill tell you what ive told her time and again i dont need protecting tell me what you know ten years he thought was a long time for an honest man to hold a secret ten years he thought was longer still for an innocent woman to hold blame he came after me one day while i was out here working the fields he went for me out of the blue it seemed to me and not being fond of him i went for him as well cant say my heart was in it much until he said what he did he said youd been with me it embarrassed him still and beneath the embarrassment he discovered there remained that sharpedged rage that had never dulled with time he said that wed made a fool of him behind his back and hed not marry a whore i bloodied his face for that murphy said viciously his fist curling hard in memory im not sorry for it i might have broken his bones as well but he told me hed heard it from your mothers own lips that shed told him youd been sneaking off with me and might even be carrying my child she was dead pale now her heart crackling with ice my mother said this to him she saidshe couldnt in good conscience let him marry you in church when youd sinned with me she knew i hadnt brie whispered she knew we hadnt her reasons for believing it or saying it are her own maggie came by when i was cleaning myself up and i told her before i could think better of it at first i thought shed go deal with maeve with her fists and i had to hold her there until shed calmed a bit we talked and it was maggies thinking that maeve had done it to keep you at home oh yes brianna thought at home that had never been a home where id tend her and the house and da we didnt know what to do brianna i swear to you id have dragged you away from the altar meself if youd gone ahead and tried to marry that snakebellied bastard but he left the very next day and you were hurting so i didnt have the heart nor did maggie to tell you what hed said you didnt have the heart she pressed her lips together what you didnt have murphy you nor maggie was the right to keep it from me you didnt have the right any more than my mother did to say such things brianna she jerked back before he could touch her no dont i cant talk to you now i cant talk to you she turned and raced away she didnt weep the tears were frozen in her throat and she refused to let them melt she ran across the fields seeing nothing now nothing but the haze of what had been or what had nearly been all innocence had been shattered now all illusions crushed to dust her life was lies conceived on them bred on them nurtured with them by the time she reached the house her breath was sobbing in her lungs she stopped herself fisting her hands hard until her nails dug into flesh the birds still sang and the tender young flowers shed planted herself continued to dance in the breeze but they no longer touched her she saw herself as shed been shocked and appalled as shed felt rorys hand strike her to the ground all these years later she could visualize it perfectly the bafflement shed felt as shed stared up at him the rage and disgust in his face before hed turned and left her there shed been marked as a whore had she by her own mother by the man she had loved what a fine joke it was when she had never felt the weight of a man very quietly she opened the door closed it behind her so her fate had been decided for her on that longago morning well now this very day she would take her fate into her own hands deliberately she walked up the stairs opened grays door closed it tight at her back grayson huh do you want me sure later his head came up his glazed eyes only half focused what what did you say do you want me she repeated her spine was as stiff as the question youve said you did and acted as you did i he made a manful attempt to pull himself out of imagination into reality she was pale as ice he noted and her eyes glittered with cold and he noted hurt brianna whats going on a simple question id thank you for an answer to it of course i want you whats thewhat in hell are you doing he was out of the chair like a shot gaping as she began to briskly unbutton her blouse cut it out goddamn it stop that now you said you want me im obliging you i said stop in three strides he was to her yanking her blouse together whats gotten into you whats happened thats neither here nor there she could feel herself beginning to shake and fought it back youve been trying to persuade me into bed now im ready to go if you cant spare the time now just say so her eyes flared im used to being put off its not a matter of time well then she broke away to turn down the bed would you prefer the curtains open or closed ive no preference leave the stupid curtains the neat way she folded down the covers did what it always did it made his stomach tighten into a slippery fist of lust were not going to do this you dont want me then when she straightened her open blouse shifted giving him a tantalizing peek of pale skin and tidy white cotton youre killing me he murmured fine ill leave you to die in peace head high she marched for the door he merely slammed a hand on it to keep it shut youre not going anywhere until you tell me whats going on nothing it seems at least with you she pressed herself back against the door forgetting now to breathe slowly evenly to keep the wrenching pain out of her voice surely theres a man somewhere who might spare a moment or two to give me a tumble he bared his teeth youre pissing me off oh well thats a pity i do beg your pardon its sorry i am to have bothered you its only that i thought youd meant what youd said thats my problem you see she murmured as tears glistened in her eyes always believing he would have to handle the tears he realized and whatever emotional tailspin she was caught in without touching her what happened i found out her eyes werent cold now but devastated and desperate i found out that theres never been a man whos loved me not really loved me ever and that my own mother lied lied hatefully to take away even that small chance of happiness she told him id slept with murphy she told him that and that i might be carrying a child how could he marry me believing that how could be believe it loving me hold on a minute he paused waiting for her quick blur of words to register youre saying that your mother told the guy you were going to marry this rory that youd been having sex with murphy might be pregnant she told him that so that i couldnt escape this house leaning her head back she closed her eyes this house as it was then and he believed her he believed i could have done that believed it so that he never asked me if it was true only told me he wouldnt have me and left and all this time maggie and murphy have known it and kept it from me tread carefully gray warned himself emotional quicksand look im on the outside here and id say being a professional observer that your sister and murphy kept their mouths shut to keep you from hurting more than you already were it was my life wasnt it do you know what its like not to know why youre not wanted to go through life only knowing you werent but never why yeah he knew exactly but he didnt think it was the answer she wanted he didnt deserve you that should give you some satisfaction it doesnt not now i thought you would show me he stepped cautiously back as the breath clogged in his lungs a beautiful woman one who had from the first instant stirred his blood innocent offering youre upset he managed in a tight voice not thinking clearly and as much as it pains me there are rules i dont want excuses you want a substitute the quick violence of the statement surprised both of them he hadnt realized that little germ had been in his head but he lashed out as it grew im not a goddamn standin for some whiny wimphearted jerk who tossed you over a decade ago yesterday sucks well welcome to reality when i take a woman to bed shes going to be thinking about me just me what little color that had seeped back into her cheeks drained im sorry i didnt mean it that way didnt mean it to seem that way thats exactly how it seems because thats exactly what it is pull yourself together he ordered deadly afraid she would start to cry again when you figure out what you want let me know i only i needed to feel as if something you wanted me i thoughti hoped id have something to remember just once to know what it was like to be touched by a man i cared for the color came back humiliation riding her cheeks as gray stared at her doesnt matter im sorry im very sorry she yanked open the door and fled she was sorry gray thought staring into the space where shed been he could all but see the air vibrate in her wake good going pal he thought in disgust as he began to pace the room nice job it always makes someone feel better when you kick them while theyre down but damn it damn it shed made him feel exactly as hed told her a convenient substitute for some lost love he felt miserable for her facing that kind of betrayal that kind of rejection there was nothing he understood better but hed patched himself up hadnt he so could she shed wanted to be touched shed just needed to be soothed head pounding he stalked to the window and back shed wanted hima little sympathy a little understanding a little sex and hed brushed her off just like the everpopular rory what was he supposed to do how could he have taken her to bed when all that hurt and fear and confusion had been shimmering around her he didnt need other peoples complications he didnt want them he wanted her on an oath he rested his head against the window glass he could walk away hed never had any trouble walking away just sit down again pick up the threads of his story and dive into it or or he could try something that might clear the frustration out of the air for both of them the second impulse was more appealing a great deal more appealing if a great deal more dangerous the safe route was for cowards he told himself snatching up his keys he walked downstairs and out of the house chapter twelve if there was one thing gray knew how to do with style it was set scenes two hours after hed left blackthorn cottage he was back in his room and putting the final touch on the details he didnt think past the first step sometimes it was wisersafer certainlynot to dwell on how the scene might unfold or the chapter close after a last glance around he nodded to himself then went downstairs to find her brianna she didnt turn from the sink where she was meticulously frosting a chocolate cake she was calmer now but no less ashamed of her behavior she had shuddered more than once over the past two hours over the way shed thrown herself at him thrown herself she remembered again and not been caught yes dinners ready she said calmly would you want it down here i need you to come upstairs all right then her relief that he didnt ask for a cozy meal in the kitchen was tremendous ill just fix a tray for you no he laid a hand on her shoulder uneasy when he felt her muscles stiffen i need you to come upstairs well she would have to face him sooner or later carefully wiping her hands on her apron she turned she read nothing in his face of condemnation or the anger hed speared at her earlier it didnt help is there a problem come up then you tell me all right she followed behind him should she apologize again she wasnt sure it might be best just to pretend nothing had been said she gave a little sigh as they approached his room oh she hoped it wasnt the plumbing the expense just now would she forgot about plumbing as she stepped inside she forgot about everything there were candles set everywhere the soft light streaming like melted gold against the twilight gray of the room flowers spilled out of a half dozen vases tulips and roses freesia and lilacs in a silver bucket rested an iced bottle of champagne still corked music came from somewhere harp music she stared baffled at the portable stereo on his desk i like the curtains open he said she folded her hands under her apron where only she would know they trembled why because you never know when you might catch a moonbeam her lips curved ever so slightly at the thought no i mean why have you done all this to make you smile to give you time to decide if its what you really want to help persuade you that it is youve gone to such trouble her eyes skimmed toward the bed then quickly nervously onto the vase of roses you didnt have to ive made you feel obliged please dont be an idiot its your choice but he moved to her took the first pin from her hair tossed it aside do you want me to show you how much i want you i i think i should show you at least a little he took out another pin a third then simply combed his hands through her tumbling hair then you can decide how much youll give his mouth skimmed over hers gentle as air erotic as sin when her lips trembled apart he slipped his tongue between them teasing hers that should give you the idea he moved his lips along her jaw up to her temple then back to nip at the corner of her mouth tell me you want me brianna i want to hear you say it i do she couldnt hear her own voice only the hum of it in her throat where his mouth now nestled i do want you gray i cant think i need just me you only need me tonight i only need you coaxing he smoothed his hands down her back lie down with me brianna he lifted her cradled her there are so many places i want to take you he laid her down on the bed where the sheets and quilt had been folded down in invitation her hair spilled like fired gold over the crisp linen subtle waves of it catching glints from the candlelight her eyes were stormy with the war of doubts and needs and his stomach trembled looking at her from desire yes but also from fear he would be her first no matter what happened after through her life she would remember tonight and him i dont know what to do she closed her eyes excited embarrassed enchanted i do he laid beside her dipped his mouth to hers once more she was trembling beneath him a fact that had a hot ball of panic tightening in his gut if he moved too fast if he moved too slow to soothe them both he pried her nervous fingers apart kissed them one by one dont be afraid brianna dont be afraid of me i wont hurt you but she was afraid and not only of the pain she knew went hand in hand with the loss of innocence she was afraid of not being capable of giving pleasure and of not being able to feel the full truth of it think of me he murmured deepening the kiss degree by shuddering degree if he did nothing else he swore he would exorcise the last ghost of her heartache think of me and when he repeated it he knew from somewhere hidden inside that he needed this moment as much as she sweet she thought hazily how odd that a mans mouth could taste so sweet and could be firm and soft all at once fascinated by the taste and texture she traced his lips with the tip of her tongue and heard his quiet purr in answer one by one her muscles uncoiled as his flavor seeped into her and how lovely it was to be kissed as if you would be kissed until time stopped how solid and good his weight was how strong his back when she dared let her hands roam he stiffened bit back a moan as her hesitant fingers skimmed over his hips he was already hard and shifted slightly worried that he might frighten her slowly he ordered himself delicately he slipped the top strap of her apron over her head untied the one around her waist and drew it off her eyes fluttered open her lips curved will you kiss me again her voice was honey thick now and warm it makes everything go gold behind my eyes when you do he rested his brow on hers waited a moment until he thought he could give her the gentleness shed asked for then he took her mouth swallowed her lovely soft sigh she seemed to melt beneath him the tremblings giving way to pliancy she felt nothing but his mouth that wonderful mouth that feasted so sumptuously on hers then his hand cupped her throat as if testing the speed of the pulse that fluttered there before he trailed down she hadnt been aware that hed unfastened her blouse as his fingers traced the soft swell of her breast above her bra her eyes flew open his were steady on hers with a concentration so focused it brought the trembles back she started to protest to make some sound of denial but his touch was so alluring just a skim of fingertips against flesh it wasnt fearful she realized it was soothing and just as sweet as the kiss even as she willed herself to relax again those clever fingers slipped under the cotton and found the sensitive point her first gasp ripped through himthe sound of it the arousing sensation of her body arching in surprise and pleasure he was barely touching her he thought as his blood pounded she had no idea how much more there was god he was desperate to show her relax he kissed her kissed her as his fingers continued to arouse and his free hand circled back to unhook the barrier just feel it she had no choice sensations were tearing through her tiny arrows of pleasure and shock his mouth swallowed her strangled breaths as he tugged away her clothes and left her bare to the waist god youre so beautiful his first look at that milkpale skin the small breasts that fit so perfectly into the cups of his palms nearly undid him unable to resist he lowered his head and tasted she moaned long deep throaty the movements of her body under his were pure instinct he knew and not designed to deliberately claw at his control so he pleased her gently and found his own pleasure growing from hers his mouth was so hot the air was so thick each time he tugged pulled laved there was an answering flutter in the pit of her stomach a flutter that built and built into something too close to pain too close to pleasure to separate them he was murmuring to her lovely soft words that circled like rainbows in her head it didnt matter what he said she would have told him if she could nothing mattered as long as he never never stopped touching her he tugged his own shirt over his head craving the feel of flesh against flesh when he lowered himself to her again she made a small sound and wrapped her arms around him she only sighed again when his mouth roamed lower over torso over ribs her skin heated muscles jerking quivering under his lips and hands and he knew she was lost in that dark tunnel of sensations carefully he unhooked her slacks baring new flesh slowly exploring it gently as her hips arched once in innocent agreement he clamped his teeth and fought back the tearing need to take just take and satisfy the grinding in his taut body her nails dug into his back drawing out a groan of dark delight from him as his hand skimmed down her bared hip he knew shed stiffened again and begged whatever god was listening for strength not until youre ready he murmured and brought his lips patiently back to hers again i promise but i want to see you all of you he shifted knelt back there was fear in her eyes again though her body was quivering with suppressed needs he couldnt steady his hands or his voice but he kept them gentle i want to touch all of you his eyes stayed on hers as he unsnapped his jeans all of you when he stripped her gaze was drawn inexorably down and her fear doubled she knew what was to happen she was after all a farmers daughter however poor a farmer hed been there would be pain and blood and gray your skins so soft watching her he skimmed a finger up her thigh ive wondered what youd look like but youre so much lovelier than i imagined unsettled shed crossed an arm over her breast he left it there and went back to where hed begun with soft slow drugging kisses and next caresses patient skilled hands that knew where a woman longed to be touched even when the woman didnt helplessly she yielded beneath him again her breathing quickening into catchy pants as his hand roamed over the flat of her stomach toward the terrible glorious heat yes he thought fighting delirium open for me let me just let me she was damp and hot where he cupped her the groan tore from his throat when she writhed and tried to resist let go brianna let me take you there just let go she was clinging to the edge of some towering cliff by no more than her fingertips terror welled inside her she was slipping no control there was too much happening inside her body all at once for her burning flesh to hold it all in his hand was like a torch against her firing her seering her mercilessly until she would have no choice but to tumble free into the unknown please the word sobbed out oh sweet god please then the pleasure the molten flood of it washed through her over her stealing her breath her mind her vision for one glorious moment she was blind and deaf to everything but herself and the velvet shocks convulsing her she poured into his hand making him moan like a dying man he shuddered even as she did then with his face buried against her skin took her soaring again straining against the chain of his own control he waited until she was at peak hold me hold on to me he murmured dizzy with his own needs as he struggled to ease gently into her she was so small so tight so deliciously hot he used every ounce of willpower he had left not to thrust greedily inside as he felt her close around him only for a second he promised her only for a second then itll be good again but he was wrong it never stopped being good she felt him break the barrier of her innocence fill her with himself and felt nothing but joy i love you she arched up to meet him to welcome him he heard the words dimly shook his head to deny them but she was wrapped around him drawing him into a well of generosity and he was helpless to do anything but drown coming back to time and place was for brianna like sliding weightlessly through a thin white cloud she sighed let the gentle gravity take her until she was once more in the big old bed candlelight flickering red and gold on her closed lids and the truly incredible pleasure of grays weight pinning her to the mattress she thought hazily that no books she had read no chatter she had heard from other women no secret daydreaming could have taught her how simply good it was to have a mans naked body pressed onto hers the body itself was an amazing creation more beautiful than shed imagined the long muscled arms were strong enough to lift her gentle enough to hold her as if she were a hollowedout egg easily broken the hands wide of palm long of finger knew so cleverly just where to touch and stroke then there were the broad shoulders the long lovely lean back narrow hips leading down to hard thighs firm calves hard she smiled to herself wasnt it a miracle that something so hard so tough and strong should be covered with smooth soft skin oh indeed she thought a mans body was a glorious thing gray knew if she kept touching him hed go quietly mad if she stopped he was certain hed whimper those pretty teaserving hands of hers were gliding over him whispering touches exploring tracing testing as if she were memorizing each muscle and curve he was still inside her couldnt bear to separate himself he knew he should should ease away and give her time to recover however much hed fought not to hurt her there was bound to be some discomfort and yet he was so contentshe seemed so content all those nerves that had sizzled through him at the thought of taking her the first timeher first timehad melted away into lazy bliss when those skimming caresses caused him to stir again he forced himself to move propping up on his elbows to look down at her she was smiling he couldnt have said why he found that so endearing so perfectly charming her lips curved her eyes warmly green her skin softly flushed now with that first rush of needs and nerves calmed he could enjoy the moment the lights the shadows the rippling pleasure of fresh arousal he pressed his lips to her brow her temples her cheeks her mouth beautiful brianna it was beautiful for me her voice was thick still raspy with passion you made it beautiful for me how do you feel now he would ask she thought both in kindness and in curiosity weak she said and with a quick laugh invincible why do you suppose such a natural thing as this should make such a difference in a life his brows drew together smoothed out again responsibility he thought it was his responsibility he had to remind himself she was a grown woman and the choice had been hers are you comfortable with that difference she smiled up at him beautifully touched a hand to his cheek ive waited so long for you gray the quick inner defense signal flashed on even steeped in her warm damn half aroused it flashed step carefully cautioned a cool controlled part of his mind warning intimacy ahead she saw the change in his eyes a subtle but distinct distancing even as he took the hand against his cheek and shifted it so that his lips pressed to her palm im crushing you she wanted to sayno staybut he was already moving away we havent had any champagne easy with his nakedness he rolled out of bed why dont you go have a bath while i open the bottle she felt odd suddenly and awkward where shed felt nothing but natural with him atop and inside her now she fumbled with the sheets the linen she began and found herself flushing and tonguetied it would be soiled she knew with her innocence ill take care of it seeing her color deepen and understanding he moved to the bed again and cupped her chin in his hand i can change sheets brie and even if i didnt know how before id have picked it up watching you his mouth brushed hers his voice thickening do you know how often ive been driven insane watching you smooth and tuck my sheets no there was a quick lick of pleasure and desire really he only laughed and laid his brow on hers what wonderful good deed did i do to deserve this to earn you he drew back but his eyes had kindled again making her heart drum slow and hard against her ribs go have your bath im wanting to make love with you again he said slipping into a brogue that made her lips quirk if youd like it i would yes she drew a deep breath bracing herself to climb naked from the bed very much i would i wont be long when she went into the bath he took a deep breath himself to steady his system he told himself hed never had anyone like her it wasnt just that hed never tasted innocence beforethat would have been enormous enough but she was unique to him her responses that hesitation and eagerness playing at odds with each other with her absolute trust shining over all i love you shed said it wouldnt do to dwell on that women tended to romanticize emotionalize sex in most cases certainly a woman experiencing sex for the first time would be bound to mix lust with love women used words and required them he knew that that was why he was very careful when choosing his but something had spurted through him when shed whispered that overrated and overused phrase warmth and need and for an instant just a heartbeat a desperate desire to believe it and to echo her words he knew better and though he would do anything and everything in his power to keep her from hurt anything and everything to make her happy while they were together there were limits to what he could and would give to her to anyone enjoy the moment he reminded himself thats all there was he hoped he could teach her to enjoy it as well she felt odd as she wrapped the towel around her freshly scrubbed body different it was something that could never be explained to a man she supposed they lost nothing when they gave themselves the first time there was no sharp tearing of self to admit another but it wasnt pain she remembered even the soreness between her thighs didnt bring the violence of invasion to mind it was the unity she thought of the sweet and simple bond of mating she studied herself in the misty mirror she looked warm she decided it was the same face surely that shed glimpsed countless times in countless mirrors yet wasnt there a softness here shed never noticed before in the eyes around the mouth love had done that the love she held in her heart the love shed tasted for the first time with her body perhaps it was only the first time that a woman felt so aware of herself so stripped of everything but flesh and soul and perhaps she thought because she was older than most the moment was all the more overwhelming and precious he wanted her brianna closed her eyes the better to feel those long slow ripples of delight a beautiful man with a beautiful mind and kind heart wanted her all of her life shed dreamed of finding him now she had she stepped into the bedroom and saw him hed put fresh linen on the bed and had laid one of her white flannel gowns at the foot of it he stood now in jeans unsnapped and relaxed on his hips with champagne bubbling in glasses and candlelight simmering in his eyes im hoping youll wear it he said when she saw her gaze rest on the prim oldfashioned nightgown ive imagined getting you out of it since that first night i watched you come down the stairs a candle in one hand a wolfhound in the other and my head went spinning she picked up a sleeve how much she wished it was silk or lace or something that would make a mans blood heat tisnt very alluring i think you think wrong because she had nothing else and it seemed to please him she slipped the gown over her head letting the towel fall away as the flannel slid down his muffled groan had her smiling over uncertainly brianna what a picture you are leave the towel he murmured as she bent to retrieve it come here please she stepped forward that half smile on her face and nerves threatening to swallow her to take the glass he held out she sipped discovered the frothy wine did nothing to ease her dry throat he was looking at her she thought the way she imagined a tiger might look at a lamb just before he pounced you havent had dinner she said no dont frighten her idiot he warned himself and struggled back the urge to devour he took a slow sample of champagne watching her wanting her i was just thinking i wanted it thinking we could eat up here together but now he reached out to curl a damp tendril of her hair around his finger can you wait so it was to be simple again she thought and again her choice i can wait for dinner she could barely get the words passed the heat in her throat but not for you she stepped quite naturally into his arms chapter thirteen an elbow in the ribs brought brianna groggily out of sleep her first view of the morning after a night of love was floor if gray took up another inch of the bed shed be on it it took her only seconds and a shiver in the chilly morning air to realize she hadnt even the stingiest corner of sheet or blanket covering her gray on the other hand was cozily wrapped beside her like a contented moth in a cocoon sprawled over the mattress he slept like the dead she wished she could have said his snuggled position and the elbow lodged near her kidney was loverlike but it smacked plainly of greed her tentative pushes and tugs didnt budge him so that was the way of it she thought the man was obviously unaccustomed to sharing she might have stayed to tussle for her sharejust on principlebut the sun was shining through the windows and there were chores to do her efforts to slip quietly from the bed so as not to disturb him proved unnecessary the minute her feet were on the floor he grunted then shifted to lay claim to her small slice of mattress still the dregs of romance remained in the room the candles had guttered out in their own wax sometime during the night the champagne bottle was empty in its silver bucket and flowers scented the air the open curtain caught sunbeams rather than moonbeams hed made it perfect for her she remembered had known how to make it perfect this morning business wasnt quite the way shed imagined it in sleep he didnt look like an innocent boy dreaming but like a man well satisfied with himself there hadnt been any gentle caresses or murmured good mornings to acknowledge their first day together as lovers just a grunt and a shove to send her on her way the many moods of grayson thane she mused perhaps she could write a book on that subject herself amused she tugged her discarded nightgown over her head and headed downstairs she could do with some tea she decided to get the blood moving again and since the sky looked promising shed do a bit of wash and hang it out to catch the morning air she thought the house could do with an airing as well and tossed open windows as she walked through the one in the parlor she spotted murphy bent under the hood of her car she watched him a moment her emotions tangling her anger with him warred with loyalty and affection anger was already losing as she walked outside and moved along the garden path didnt expect to see you she began i said id have a look he glanced back she was standing in her nightgown her hair tangled from the night her feet bare unlike gray his blood didnt kindle she was simply brianna to him and he took the moment to search out any sign of temper or forgiveness he saw neither so went back to his business your starter motors in a bad way he muttered so ive been told your engines sick as an old horse i can get some parts patch it back together but its good money after bad as i see it if it could last me through the summer into the autumn she trailed off as he cursed under his breath she simply couldnt keep her heart cool from him hed been her friend as long as she remembered and it was friendship she knew that had caused him to do what hed done murphy im sorry he straightened then and turned to her with everything he felt naked in his eyes so am i i never meant to cause you hurt brie gods witness i know that she took the step crossing to him and slipping her arms around him i shouldnt have been so hard murphy not on you never on you you scared me ill admit it his arms went tight around her i spent the night worrying over itafraid you wouldnt forgive me and not bake me scones anymore she laughed as hed hoped shaking her head she kissed him under the ear i was so angry at the thought of it all more than at you i know you acted out of caring and maggie too secure with her head on his shoulder brianna closed her eyes but my mother murphy what did she act out of i cant say brie you wouldnt say she murmured and eased back to study his face such a handsome one she thought with all that goodness inside it wasnt right for her to ask him to condemn or defend her mother and she wanted to see him smile again tell me did rory hurt you very much murphy made a sound of derision purely male brianna thought soft hands is what he had and not a bit of style wouldnt have laid the first one on me if id been expecting it she tucked her tongue in her cheek no im sure of it and did you bloody his nose for me murphy darling that and more his nose was broke when id finished with him and hed lost a tooth or two thats a hero for you she kissed his lightly on both cheeks im sorry she used you that way he shrugged that off im glad i was the one who plowed a fist in his face and thats the truth never liked the bastard no brianna said softly you nor maggie either it seems you both saw something i didnt or i was seeing something that was never there dont worry at it now brie it was years ago he started to pat her and remembered the grease on his hands get back now youll make yourself filthy what are you doing out here in your bare feet making up with you she smiled then looked toward the road at the sound of a car when she spotted maggie brianna folded her hands lifted a brow warned her did you she muttered to murphy well i thought it best and he thought it best now to step neatly back out of the line of fire so maggie walked around the nodding columbine her eyes on briannas face i thought you might want to talk to me i do yes did you think i had no right to know maggie it wasnt rights i was worried about twas you i loved him the long breath she took was part relief that the emotion was fully past tense i loved him longer than i would had i known the whole of it maybe thats true and im sorry for it i couldnt bear to tell you to all three of their discomfort maggies eyes filled i just couldnt you were so hurt already so sad and lost pressing her lips together she struggled with the tears i didnt know what was best it was both of our decision murphy ranged himself with maggie there was no bringing him back for you brie do you think i would have wanted him back a shimmer of heat and more of pride seeped through as she tossed back her hair do you think so little of me he believed what she told him no id not have had him back she let out a quick huff of breath drew in another more slowly and im thinking had it been me in your position margaret mary i might have done the same id have loved you enough to have done the same she rubbed her hands together then held one out come inside im going to make some tea have you had breakfast murphy nothing to speak of ill call you when its ready then with maggies hand in hers she turned and saw gray standing in the doorway there was no way to stop the color that flooded her cheeks a combination of pleasure and embarrassment that sent her pulse scrambling but her voice was steady enough her nod of greeting easy good morning to you grayson i was about to start breakfast so she wanted to play it cool and casual gray noted and returned the nod looks like ill have company eating it morning maggie maggie sized him up as she walked with brianna to the house and to you gray you look rested the irish air agrees with me he moved aside to let them through the door ill see what murphys up to he strolled down the walk and stopped by the open hood of the car so whats the verdict murphy leaned on the car and watched him you could say its still out understanding that neither of them were discussing engines gray tucked his thumbs in his front pockets and rocked back on his heels still looking out for her cant blame you for that but im not rory never thought you were murphy scratched his chin considered shes a sturdy piece of work our brie you know but even sturdy women can be damaged if handled carelessly i dont intend to be careless he lifted a brow thinking of beating me up murphy not yet and he smiled i like you grayson i hope i wont be called upon to break any of your bones that goes for both of us satisfied gray glanced toward the engine are we going to give this thing a decent burial murphys sigh was long and heartfelt if only we could in harmony they ducked under the hood together in the kitchen maggie waited until coffee was scenting the air and con was chomping happily at his breakfast brianna had dressed hastily and with her apron in place was busy slicing bacon ive gotten a late start brianna began so theres no time for fresh muffins or buns but ive plenty of bread maggie sat at the table knowing her sister preferred that she stay out of the way are you all right brianna why wouldnt i be will you be wanting sausage too doesnt matter brie maggie dragged a hand through her hair he was your first wasnt he when brianna set her slicing knife aside and said nothing maggie pushed away from the table did you think i wouldnt know just seeing you together the way he looks at you she rubbed her hands absently over her weighted belly as she paced the way you look have i a sign around my neck that says fallen woman brianna said coolly damn it you know thats not my meaning exasperated maggie stopped to face her anyone with wit could see what was between you and their mother had wit maggie thought grimly maeve would be back in a matter of days im not trying to interfere or to give advice if advice isnt welcome i just want to know i need to know that youre all right brianna smiled then and let her stiff shoulders relax im fine maggie he was very good to me very kind and gentle hes a kind and gentle man maggie touched a hand to briannas cheek brushed at her hair youre in love with him yes and he hes used to being on his own to coming and going as he pleases without ties maggie tilted her head and youre after changing that with a little hum in her throat brianna turned back to her cooking you dont think i can i think hes a fool if he doesnt love you but changing a mans like walking through molasses a lot of effort for little progress well its not so much changing him as letting him see what choices there are i can make a home for him maggie if hell let me then she shook her head oh its too soon to be thinking so far hes made me happy thats enough for now maggie hoped that was true what will you do about mother as far as grays concerned i wont let her spoil it briannas eyes frosted as she turned to add cubed potatoes to the pan as to the other i havent decided but i will handle it myself maggie you understand me i do giving in to eight months of pregnancy she sat again we heard from the new york detective yesterday you did did he find her its a more complicated business than we might have thought he found a brothera retired policeman who still lives in new york well thats a start then isnt it eager for more brianna began to whip up batter for griddle cakes more of a stop im afraid the man refused to admit he even had a sister at first when the detective pressed he had copies of amandas birth certificate and suchthis dennis dougherty said he hadnt seen nor heard from amanda in more than twentyfive years that she was no sister to him and so forth as shed gotten herself in trouble and run off he didnt know where or care to know thats sad for him isnt it brianna murmured and her parents amandas parents dead both of them the mother only last year theres a sister as well married and living out in the west of the states hes talked to her as well rogans man and though she seems softer of heart she hasnt been any real help but she must know brianna protested surely shed know how to find her own sister that doesnt seem to be true it appears there was a family ruckus when amanda announced she was pregnant and she wouldnt name the father maggie paused pressed her lips together i dont know if she was protecting da or herself or the child if it comes to it but according to the sister there were bitter words on all sides they were lacecurtain irish and saw a pregnant unwed daughter as a smear on the family name they wanted her to go away have the child and give it up it seems she refused and simply went away altogether if she contacted her parents again the brother isnt saying and the sister isnt aware of it so we have nothing next to it he did find outthe detectivethat shed visited ireland all those years ago with a woman friend hes working now on tracking her down then well be patient she brought a pot of tea to the table and frowned at her sister you look pale im just tired sleepings not as easy as it once was when do you see the doctor again this very afternoon maggie drummed up a smile as she poured herself a cup then ill take you you shouldnt be driving maggie sighed you sound like rogan hes coming all the way back from the gallery to take me himself good and youre staying right here with me until he comes to get you more concerned than pleased when she got no argument brianna went to call the men to breakfast she spent the day happily enough fussing over maggie welcoming an american couple who had stayed at her inn two years earlier gray had gone off with murphy to look for car parts the sky stayed clear the air warm once she had seen maggie safely off with rogan brianna settled down for an hour of gardening in her herb bed freshly washed linens were billowing on the line music was trilling out through the open windows her guests were enjoying tea cakes in her parlor and her dog was snoozing in a patch of sunlight beside her she couldnt have been happier the dogs ears pricked and her own head came up when she heard the sound of cars thats murphys truck she said to con and indeed the dog was already up tail wagging the other i dont recognize do you think we have another guest pleased with the prospect brianna rose dusted the garden dirt from her apron and started around the house con raced ahead of her already barking happily in greeting she spotted gray and murphy both of them wearing silly grins as the dog welcomed them as if it had been days rather than hours since theyd parted her gaze skimmed over the neat latemodel blue sedan parked in front of murphys truck i thought i heard two cars she looked around anxiously did they go inside already who gray wanted to know the people who were driving this is there luggage i should brew some tea fresh i was driving it gray told her and i wouldnt mind some tea youre a brave one boyo murphy said under his breath i dont have time for tea meself he went on preparing to desert my cowsll be looking for me by now he rolled his eyes at gray shook his head and climbed back into his truck now what was that brianna wondered as murphys truck backed into the road what have the pair of you been up to and why would you be driving this car when youve already got one someone had to drive it and murphy doesnt like anyone else behind the wheel of his truck what do you think of it in the way of men gray ran a hand along the front fender of the car as lovingly as he would over a smooth creamy shoulder its very nice im sure runs like a top want to see the engine i dont think so she frowned at him are you tired of your other one my other what car she laughed and shook back her hair what are you about grayson why dont you sit in it get the feel of it encouraged by her laugh he took her arm and tugged her toward the drivers side it only has about twenty thousand miles on it murphy had warned him that bringing back a new car would be as foolish as spitting into the wind willing to humor him brianna climbed in and set her hands on the wheel very nice it feels just like a car but do you like it he propped his elbows on the base of the window and grinned at her its a fine car gray and im sure youll enjoy the driving of it its yours mine what do you mean its mine that old crate of yours is going to junkyard heaven murphy and i agreed it was hopeless so i bought you this he yelped when she jerked open the door and caught him smartly on the shin well you can just take it back where it came from her voice was ominously cool as he rubbed his throbbing shin im not ready to buy a new car and when i am ill decide for myself youre not buying it im buying it i bought it he straightened and faced the ice with what he was certain was sheer reason you needed reliable transportation and ive provided it now stop being so stiffnecked stiffnecked is it well tis you whos being arrogant grayson thane going out and buying a car without a byyourleave i wont have such decisions taken out of my hands and i dont need to be tended to like a child she wanted to shout he could see she was fighting the urge with every breath covering raging temper with an icy dignity that made him want to smile being a wise man he kept his expression sober its a gift brianna a box of chocolates is a gift a box of chocolates is a cliche he corrected then backtracked lets just say this is my version of a box of chocolates he shifted cleverly trapping her between his body and the side of the car do you want me worried about you every time you drive off to the village theres no need for you to worry of course there is before she could evade he slipped his arms around her i visualize you tottering back up the road with nothing more than a steering wheel in your hand its your imagination thats to blame for that she turned her head but his lips managed to brush her neck stop it you wont get around me that way oh but he thought he would do you really have a hundred pounds to toss away on a lost cause my practical brianna and do you really want to ask poor murphy to tinker with that useless heap every other day just so you can keep your pride she started to snarl but he covered her lips firmly with his you know you dont he murmured its just a car brianna just a thing her head was starting to spin i cant accept such a thing from you will you stop nuzzling me ive guests in the parlor ive been waiting all day to nuzzle you actually ive been waiting all day to get you back in bed you smell wonderful its the rosemary from the herb bed stop this i cant think dont think just kiss me just once if her head hadnt been reeling she would have known better but his lips were already onhers and hers were softening parting welcoming he took it slow deepening the kiss degree by lazy degree savoring her gradual warming the delicate scent of the herbs that clung to the hands she lifted to his face the gentle almost reluctant yielding of her body to his for a moment he forgot the move had been one of persuasion and simply enjoyed you have such a wonderful mouth brianna he nibbled at it pleasing himself i wonder how i managed to stay away from it for so long youre trying to distract me i have distracted you and myself he drew her back to arms length marveling that what hed intended to be a playful kiss had set his heart thundering lets forget practicality and all the other intellectual reasons i was going to use to convince you to take the damn car i want to do this for you its important to me it would make me happy if youd accept it she could have stood firm against the practical ignored the reason of the intellect but how could she refuse this quiet request or hold back from the steady look in his eyes tisnt fair to use my heart she murmured i know that he swore impatiently i know it i should walk away from you right now brianna pack up move out and get gone he swore again as she kept her eyes level therell probably come a time youll wish i had no i wont she folded her hands together afraid if she touched him she might cling why did you buy me this car grayson because you needed it he tossed out then steadied himself because i needed to do something for you its not that big a deal brie the moneys nothing to me her brow quirked oh i know it youre rolling in pound notes arent you do you think all your fine money matters to me grayson that i care for you because you can buy me new cars he opened his mouth closed it again oddly humbled no i dont i dont think it matters to you in the least well then we understand that he was so needy she thought and didnt even know the gift had been as much for himself as it was for her and that she could accept she turned around to take another look at the car this was a kind thing you did and i havent been properly gratefulnot for the thought or the deed he felt oddly like a small boy about to be forgiven for some careless bit of mischief so youll keep it aye she turned back kissed him and thank you his grin broke out murphy owes me five pounds wagered on me did you amusement colored her voice it was so typical his idea mmm well why dont i go in and see if my guests are happy then we can go for a little drive he came to her that night as shed hoped he would and again the night after as guests slept peacefully upstairs her inn was full as she liked it best when she sat down with her accounts it was with a light heart she was nearly ready to buy her material for the greenhouse he found her at her little desk bundled in her robe tapping a pen against her lips her eyes dreamy are you thinking of me he murmured bending down to nuzzle her neck actually i was thinking of southern exposure and treated glass second place to a greenhouse hed worked his way around to her jaw when his gaze skimmed over a letter she had spread open whats this an answer from that mining company yes at last theyve gotten their bookkeeping together well get a thousand pounds when we turn in the stock he drew back frowning a thousand for ten thousand shares that doesnt seem right she only smiled and rose to take down her hair normally it was a ritual he enjoyed but this time he only continued to stare at the papers on her desk you didnt know da she told him its a great deal more than i expected a fortune really as his schemes usually cost much more than they ever gained a tenth of a pound per share he picked up the letter himself what do they say he paid for it half of that as you can see i cant remember anything he ever did that earned as well ive only to tell rogan to send them the certificate dont dont she paused the brush in her hand why shouldnt we has rogan looked into the company no hes enough on his mind with maggie and the gallery opening next week i only asked him to hold the certificate let me call my broker look it cant hurt to get a prospectus on the company a little information a few days wont matter to you will they no but it seems a lot of bother for you a phone call my broker loves to bother setting the letter down again he crossed to her and took the brush let me do that he turned her to face the mirror and began to draw the brush through her hair just like a titian painting he murmured all these shades within shades she stood very still watching him in the glass it shocked her to realize how intimate it was how arousing to have him tend to her hair the way his fingers combed through after the brush much more than her scalp began to tingle then his eyes lifted met hers in the glass excitement arrowed into her when she saw the flare of need in his no not yet he held her as she was when she started to turn to him he set the brush down then drew her hair away from her face watch he murmured then slid his fingers down her to the belt of her robe do you ever wonder how we look together the idea was so shocking so thrilling she couldnt speak his eyes stayed on hers as he unbelted the robe drew it away i can see it in my head sometimes it gets in the way of my work but its hard to mind his hands trailed up lightly over her breasts making her shiver before he began to unbutton the highnecked gown speechless helpless she watched his hands move over her felt the heat spread under her skin over it her legs seemed to melt away so that she had no choice but to lean back against him as if in a dream she saw him tug the gown from her shoulder press his lips to the bared skin a jolt of pleasure a flash of heat her breath came out on a little purr of agreement as the tip of his tongue teased the curve of her neck it was so stunning to see as well as to feel though her eyes went wide when he slipped the gown up over her head and away she didnt protest couldnt she stared in amazement at the woman in the glass at herself she thought hazily it was herself she watched for she could feel that light devastating touch as his hands curved up to take her breasts so pale he said in a voice that had roughened like ivory tipped with rose petals eyes dark and intense he rubbed his thumbs over her nipples felt her tremble heard her moan it was beautifully erotic to watch her body curve back to feel the soft yielding weight of her sag against him as she went pliant with pleasure almost experimentally he took his hand down her torso feeling each muscle quiver under his palm the scent of her hair streamed through his senses the silk of those long white limbs and the sight of them trembling in the glass he wanted to give to give to her as hed never wanted to give to anyone before to soothe and excite to protect and inflame and she he thought pressing his lips to her throat again was so perfect so outrageously generous a touch he thought at his touch all that cool dignity and calm manner melted away brianna his breath was backing up in his lungs but he held on until her clouded eyes lifted once more to the reflection of his watch what happens to you when i take you up she started to speak but his hand glided smoothly down cupping her finding her already hot and wet even as she choked out his name half in protest half in disbelief he stroked her gently at first persuasively but his eyes were fierce with concentration it was staggering shocking to see his hand possess her there and to feel those long slow strokes that evoked an i answering pull and tug in her center her own eyes showed her that she was moving against him now willingly eagerly almost pleadingly any thought of modesty was forgotten abandoned as she lifted her arms hooking them back around his neck her hips responding to his increasing rhythm and she was like a moth pinned by a sharp sweet spear of pleasure her body was still shuddering when he lifted her carrying her to the bed to show her more chapter fourteen the openings tomorrow and hes barred me from the place with her chin on her fist maggie glared at briannas back and hes plopped me down in your kitchen so you can be my keeper patiently brianna finished icing the petit fours shed baked for tea she had eight guests counting gray including three active children margaret mary didnt the doctor tell you to stay off your feet and that since the babys dropped you could deliver earlier than youd thought what does he know cranky as a child herself maggie scowled im going to be pregnant for the rest of my life and if sweeney thinks hes keeping me from the opening tomorrow hed best think again rogan never said he intended to do that he didnt want you shed nearly said underfoot and took more care with her words overdoing today its my gallery too she muttered her back was paining her like a toothache and she was having twinges just twinges she assured herself probably the mutton shed eaten that afternoon of course it is brianna soothed and well all be there tomorrow for the opening the advertisements in the papers were lovely itll be a great success i know maggie only grunted wheres the yank hes working locked himself in as defense against the little german girl who kept wandering into his room she smiled over it hes a darling with children he played chutes and ladders with her last night so shes fallen in love with him and wont leave him in peace and youre thinking what a fine father hell make brianna pokered up i didnt say that but he would you should see how he she broke off when she heard the front door open if thats more guests ill have to give them my room and sleep in the parlor you can just stop playing musical beds and sleep in grays maggie commented then winced when she recognized the voices coming down the hall ah perfect id hoped shed changed her mind and stayed in france stop it brianna warned and took out more cups for tea the world travelers are back lottie said cheerfully as she trailed maeve into the kitchen oh what a fine place you have there maggie like a palace it is what a wonderful time we had speak for yourself maeve sniffed and set her purse on the counter bunch of foreign halfnaked people running around on the beach some of the men were built beautifully lottie giggled there was an american widower who flirted with maeve dallying maeve waved a hand but her cheeks had flushed i paid no mind to his kind sitting down maeve gave maggie a hard stare she covered the spurt of concern with a curl of the lip peaked you are youll soon appreciate what a mother suffers when you go into labor thank you so much ah the girls as strong as a horse lotties voice was bracing as she patted maggies hand and young enough to have a half dozen children maggie rolled her eyes and managed a laugh i dont know which of you depresses me more its nice youre back in time for the gallery opening tomorrow brianna tactfully changed subjects as she served the tea hah what would i be doing wasting time at some art place we wouldnt miss it lottie aimed a stern look in maeves direction maeve you know very well you said youd be pleased to see maggies work and the rest maeve shifted uncomfortably what i said was i was surprised there was so much fuss over bits of glass she frowned at brianna before lottie could embarrass her further your car wasnt out front has it fallen apart at last im told it was hopeless ive a new one the blue one out there a new one maeve set her cup down with a clatter squandering your money on a new car tis her money maggie began heatedly but brianna cut her off with a look its not new except to me its a used car and i didnt buy it she braced herself grayson bought it for me for a moment there was silence lottie stared down at her tea with her lips pursed maggie prepared to leap to her sisters defense and fought to ignore the twinges bought it for you maeves voice was hard as stone you accepted such a thing from a man have you no care for what people will think or say i imagine people will think it was a generous thing and say the same she set aside her frosting knife and picked up her tea her hands would shake in a moment she knew it hated it what they will think is that you sold yourself for it and have you is that what youve done no the word was frigidly calm the car was a gift and accepted as such it has nothing to do with our being lovers there she thought shed said it her stomach was clutched her hands fit to tremble but shed said it white around the lips her eyes burning blue maeve shoved away from the table youve whored yourself i havent ive given myself to a man i care for and admire given myself for the first time she said and was surprised that her hands remained steady though youve told it differently maeves gaze cut to maggie full of bitterness and temper no i didnt tell her maggie said calmly enough i should have but i didnt it hardly matters how i found out brianna folded her hands together there was a coldness inside her a horrible chill but she would finish this you saw that i lost whatever happiness i might have had with rory he was nothing maeve shot back a farmers son who never would have made a man youd have had nothing with him but a houseful of crying children i wanted children an ache shot through the ice i wanted a family and a home but well never know if i would have found that with him you saw to that and dragged a good fine man into your lies to keep me safe mother i dont think so i wish i could think so to keep me tied who would have tended to you and this house if i had married rory well never know that either i did what was best for you what was best for you because her legs felt weak maeve sat again so this is the way you pay me back for it by giving yourself in sin to the first man who strikes your fancy by giving myself in love to the first and only man whos touched me and what will you do when he plants a baby in your belly and goes off whistling thats my concern shes talking like you now enraged maeve turned on maggie youve turned her against me youve done that yourself dont bring maggie into this in a protective move brianna laid a hand on her sisters shoulder this is you and me mother any chance of getting a high on an afternoon of successful writing gray breezed into the kitchen and trailed off as he spotted the company though he felt the weight of tension in the room he tried a friendly smile mrs concannon mrs sullivan its good to have you back maeves hands curled into fists bloody bastard youll burn in hell with my daughter beside you mind your tongue in my house briannas sharp order shocked them all more than maeves bitter prediction i beg your pardon gray for my mothers rudeness youll beg no ones pardon on my account no gray agreed nodding at maeve theres no need you can say what you like to me mrs concannon did you promise her love and marriage a lifetime of devotion to get her on her back do you think i dont know what men say to have their way he promised me nothing brianna began but gray cut her off with one sharp look no i didnt make promises briannas not someone i would lie to and shes not someone id turn from if i was told something about her i didnt like youve shared family business with him too maeve whirled on brianna its not enough for you to condemn your soul to hell will you forever be damning your children to hell maggie fired up before brianna could speak because you couldnt find happiness must you try to keep us both from finding it she loves him if you could see through your own bitterness youd know that and thats what would matter to you but shes been at your beck and call all her life and you cant stand the thought that she might find something someone for herself maggie enough brianna murmured tisnt enough you wont say it never would but shell hear it from me shes hated me from the moment i was born and shes used you were not daughters to her but by turns a penance and a crutch has she once even once wished me happy with rogan or with the baby and why should i maeve shot back lips trembling and have my good wishes tossed back in my face youve never given me the love thats a mothers right i would have maggies breath began to hitch as she shoved back from the table god knows ive wanted to and briannas tried have you ever been grateful for all she put aside for your comfort instead you ruined whatever chance she had for the home and family she wanted well youll not do it again not this time you wont come into her house and speak to her or the man she loves this way ill speak as i choose to my own flesh and blood stop it the pair of you briannas voice was sharp as a whiplash she was pale icily so and the trembling shed managed to fight back had grown to shudders must you strike at each other this way always i wont be the club you use to hurt each other ive guests in the parlor she said drawing an unsteady breath and i prefer they not be subjected to the misery of my family maggie you sit down and calm yourself fight your own battles then maggie said furiously ill leave even as she said it the pain struck and had her gripping the back of the chair maggie panicked brianna grabbed her what is it is it the baby just a twinge but it built into a wave that stunned her youve gone white sit down now sit dont argue with me lottie a retired nurse rose briskly how many twinges have you had darling i dont know on and off all afternoon she let out a relieved breath when the pain passed its nothing really ive two weeks yet or nearly that the doctor said any time now brianna reminded her what does a doctor know true true smiling easily lottie skirted the table and began to massage maggies shoulders anything else paining you love my back a bit maggie admitted its been nagging me all day mmmm well you just breathe easy now and relax no no more tea for her just now brianna she said before brianna could pour well see by and by im not in labor maggies head went giddy at the idea its just the mutton might be yes brie you havent given your young man any tea im fine gray looked from one woman to the other wondering what move to make retreat he decided would probably be best for all of them i think ill go back to work oh i do enjoy your books lottie said cheerfully two of them i read while we were on our holiday i wonder how you can think up such tales and write them down in all those nice words she chattered on keeping him and everyone as they were until maggie caught her breath there you are only about four minutes apart id say breathe it out love thats a girl brie i think you should call rogan now hell want to meet us at the hospital oh for an instant brianna couldnt think much less move i should call the doctor thatll be fine lottie took maggies hand held it tight as brianna dashed off now dont you worry ive helped bring many a baby into this world do you have a case packed maggie at home in the bedroom yes she shuddered out a breath as the contraction passed odd she felt calmer now in the closet the young man will go fetch it for you wont you dear sure hed be glad to it would get him out of the house away from the terrifying prospect of childbirth ill go get it right now its all right gray with the new calm cloaking her maggie managed a chuckle im not going to deliver on the kitchen table right he gave her an uncertain smile and fled im going to get your jacket now lottie told maggie and sent maeve a telling look dont forget your breathing i wont thank you lottie ill be fine youre scared gently lottie bent down to cup maggies cheek tis natural but whats happening to you is just as natural something only a woman can do only a woman can understand the good lord knows if a man could do it thered be fewer people in the world the thought made maggie smile im only a little scared and not just of the pain of knowing what to do after youll know youll be a mother soon margaret mary god bless you maggie closed her eyes when lottie left the room she could feel the changes inside her body the magnitude of them she imagined the changes in her life the enormity of them yes she would be a mother soon the child she and rogan had created would be in her arms instead of her womb i love you she thought i swear to you ill only show you love the pain began to well again drawing a low moan from her throat she squeezed her eyes tighter concentrated on breathing through the haze of pain she felt a hand cover hers opening her eyes she saw her mothers face and tears and perhaps for the first time in her life a true understanding i wish you happy maggie maeve said slowly with your child for a moment at least the gap was bridged maggie turned her hand over and gripped her mothers palm to palm when gray hurried back the overnight bag clutched in his hand lottie was helping maggie toward briannas car every guest in the house was outside waving them off oh thank you for being quick brianna snatched the case then looked around distractedly rogans on his way to the hospital he hung up before i could even say goodbye the doctor said to bring her right in i have to go with her of course you do shell be fine yes shell be fine brianna nibbled on her thumb nail i have to leaveall the guests dont worry about things here ill take care of it you cant cook ill take the lot of them out to dinner dont worry brie no its silly of me im so distracted im so sorry gray dont steadier himself he took her face in his hands dont even think about any of that now just go help your sister have a baby i will could you call mrs omalley please her numbers in my book shell come tend to things until i get home again and if youd call murphy hed want to know and brie go ill call the whole county despite the audience he gave her a quick hard kiss have rogan send me a cigar yes all right yes im going she hurried to the car gray stood back and watched her drive away with lottie and maeve following behind families he thought with a shake of the head and a shudder thank christ he didnt have to worry about one but he worried about her as afternoon became evening and evening became night mrs omalley had come bustling into the kitchen barely half an hour after his sos call rattling pans she chattered cheerfully about the childbirth experience until queasy gray had retreated to his room he fared better when murphy came down and shared a glass of whiskey with him in toast to maggie and the baby but as the inn grew quiet and the hour late gray wasnt able to work or sleeptwo activities hed always used for escape being wakeful gave him too much time to think however much he wanted to avoid it the kitchen scene played over and over in his head what kind of trouble had he caused brianna simply by wanting her then acting on the wanting he hadnt considered her family or her religion did she believe as her mother did it made him uneasy to think of souls and eternal damnation anything eternal made him uneasy and damnation certainly topped the list or had maggie spoken briannas mind that was hardly less disturbing all that talk of love from his point of view love could be every bit as dangerous as damnation and he preferred to dwell on neither on a personal level why couldnt people keep things simple he wondered as he wandered into briannas room complications were part and parcel of fiction but in reality life was so much smoother one day at a time but it was stupid he admitted and incredibly naive to pretend that brianna concannon wasnt a complication hadnt he admitted already that she was unique restless he lifted the top off a small bottle on her dresser and smelled her he just wanted to be with herfor the time being he told himself they enjoyed each other liked each other at this particular time and this particular place they suited each other well of course he could back off any time of course he could with a little snarl he shot the top back in the bottle but her scent remained with him she wasnt in love with him maybe she thought she was because he was her first that was natural and maybe just maybe he was a little more involved with her than hed ever been with anyone else because she was unlike anyone else so that was natural too still and all when his book was finished they would have to be finished as well hed be moving on lifting his head he stared at himself in the mirror no surprises there he thought it was same face if there was a faint light of panic in the eyes he chose to ignore it grayson thane looked back at him the man hed made from nothing a man he was comfortable with a man he told himself now who moved through life as he chose to move free no baggage no regrets there were memories he could block the unpleasant ones hed been doing that for years one day he thought hed look back and remember brianna and that would be enough why the hell hadnt she called he checked himself turned away from the mirror before he could see something he preferred to avoid no need for her to call he told himself and poked through the books on her shelf it was her business family business and he had no part in it wanted no part in it he was curious that was all about maggie and the baby if he was waiting up it was only to satisfy that curiosity feeling better he chose a book stretched out on her bed and began to read brianna found him there at three am she staggered in on a wave of joy and fatigue to see him asleep on top of her blankets an open book on his chest she beamed at him foolishly she knew but it was a night for foolishness quietly she undressed folded her clothes over a chair slipped into a nightgown in the adjoining bath she scrubbed the tiredness from her face she caught her own grinning reflection in the mirror and laughed padding back into the bedroom she bent down to pet con who was curled on the rug at the foot of the bed with a sigh she turned off the light and laid down without bothering to turn down the covers he turned to her instantly his arm draping over her his face nuzzling her hair brie his voice was thick with sleep missed you im back now she shifted curving to him just sleep hard to sleep without you too many old dreams without you ssh she stroked him felt herself start to drift im right here he came fully awake with a snap blinking confused brie he cleared his throat and pushed himself up youre back yes you fell asleep reading oh yeah after scrubbing his hands over his face he squinted to see her in the dim light it came flooding back maggie shes fine shes wonderful oh it was beautiful to see gray excited all over again she sat up wrapped her arms around her knees she was cursing rogan vowing all sorts of hideous revenge on him he just kept kissing her hands and telling her to breathe then shed laugh tell him she loved him and curse him all over again ive never seen a man so nervous and awed and loving all at once she sighed again not even aware her cheeks were wet there was all this confusion and chattering arguing just as youd expect whenever they tried to boot us out maggie would threaten to get up and leave herself my family stays says she or i go with them so we stayed and it was so marvellous gray wiped her tears himself are you going to tell me what she had a boy brianna sniffled the most beautiful boy he has black hair like rogans it curls around his little head like a halo and he has maggies eyes theyre blue now of course but the shape of thems maggies and he wailed so like he was cursing the lot of us for bringing him into this mess his little fingers all clenched into fists liam they named him liam matthew sweeney they let me hold him she rested her head on grays shoulder he looked at me are you going to tell me he smiled at you no but she smiled no that he didnt he looked at me very serious like as if he was after wondering what he was to make of all this business ive never held a life so new before its like nothing else nothing else in the world she turned her face into his throat i wish you could have been there to his amazement he found he wished the same well somebody had to mind the ranch your mrs omalley came on the fly bless her ill call her up tomorrow to give her the news and thank her she doesnt cook as well as you you dont think so she grinned to herself delighted i hope you didnt say so im the soul of diplomacy so he kissed briannas temple she had a boy whats the weight seven pounds one ounce and the timeyou know when she had it oh it was about half one shit looks like the german copped the pool pardon the pool we had a baby pool going sex weight time of birth im pretty sure the german guykrausehit the closest a betting pool is it and whose idea was that gray ran his tongue around his teeth murphys he said the manll bet on anything and what was your guess girl seven and a half pounds straight up midnight he kissed her again wheres my cigar rogan sent you along a fine one its in my purse ill take it down to the pub tomorrow somebodys bound to be handing out free drinks oh you can bet on that as well she took a little breath locked her fingers together grayson about this afternoon my mother you dont have to say anything about that i walked in at a bad moment thats all its not all and its foolish to pretend it is all right hed known shed insist on hashing it out but he couldnt bear to see her mood lowered we wont pretend lets not think about it tonight though well talk about it later as much as you need to tonights for celebrating dont you think relief warmed her her emotions had ridden on a roller coaster long enough that day i do yes i bet you havent eaten i havent why dont i get us some of the cold chicken thats left over from dinner well eat in bed chapter fifteen it was easy enough to avoid serious subjects over the next week gray buried himself in his work and briannas time was stretched thin between her guests and her new nephew whenever she had a spare minute she found some excuse to dart down to maggies cottage and fuss over the new mother and baby maggie was too enraptured with her son to do more than give a few token complaints about missing the opening of her new gallery gray had to admit the kid was a winner hed wandered down to the cottage himself a time or two when he needed to stretch his legs and clear his mind early evening was the best time when the light took on that luminous glow so special to ireland and the air was so clear he could see for miles across the emerald hills with the sun striking down on the thin ribbon of river in the distance making it flash like a silver sword he found rogan dressed in a tshirt and old jeans in the front garden plucking industriously at weeds an interesting look gray mused for a man who could likely afford a platoon of gardeners hiya pop grinning gray leaned on the garden gate rogan shifted back on the worn heels of his boots ah a man come in and join me ive been evicted women he jerked his head toward the cottage maggie and brie and murphys sister kate up for a visit and some of the village ladies discussing breast feeding and delivery room war stories yeah gray gave the cottage a pained look as he swung through the gate it sounds to me more like you escaped than got kicked out true enough being outnumbered i cant get near liam and brianna pointed out that maggie shouldnt be doing the gardening yet and its getting overrun then she lifted her brow at me in that way of hers so i took the hint he looked longingly back at the cottage we could try sneaking into the kitchen for a beer its safer out here gray sat down folded his legs companionably he reached out and pulled a weed at least it looked like a weed ive been wanting to talk to you anyway about that stock certificate which stock certificate is that the triquarter mining thing ah yes that business slipped my mind with all thats been going on brianna heard from them didnt she she heard from someone gray scratched his chin i had my broker do a little digging its interesting thinking of investing are you no and couldnt if i were there is no triquarter miningnot in wales or anywhere else he can locate rogans brow creased folded did they if doesnt appear there ever was a triquarter mining which should mean the certificate youre holding is worthless odd then that someone would be willing to pay a thousand pounds for it your man might have missed something the company might be quite small not appear on any of the standard lists i thought of that so did he he was curious enough to dig a little deeper even called the number that was printed on the letterhead and it isnt a working number it occurs to me that anyone can have a sheet of letterhead printed up just as anyone can rent a post office box like the one brianna wrote to in wales true enough but it doesnt explain why someone would be willing to pay for something that doesnt exist rogan frowned into middle distance ive got some business in dublin though im not sure brie will forgive me for taking maggie and liam away we need to leave at the end of the week it should only take a few days and i can look into this myself while im there i figure its worth a trip to wales gray shrugged as rogan looked at him youre a little encumbered right now but im not youre thinking of going to wales yourself ive always wanted to play detective its kind of a coincidence dont you think that shortly after brie found the certificate and sent off a letter the cottage was broken into he moved his shoulders again i make my living tying coincidences into plots and will you tell brianna what youre up to pieces of it anyway ive been thinking about taking a quick trip to new yorkbrianna might like a weekend in manhattan now rogans brows lifted i imagine she wouldif you could convince her to leave the cottage during high season i think ive got that worked out and new york is a distance from wales wouldnt be hard to detour there on the way back to clare though add a couple days onto the trip i thought about going on my own but if i had to talk to anyone official i think id need heror maggie or their mother he grinned again i think bries the obvious choice when would you leave a couple of days you move fast rogan commented do you think you can get brianna to move as quickly itll take a lot of charm ive been saving up well if you manage it keep in touch with me ill do what i can to look into the matter from my end oh and if you need extra ammunition you could mention weve several of maggies pieces displayed in worldwide new york the sound of womens laughter filled the air they came outside still circling maggie who had liam in the crook of her arm there were introductions greetings a lot of lastminute cooing over the baby before the visitors hopped on bicycles and peddled off lets have him gray reached out and took the baby from maggies arms he always got a kick out of the way liam stared up at him with solemn blue eyes hey arent you talking yet rogan i think its time we got this kid away from the women took him down to the pub for a pint hes had his pint for the evening thank you maggie put in mothers milk gray tickled the babys chin how come hes wearing a dress these women are making a sissy out of you kid tisnt a dress brianna leaned forward to kiss the top of liams head a sacque is what it is hell be wearing trousers soon enough rogan youve only to heat that dish i brought down when youre ready for dinner she scowled down at his gardening attempt its no good playing with the weeds you have to get the roots he grinned kissed her yes maam waving him away she laughed im going gray give the baby back the sweeneys have had more than enough company for the day youll put your feet up she said to maggie i will make her do the same she ordered gray shes been running two households for days gray snatched briannas hand i could carry you back dont be foolish you take care she let her hand stay in grays as they walked through the garden gate and onto the road hes grown so much already she murmured and he does smile now right at you do you ever wonder what goes through a babys mind when hes looking at you i figure hes wondering if this life is going to be much different from the last surprised she turned her head do you believe in that sort of thing really sure one trip through never made sense to me wed never get it right with one try and being in a place like this you can feel the echo of old souls every time you take a breath sometimes i feel ive walked along here before idly she reached out trailing her hand along the red blossoms of fuchsia that lined the road right here but in a different time in a different skin tell me a story theres a stillness to the air a peace the roads only a path very narrow but well trod and i can smell turf fires burning im tired but its good because im going home to someone someones waiting for me just up ahead sometimes i can almost see him standing there lifting his hand to wave at me she stopped shook her head at her own nonsense its foolish just imagining doesnt have to be he bent down plucked a wildflower from the side of the road and handed it to her the first day i walked here i couldnt look at it all fast enough long enough it wasnt just because it was new it was like remembering on impulse he turned took her into his arms and kissed her so was this he realized now and then when he held her when his mouth was on hers there was a picture of it at the edge of his mind like remembering he brushed off the feeling it was time he decided to start charming her into doing what he wanted rogan told me he needs to go back to dublin for a while maggie and liam will go with him oh there was a sharp quick stab of regret before she found acceptance well they have a life there as well i tend to forget when theyre here youll miss them i will yes i need to take a little trip myself a trip now there was a jolt of panic she fought to control where are you going new york the premiere remember your movie she managed a smile its exciting for you it could be if youd go with me go with you now she stopped dead in the road to gape at him to new york city a couple of days three or four he scooped her into his arms again and led her into an impromtu waltz we could stay at the plaza like eloise eloise who never mind ill explain later well take the concorde be there before you know it we could visit worldwide there he added as extra incentive do all the tourist things eat in ridiculously expensive restaurants you might get some new menus out of it but i couldnt really her head was spinning and had nothing to do with the quick circles of the dance the inn mrs omalley said shed be glad to pinch hit to to help out he elaborated i want you with me brianna the movies important but it wont be any fun without you its a big moment for me i dont want it to just be an obligation but new york a wink away on the sst murphys happy to look after con mrs omalleys bustling to take care of the inn youve talked to them already she tried to stop the whirling dance but gray kept spinning her sure i knew you wouldnt go until everything was tidy i wouldnt and i cant do this for me brianna ruthlessly he pulled out his best weapon the trust i need you there her breath came out on a long slow sigh grayson is that a yes i must be mad and she laughed yes two days later brianna found herself on the concorde streaking across the atlantic her heart was in her throat had been since shed closed her suitcase she was going to new york just like that shed left her business in the hands of another capable hands to be sure but not her hands shed agreed to go to another country to cross an entire ocean with a man who wasnt even kin in a plane that was a great deal smaller than shed imagined surely she must have gone mad nervous he took her hand brought it to his lips gray i should never have done this i dont know what got into me of course she knew he had he had gotten into her in every possible way are you worried about your mothers reaction that had been hideous the hard words the accusations and predictions but brianna shook her head shed resigned herself to maeves feelings on gray and their relationship i just packed and left she murmured hardly he laughed at her you made at least a dozen lists cooked enough meals for a month and stuck them in the freezer cleaned the cottage from top to bottom he broke off because she didnt merely look nervous she looked terrified honey relax theres nothing to be scared of new york isnt nearly as bad as its made out to be it wasnt new york brianna turned her head burying her face against his shoulder it was gray she understood if he didnt that there was no one else in the world she would have done this for but family she understood if he didnt that he had become as intricate and vital a part of her life as her own flesh and blood tell me about eloise again he kept her hand in his soothing shes a little girl who lives at the plaza with her nanny her dog weenie and her turtle skipperdee brianna smiled closed her eyes and let him tell her the story there was a limo waiting for them at the airport thanks to rogan and maggie brianna had experienced a limo before and didnt feel a complete dolt in the plush backseat she found an elaborate bouquet of three dozen white roses and a chilled bottle of dom perignon grayson overwhelmed she buried her face in the blossoms all you have to do is enjoy yourself he popped the cork on the champagne let it fizz to the rim and i your genial host will show you all there is to see in the big apple why do they call it that i havent got a clue he handed her a flute of wine tapped his against it you are the most beautiful woman ive ever known she flushed fumbled and pushed a hand through her traveltouseled hair im sure im looking my best no you look best in your apron when she laughed he leaned closer nibbled on her ear in fact i was wondering if youd wear it for me sometime i wear it every day uhuh i mean just the apron now color flooded her cheeks and she cast a distracted glance at the back of the drivers head through the security glass gray okay well deal with my prurient fantasies later what do you want to do first i she was still stuttering over the idea of standing in her kitchen in nothing but her apron shopping he decided after we check in and i make a couple of calls well hit the streets i should buy some souveniers and theres that toy store that important one fao schwartz aye theyd have something wonderful for liam wouldnt they absolutely but i was thinking more about fifth and fortyseventh whats that ill take you he barely gave her time to gawk at the palacelike structure of the hotel itself at the opulent lobby of the plaza with its red carpeting and dazzling chandeliers the spiffy uniforms of the staff the magnificently ornate floral arrangements and the glorious little display windows filled with stunning jewels they rode the elevator to the top and she walked into the sumptuous suite so high up that it had a view of the lush green island of central park he whirled her in and by the time shed freshened up from traveling he was waiting impatiently to whirl her out again lets walk its the best way to see new york he took her purse crossed the strap from her shoulder to her hip carry it like this with your hand on it are those shoes comfortable yes then youre set she was still trying to catch her breath when he pulled her out its a great town in the spring he told her as they began to walk down fifth so many people she watched a woman dash by legs flashing under short shimmering silk and another in baggy red leather with a trio of earrings dangling from her left lobe you like people she stared at a man marching along barking orders into a cellular phone yes gray shifted her out of the path of a zipping bike me too now and then he pointed out things to her promised her as much time as she wanted in the grand toy store enjoyed watching her gawk at store windows and the wonderfully varied people who hurried along the streets i went to paris once she told him smiling at a sidewalk vender who hawked hot dogs to see maggies show there i thought then id never in my life see anything as grand as that laughing she squeezed his hand hard but this is she loved it the constant and almost violent noise of traffic the glittering offerings displayed in shop after shop the people selfabsorbed and rushing away on their own business and the towering buildings spearing up everywhere and turning the streets into canyons here brianna stared at the building on the corner each window dripping with jewels and gems oh what is it its a bazaar darling zooming on the excitement of just being there with her he yanked open the door a carnival the air inside was alive with voices shoppers bumped along the aisles peering into display cases she saw diamonds ring after ring flashing through glass colored stones like rainbows the seductive gleam of gold oh what a place she was pleased to wander along the aisle with him it seemed otherworldly all the sellers and buyers haggling over the price of ruby necklaces and sapphire rings what a story shed have to tell when she got back to clare she stopped with gray by a display case and chuckled i doubt very much ill find my souveniers in here i will pearls i think he wagged a finger at the saleswoman to hold her off and studied the wares himself pearls would suit are you buying a gift exactly this one he gestured to the clerk hed already had an image in his mind and the three strands of milky pearls fit it perfectly he listened with half an ear as the clerk touted the beauty and worth of the necklace traditional she said simple and elegant an heirloom and of course a bargain gray took the necklace himself tested the weight studied the glowing orbs what do you think brianna its stunning of course it is the clerk said sensing a sale rather than a browse you wont find another to compare with it certainly not at this price a classic look like this you can wear with anything evening dress day wear a little cashmere sweater silk blouse simple little black dress black wouldnt suit her gray said looking at brianna midnight blue pastels moss green maybe brianna stomach began to jitter as the clerk picked up the theme you know youre right with her coloring you want jewel tones or pastels not every woman can wear both try it on youll see for yourself how beautifully they drape gray no brianna took a step back bumped solidly into another shopper you cant its ridiculous dearie the clerk broke in when a man wants to buy you a necklace like this its ridiculous to quibble at forty percent off retail too oh i think you can do better than that gray said offhandedly it wasnt the money hed hardly glanced at the tiny ticket tagged discreetly to the pave diamond clasp it was the sport lets see how they look brianna stood her eyes filled with distress as gray fastened the necklace around her it lay like a miracle against her plain cotton blouse you cant buy me something like this she refused however much her fingers itched to reach up and stroke the pearls sure i can he leaned over gave her a casual kiss let me enjoy myself straightening he studied her through narrowed eyes i think its pretty much what im looking for he shot the clerk a look do better dearie im practically giving it away now those pearls are perfectly matched you know mmmhmm he turned the little tabletop mirror toward brianna take a look he suggested live with them for a minute let me see that pin there the diamond heart oh thats a nice piece youve got a good eye revved the clerk reached for it lay it on the counter on a black velvet pad twentyfour brilliant cut stones top quality pretty brie dont you think maggie would like it a new mom present ah she was having a hard time keeping her mouth from hanging open first the sight of herself in the mirror with pearls around her neck then the idea that gray would buy diamonds for her sister shed adore it how couldnt she but you cant what kind of deal are you going to make me for both well the clerk drummed her fingers on her breast as if pained she picked up a calculator and started running figures she wrote an amount on a pad that had briannas heart stopping gray please he just waved her to silence i think you can do better than that youre killing me here the woman said see if you can stand a little more pain she grumbled muttering about profit margins and the quality of her merchandise but she juggled figures sliced a bit then patted a hand over her heart im cutting my own throat gray winked at her took out his wallet box them up send them to the plaza gray no sorry he unclasped the pearls handed them negligently to the delighted clerk youll have them by tonight its not smart to walk around with them thats not what i mean and you know it you have such a lovely voice the clerk said to distract her are you irish i am yes you see its her first trip to the states i want her to have something special to remember it by he took briannas hand kissing her fingers in a way that made even the clerks cynical heart sigh i want that very much you dont have to buy me things thats part of the beauty of it you never ask and what part of ireland are you from dearie county clare brianna murmured knowing shed lost again its in the west im sure its lovely and youre going to after taking grays credit card the clerk read the name and yelped grayson thane god i read all your books im your biggest fan wait until i tell my husband hes your biggest fan too were going to see your movie next week cant wait can i have your autograph milts just not going to believe it sure he took the pad she shoved at him this you marcia he tapped the business card displayed on the counter thats me do you live in new york it never says where on the back of your books no i dont he smiled at her handing her back the pad to distract her from asking more questions to marcia she read a gem among gems fondly grayson thane she beamed at him now but not so brightly she forgot to have him sign the credit slip you come back any time youre looking for something special and dont you worry mr thane ill have these sent out to your hotel right away you enjoy your necklace dearie and you enjoy new york thanks marcia give my best to milt pleased with himself he turned back to brianna want to look around some more numb she merely shook her head why do you do that she managed when they were on the street again how do you make it impossible to say no when i mean no youre welcome he said lightly are you hungry im hungry lets get a hot dog gray she stopped him its the most beautiful thing ive ever had she said solemnly and so are you good he grabbed her hand and led her to the next corner calculating that hed softened her up enough so that shed let him buy her the perfect dress for the premiere she argued she lost to balance things out gray backed off when she insisted on paying for her trinkets for ireland herself he amused himself helping her figure her change with the unfamiliar american money shed gotten at the airport bank it fascinated him that she seemed more dazzled by the toy store than by the jewelry or dress shops theyd visited and when inspiration hit he discovered her even more enthralled with a kitchen specialty store delighted with her he carted her bags and boxes back to the hotel then charmed her into bed spinning out time with long luxurious lovemaking he wined and dined her at le cirque then in a rush of nostalgic romanticism took her dancing at the rainbow room enjoying as much as she the outoftime decor and big band sound then he loved her again until she slept exhausted beside him and he lay wakeful he lay wakeful a long time smelling the roses hed given her stroking the silk of her hair listening to her quiet even breathing somewhere during that twilight time of half sleep he thought of how many hotels hed slept in alone how many mornings hed awakened alone with only the people he created inside his head for company he thought of how he preferred it that way he always had and how with her curled beside him he wasnt quite able to recapture that sensation of solitary contentment surely he would again when their time was up even half dreaming he warned himself not to dwell on tomorrow and certainly not on yesterday today was where he lived and today was very nearly perfect chapter sixteen by the following afternoon brianna was still dazzled enough with new york to try to look everywhere at once she didnt care if she appeared so obviously the tourist snapping pictures with her camera staring up her neck craned back to see the very top of the spearing buildings if she gawked what of it new york was a noisy and elaborate sideshow designed to stun the senses she pored over the guidebook in their suite making careful lists and dutifully crossing off each sight shed seen now she had to face the prospect of a business lunch with grays agent arlenes terrific gray assured brianna as he hustled her along the street youll like her but this lunch though she slowed her pace he didnt allow her to hang back as she would have preferred its like a business meeting i should wait for you somewhere or perhaps join you when youve finished i could go to saint patricks now and i told you id take you to saint pats after lunch and he would she knew he was more than willing to take her anywhere everywhere already that morning shed stood at the top of the empire state building marvelling shed had a subway ride eaten breakfast in a deli everything shed done everything shed seen was whirling around in her head like a kaleidoscope of color and sound still he promised more but the prospect of having lunch with a new york agent an obviously formidable woman was daunting shed have found some firm way of excusing herself perhaps even inventing a headache or fatigue if gray hadnt seemed so excited by the idea she watched as he casually stuffed a bill into a tin cup of a man dozing against the side of a building he never missed one whatever the handprinted sign might say homeless out of work vietnam vetit got his attention and his wallet everything got his attention she mused he missed nothing and saw everything and those small acts of kindness to strangers others seemed not even to admit existed were an innate part of him hey bud need a watch got some nice watches here only twenty bucks a slim black man opened a briefcase to display an array of gucci and cartier knockoffs got a real nice watch for the lady here to briannas dismay gray stopped yeah they got works hey the man grinned what do i look like they keep the time man look just like the ones you pay a thousand for down on fifth lets see gray chose one while brianna bit her lip the man looked dangerous to her the way his eyes were shifting right and left get hassled much on this corner nah i got a rep nice watch there quality look pretty on the lady twenty bucks gray gave the watch a shake held it to his ear fine he passed the man a twenty couple of beat cops heading this way he said mildly and tucked briannas hand in his arm when she looked back the man was gone were they stolen she asked awed probably not here you go he fastened the watch on her wrist it might run for a dayor a year you can never tell then why did you buy it hey the guys got to make a living doesnt he the restaurants up here that distracted her enough to have her tug on the jacket of her suit she felt drab and countrified and foolish with her little i love new york bag holding her empire state souveniers nonsense she assured herself she met new people all the time she enjoyed new people the problem was she thought as gray ushered her into the four seasons this time it was grays people she tried not to stare as he led her up the steps ah mr thane the maitre d greeted him warmly its been too long ms winston is already here they crossed the room with its long gleaming bar the linendecked tables already filled with the lunch crowd a woman rose as she spotted gray brianna saw the gorgeous red suit first the glint of gold at the lapel and at the ears then the short sleek blond hair the quick flashing smile before the woman was enveloped by grays enthusiastic embrace good to see you beautiful my favorite globe trotter her voice was husky with a hint of gravel arlene winston was tiny barely topping five feet and athletically trim from her thrice weekly workouts gray had said she was a grandmother but her face was almost unlined the tawny eyes sharp in contrast to the soft complexion and pixie features with her arm still around grays waist she held out a hand to brianna and youre brianna welcome to new york has our boy been showing you a good time he has yes its a wonderful city im pleased to meet you mrs winston arlene she cupped briannas hand briefly between the two of hers patted however friendly the gesture brianna wasnt unaware of the quick and thorough measuring gray simply stood back beaming isnt she gorgeous she certainly is lets sit i hope you dont mind ive ordered champagne a little celebration the brits gray asked settling there is that she smiled as their glasses were filled from the bottle of spring water already on the table do you want to get this business out of the way now or wait until after lunch lets get it out of the way obliging arlene dismissed the waiter then reached into her briefcase and took out a file of faxes heres the british deal what a woman gray said and winked at her the other foreign offers are in thereand the audio weve just started to pitch to the movie people and i have your contract she shifted letting gray look over the papers while she smiled at brianna gray tells me youre an incredible cook he likes to eat doesnt he though you run a b and b delightfully from what i hear blackthorn its called blackthorn cottage yes its not a large place homey i imagine arlene studied brianna over her water glass and quiet quiet certainly people come to the west for the scenery which im told is quite spectacular ive never been to ireland but grays certainly whetted my curiosity how many people can you manage oh ive four guest rooms so it varies depending on the size of families eights comfortable but i sometimes have twelve or more with children and you cook for them all run the place by yourself its a bit like running a family brianna explained most people stay only a night or two going on their way casually arlene drew brianna out weighing each word every inflection judging gray was more than a client to her much more an interesting woman she decided reserved a bit nervous obviously capable she mused tapping a perfectly manicured nail against the cloth as she pumped brianna for details of the countryside neat as a pin she observed well mannered and ah she watched briannas gaze wanderjust for a fractionand rest on gray and saw what she wanted to see brianna looked back saw arlenes lifted brows and struggled not to blush grayson said you have grandchildren i certainly do and after a glass of champagne im likely to drag out all their pictures id love to see them really my sister just had a baby everything about her warmed her eyes her voice ive pictures of my own arlene gray looked up from the file focused again youre a queen among agents and dont you forget it she handed him a pen even as she signaled for the wine and the menus sign the contracts gray and lets celebrate brianna calculated that she had sipped more champagne since meeting grayson than she had in the whole of her life before him while she toyed with a glass she studied the menu and tried not to wince over the prices we have drinks with rosalie late this afternoon gray was saying referring to the meeting scheduled with his editor then the premiere youre going arent you wouldnt miss it arlene assured him ill have the chicken she added passing her menu to the hovering waiter now she continued after their orders were placed tell me how the books going its going well incredibly well ive never had anything fall into place like this ive nearly got the first draft finished so quickly its streaming out his gaze rested on brianna almost like magic maybe its the atmosphere its a magical place ireland he works hard brianna put in sometimes he doesnt come out of his room for days at a time and it doesnt do to disturb him hell snap at you like a terrier and do you snap back arlene wanted to know not usually brianna smiled as gray covered her hand with his own im used to that sort of behavior with my sister oh yes the artist youd have experience with the artistic temperament i do indeed brianna said with a laugh creative people have a more difficult time than the rest of us i think gray needs to keep the door of his world closed while hes in it isnt she perfect i believe she is arlene said complacently a patient woman she waited until after the meal before making her next move will you have dessert brianna i couldnt thank you gray will never gains an ounce she said with a shake of her head you order something sinful gray brianna and i will go into the ladies room where we can talk about you in private when arlene rose brianna had little choice but to follow suit she cast one confused glance at gray over her shoulder as they walked away the ladies lounge was as glamorous as the barroom the counter was set with bottles of scent lotions even cosmetics arlene sat before the mirror crossed her legs and gestured for brianna to join her are you excited about the premiere tonight yes its a big moment for him isnt it i know theyve made movies of his books beforeive seen one the book was better thatta girl arlene laughed tilted her head do you know gray has never brought a woman with him to meet me before you i brianna fumbled wondered how best to respond i find that a very telling thing our relationship goes beyond business brianna i know hes so fond of you he speaks of you like family i am family or as close as hell let himself come to it i love him dearly when he told me he was bringing you to new york i was more than surprised casually arlene opened her compact dabbed powder under her eyes i wondered just how some little irish tart had gotten her hooks in my boy when briannas mouth opened her eyes iced arlene held up a hand an overprotective mothers first reaction and one that shifted as soon as i got a look at you forgive me of course but briannas voice was stiff and formal now youre annoyed with me and you should be ive adored gray for more than a decade worried about him harassed him soothed him id hoped he could find someone he could care for someone who would make him happy because hes not she snapped her compact closed and out of habit took out a tube of lipstick oh hes probably the most welladjusted person i know but theres a lack of happiness in some corner of his heart i know brianna murmured hes too alone he was do you know the way he looks at you hes almost giddy that might have concerned me if i hadnt seen the way you look at him i love him brianna heard herself say oh my dear i can see that she reached out to clasp briannas hand has he told you about himself very little he holds that in pretends it isnt there arlenes lips thinned as she nodded hes not one to share ive been as close to him as anyone can be for a long time and i know next to nothing myself once after his first milliondollar sale he got a little drunk and told me more than hed meant to she shook her head i dont feel i can tell you something like a priest in confession youd understand that yes ill say this he had a miserable childhood and a difficult life despite it maybe because of it hes a kind and generous man i know he is sometimes too generous how do you make him stop buying you things you dont because he needs to do it moneys not important to gray the symbol of it is vital but the money itself is nothing more than a means to an end and im about to give some unsolicited advice and tell you not to give up to be patient grays only home in his work he sees to that i wonder if he realizes yet youre making him a home in ireland no brianna relaxed enough to smile he doesnt neither did i until a bit ago still his books almost finished but youre not and youve got someone very much on your side now if you feel the need for it hours later as gray tugged up the zipper of her dress brianna thought over arlenes words it was a lovers gesture she thought as gray planted a kiss on her shoulder a husbands she smiled at him in the mirror you look wonderful grayson so he did in the black suit tieless with that casual sophistication shed always associated with movie and music stars whos going to look at me when youre around all the women theres a thought he draped the pearls around her throat grinning as he clasped them nearly perfect he judged turning her to face him the tone of the midnight blue warmed against her creamy skin the neckline was a low scoop that skimmed the soft curve of breasts and left her shoulders bare shed put her hair up so that he could play with the tendrils that escaped to tickle her ears and the nape of her neck she laughed as he turned her in a slow circle earlier you said i was perfect so i did he took a box out of his pocket flipped open the top there were more pearls inside two luminous teardrops that dripped from single flashing diamonds gray ssh he slipped the earrings over her lobes a practiced move she thought wryly smoothly and casually done now youre perfect when did you get these i picked them out when we bought the necklace marcia was delighted when i called and had her send them over i bet she was helpless to do otherwise she lifted a hand and stroked an earring it was real she knew yet she couldnt imagine itbrianna concannon standing in a luxurious new york hotel wearing pearls and diamonds while the man she loved smiled at her its no use telling you that you shouldnt have done it no use at all say thank you thank you accepting she pressed her cheek to his this is your night grayson and youve made me feel like a princess just think how nifty well look if any of the press bothers to snap a picture bothers to she grabbed her bag as he pulled her toward the door its your movie you wrote it i wrote the book thats what i said no he slipped an arm around her shoulders as they walked to the elevator she may have looked like a glamorous stranger he noted but she still smelled like brianna soft sweet and subtle you said it was my movie its not its the directors movie the producers movie the actors movie and its the screenwriters movie as the doors opened he led her inside pushed the button for lobby the novelist is way down on the list honey thats ridiculous its your story your people was he smiled at her she was becoming indignant for him and he found it charming i sold it so whatever theyve donefor better or worseyou wont hear me complain and the spotlight most certainly will not be on based on the novel written by tonight well it should be theyd have nothing without you damn right she cut him a glance as they stepped into the lobby youre making fun of me no im not im adoring you he kissed her to prove it then led her outside where their limo was waiting the trick to surviving a hollywood sale is not to take it too personally you could have written the screenplay yourself do i look like a masochist he almost shuddered at the thought thanks but working with an editor is as close as i ever want to come to writing by committee he settled back as the car cruised through traffic i get paid well i get my name on the screen for a few seconds and if the movies a hitand the early buzz seems to indicate this one will bemy sales soar dont you have any temperament plenty of it just not about this their picture was snapped the moment they alighted at the theater brianna blinked against the lights surprised and more than a little disconcerted hed indicated that hed be all but ignored yet a microphone was thrust at him before theyd taken two steps gray answered questions easily avoided them just as easily all the while keeping a firm grip on brianna as they made their way toward the theater dazzled she looked around there were people here shed only seen in glossy magazines on movie and television screens some loitered in the lobby as ordinary people might catching a last smoke chatting over drinks gossiping or talking shop here and there gray introduced her she made whatever responses seemed right and filed away names and faces for the people back in clare some dressed up some dressed down she saw diamonds and she saw denim there were baseball caps and thousanddollar suits she smelled popcorn as she might in any theater on any continent and that bubble gum scent of candy along with subtle perfumes and over it all was a thin glossy coat of glamour when they took their seats in the theater gray draped his arm over the back of her chair turned so that his mouth was at her ear impressed desperately i feel ive walked into a movie instead of coming to see one thats because events like this have nothing to do with reality wait until the party after brianna let out a careful breath shed come a long way from clare she thought a long long way she didnt have much time to chew over it the lights dimmed the screen lit in only moments she felt the sharp silvery thrill of seeing grays name flash hold then fade thats wonderful she whispered thats a wonderful thing lets see if the rest is as good she thought it was the action swept by that edgeoftheseat pace that had her immersed it didnt seem to matter that shed read the book already knew the twists of plot recognized whole blocks of grays words in the dialogue her stomach still clenched her lips still curved her eyes still widened once gray pressed a handkerchief into her hands so she could dry her cheeks youre the perfect audience brie i dont know how ive watched a movie without you ssh she sighed took his hand and held it through the breathless climax and through the closing credits while applause echoed from the walls id say weve got a hit they wont believe me brianna said as they stepped out of the elevator in the plaza hours later i wouldnt believe me i danced with tom cruise giggling a little lightheaded on wine and excitement she turned a quick pirouette do you believe it i have to gray unlocked the door i saw it he seemed very taken with you oh he just wanted to talk about ireland he has a fondness for it hes charming and madly in love with his wife and to think they might actually come and stay at my house it wouldnt surprise me to find the place lousy with celebrities after tonight yawning gray toed off his shoes you enchanted everyone you spoke with you yanks always fall for an irish voice she unclasped her necklace running the strands through her hands before she laid them in their box im so proud of you gray everyone was saying how wonderful the movie was and all that talk about oscars she beamed at him as she slipped off her earrings imagine you winning an oscar i wouldnt he took off his jacket tossed it carelessly aside i didnt write the movie but she made a sound of disgust stepping out of her shoes lowering the zipper of her dress thats just not right you should have one he grinned and taking off his shirt glanced over his shoulder at her but the quip dried like dust on the tip of his tongue she stepped out of her dress and was standing there in the little strapless fancy hed bought to go under it midnight blue silk lace unprepared he was hard as iron as she bent to unsnap a smoky stocking from its garters pretty hands with their neat unpainted nails skimmed down over one long smooth thigh over the knee the calf tidily rolling the stocking she was saying something but he couldnt hear it over the buzzing in his head part of his brain was warning him to get a choke hold on the violent flare of desire another part was urging him to take as hed wanted to take hard and fast and mindlessly her stockings neatly folded she reached up to unpin her hair his hands fisted at his sides as those firedgold tresses spilled down over bare shoulders he could hear his own breathing too quick too harsh and could almost almost feel that silk rip in his hands feel the flesh beneath go hot taste that heat as his mouth closed greedily over her he forced himself to turn away he needed only a moment he assured himself to reclaim control it wouldnt be right to frighten her and itll be such fun to tell everyone brianha set down her brush and giving into the new laugh turned another pirouette i cant believe its the middle of the night and im so wide awake just like a little child whos had too many sweets i dont feel as though ill ever need to sleep again she spun toward him wrapping her arms around his waist pressing against his back oh ive had such a wonderful time gray i dont know how to thank you for it you dont have to his voice was rough every cell in his body on full alert oh but youre used to this sort of thing innocently she planted a quick line of friendly kisses from shoulder to shoulder he ground his teeth to hold back a moan i dont suppose you can really imagine what a thrill all this has been for me but youre all knotted up instinctively she began to rub his back and shoulders you must be tired and here i am chattering like a magpie lie down wont you and ill work these kinks out for you stop the order sliced out he whirled quickly gripping her wrists so that she could only stand and stare he looked furious no she realized he looked dangerous grayson what is it dont you know what youre doing to me when she shook her head he jerked her against him his fingers biting into flesh he could see the puzzlement in her eyes give way to dawning awareness and to panic and he snapped goddamn it his mouth crushed down on hers hungry desperate if shed pushed him away he might have pulled himself back instead she lifted a trembling hand to his cheek and he was lost just once he muttered dragging her to the bed just once this wasnt the patient tenderhearted lover shed known he was wild on the edge of violence with hands that tugged and tore and possessed everything about him was hard his mouth his hands his body for an instant as he used them all to batter her senses she feared she might simply break apart like glass then the dark tide of his need swept her along shocked aroused and terrified all at once she cried out staggered as those restless fingers shot her mercilessly to peak and over her vision hazed but she could see him through it in the lights theyd left blazing his eyes were fierce she said his name again sobbed it out as he pulled her up to her knees they were torso to torso on the rumpled bed his hands molding her pushing her ruthlessly toward madness helpless she bowed back shuddering when his teeth scraped down her throat over her breast there he suckled greedily as if starved for her taste while his impatient fingers drove her mercilessly higher he couldnt think each time hed loved her hed struggled to keep one corner of his mind cool enough to make his hands gentle his pace easy this time there was only heat a kind of gleeful glorious hell that seeped into mind as well as body and burned away the civilized now bombarded by his own lust craving hers control was beyond him he wanted her writhing bucking screaming and he had her even the torn silk was too much of a barrier frantic now he ripped it down the center pushing her onto her back so that he could devour the newly exposed flesh he could feel her hands drag through his hair her nails score his shoulders as he worked his way down her feasting then her gasp the jolt the muffled scream when his tongue plunged into her she was dying no one could live through this heat through the pressure that kept building and exploding building and exploding until her body was only a quivering mass of scored nerves and unspeakable needs the sensations pounded at her massing too quickly to be separated she only knew he was doing things to her incredible wicked delicious things the next climax slammed into her like a fist rearing up she grabbed at him thrashing until they were rolling over the bed her mouth sprinted over him just as greedy now just as frenzied her questing hands found him cupped him so that her system shivered with fresh and furious pleasure when he groaned now now it had to be now he couldnt stop himself his hands slid off her damp skin gripped hard at her hips to lift them he drove himself inside her deep panting as he positioned her to take even more of him he rode her hard plunging further each time she rose to meet him he watched her face as she plummeted over that final vicious peak the way her clouded eyes went dark as her muscles contracted around him with something perilously close to pain he emptied himself into her chapter seventeen hed rolled off her and was staring at the ceiling he could curse himself he knew but he couldnt take back what hed done all of his care all of his caution and in an instant he had snapped and ruined it now she was curled up beside him quivering and he was afraid to touch her im sorry he finally said and tasted the uselessness of the apology i never meant to treat you that way i lost control lost control she murmured and wondered how it could be a body should feel limp and energized all at once did you think you needed it her voice was shaky he noted and rough he imagined with shock i know an apologys pretty lame can i get you something some water he squeezed his eyes shut and cursed himself again talk about lame let me get you a nightgown youll want a nightgown no i dont she managed to shift enough to look up and study his face he didnt look at her she noted but only stared at the ceiling grayson you didnt hurt me of course i did youll have bruises to prove it im not fragile she said with a hint of exasperation i treated you like he couldnt say it not to her i should have been gentle you have been i like knowing it took you some effort to be gentle and i like knowing something i did made you forget to be her lips curved as she brushed at the hair on his forehead did you think you frightened me i know i frightened you he shifted away sat up i didnt care you did frighten me she paused i liked it i love you he winced squeezed the hand shed laid over his brianna he began without a clue how to continue dont worry i dont need the words back listen a lot of times people get sex confused with love i imagine youre right grayson do you think i would be here with you that i would ever have been with you like this if i didnt love you he was good with words dozens of reasonable excuses and ploys ran through his mind no he said at length settling on the truth i dont which only makes it worse he muttered and rose to tug on his trousers i should never have let things go this far i knew better its my fault theres no fault here she reached for his hand so that he would sit on the bed again rather than pace it shouldnt make you sad to know youre loved grayson but it did it made him sad and panicked and for just a moment wishful brie i cant give you back what you want or should have theres no future with me no house in the country and kids in the yard its not in the cards its a pity you think so but im not asking you for that its what you want its what i want but not what i expect she gave him a surprisingly cool smile ive been rejected before and i know very well what is it to love and not have the person love you back at least not so much as you want or need she shook her head before he could speak as much as i might want to go on with you grayson ill survive without you i dont want to hurt you brianna i care about you i care for you she lifted a brow i know that and i know youre worried because you care more for me than youve cared for anyone before he opened his mouth shut it shook his head yes thats true its new ground for me for both of us still uncertain of his moves he took her hand kissed it id give you more if i could and i am sorry i at least didnt prepare you a little better for tonight youre the first inexperienced woman ive been with so ive tried to take it slow intrigued she cocked her head you must have been as nervous as i was the first time more he kissed her hand again much more believe me im used to women who know the ropes and the rules experienced or pro and you pro professional her eyes went huge youve paid women to bed them he stared back at her he must have been even more befuddled than hed realized to have come out with something like that not in recent memory anyway why would you have to do that a man who looks like you who has your sensibility look it was a long time ago another life dont look at me like that he snapped when youre sixteen and alone on the streets nothings free not even sex why were you alone and on the street at sixteen he stood retreated she thought and there was shame in his eyes as much as anger im not going to get into this why christ shaken he dragged both hands through his hair its late we need to get some sleep grayson is it so hard to talk to me theres hardly anything you dont know of me the bad things and the good do you think id think less of you for knowing he wasnt sure and told himself he didnt care its not important brianna it has nothing to do with me now with us here her eyes cooled and she rose to get the nightgown shed said she didnt want its your business of course if you choose to shut me out thats not what im doing she tugged the cotton over her head adjusted the sleeves as you say goddamn it youre good arent you furious with her he jammed his hands into his pockets i dont know your meaning you know my meaning exactly he tossed back lay on the guilt spread on a little frost and you get your way weve agreed its none of my business moving toward the bed she began to tuck in the sheets theyd ripped out if its guilt youre feeling its not my doing you get to me he muttered you know just how to get to me he hissed out a breath defeated you want it fine sit down ill tell you a story he turned his back on her rummaging through the drawer for the pack of cigarettes he always carried and smoked only when working the first thing i remember is the smell garbage just starting to rot mold stale cigarettes he added looking wryly at the smoke that curled toward the ceiling grass not the kind you mow the kind you inhale youve probably never smelled pot in your life have you i havent no she kept her hands in her lap and her eyes on him well thats my first real memory the sense of smells the strongest stays with yougood or bad i remember the sounds too raised voices loud music someone having sex in the next room i remember being hungry and not being able to get out of my room because shed locked me in again she was stoned most of the time and didnt always remember she had a kid around who needed to eat he looked around idly for an ashtray then leaned back against the dresser it wasnt so hard to speak of it after all he discovered it was almost like making up a scene in his mind almost she told me once shed left home when she was sixteen wanted to get away from her parents all the rules they were square shed say went nuts when they found out she smoked dope and had boys up in her room she was just living her own life doing her own thing so she just left one day hitched a ride and ended up in san francisco she could play at being a hippie there but she ended up on the hard edge of the drug culture experimented with a lot of shit paid for a lot of it by begging or selling herself hed just told her his mother was a prostitute a junkie and waited for some shocked exclamation when she only continued to watch him with those cool guarded eyes he shrugged and went on she was probably about eighteen when she got pregnant with me according to her story shed already had two abortions and was scared of another she could never be quite sure who the father was but was pretty certain it was one of three guys she moved in with one of them and decided to keep me when i was about a year old she got tired of him and moved in with somebody else he pimped for her supplied her with drugs but he knocked her around a little too much so she ditched him gray tapped his cigarette out paused long enough for brianna to comment but she said nothing only sat as she was on the bed her hands folded anyway we can fast forward through the next couple of years as far as i can tell things stayed pretty much as they were she moved around from man to man got hooked on the hard stuff in enlightened times i guess you could say she had an addictive personality she knocked me around a little but she never really beat methat would have taken a little too much effort and interest she locked me in to keep me from wandering when she was on the street or meeting her dealer we lived in filth and i remember the cold it gets fucking cold in san francisco thats how the fire started somebody in the building knocked over a portable heater i was five and i was alone and locked in oh my god grayson she pressed her hands to her mouth oh god i woke up choking he said in the same distant voice the room was filled with smoke and i could hear the sirens and the screaming i was screaming and beating at the door i couldnt breathe and i was scared i remember just lying down on the floor and crying then a fireman crashed through the door and he picked me up i dont remember him carrying me out i dont remember the fire itself just the smoke in my room i woke up in the hospital and a social worker was there a pretty young thing with big blue eyes and soft hands and there was a cop he made me nervous because id been taught to distrust anyone in authority they asked me if i knew where my mother was i didnt by the time i was well enough to leave the hospital ward id been scooped up in the system they put me in a childrens home while they looked for her they never found her i never saw her again she never came for you no she never came it wasnt such a bad deal the home was clean they fed you regular the big problem for me was that it was structured and i wasnt used to structure there were foster homes but i made sure that didnt work didnt want to be anyones fake kid no matter how good or how bad the people were and some of them were really good people i was what they call intractable i liked it that way being a troublemaker gave me an identity so i made plenty of trouble i was a real tough guy with a smart mouth and a bad attitude i liked to pick fights because i was strong and fast and could usually win i was predictable he said with a half laugh thats the worst of it i was a product of my early environment and damned proud of it no fucking counselor or shrink or social worker was going to get through to me id been taught to hate authority and that was one thing shed taught me well but the school the home they were good to you a mocking light shimmered in his eyes oh yeah just peachy three squares and a bed he let out an impatient breath at her troubled expression youre a statistic brianna a number a problem and there are plenty of other statistics and numbers and problems to be shuffled around sure in hindsight i can tell you that some of them probably really gave a damn really tried to make a difference but they were the enemy with their questions and tests their rules and disciplines so following my mothers example i ran off at sixteen lived on the streets by my wits i never touched drugs never sold myself but there wasnt much else i didnt do he pushed away from the dresser and began to prowl the room i stole i cheated i ran scams and one day i had an epiphany when a guy i was running a short con on got wise and beat the living shit out of me it occurred to me when i came to in an alley with blood in my mouth and several busted ribs that i could probably find a better way to make a living i headed to new york i sold plenty of watches along fifth avenue he said with a hint of a smile ran a little threecard monte and i started to write id gotten a fairly decent education in the home and i liked to write i couldnt admit that at sixteen being such a tough sonofabitch but at eighteen in new york it didnt seem so bad what seemed bad what suddenly began to seem really bad was that i was the same as she was i decided to be somebody else i changed my name i changed myself i got a legit job bussing tables at a little dive in the village i shed that little bastard layer by layer until i was grayson thane and i dont look back because its pointless because it hurts you brianna said quietly and makes you angry maybe but mostly because it has nothing to do with who i am now she wanted to tell him it had everything to do with who he was what hed made himself instead she rose to face him i love who you are now she felt a pang knowing he was drawing back from what she wanted to give him is it so distressing to you to know that and to know i can feel sorry for the child for the young man and admire what evolved from them brianna the past doesnt matter not to me he insisted its different for you your past goes back centuries youre steeped in it the history the tradition its formed you and because of it the futures just as important youre a planner long term im not i cant be damn it i dont want to be theres just now the way things are right now did he think she couldnt understand that after all hed told her she could see him all too well the battered little boy terrified of the past terrified there was no future holding on desperately to whatever he could grab in the present well were together right now arent we gently she cupped his face grayson i cant stop loving you to make you more comfortable i cant do it to make myself more comfortable it simply is my hearts lost to you and i cant take it back i doubt i would if i could it doesnt mean you have to take it but youd be foolish not to it costs you nothing i dont want to hurt you brianna he linked his fingers around her wrists i dont want to hurt you i know that he would of course she wondered that he couldnt see he would hurt himself as well well take the now and be grateful for it but tell me one thing she said and kissed him lightly what was your name christ you dont give up no her smile was easy now surprisingly confident its not something i consider a failing logan he muttered michael logan and she laughed making him feel like a fool irish i should have known it such a gift of gab youve got and all the charm in the world michael logan he said firing up was a smallminded meanspirited pennyante thief who wasnt worth spit she sighed michael logan was a neglected troubled child who needed love and care and youre wrong to hate him so but well leave him in peace then she disarmed him by pressing against him laying her head on his shoulder her hands moved up and down his back soothing she should have been disgusted by what hed told her she should have been appalled by the way hed treated her in bed yet she was here holding him and offering him a terrifying depth of love i dont know what to do about you theres nothing you have to do she brushed her lips over his shoulder youve given me the most wonderful months of my life and youll remember me grayson as long as you live he let out a long breath he couldnt deny it for the first time in his life hed be leaving a part of himself behind when he walked away it was he who felt awkward the next morning they had breakfast in the parlor of the suite with the view of the park out the window and he waited for her to toss something hed told her back in his face hed broken the law hed slept with prostitutes hed wallowed in the sewers of the streets yet she sat there across from him looking as fresh as a morning in clare talking happily about their upcoming trip to worldwide before they went to the airport youre not eating your breakfast grayson arent you feeling well im fine he cut into the pancakes hed thought hed wanted i guess im missing your cooking it was exactly the right thing to say her concerned look transformed into a delighted smile youll be having it again tomorrow ill fix you something special he gave a grunt in response hed put off telling her about the trip to wales he hadnt wanted to spoil her enjoyment of new york now he wondered why hed thought he could nothing hed dumped on her the night before had shaken that steady composure ah brie were actually going to take a little detour on the way back to ireland oh frowning she set her teacup down do you have business somewhere not exactly were stopping off in wales in wales its about your stock remember i told you id have my broker do some checking yes did he find something unusual brie triquarter mining doesnt exist but of course it exists i have the certificate ive got the letter there is no triquarter mining on any stock exchange no company by that name listed anywhere the phone number on the letterhead is fake how can that be they offered me a thousand pounds which is why were going to wales i think it would be worth the trip to do a little personal checking brianna shook her head im sure your brokers very competent gray but he must have overlooked something if a company doesnt exist they dont issue stock or offer to buy it back they issue stock if its a front he said stabbing at his meal as she stared at him a scam brie i have a little experience with stock cons you get a post office box a phone number and you canvas for marks for people wholl invest he explained people looking to make a quick buck you get a suit and a spiel put some paperwork together print up a prospectus and phony certificates you take the money and you disappear she was quiet for a moment digesting it indeed she could see her father falling for just such a trick hed always flung himself heedlessly into deals in truth shed expected nothing when shed first pursued the matter i understand that part i think and its in keeping with my fathers luck in business but how do you explain that they answered me and offered me money i cant though he had some ideas on it thats why were going to wales rogans arranged for his plane to meet us in london and take us itll bring us back to shannon airport when were ready i see carefully she set her knife and fork aside youve discussed it with rogan him being a man and planned it out between you gray cleared his throat ran his tongue over his teeth i wanted you to enjoy the trip here without worrying when she only pinned him with those cool green eyes he shrugged youre waiting for an apology and youre not going to get one she folded her hands rested them on the edge of the table and said nothing youre good at the big chill he commented but it isnt going to wash frauds out of your league id have taken this trip by myself but its likely ill need you since the stocks in your fathers name and being in my fathers name makes it my business its kind of you to want to help fuck that she jolted felt her stomach shrivel at the inevitability of the argument dont use that tone on me grayson then dont use that irritated schoolteachers tone on me when she rose his eyes flashed narrowed dont you walk away goddamn it i wont be sworn at or shouted at or made to feel inadequate because im only a farmers daughter from the west counties what the hell does that have to do with anything when she continued to walk toward the bedroom he shoved away from the table he snatched her arm whirled her back a flicker of panic crossed her face before she closed up i said dont walk away from me i come and go as i please just as you do and im going to dress now and get ready for the trip youve so thoughtfully arranged you want to take a bite out of me go ahead but were going to settle this i was under the impression you already had youre hurting my arm grayson im sorry he released her jammed his hands in his pockets look i figured you might be a little annoyed but i didnt expect someone as reasonable as you to blow it all out of proportion youve arranged things behind my back made decisions for me decided i wouldnt be able to cope on my own and im blowing it all out of proportion well thats fine then im sure i should be ashamed of myself im trying to help you his voice rose again and he fought to bring it and his temper under control it has nothing to do with your being inadequate it has to do with you having no experience someone broke into your house cant you put it together she stared paled no why dont you put it together for me you wrote about the stock then somebody searches your house fast sloppy maybe desperate not long after that theres somebody outside your window how long have you lived in that house brianna all my life has anything like that happened before no but no so it makes sense to connect the dots i want to see what the whole picture looks like you should have told me all this before shaken she lowered to the arm of a chair you shouldnt have kept it from me its just a theory christ brie youve had enough on your mind your mother maggie and the baby me the whole business about finding that woman your father was involved with i didnt want to add to it you were trying to shield me im trying to understand that of course i was trying to shield you i dont like seeing you worried i he broke off stunned what had he almost said he took a long step back mentally from those tricky three words physically from her you matter to me he said carefully all right suddenly tired she pushed at her hair im sorry i made a scene about it but dont keep things from me gray i wont he touched her cheek and his stomach trembled brianna yes nothing he said and dropped his hand again nothing wed better pull it together if were going to get to worldwide it was raining in wales and too late to do more than check into the drab little hotel where gray had booked a room brianna had only a fleeting impression of the city of rhondda of the bleak row houses in the tight groups the sorry skies that pelted the road with rain they shared a meal she didnt taste then tumbled exhausted into bed he expected her to complain the accommodations werent the best and the traveling had been brutal even for him but she said nothing the next morning only dressed and asked him what they would do next i figured wed check the post office see where that gets us he watched her pin up her hair her movements neat precise though there were shadows under her eyes youre tired a bit all the time changing i imagine she glanced out the window where watery sunlight struggled through the glass i always thought of wales as a wild and beautiful place a lot of it is the mountains are spectacular and the coast the lleyn peninsulaits a little touristy full of brits on holidaybut really gorgeous or the uplands very pastoral and traditionally welsh if you saw the moorlands in the afternoon sun youd see just how wild and beautiful the country is youve been so many places im surprised you can remember one from another theres always something that sticks in your mind he looked around the gloomy hotel room im sorry about this brie it was the most convenient if you want to take an extra day or two ill show you the scenery she smiled over it the thought of her tossing responsibility aside and traveling with gray over foreign hills and shores i need to get home once weve finished what weve come for i cant impose on mrs omalley much longer she turned from the mirror and youre wanting to get back to work it shows got me he took her hands when i finish the book ill have a little time before i tour for the one thats coming up we could go somewhere anywhere you like greece or the south pacific the west indies would you like that some place with palm trees and a beach blue water white sun it sounds lovely he she thought he who never made plans was making them she felt it wiser not to point it out it might be difficult to get away again so soon she gave his hands a squeeze before releasing them to pick up her purse im ready if you are they found the post office easily enough but the woman in charge of the counter appeared immune to grays charm it wasnt her place to give out the names of people who rented post office boxes she told them crisply they could have one themselves if they wanted and she wouldnt be discussing them with strangers either when gray asked about triquarter he received a shrug and a frown the name meant nothing to her gray considered a bribe took another look at the prim set of the womans mouth and decided against it strike one he said as they stepped outside again i dont believe you ever thought it would be so easy no but sometimes you get a hit when you least expect it well try some mining companies shouldnt we just report everything we know to the local authorities well get to that he checked tirelessly office after office asking the same questions getting the same answers no one in rhondda had heard of triquarter brianna let him take control for the simple pleasure of watching him work it seemed to her that he could adjust chameleonlike to whatever personality he chose he could be charming abrupt businesslike sly it was she supposed how he researched a subject he might write about he asked endless questions by turns cajoling and bullying people into answering after four hours she knew more about coal mining and the welsh economy than she cared to remember and nothing about triquarter you need a sandwich gray decided i wouldnt say no to one okay we refuel and rethink i dont want you to be disappointed we havent learned anything but we have we know without a shadow of doubt there is no triquarter mining and never has been the post office box is a sham and in all likelihood still being rented by whoevers fronting the deal why would you think that they need it until they settle with you and any other outstanding investors i imagine theyve cleaned most of that up lets try here he nudged her into a small pub the scents were familiar enough to make her homesick the voices just foreign enough to be exotic they settled at a table where gray immediately commandeered the thin plastic menu mmm shepherds pie it wont be as good as yours but itll do want to try it thatll be fine and some tea gray gave their order leaned forward im thinking brie that your father dying so soon after he bought the stock plays a part in it you said you found the certificate in the attic i did yes we didnt go through all the boxes after hed died my motherwell maggie didnt have the heart to and i let it go because because maggie was hurting and your mother would have hounded you i dont like scenes she pressed her lips together and stared at the tabletop its easier to step back from them walk away from them she glanced up then away again maggie was the light of my fathers life he loved me i know he did but what they had was very special it was only between them she was grieving so hard and there was already a blowup about the house being left to me instead of my mother mother was bitter and angry and i let things go i wanted to start my business you see so it was easy to avoid the boxes dust around them from time to time and tell myself id get to it by and by and then you did i dont know why i picked that day i suppose because things were settled quite a bit mother in her own house maggie with rogan and i you werent hurting so much over him enough time had passed for you to do the practical thing thats true enough i thought i could go through the things up there that hed saved without aching so much for him or wishing so hard things had been different and it was part ambition she sighed i was thinking i could have the attic room converted for guests thats my brie he took her hand so hed put the certificate up there for safekeeping and years passed without anyone finding it or acting on it i imagine they wrote it off why should they take a chance of making contact if they did any checking theyd have learned that tom concannon had died and his heirs hadnt dealt with the stock it might have been lost or destroyed or tossed out by mistake then you wrote a letter and here we are it still doesnt explain why theyve offered me money okay were going to suppose its one of my best things suppose when the deal was made it was a fairly straightforward scam the way i explained in new york then suppose somebody got ambitious or lucky expanded on it triquarter was out of the picture but the resources the profit the organization was still there maybe you run another scam maybe you even get into something legit maybe youre just playing with things on the right side of the law using them as cover wouldnt it be a surprise if the legal stuff started to work maybe even made more of a profit than the cons now youve got to shed that shadowy stuff or at least cover it up brianna rubbed her temple as their meal was served its too confusing for roe something about those loose stock certificates hard to say what he helped himself to a healthy bite nope doesnt come close to yours and swallowed but theres something and they want them back even pay to get them back oh not much not enough to make you suspicious or interested in further investing just enough to make it worth your while to cash in you do know how all this business works dont you too much if it hadnt been for writing he trailed off shrugged it wasnt something to dwell on well we can consider it luck that i happen to have some experience along these lines well make a few stops after we eat then run it by the cops she nodded relieved at the idea of turning the whole mess over to the authorities the food helped pick up her spirits by morning theyd be home over her tea she began to dream about her garden greeting con working in her own kitchen finished hmm gray smiled at her taking a trip i was thinking of home my roses might be blooming youll be in the garden by this time tomorrow he promised and after counting out bills for the tab rose outside he draped his arm over her shoulder want to try local public transportation if we catch a bus well get across town a lot quicker i could rent a car if youd rather dont be silly a bus is fine then lets just hold it he turned her around nudging her back into the pub doorway isnt that interesting he murmured staring down the street isnt that just fascinating what youre crushing me sorry i want you to keep back as much as you can and take a look down there just across the street his eyes began to gleam just on the way to the post office the man carrying the black umbrella she poked her head out scanning yes she said after a moment theres a man with a black umbrella doesnt look familiar think back a couple of months you served us salmon as i recall and trifle i dont know how it is you can remember meals so she leaned out further strained her eyes he looks ordinary enough to me like a lawyer or a banker bingo or so he told us our retired banker from london mr smythewhite it came to her in a flash made her laugh well thats odd isnt it why are we hiding from him because its odd brie because its very very odd that your overnight guest the one who happened to be out sightseeing when your house was searched is strolling down the street in wales just about to go into the post office what do you want to bet he rents a box there oh she sagged back against the door sweet jesus what are we going to do wait then follow him chapter eighteen they didnt have long to wait barely five minutes after smythewhite walked into the post office he walked out again after taking one quick look right then left he hurried up the street his umbrella swinging like a pendulum at his side damn it she blew it what come on quick gray grabbed briannas hand and darted after smythewhite the postmistress or whatever she is she told him we were asking questions how do you know suddenly hes in a hurry gray checked traffic cursed and pulled brianna in a zigzagging pattern between a truck and a sedan her heart pounded in her throat as both drivers retaliated with rude blasts of their horns already primed smythewhite glanced back spotted them and began to run stay here gray ordered ill not she sprinted after him her long legs keeping her no more than three paces behind their quarry might have dodged and swerved elbowing pedestrians aside but it was hardly a contest with two younger healthy pursuers on his heels as if hed come to the same conclusion he came to a stop just outside a chemists panting he dragged out a snowy white handkerchief to wipe his brow then turned letting his eyes widen behind his sparkling lenses well miss concannon mr thane what an unexpected surprise he had the wit and the wherewithal to smile pleasantly even as he pressed a hand to his speeding heart the world is indeed a small place are you in wales on holiday no more than you gray tossed back weve got business to discuss pal you want to talk here or should we hunt up the local constabulary all innocence smythewhite blinked in a familiar habit he took off his glasses polished the lenses business im afraid im at a loss this isnt about that unfortunate incident at your inn miss concannon as i told you i lost nothing and have no complaint at all its not surprising youd have lost nothing as you did the damage yourself did you have to dump all my dry goods on the floor excuse me looks like the cops then gray said and took smythewhite by the arm im afraid i dont have time to dally just now though it is lovely to run into you this way he tried and failed to dislodge grays grip as you could probably tell im in a hurry an appointment id completely forgotten im dreadfully late do you want the stock certificate back or not gray had the pleasure of seeing the man pause reconsider behind the lenses of the glasses he carefully readjusted his eyes were suddenly sly im afraid i dont understand you understand fine and so do we a seams a scam in any country any language now im not sure what the penalty for fraud confidence games and counterfeiting stocks is in the united kingdom but they can be pretty rough on pros where i come from and you used the mail smythewhite which was probably a mistake once you put a stamp on it and hand it over to the local post fraud becomes mail fraud a much nastier business he let smythewhite sweat that before he continued and then theres the idea of basing yourself in wales and doing scams across the irish sea makes it international you could be looking at a very long stretch now now i dont see any reason for threats smythewhite smiled again but sweat had begun to pearl on his brow were reasonable people and its a small matter a very small matter we can resolve easily and to everyones satisfaction why dont we talk about that yes yes why dont we he brightened instantly over a drink id be delighted to buy both of you a drink theres a pub just around the corner here a quiet one why dont we have a friendly pint or two while we hash all this business out why dont we brie but i think we should talk gray said smoothly and keeping one hand firmly on smythewhites arm took hers how long have you been in the game gray asked conversationally oh dear since before either of you were born i imagine im out of it now truly completely just two years ago my wife and i bought a little antique shop in surrey i thought your wife was dead brianna put in as smythewhite led the way to the pub oh no indeed iris is hale and hearty minding things for me while i put this little business to rest we do quite well he added as they stepped into the pub quite well in addition to the antique shop we have interests in several other enterprises all quite legal i assure you gentleman to the last he held briannas chair out for her a tour company first flight you might have heard of it impressed gray lifted a brow its become one of the top concerns in europe smythewhite preened i like to think that my managerial skills had something to do with that we started it as rather a clandestine smuggling operation initially he smiled apologetically at brianna my dear i hope youre not too shocked she simply shook her head nothing else could shock me at this point shall we have a harp he asked playing the gracious host it seems appropriate taking their assent for granted smythewhite ordered for the table now then as i said we did do a bit of smuggling tobacco and liquor primarily but we didnt have much of a taste for it and the touring end actually made more of a profit with no risk so to speak and as iris and i were getting on in years we decided to retire in a manner of speaking do you know the stock game was one of our last shes always been keen on antiques my iris so we used the profits from that to buy and stock our little shop he winced smiled sheepishly i suppose its poor taste to mention that dont let that stop you gray kicked back in his chair as their beer was served well imagine our surprise our dismay when we received your letter ive kept that post office box open because we have interests in wales but the triquarter thing was well in the past all but forgotten really im ashamed to say your father rest him slipped through the cracks in our reorganization efforts i hope youll take it as its meant when i say i found him a thoroughly delightful man brianna merely sighed thank you i must say iris and i very nearly panicked when we heard from you if we were connected with that old life our reputation the little businesses weve lovingly built in the past few years could be ruined not to mention the ah he dabbed at his lip with a napkin legal ramifications you could have ignored the letter gray said and we considered it did ignore the first but when brianna wrote again we felt something had to be done the certificate he had the grace to flush its lowering to admit it but i actually signed my legal name to it arrogance i suppose and i wasnt using it at the time having it float to the surface now come to the attention of the authorities could be rather awkward its as you said brianna murmured staring at gray its almost exactly as you said im good he murmured and patted her hand so you came to blackthorn to check out the situation for yourself i did iris couldnt join me as we were expecting a rather lovely shipment of chippendale admittedly i got a charge out of going under again a bit of nostalgia a little adventure i was absolutely charmed by your home and more than a little concerned when i discovered that you were related by marriage to rogan sweeney after all he is an important man a sharp one it worried me that he would take charge so when the opportunity presented itself i took a quick look around for the certificate he put a hand over briannas gave it an avuncular squeeze i do apologize for the mess and inconvenience i couldnt be sure how long id have alone you see id hoped if i could put my hands on it we could put a period to the whole unhappy business but i gave the certificate to rogan for safekeeping brianna told him ah i was afraid of something like that i find it odd he didnt follow up his wife was about to have a baby and he had the opening of the new gallery brianna stopped herself realized she was very nearly apologizing for her brotherinlaw i could handle the matter myself i began to suspect that as well after only a few hours in your home an organized soul is a dangerous one to someone in my former trade i did come back once thinking i might have another go but between your dog and your hero in residence i had to take to my heels briannas chin came up you were looking in my window with no disrespectful intent i promise you my dear im old enough to be your father and quite happily married he huffed a bit as if insulted well i offered to buy the stock back and the offer holds a half pound a piece gray reminded him dryly double what tom concannon paid i have the paperwork if you need proof oh im sure someone with your talent could come up with any paper transaction he wanted smythewhite let out a longsuffering sigh im sure you feel you have the right to accuse me of that sort of behavior i think the police would be fascinated by your behavior eyes on gray smythewhite took a hasty sip of beer what purpose would that serve really now two people in their golden years taxpayers devoted spouses ruined and sent to prison for past indiscretions you cheated people brianna snapped back you cheated my father i gave your father exactly what he paid for brianna a dream he walked off from our dealing a happy man hoping as too many hope to make something out of next to nothing he smiled at her gently he really only wanted the hope that he could because it was true she could find nothing to say it doesnt make it right she decided at length but weve mended our ways changing a life is an effortful thing my dear it takes work and patience and determination she lifted her gaze again as his words hit home if what he said of himself was true there were two people at that table who had made that effort would she condemn gray for what hed done in the past would she want to see some old mistake spring up and drag him back i dont want you or your wife to go to prison mr smythewhite he knows the rules gray interrupted squeezing briannas hand hard you play you pay maybe we can bypass the authorities but the courtesy is worth more than a thousand pounds as i explained smythewhite began the stock isnt worth dick gray returned but the certificate id say that would come in at ten thousand ten thousand pounds smythewhite blustered while brianna simply sat with her mouth hanging open thats blackmail its robbery its a pound a unit gray finished more than reasonable with what youve got riding on it and with the tidy profit you made from the investors i think tom concannons dream should come true i dont think thats blackmail i think its justice and justice isnt negotiable pale smythewhite sat back again he took out his handkerchief and mopped his face young man youre squeezing my heart nope just your bankbook which is fat enough to afford it you caused brie a lot of trouble a lot of worry you messed with her home now while i might sympathize with your predicament i dont think you realize just what that home means to her you made her cry oh well really smythewhite waved the handkerchief dabbed with it again i do apologize most sincerely this is dreadful really dreadful i have no idea what iris would say if shes smart gray drawled i think shed say pay up and count your blessings he sighed stuffed the damp handkerchief into his pocket ten thousand pounds youre a hard man mr thane herb i think i can call you herb because at this moment we both know im your best friend he nodded sadly unfortunately true changing tactics he looked hopefully at brianna i really have caused you distress and im terribly sorry well clear the whole matter up i wonder perhaps we could cancel the debt in trade a nice trip for you or furnishings for your inn we have some lovely pieces at the shop money talks gray said before brianna could think of a response a hard man smythewhite repeated and let his shoulders sag i suppose theres very little choice in the matter ill write you a check its going to have to be cash another sigh yes of course it is all right then well make arrangements naturally i dont carry such amounts with me on business jaunts naturally gray agreed but you can get it by tomorrow really another day or two would be more reasonable smythewhite began then seeing the gleam in grays eyes surrendered but i can wire iris for the money it will be no trouble to have it here by tomorrow i didnt think it would smythewhite smiled wanly if youd excuse me i need the loo shaking his head he rose and walked to the rear of the pub i dont understand i dont brianna whispered when smythewhite was out of earshot i kept quiet because you kept kicking me under the table but nudging you gray corrected i was only nudging you aye and ill have a limp for a week but my point is youre letting him go and youre making him pay such a huge amount it doesnt seem right its exactly right your father wanted his dream and hes getting his dream good old herb knows that sometimes a con goes sour and you count your losses you dont want to send him to jail and neither do i no i dont but to take his money he took your father and that five hundred pounds couldnt have been easy for your family to spare no but brianna what would your father say beaten she dropped her chin on her fist hed think it was a grand joke exactly gray cast his eyes toward the mens room narrowed them hes taking too long hang on a minute brianna frowned into her glass then her lips began to curve it really was a grand joke one her father would have greatly appreciated she didnt expect to see the money not such a huge amount not really it was enough to know theyd settled it all with no real harm done glancing up she saw gray eyes hot storm out of the mens room and head toward the bar he had a quick conversation with the barman before coming back to the table his face had cleared again as he dropped into his chair and picked up his beer well brianna said after the moment stretched out oh hes gone right out the window canny old bastard gone staggered by the turn of events she shut her eyes gone she repeated and to think he had me liking him believing him thats exactly what a con artists supposed to do but in this case i think we got more of the truth than not what do we do now i just dont want to go to the police gray i couldnt live with myself imagining that little man and his wife in jail a sudden thought stabbed through making her eyes pop wide oh bloody hell do you suppose he really has a wife at all probably gray took a sip of beer considered as to what we do now now we go back to clare let him stew wait him out itll be easy enough to find him again if and when we want how through first flight tours then theres this before briannas astonished eyes gray drew out a wallet i picked his pocket when we were out on the street insurance he explained when she continued to gape after all these years im not even rusty he shook his head at himself i should be ashamed then he grinned and tapped the billfold against his palm dont look so shocked its only a little cash and id calmly gray took bills from the wallet and stuck them in his own pocket he still owes me a hundred pounds more or less id say he keeps his real money in a clip hes got a london address gray went on tucking the lifted wallet away i glanced through it in the mens room theres also a snapshot of a rather attractive matronly looking woman iris id think oh and his names carstairs john b not smythewhite brianna pressed her fingers between her eyes my heads spinning dont worry brie i guarantee well be hearing from him again ready to go i suppose still reeling from the events of the day she rose hes a nerve that one he clipped out too without buying us the drinks oh he bought them gray hooked an arm through hers sending a salute to the barman on the way out he owns the damn pub he she stopped stared then began to laugh chapter nineteen it was good to be home adventures and the glamour of traveling were all very fine brianna thought but so were the simple pleasures of your own bed your own roof and the familiar view out your own window she would not mind winging off somewhere again as long as there was home to come back to content with routine brianna worked in her garden staking her budding delphiniums and monkshood while the scent of just blooming lavender honeyed the air bees hummed nearby busy flirting with her lupine from the rear of the house came the sound of children laughing and cons excited barks as he chased the ball her young american visitors tossed for him new york seemed very far away as exotic as the pearls shed tucked deep inside her dresser drawer and the day she had spent in wales was like some odd colorful play she glanced up adjusting the brim of her hat as she studied grays window he was working had been almost around the clock since theyd set down their bags she wondered where he was now what place what time what people surrounded him and what mood would he be in when he came back to her irritable if the writing went badly she thought touchy as a stray dog if it went well hed be hungryfor food and for her she smiled to herself and gently tied the fragile stems to the stakes how amazing it was to be wanted the way he wanted her amazing for both of them she decided he was no more used to it than she and it worried him a bit idly she brushed her fingers over a clump of bellflowers hed told her things about himself she knew hed told no one else and that worried him as well how foolish of him to have believed she would think less of him for what hed been through what hed done to survive she could only imagine the fear and the pride of a young boy who had never known the love and demands the sorrows and the comforts of family how alone hed been and how alone hed made himself out of that pride and fear and somehow through it hed fashioned himself into a caring and admirable man no she didnt think less of him she only loved him more for the knowing his story had made her think of her own and study on her life her parents hadnt loved each other and that was hurtful but brianna knew shed had her fathers love had always known it and taken comfort from it shed had a home and roots that kept body and soul anchored and in her own way maeve had loved her at least her mother had felt the duty toward the children shed borne enough to stay with them she could have turned her back at any time brianna mused that opinion had never occurred to brianna before and she mulled it over now as she enjoyed the gardening chores her mother could have walked away from the family shed createdand resented gone back to the career that had meant so much to her even if it was only duty that had kept her it was more than gray had had maeve was hard embittered she too often twisted the heart of the scriptures she so religiously read to suit her own means and uses she could use the canons of the church like a hammer but she had stayed with a little sigh brianna shifted to stake the next plant the time would come for forgiveness she hoped she had forgiveness in her youre supposed to look happy when you garden not troubled putting a hand on top of her hat brianna lifted her head to look at gray a good day she decided at once when hed had a good day you could all but feel the pleasure of it vibrate from him i was letting my mind wander so was i i got up and looked out of the window and saw you for the life of me i couldnt think of anything else its a lovely day for being outofdoors and you started working at dawn with quick and oddly tender movements she staked another stem is it going well for you then its going incredibly well he sat beside her indulged himself with a gulp of the perfumed air i can barely keep up with myself i murdered a lovely young woman today she snorted with laughter and sound very pleased with yourself i was very fond of her but she had to go and her murder is going to spearhead the outrage that will lead to the killers downfall was it in the ruins we went to that she died no that was someone else this one met her fate in the burren near the druids altar oh despite herself brianna shivered ive always been fond of that spot me too he left her stretched over the crown stone like an offering to a bloodthirsty god naked of course of course and i suppose some poor unfortunate tourist will find her he already has an american student on a walking tour of europe gray clucked his tongue i dont think hell ever be the same leaning over he kissed her shoulder so how was your day not as eventful i saw off those lovely newlyweds from limerick this morning and i minded the american children while their parents had a liein eagleeyed she spotted a tiny weed and mercilessly ripped it out of the bed they helped me make hot cross buns after the family had a day at bunratty the folk park you know only returned shortly ago were expecting another family this evening from edinburgh who stayed here two years past theyve two teenagers boys who both fell a bit in love with me last time really idly he ran a fingertip down her shoulder ill have to intimidate them oh i imagine theyre over it now she glanced up smiled curiously at his snort of laughter what i was just thinking youve probably ruined those boys for life theyll never find anyone to compare with you what nonsense she reached for another stake i talked to maggie earlier this afternoon they might be in dublin another week or two and well have the baptism when they get back murphy and i are to be godparents he shifted sat crosslegged now what does that mean exactly in catholic oh not much different id imagine than it means in any church well speak for the baby during the service like sponsors you see and well promise to look after his religious upbringing if something should happen to maggie and rogan kind of a heavy responsibility its an honor she said with a smile were you not baptized ever grayson i have no idea probably not he moved his shoulders then cocked a brow at her pensive frown what now worried ill burn in hell because nobody sprinkled water over my head no uncomfortable she looked away again and the waters only a symbol of cleansing away original sin how original is it she looked back at him shook her head you dont want me explaining catechism and such and im not trying to convert you still i know maggie and rogan would like you at the service sure ill go be interesting hows the kid anyway she says liams growing like a weed brianna concentrated on what her hands were doing and tried not to let her heart ache too much i told her about mr smythewhitei mean mr carstairs and she laughed till i thought shed burst she thought rogan might take the matter a bit less lightly but we both agreed it was so like da to tumble into a mess like this its a bit like having him back for a time brie he might say if you dont risk something you dont win something and im to tell you she was impressed with your cleverness in tracking mr carstairs down and would you like the job weve hired that detective for no luck on that actually there was something she sat back again laid her hands on her thighs someone one of amanda doughertys cousins i think thought she might have gone north in new york into the mountains it seems shed been there before and was fond of the area the detective hes taking a trip there to oh that place where rip van winkle fell asleep the catskills aye thats it so with luck hell find something there gray picked up a garden stake himself eyeing it down the length wondering absently how successful a murder weapon it might be whatll you do if you discover youve got a half brother or sister well i think i would write to miss dougherty first shed already thought it through carefully i dont want to hurt anyone but from the tone of her letters to da i think shed be a woman who might be glad to know that she and her child are welcome and they would be he mused setting the stake aside again this whattwentysix twentysevenyearold stranger would be welcome of course she tilted her head surprised he would question it he or she would have das blood wouldnt they as maggie and i do he wouldnt want us to turn our back on family but he gray broke off shrugged youre thinking he did brianna said mildly i dont know if thats the way of it well never know i suppose what he did when he learned of it but turn his back no it wouldnt have been in him he kept her letters and knowing him i think he would have grieved for the child he would never be able to see her gaze wandered followed the flitting path of a speckled butterfly he was a dreamer grayson but he was first and always a family man he gave up a great deal to keep this family whole more than id ever guessed until i read those letters im not criticizing him he thought of the grave and the flowers brianna had planted over it i just hate to see you troubled ill be less troubled when we find out what we can and your mother brianna how do you think shes going to react if this all comes out her eyes cooled and her chin took on a stubborn tilt ill deal with that when and if i have to shell have to accept what is for once in her life shell have to accept it youre still angry with her he observed about rory rorys over and done and has been he took her hands before she could reach for her stakes and waited patiently all right im angry for what she did then for the way she spoke to you and maybe most of all for the way she made what i feel for you seem wicked im not good at being angry it makes my stomach hurt then i hope youre not going to be angry with me he said as he heard the sound of a car approaching why would i saying nothing he rose drawing her to her feet together they watched the car pull up stop lottie leaned out with a hearty wave before she and maeve alighted i called lottie gray murmured squeezing briannas hand when it tensed in his sort of invited them over for a visit i dont want another argument with guests in the house briannas voice had chilled you shouldnt have done this grayson id have gone to see her tomorrow and had words in her home instead of mine brie your gardens a picture lottie called out as they approached and what a lovely day you have for it in her motherly way she embraced brianna and kissed her cheek did you have a fine time in new york city i did yes living the high life maeve said with a snort and leaving decency behind oh maeve leave be lottie gave an impatient wave i want to hear about new york city come in and have some tea then brianna invited ive brought you back some souveniers oh what a sweetheart you are souveniers maeve from america she beamed at gray as they walked to the house and your movie grayson was it grand it was he tucked her hand through his arm gave it a pat and after i had to compete with tom cruise for briannas attention no you dont say lotties voice squeaked and her eyes all but fell out in astonishment did you hear that maeve brianna met tom cruise i dont pay mind to movie actors maeve grumbled desperately impressed its all wild living and divorces with them hah never does she miss an errol flynn movie when it comes on the telly point scored lottie waltzed into the kitchen and went directly to the stove now ill fix the tea brianna that way you can go fetch our presents ive some berry tarts to go with it brianna shot gray a look as she headed for her bedroom baked fresh this morning ah thats lovely do you know grayson my oldest son thats peter he went to america to boston he went to visit cousins we have there he visited the harbor where you yanks dumped the british tea off the boat gone back twice again he has and taken his children his own son shawn is going to move there and take a job she chatted on about boston and her family while maeve sat in sullen silence a few moments later brianna came back in carrying two small boxes theres so many shops there she commented determined to be cheerful everywhere you look something else is for sale it was hard to decide what to bring you whatever it is itll be lovely eager to see lottie set down a plate of tarts and reached for her box oh would you look at this she lifted the small decorative bottle to the light where it gleamed rich blue tis for scent if you like or just for setting out its lovely as it can be lottie declared look how its got flowers carved right into it lilies how sweet of you brianna oh and maeve yours is red as a ruby with poppies wont these look fine setting on the dresser theyre pretty enough maeve couldnt quite resist running her finger over the etching if she had a weakness it was for pretty things she felt shed never gotten her fair share of them it was kind of you to give me a passing thought while you were off staying in a grand hotel and consorting with movie stars tom cruise lottie said easily ignoring the sarcasm is he as handsome a lad as he looks in the films every bit and charming as well he and his wife may come here here amazed at the thought lottie pressed a hand to her breast right here to blackthorn cottage brianna smiled at lottie so he said thatll be the day maeve muttered what would so rich and highflying a man want with staying at this place peace brianna said coolly and a few good meals what everyone else wants when they stay here and you get plenty of both in blackthorn gray put in ive done a great deal of traveling mrs concannon and ive never been to a place as lovely or as comfortable as this you must be very proud of brianna for her success hmph i imagine right enough youre comfortable here in my daughters bed it would be a foolish man who wasnt he said amiably before brianna could comment youre to be commended for raising such a warmhearted kindnatured woman who also has the brains and the dedication to run a successful business she amazes me stumped maeve said nothing the compliment was a curve she hadnt expected she was still searching through it for the insult when gray crossed to the counter i picked up a little something for both of you myself hed left the bag in the kitchen before hed gone out to brianna setting the scene he thought now as he wanted it to play why isnt that kind surprise and pleasure coursed through lotties voice as she accepted the box gray offered just tokens gray said smiling as brianna simply stared at him baffled lotties little gasp of delight pleased him enormously its a little bird look here maeve a crystal bird see how it catches the sunlight you can hang it by a wire in the window gray explained itll make rainbows for you you make me think of rainbows lottie oh go on with you rainbows she blinked back a film of moisture and rose to give gray a hard hug ill be hanging it right in our front window thank you gray youre a darling man isnt he a darling man maeve maeve grunted hesitated over the lid of her gift box by rights she knew she should toss the thing into his face rather than take a gift from a man of his kind but lotties crystal bird was such a pretty thing and the combination of basic greed and curiosity had her flipping open the lid speechless she lifted out the gilt and glass shaped like a heart it had a lid as well and when she opened it music played oh a music box lottie clapped her hands together what a beautiful thing and how clever whats the tune its playing stardust maeve murmured and caught herself just before she began to hum along with it an old tune a classic gray added they didnt have anything irish but this seemed to suit you the corners of maeves mouth turned up as the music charmed her she cleared her throat shot gray a level look thank you mr thane gray he said easily thirty minutes later brianna placed her hands on her hips there was only she and gray in the kitchen now and the plate of tarts was empty twas like a bribe no twasnt like a bribe he said mimicking her it was a bribe damn good one too she smiled at me before she left brianna huffed i dont know who i should be more ashamed of you or her then just think of it as a peace offering i dont want your mother giving you grief over me brianna clever you were a music box i thought so every time she listens to it shell think of me before too long shell convince herself im not such a bad sort after all she didnt want to smile it was outrageous figured her out have you a good writers a good observer shes used to complaining he opened the refrigerator helped himself to a beer trouble is she doesnt have nearly enough to complain about these days must be frustrating he popped the top off the bottle took a swig and shes afraid youve closed yourself off to her she doesnt know how to make the move thatll close the gap and im supposed to you will its the way youre made she knows that but shes worried this might be the exception he tipped up briannas chin with a fingertip it wont familys too important to you and youve already started to forgive her brianna turned away to tidy the kitchen its not always comfortable having someone see into you as though you were made of glass but she sighed listened to her own heart perhaps i have started to forgive her i dont know how long the process will take meticulously she washed the teacups your ploy today has undoubtedly speeded that along that was the idea from behind her he slipped his arms around her waist so youre not mad no im not mad turning she rested her head in the curve of his shoulder where she liked it best i love you grayson he stroked her hair looking out the window saying nothing they had soft weather over the next few days the kind that made working in his room like existing in endless twilight it was easy to lose track of time to let himself fall into the book with only the slightest awareness of the world around him he was closing in on the killer on that final violent meeting hed developed a respect for his villains mind mirroring perfectly the same emotions of his hero the man was as clever as he was vicious not mad gray mused as another part of his mind visualized the scene he was creating some would call the villain mad unable to conceive that the cruelty the ruthlessness of the murders could spring from a mind not twisted by insanity gray knew betterand so did his hero the killer wasnt mad but was coldbloodedly sane he was simply very simply evil he already knew exactly how the final hunt would develop almost every step and word was clear in his head in the rain in the dark through the windswept ruins where blood had already been spilled he knew his hero would see himself just for one instant see the worst of himself reflected in the man he pursued and that final battle would be more than right against wrong good against evil it would be on that rainsoaked windhowling precipice a desperate fight for redemption but that wouldnt be the end and it was in search of that unknown final scene that gray raced hed imagined almost from the beginning his hero leaving the village leaving the woman both of them would have been changed irrevocably by the violence that had shattered that quiet spot and by what had happened between them then each would go on with the rest of his life or try separately because hed created them as two dynamically opposing forces drawn together certainly but never for the long haul now it wasnt so clear he wondered where the hero was going and why why the woman turned slowly as hed planned moving toward the door of her cottage without looking back it should have been simple true to their characters satisfying yet the closer he came to reaching that moment the more uneasy he became kicking back in his chair he looked blankly around the room he hadnt a clue what time of day it was or how long hed been chained to his work but one thing was certain hed run dry he needed a walk he decided rain or no rain and he needed to stop secondguessing himself and let that final scene unfold in its own way and its own time he started downstairs marveling at the quiet before he remembered the family from scotland had gone it had amused him when hed crawled out of his cave long enough to notice how the two young men had sniffed around briannas heels competing for her attention it was tough to blame them the sound of briannas voice had him turning toward the kitchen well good day to you kenny feeney are you visiting your grandmother i am miss concannon well be here for two weeks im happy to see you youve grown so will you come in and have a cup of tea and some cake i wouldnt mind gray watched a boy of about twelve give a crookedtoothed grin as he stepped out of the rain he carried something large and apparently heavy wrapped in newspaper gran sent you a leg of lamb miss concannon we slaughtered just this morning oh thats kind of her with apparent pleasure brianna took the grisly package while graywriter of bloodthirsty thrillersfelt his stomach churn i have a currant cake here youll have a piece wont you and take the rest back to her i will dutifully stepping out of his wellies the boy stripped off his raincoat and cap then he spotted gray good day to you he said politely oh gray i didnt hear you come down this is young kenny feeney grandson of alice and peter feeney from the farm down the road a bit kenny this is grayson thane a guest of mine the yank kenny said as he solemnly shook grays hand you write books with murders in them my gran says thats right do you like to read i like books about cars or sports maybe you could write a book about football ill keep it in mind will you have some cake gray brianna asked as she sliced or would you rather have a sandwich now he cast a wary eye toward the lump under the newspaper he imagined it baaing no nothing not now do you live in kansas city kenny wanted to know my brother does he went to the states three years ago this winter he plays in a band no i dont live there but ive been there its a nice town pat he says its better than anywhere im saving me money so i can go over when im

good pay maybe ill play for an american football team they have one right there in kansas city you know ive heard rumors gray said and smiled this is grand cake miss concannon kenny polished off his piece when he left a bit later brianna watched him dart over the fields the cake bundled under his arm like one of his precious footballs so many of them go she murmured we lose them day after day year after year shaking her head she closed the kitchen door again well ill see to your room now that youre out of it i was going to take a walk why dont you come with me i could take a short one just let me she smiled apologetically as the phone rang good afternoon blackthorn cottage oh arlene how are you brianna held out a hand for grays thats good to hear yes im fine and well grays just here ill

mmmhmmm hey gorgeous he said into the receiver going to play tourist in the west counties he grinned nodded when brianna offered him tea no i think youll love it the weather he glanced out the window at the steadily falling rain magnificent he winked at brianna sipped his tea no i didnt get your package yet whats in it nodding he murmured to brianna reviews on the movie he paused listening whats the hype mmm brilliant i like brilliant wait say that one again from the fertile mind of grayson thane he repeated for bri annas benefit oscar worthy two thumbs straight up he laughed at that and the most powerful movie of the year not bad even if its only may no i dont have my tongue in my cheek its great even better early quotes on the new book he told brianna but you havent finished the new book not that new book the one thats coming out in july thats the new book what im working on is the new manuscript no just explaining some basic publishing to the landlady pursing his lips he listened really i like it with an eye on him brianna went to the stove for her roaster he was making noises the occasional comment occasionally hed grin or shake his head its a good thing im not wearing a hat my heads getting big yeah publicity sent me an endless letter about the plans for the tour ive agreed to be at their mercy for three weeks no you make the decision on that sort of thing it just takes too long for them to mail stuff yeah you too ill tell her talk to you later the movies doing well brianna said trying to resist pumping him twelve million in its first week which is nothing to sneeze at and the critics are smiling on it apparently they like the upcoming book too im at the top of my form he said reaching into a canister for a cookie ive created a story dense in atmosphere with prose as sharp as a honed dagger with ah gutwrenching twists and dark biting humor not too shabby you should be very proud i wrote it almost a year ago he shrugged chewed yeah its nice i have an affection for it that will dim considerably after thirtyone cities in three weeks the tour you were speaking of right talk shows bookstores airports and hotel rooms with a laugh he popped the rest of the cookie into his mouth what a life it suits you well id think right down to the ground she nodded not wanting to be sad and set the roaster on the counter in july you say yeah its crept up on me ive lost track ive been here four months sometimes it seems youve been here always getting used to me he grazed an absent hand over his chin and she could see his mind was elsewhere how about that walk i really need to get dinner on ill wait he leaned companionably against the counter so whats for dinner leg of lamb gray gave a little sigh i thought so chapter twenty on a clear day in the middle of may brianna watched the workmen dig the foundation for her greenhouse a small dream she thought flipping the braid she wore from her shoulder to her back come true she smiled down at the baby who gurgled in the portable swing beside her shed learned to be content with small dreams she thought bending to kiss her nephew on his curling black hair hes grown so maggie in just a matter of weeks i know and i havent she patted her belly grimaced a little i feel less of a sow every day but i wonder if ill ever lose all of it again you look wonderful thats what i tell her rogan added draping an arm around maggies shoulders and what do you know youre besotted with me true enough brianna looked away as they beamed at each other how easy it was for them now she mused so comfortably in love with a beautiful baby cooing beside them she didnt care for the pang of envy or the tug of longing so wheres our yank this morning brianna glanced back wondering uneasily if maggie was reading her mind he was up and out at first light without even his breakfast to i dont know he grunted at me at least i think it was at me his moods are unpredictable these days the books troubling him though he says hes cleaning it up which means im told tinkering with it shining it up hell be done before long then rogan asked before long and then brianna was taking a page out of grays book and not thinking of and them his publishers on the phone quite a lot now and sending packets by express all the time about the book thats coming out this summer it seems to irritate him to have to think of one when hes working on another she glanced back at the workmen its a good spot for the greenhouse dont you think ill be pleased to be able to see it from my window its the spot youve been talking of for months maggie pointed out and refused to be turned from the topic are things well between you and gray yes very well hes a bit sulky right now as i said but his moods never last very long i told you how he engineered a truce with mother clever of him a trinket from new york she was pleasant to him at liams christening i had to give birth before i could achieve close to the same shes mad for liam brianna said hes a buffer between us ah whats the trouble darling she murmured as liam began to fuss his nappies wet thats all lifting him maggie patted his back and soothed ill change it youre quicker to volunteer than his da with a shake of her head maggie laughed no ill do it you watch your greenhouse itll only take a minute she knows i wanted to talk to you rogan led brianna toward the wooden chairs set near the blackthorns for which the cottage was named is something wrong no there was an edginess about her under a forced calm that was out of character that rogan decided with a slight frown would have to be maggies department i wanted to talk with you about this triquarter mining business or the lack of it he sat laid his hands on his knees we havent really had the chance to talk it through since i was in dublin then the babys christening maggies satisfied with the way things have shaken down shes more interested in enjoying liam and getting back to her glass than pursuing the matter thats how it should be for her perhaps he didnt say what was obvious to both of them neither he nor maggie required any of the monetary compensation that might result from a suit i have to admit brianna it doesnt sit well with me the principle of it i can understand that you being a businessman yourself she smiled a little you never met mr carstairs its difficult to hold a grudge once you have lets separate emotion from legalities for a moment her smile widened she imagined he used just that brisk tone with any inefficient underling all right rogan carstairs committed a crime and while you might be reluctant to see him imprisioned its only logical to expect a penalty now im given to understand that hes become successful in the last few years i took it on myself to make a few discreet inquiries and it appears that his current businesses are aboveboard as well as lucrative hes in the position to compensate you for the dishonesty in his dealings with your father it would be a simple matter for me to go to london personally and settle it thats kind of you brianna folded her hands drew a deep breath im going to disappoint you rogan and im sorry for it i can see your ethics have been insulted by this and you want only to see justice served i do yes baffled he shook his head brie i can understand maggies attitude shes focused on the baby and her work and has always been one to brush aside anything that interfered with her concentration but youre a practical woman i am she agreed i am yes but im afraid i have a bit of my father in me as well reaching out she laid a hand over rogans you know some people for whatever reason start out on unsteady ground the choices they make arent always admirable a portion of them stay there because its easier or what theyre used to or even what they prefer another portion slide onto a stable footing without much effort a bit of luck of timing and another a small special portion she said thinking of gray fight their way onto the solid and they make something admirable of themselves she fell into silence staring out over the hills wishing ive lost you brie oh she waved a hand and brought herself back what i mean to say is i dont know the circumstances that led mr carstairs from one kind of life to another but hes hurting no one now maggie has what she wants and i what contents me so why trouble ourselves thats what she told me youd say he lifted his hands in defeat i had to try rogan maggie called from the kitchen doorway the baby bouncing against her shoulder the phone its dublin for you she wont answer the damn thing in our own house but she answers it here ive threatened not to bake for her if she doesnt none of my threats work he rose ive been expecting a call so i gave the office your number if we didnt answer at home thats no problem take all the time you need she smiled as maggie headed out with the baby well margaret mary are you going to share him now or keep him all to yourself he was just asking for you auntie brie with a chuckle maggie passed liam to her sister and settled in the chair rogan had vacated oh its good to sit liam was fussy last night id swear between us rogan and i walked all the way to galway and back do you suppose hes teething already cooing brianna rubbed a knuckle over liams gums looking for swelling it may be he drools like a puppy she closed her eyes let her body sag oh brie who would have thought you could love so much i spent most of my life not knowing rogan sweeney existed and now i couldnt live without him she opened one eye to be certain rogan was still in the house and couldnt hear her wax so sentimental and the baby its an enormous thing this grip on the heart i thought when i was carrying him i understood what it was to love him but holding him from the very first time i held him it was so much more she shook herself gave a shaky laugh oh its those hormones again theyre turning me to mush tisnt the hormones maggie brianna rubbed her cheek over liams head caught the marvelous scent of him its being happy i want you to be happy brie i can see youre not that isnt true of course im happy youre already seeing him walk away and youre making yourself accept it before it even happens if he chooses to walk away i cant stop him ive known that all along why cant you maggie shot back why dont you love him enough to fight for him i love him too much to fight for him and maybe i lack the courage im not as brave as you maggie thats just an excuse too brave is what youve always been saint brianna and if it is an excuse its mine she spoke mildly she would not she promised herself be drawn into an argument he has reasons why hell go i may not agree with them but i understand them dont slap at me maggie she said quietly and averted the next explosion because it does hurt and i could see this morning when he left the house that he was already walking away then make him stop he loves you brie you can see it every time he looks at you i think he does and that only increased the pain thats why hes in a hurry all at once to move on and hes afraid too afraid hell come back is that what youre counting on no but she wanted to count on it she wanted that very much love isnt always enough maggie we can see that from what happened with da that was different its all different but he lived without his amanda and he made his life as best he could im enough his daughter to do the same dont worry over me she murmured stroking the baby i know what amanda was feeling when she wrote she was grateful for the time they had together i wouldnt trade these past months for the world and more she glanced over then fell silent studying the set look on rogans face as he came across the lawn we may have found something he said on amanda dougherty gray didnt come home for tea and brianna wondered but didnt worry as she saw that her guests had their fill of finger sandwiches and dundee cake rogans report on amanda dougherty was always at the back of her mind as she moved through the rest of her day the detective had found nothing in his initial check of the towns and villages in the catskills it was to briannas i thinking hardly a surprise that no one remembered a pregnant irishwoman from more than a quarter of a century in the past but rogan being a thorough man hired thorough people routinely the detective made checks on vital statistics reading through birth and death and marriage certificates for a fiveyear period following the date of amandas final letter to tom concannon and it was in a small village deep in the mountains where he had found her amanda dougherty age thirtytwo had been married by a justice of the peace to a thirtyeightyearold man named colin bodine an address was given simply as rochester new york the detective was already on his way there to continue the search for amanda dougherty bodine the date of the marriage had been five months after the final letter to her father brianna mused amanda would have been close to term so it was most likely the man she had married had known shed been pregnant by another had he loved her brianna wondered she hoped so it seemed to her it took a strong kindhearted man to give another mans child his name she caught herself glancing at the clock again wondering where gray had gone off to annoyed with herself she biked down to murphys to fill him in on the progress of the greenhouse construction it was time to finish dinner preparations when she returned murphy had promised to come by and check over the foundation himself the following day but briannas underlying purpose the hope that gray had been visiting her neighbor as he often did had been dashed and now with more than twelve hours passed since hed left that morning she moved from wonder to worry she fretted eating nothing herself as her guests feasted on mackerel with gooseberry sauce she played her role as hostess seeing there was brandy where brandy was wanted an extra serving of steamed lemon pudding for the child who eyed it so hopefully she saw that the whiskey decanter in each guest room was filled and towels were fresh for evening baths she made parlor conversation with her guests offered board games to the children by ten when the light was gone and the house quiet shed moved beyond worry to resignation he would come back when he would come she thought and settled down in her room her knitting in her lap and her dog at her feet a full day of driving and walking and studying the countryside hadnt done a great deal to improve grays mood he was irritated with himself irritated by the fact that a light had been left burning for him in the window he switched it off the moment he came inside as if to prove to himself he didnt need or want the homey signal he started to go upstairs a deliberate move he knew to prove he was his own man cons soft woof stopped him turning on the stairs gray scowled at the dog what do you want con merely sat thumped his tail i dont have a curfew and i dont need a stupid dog waiting up for me con merely watched him then lifted a paw as if anticipating grays usual greeting shit gray went back down the stairs took the paw to shake and gave the dogs head a good scratch there better now con rose and padded toward the kitchen he stopped looked back then sat again obviously waiting im going to bed gray told him as if in agreement con rose again as if waiting to lead the way to his mistress fine well do it your way gray stuffed his hands in his pockets and followed the dog down the hall into the kitchen and through to briannas room he knew his mood was foul and couldnt seem to alter it it was the book of course but there was more he could admit at least to himself that hed been restless since liams christening thered been something about it the ritual itself that ancient pompous and oddly soothing rite full of words and color and movement the costumes the music the lighting had all melded together or so it had seemed to him to tilt time but it had been the community of it the belonging hed sensed from every neighbor and friend whod come to witness the childs baptism that had struck him most deeply it had touched him beyond the curiosity of it the writers interest in scene and event it had moved him the flow of words the unshakable faith and the river of continuity that ran from generation to generation in the small village church accented by a babys indignant wail fractured light through stained glass wood worn smooth by generations of bended knees it was family as much as shared belief and community as much as dogma and his sudden staggering wish to belong had left him restless and angry irritated with himself and her he stopped in the doorway of briannas sitting room watching her with her knitting needles clicking rhythmically the dark green wool spilled over the lap of her white nightgown the light beside her slanted down so that she could check her work but she never looked at her own hands across the room the television murmured through an old blackandwhite movie gary grant and ingrid bergman in sleek evening dress embraced in a wine cellar notorious gray thought a tale of love mistrust and redemption for reasons he didnt choose to grasp her choice of entertainment annoyed him all the more you shouldnt have waited up she glanced over at him her needles never faltering i didnt he looked tired she thought and moody whatever hed searched for in his long day alone he didnt appear to have found it have you eaten some pub grub this afternoon youll be hungry then she started to set her knitting aside in its basket ill fix you a plate i can fix my own if i want one he snapped i dont need you to mother me her body stiffened but she only sat again and picked up her wool as you please he stepped into the room challenging well well what wheres the interrogation arent you going to ask me where i was what i was doing why i didnt call as youve just pointed out im not your mother your business is your own for a moment there was only the sound of her needles and the distressed commercial voice of a woman on television whod discovered chip fat on her new blouse oh youre a cool one gray muttered and strode to the set to slam the picture off are you trying to be rude brianna asked him or cant you help yourself im trying to get your attention well you have it do you have to do that when im talking to you since there seemed no way to avoid the confrontation he so obviously wanted brianna let her knitting rest in her lap is that better i needed to be alone i dont like being crowded i havent asked for an explanation grayson yes you have just not out loud impatience began to simmer so now youre reading my mind are you its not that difficult were sleeping together essentially living together and you feel im obliged to let you know what im doing is that what i feel he began to pace no she thought it was more of a prowlas a big cat might prowl behind cage bars are you going to sit there and try to tell me youre not mad it hardly matters what i tell you when you read my unspoken thoughts she linked her hands together rested them on the wool she would not fight with him she told herself if their time together was nearing an end she wouldnt let the last memories of it be of arguments and bad feelings grayson i might point out to you that i have a life of my own a business to run personal enjoyments i filled my day well enough so you dont give a damn whether im here or not it was his out wasnt it why did the idea infuriate him she only sighed you know it pleases me to have you here what do you want me to say that i worried perhaps i did for a time but youre a man grown and able to take care of yourself did i think it was unkind of you not to let me know youd be gone so long when its your habit to be here most evenings you know it was so its hardly worth me pointing it out to you now if that satisfies you im going to bed youre welcome to join me or go upstairs and sulk before she could rise he slapped both hands on either arm of her chair caging her in her eyes widened but stayed level on his why dont you shout at me he demanded throw something boot me out on my ass those things might make you feel better she said evenly but it isnt my job to make you feel better so thats it just shrug the whole thing off and come to bed for all you know i could have been with another woman for one trembling moment the heat flashed into her eyes matching the fury in his then she composed herself taking the knitting from her lap and setting it in the basket are you trying to make me angry yes damn it yes he jerked back from her spun away at least it would be a fair fight then theres no way to beat that iced serenity of yours then id be foolish to set aside such a formidable weapon wouldnt i she rose grayson im in love with you and when you think id use that love to trap you to change you then you insult me its for that you should apologize despising the creeping flow of guilt he looked back at her never in the whole of his life had another woman made him feel guilt he wondered if there was another person in existence who could with such calm reason cause him to feel so much the fool i figured youd find a way to get an im sorry out of me before it was over she stared at him a moment then saying nothing turned and walked into the adjoining bedroom christ gray scrubbed his hands over his face pressed his fingers against his closed eyes then dropped his hands you could only wallow in your own idiocy so long he decided im crazy he said stepping into the bedroom she said nothing only adjusted one of her windows to let in more of the cool fragrant night air i am sorry brie for all of it i was in a pisser of a mood this morning and just wanted to be alone she gave him no answer no encouragement only turned down the bedspread dont freeze me out thats the worst he stepped behind her laid a tentative hand on her hair im having trouble with the book it was lousy of me to take it out on you i dont expect you to adjust your moods to suit me you just dont expect he murmured its not good for you i know whats good for me she started to move away but he turned her around ignoring the rigid way she held herself he wrapped his arms around her you should have booted me out he murmured youre paid up through the month he pressed his face into her hair chuckled now youre being mean how was a woman supposed to keep up with his moods when she tried to push away he only cuddled her closer i had to get away from you he told her and his hand roamed up and down her back urging her spine to relax i had to prove i could get away from you dont you think i know that drawing back as far as he would permit she framed his face in her hands grayson i know youll be leaving soon and i wont pretend that doesnt leave a crack in my heart but itll hurt so much more for both of us if we spend these last days fighting over it or around it i figured it would be easier if you were mad if you tossed me out of your life easier for whom for me he rested his brow on hers and said what hed avoided saying for the last few days ill be leaving at the end of the month she said nothing found she could say nothing over the sudden ache in her chest i want to take some time before the tour starts she waited but he didnt ask as he once had for her to come with him to some tropical beach she nodded then lets enjoy the time we have before you go she turned her face so that her mouth met his gray laid her slowly onto the bed and when he loved her loved her tenderly chapter twentyone for the first time since brianna had opened her home to guests she wished them all to the devil she resented the intrusion on her privacy with gray though it shamed her she resented the time he spent closed in his room finishing the book that had brought him to her she fought the emotions did everything she could to keep them from showing as the days passed she assured herself that the sense of panic and unhappiness would fade her life was so very nearly what she wanted it to be so very nearly she might not have the husband and children shed always longed for but there was so much else to fullfill her it helped at least a little to count those blessings as she went about her daily routine she carried linens fresh off the line up the stairs since grays door was open she went inside here she set the linens aside it was hardly necessary to change his sheets since he hadnt slept in any bed but hers for days but the room needed a good dusting she decided since he was out of it his desk was an appalling mess to be sure she started there emptying his overflowing ashtray tidying books and papers hoping she knew to find some little snatch of the story he was writing what she found were torn envelopes unanswered correspondence and some scribbled notes on irish superstitions amused she read beware of speaking ill of fairies on friday because they are present and will work some evil if offended for a magpie to come to the door and look at you is a sure death sign and nothing can avert it a person who passes under a hempen rope will die a violent death well you surprise me brianna snooping blushing red she dropped the notepad stuck her hands behind her back oh wasnt it just like grayson thane she thought to come creeping up on a person i was not snooping i was dusting he sipped idly at the coffee hed gone to the kitchen to brew to his thinking hed never seen her quite so flummoxed you dont have a dust rag he pointed out feeling naked brianna wrapped dignity around her i was about to get one your desk is a pitiful mess and i was just straightening up you were reading my notes i was putting the notebook aside perhaps i glanced at the writing on it superstitions is all it is of evil and death evil and deaths my living grinning he crossed to her picked up the pad i like this one on hallowtidethats november first im aware of when hallowtide falls sure you are anyway on hallowtide the air being filled with the presence of the dead everything is a symbol of fate if on that date you call the name of a person from the outside and repeat it three times the result is fatal he grinned to himself wonder what the garda could charge you with its nonsense and gave her the chills its great nonsense i used that one he set the notebook down studied her her high color hadnt quite faded you know the trouble with technology he lifted one of his computer disks tapping it on his palm as he studied her with laughing eyes no balled up papers discarded by the frustrated writer that the curious can smooth out and read as if id do such a thing she flounced away to pick up her linens ive beds to make want to read some of it she paused halfway to the door looking back over her shoulder suspiciously of your book no of the local weather report of course of my book actually theres a section i could use a locals spin on to see if i got the rhythm of the dialogue down the atmosphere interactions oh well if i could help you id be glad brie youve been dying to get a look at the manuscript you could have asked i know better than that living with maggie she set the linens down again its worth your life to go in her shop to see a piece shes working on im a more eventempered sort with a few deft moves he booted his computer slipped in the appropriate disk its a pub scene local color and some character intros its the first time mcgee meets tullia tullia its gaelic right means peaceful lets see if i can find it he began flipping screens you dont speak gaelic do you i do yes both maggie and i learned from our gran he looked up stared at her son of a bitch it never even occured to me do you know how much time ive spent looking up words i just wanted a few tossed in here and there youd only to have asked he grunted too late now yeah here it is mcgees a burnedout cop with irish roots hes come to ireland to look into some old family history maybe find his balance and some answers about himself mostly he just wants to be left alone to regroup he was involved in a bust that went bad and holds himself responsible for the bystander death of a sixyearold kid how sad for him yeah hes got his problems tullia has plenty of her own shes a widow lost her husband and child in an accident that only she survived shes getting through it but carrying around a lot of baggage her husband wasnt any prize and there were times she wished him dead so shes guilty that he is and scarred because her child was taken from her like a punishment for her thoughts more or less anyway this scenes in the local pub only runs a few pages sit down now pay attention he leaned over her shoulder took her hand see these two buttons yes this one will page up this one will page down when you finished whats on the screen and want to move on push this one if you want to go back and look at something again push that one and brianna yes if you touch any of the other buttons ill have to cut all your fingers off being an eventempered sort thats right the disks are backed up but we wouldnt want to develop any bad habits he kissed the top of her head im going to go back downstairs check on the progress on your greenhouse if you find something that jars or just doesnt ring quite true you can make a note on the pad there all right already reading she waved him off go away then gray wandered downstairs and outside the six courses of local stone that would be the base for her greenhouse were nearly finished it didnt surprise him to see murphy setting stones in place himself i didnt know you were a mason as well as a farmer gray called out oh i do a bit of this a bit of that mind you dont make that mortar so loose this time he ordered the skinny teenager nearby heres my nephew tim macbride visiting from cork tim cant get enough of your country music from the states randy travis wynonna garth brooks all of them tim flashed a smile much like his uncles gray bent down lifted a new stone for murphy while he discussed the merits of country music with the boy before long he was helping to mix the mortar and making satisfying manly noises about the work with his companions youve a good pair of hands for a writer murphy observed i worked on a construction crew one summer mixing mortar and hauling it in wheelbarrows while the heat fried my brain its pleasant weather today satisfied with the progress murphy paused for a cigarette if it holds we may have this up for brie by another week another week gray mused was almost all he had its nice of you to take time from your own work to help her with this thats comhair murphy said easily community thats how we live here no one has to get by alone if theres family and neighbors theyll be three men or more here when its time to put up the frame and the glass and othersll come along if helps needed to build her benches and such by the end of it everyone will feel they have a piece of the place and brianna will be giving out cuttings and plants for everyones garden he blew out smoke it comes round you see thats comhair gray understood the concept it was very much what he had felt and for a moment envied in the village church during liams christening does it ever cramp your style that by accepting a favor youre obliged to do one you yanks chuckling murphy took a last drag then crushed the cigarette out on the stones knowing brianna he tucked the stub into his pocket rather than flicking it aside you always reckon in payments obliged isnt the word tis a security if youre needing a more solid term for it a knowing that youve only to reach out a hand and someone will help you along if you need it a knowing that youd do the same he turned to his nephew well tim lets clean up our tools we need to be getting back youll tell brie not to be after fiddling with these stones will you grayson they need to set sure illoh christ i forgot about her see you later he hurried back into the house a glance at the kitchen clock made him wince hed left her for more than an hour and she was he discovered exactly where hed left her takes you a while to read half a chapter however much his entrance surprised her she didnt jolt this time when she lifted her gaze from the screen to his face her eyes were wet that bad he smiled a little surprised to find himself nervous its wonderful she reached into her apron pocket for a tissue truly this part where tullias sitting alone in her garden thinking of her child it makes you feel her grief its not like shes a madeup person at all his second surprise was that he should experience embarrassment as far as praise went hers had been perfect well thats the idea youve a wonderful gift gray for making words into emotions i went a bit beyond the part you wanted me to read im sorry i got caught up in it im flattered he noted by the screen shed read more than a hundred pages youre enjoying it oh very much it has a different something she said unable to pinpoint it than your other books oh its moody as they always are and rich in detail and frightening the first murder the one at the ruins i thought my heart would stop when i was reading it and gory it was too gleefully so dont stop now he ruffled her hair dropped down on the bed well she linked her hands laid them on the edge of the desk as she thought through her words your humors there as well and your eye it misses nothing the scene in the pub ive walked into that countless times in my life i could see tim omalley behind the bar and murphy playing a tune hell like that you made him so handsome you think hell recognize himself oh i do yes i dont know how hell feel about being one of the suspects or the murderer if thats what youve done in the end she waited hopeful but he only shook his head you dont really think im going to tell you who done it do you well no she sighed and propped her chin on her fist as to murphy probably hell enjoy it and your affection for the village for the land here and the people shows in the little thingsthe family hitching a ride home from church in their sunday best the old man walking with his dog along the roadside in the rain the little girl dancing with her grandda in the pub its easy to write things down when theres so much to see its more than what you see with your eyes i mean she lifted her hands let them fall again she didnt have words as he did to juggle into the right meaning its the heart of it theres a deepness to the heart of it thats different from what ive read of your writings before the way mcgee fights that tug of war within himself over what he should do the way he wishes he could do nothing and knows he cant and tullia the way she bears her grief when its near to bending her in two and works to make her life what it needs to be again i cant explain it youre doing a pretty good job gray murmured it touches me i cant believe it was written right here in my home i dont think it could have been written anywhere else he rose then disappointing her by hitting buttons that jangled the screen shed hoped he let her read more oh youve changed the name of it she said when the title page came up final redemption i like it thats the theme of it is it the murders whats happened to mcgee and tullia before and what changes after they meet thats the way it worked out he hit another button bringing up the dedication page in all the books hed written it was only the second time hed dedicated one the first and only had been to arlene to brianna for gifts beyond price oh grayson her voice hitched over the tears rising in the back of her throat im honored ill start crying again she murmured and turned her face into his arm thank you so much theres a lot of me in this book brie he lifted her face hoping shed understand its something i can give you i know ill treasure it afraid shed spoil the moment with tears she ran her hands briskly over her hair youll want to get back to work im sure and ive whittled the day away she picked up her linens knowing shed weep the moment she was behind the first closed door shall i bring your tea up here when its time he tilted his head narrowed his eyes as he studied her he wondered if shed recognized herself in tullia the composure the quiet almost unshakable grace ill come down ive nearly done all i need to do for today in an hour then she went out closing the door behind her alone gray sat and stared for a long time at the brief dedication it was the laughter and the voices that drew gray when the hour was up toward the parlor rather than the kitchen briannas guests were gathered around the tea table sampling or filling plates brianna herself stood swaying gently from side to side to rock the baby sleeping on her shoulder my nephew she was explaining liam im minding him for an hour or two oh gray she beamed when she saw him look who i have here so i see crossing over gray peeked at the babys face his eyes were open and dreamy until they latched onto gray and stared owlishly he always looks at me as if he knows every sin i commited its intimidating gray moved to the tea table and had nearly decided on his choices when he noted brianna slipping from the room he caught up with her at near the kitchen door where are you going to put the baby down what for maggie said hed be wanting a nap maggies not here he took liam himself and we never get to play with him to amuse himself he made faces at the baby wheres maggie shes fired up her furnace rogan had to run into the gallery to handle some problem so she came dashing down here just a little bit ago with a laugh she bent her head close to grays i thought it would never happen now i have you all to myself she murmured she straightened at the knock on the door keep his head supported mind she said as she went to answer i know how to hold a baby women he said to liam they dont think we can do anything they all think youre hot stuff right now boyo but just wait in a few years theyll figure your purpose in life is to fix small electrical appliances and kill bugs since no one was looking he bent his head to press a light kiss on liams mouth and watched it curve thats the way why dont we go in the kitchen and he broke off at briannas startled exclamation shifting liam more securely in the crook of his arm he hurried back down the hallway carstairs stood at the threshold a tan bowler in his hands a friendly smile on his face grayson how nice to see you again i wasnt certain youd still be here and whats this its a baby gray said shortly of course it is carstairs tickled liams chin and made foolish noises handsome lad i must say he favors you a bit brianna around the mouth hes my sisters child and what might you be doing here at blackthorn mr carstairs just passing through as it were id told iris so much about the cottage and the countryside she wanted to see it for herself shes in the car he gestured to the bentley parked at the garden gate actually wed hoped you might have a room for us for the night she goggled at him you want to stay here ive bragged perhaps unwisely about your cooking he leaned forward confidentially im afraid iris was a bit irked at first shes quite a cook herself you know she wants to see if i was exaggerating mr carstairs youre a shameless man that may be my dear he said twinkling that may be she huffed sighed well dont leave the poor woman sitting in the car bring her in for tea cant wait to meet her gray said jiggling the baby she says the same of you shes quite impressed that you could lift my wallet without me having a clue i used to be much quicker he shook his head in regret but then i used to be much younger shall i bring in our luggage brianna i have a room its smaller than what you had last im sure its charming absolutely charming he strolled off to fetch his wife can you beat it brianna said under her breath i dont know whether to laugh or hide the silver if i had any silver he likes you too much to steal from you so gray mused this is the famous iris the photograph from the pinched wallet had been a good likeness brianna discovered iris wore a flowered dress that ruffled in the breeze around excellent legs to briannas eye iris had used the time in the car to freshen her hair and makeup and so looked fresh and remarkably pretty as she strolled up the walk beside her grinning husband oh miss concannon brianna i do hope i can call you brianna i think of you as brianna of course after hearing so much about you and your charming inn her voice was smooth cultured despite the fact that her words all but tumbled over each other to get out before brianna could respond iris flung out both hands gripped hers and barrelled on youre every bit as lovely as johnny told me how kind of you how sweet to find room for us when weve dropped so unexpectedly on your doorstep and your garden my dear i must tell you im dizzy with admiration your dahlias i never have a bit of luck with them myself and your roses magnificent you really must tell me your secret do you talk to them i chatter at mine day and night but i never get blooms like that well i and youre grayson iris simply rolled over briannas response and turned to him she freed one of briannas hands so that she could grip grays what a clever clever young man you are and so handsome too why you look just like a film star ive read all your books every one frighten me to death they do but i cant put them down wherever do you come up with such thrilling ideas ive been so anxious to meet both of you she continued holding on to each of them badgering poor johnny to death you know and now here we are there was a pause while iris beamed at both of them yes brianna discovered she could find little else to say here you are ah please come in i hope you had a pleasant trip oh i adore traveling dont you and to think with all the racketing around johnny and i did in our misspent youth we never came to this part of the world its pretty as a postcard isnt it johnny it is my sweet it certainly is oh what a lovely home just charming iris kept her hand firmly on briannas as she glanced around im sure no one could be anything but comfortable here brianna gave gray a helpless look but he only shrugged i hope you will be theres tea in the parlor if you like or i can show you your room first would you do that well put our bags away shall we johnny then perhaps we can all have a nice chat iris exclaimed over the stairway as they climbed it the upstairs hall the room brianna escorted them into wasnt the bedspread charming the lace curtains lovely the view from the window superb in short order brianna found herself in the kitchen brewing another pot of tea while her new guests sat at the table making themselves at home iris happily bounced liam on her lap hell of a team arent they gray murmured helping by getting out cups and plates she makes me dizzy brianna whispered but its impossible not to like her exactly youd never believe there was an unscrupulous thought in her head everyones favorite aunt or amusing neighbor maybe you should hide that silver after all hush brianna turned away to carry plates to the table carstairs immediately helped himself to the bread and jam i do hope youll join us iris began choosing a scone dipping into the clotted cream johnny dear we do want to get business over with dont we so distressing to have business clouding the air business brianna took liam again settled him on her shoulder unfinished business carstairs dabbed his mouth with a napkin i say brianna this bread is tasty have a bit do iris johnny rhapsodized over your cooking im afraid i got a teeny bit jealous im a fair cook myself you know a brilliant cook a loyal carstairs corrected snatching his wifes hand and kissing it lavishly a magnificent cook oh johnny you do go on she giggled girlishly before swatting him aside then she pursed her lips and blew him several quick kisses the byplay had gray wiggling his brows at brianna but i can see why he was so taken with the table you set brianna she nibbled delicately on her scone we must find time to exchange some recipes while were here my speciality is a chicken and oyster dish and if i do say so myself its rather tasty the trick is to use a really good wine a dry white you see and a hint of tarragon but there i go running on again and we havent dealt with our business she reached for another scone gesturing to the empty chairs do sit down wont you so much cozier to talk business over tea agreeably gray sat and began to fill his plate want me to take the kid he asked brianna no ive got him she sat with liam resting comfortably in the curve of her arm what an angel iris cooed and youve such an easy way with babies johnny and i always regretted not having any ourselves but then we were always off having an adventure so our lives were full adventures brianna repeated an interesting term she thought for bilking we were a naughty pair iris laughed and the gleam in her eyes said she understood briannas sentiments exactly but what fun we had it wouldnt be quite right to say we were sorry for it when we enjoyed it so much but then one does get older one does carstairs agreed and one sometimes loses the edge he sent gray a mild look ten years ago lad youd never have pinched my wallet dont bet on it gray sipped at his tea i was even better ten years ago carstairs tossed back his head and laughed didnt i tell you he was a pistol iris oh i wish youd have seen him button me down in wales my heart i was filled with admiration i hope youll consider returning the wallet to me grayson at least the photographs the identification is easily replaced but im quite sentimental over the photos and of course the cash grays smile was quick and wolfish you still owe me a hundred pounds johnny carstairs cleared his throat naturally unquestionably i only took yours you see to make it seem like a burglary naturally gray agreed unquestionably i believe we discussed compensation in wales before you had to leave so unexpectedly i do apologize youd pinned me down you see and i didnt feel comfortable coming to a firm agreement without consulting iris first were strong advocates of full partnership iris put in indeed he gave his wifes hand an affectionate pat i can truthfully say that all our decisions are a matter of teamwork we feel that combined with deep affection is why weve had fortythree successful years together and of course a good sex life iris said comfortably smiling when brianna choked over her tea marriage would be rather dull otherwise dont you think yes im sure youre right this time brianna cleared her throat i think i understand why youve come and i appreciate it its good to clear the air over it we did want to apologize in person for any distress weve caused you and i wanted to add my sympathies over my johnnys clumsy and completely illadvised search of your lovely home she cut a stern look at her husband it lacked all finesse johnny it did indeed it did he bowed his head im thoroughly ashamed brianna wasnt entirely certain of that but shook her head well there was no real harm done i suppose no harm iris took up the gauntlet brianna my dear girl im sure you were furious and rightly so and distressed beyond belief it made her cry grayson embarrassed now brianna stared into her teacup its done i can only imagine how you must have felt iriss voice had softened johnny knows how i feel about my things why if i came home and found everything topsyturvy id be devastated simply devastated i only hope you can forgive him for the regrettable impulse and for thinking like a man i do i have i understand he was under a great deal of pressure and brianna broke off lifting her head when she realized she was defending the man who had cheated her father and invaded her home what a kind heart you have iris streamed into the breech now if we could touch on this uncomfortable business of the stock certificate one last time first let me say it was very broadminded very patient of you not to contact the authorities after wales gray said youd be back clever boy iris murmured and i didnt see any point in it with a sigh brianna picked up a finger of bread and nibbled it was long ago and the money my father lost was his to lose knowing the circumstances was enough to satisfy me you see iris its just as i told you johnny her voice was suddenly commanding the look that passed between them held until carstairs let out a long breath and dropped his gaze yes iris of course youre quite right quite right rallying he reached into the inside pocket of his jacket drew out an envelope iris and i have discussed this at length and we would very much like to settle the matter to everyones satisfaction with our apologies dear he said handing brianna the envelope and our best wishes uneasy she lifted the flap her heart careened to her stomach and up to her throat its money cash money a check would make bookkeeping difficult carstairs explained and then theres the taxes that would be involved a cash transaction saves us both from that inconvenience its ten thousand pounds irish pounds oh but i couldnt yes you can gray interrupted it isnt right she started to hand the envelope back to carstairs his eyes lit up briefly his fingers reached out and his wife swatted them away your young man is correct in the matter brianna this is quite right for everyone involved you neednt worry that the money will make an appreciable difference in our lives we do quite well it would ease my mind and my heart if youd accept it and she added return the certificate to us rogan has it brianna said no i got it back from him gray rose slipped into briannas rooms take the money brianna iris said gently put it away now in your apron pocket id consider it a great favor i dont understand you i dont suppose you do johnny and i dont regret the way we lived we enjoyed every minute of it but a little insurance toward redemption wouldnt hurt she smiled reached over to squeeze briannas hand id look on it as a kindness both of us would isnt that right johnny he gave the envelope one last longing look yes dear gray walked back in holding the certificate yours i believe yes yes indeed eager now carstairs took the paper adjusting his glasses he peered at it iris he said with pride as he tilted the certificate for her to study as well we did superior work didnt we absolutely flawless we did johnny dear we certainly did chapter twentytwo i have never in the whole of my life had a finer moment of satisfaction all but purring maggie stretched out in the passenger seat of briannas car she sent one last glance behind at their mothers house as her sister pulled into the street gloating isnt becoming margaret mary becoming or not im enjoying it she shifted reaching out to put a rattle in liams waving hand as he sat snug in his safety seat in the back did you see her face brie oh did you see it i did her dignity slipped just a moment and a grin snuck through at least you had the good sense not to rub her nose in it that was the bargain wed tell her only that the money came from an investment da made before he died one that recently paid off and i would resist no matter how it pained me pointing out that she didnt deserve her third of it as she never believed in him the third of the money was rightfully hers and that should be the end of it im not going to badger you about it im much too busy gloating savoring maggie hummed a little tell me what are your plans for yours ive some ideas for improvements on the cottage the attic room for one which started the whole business as liam cheerfully flung the first one aside maggie pulled out another rattle i thought we were going to galway to shop we are grayson had badgered her into the idea and had all but booted her out of her own front door she smiled now thinking of it ive a mind to buy me one of those professional food processors the ones they use in restaurants and on the cookery shows that would have pleased da very much maggies grin softened into a smile it is like a gift from him you know im thinking of it that way it seems right if i do what about you ill shovel some into the glass house the rest goes away for liam i think da would have wanted it idly she ran her fingers over the dashboard its a nice car youve got here brie it is she laughed and told herself shed have to thank gray for pushing her out of the house for the day imagine me driving to galway without worrying somethings going to fall off its so like gray to give outrageous gifts and make it seem natural thats the truth the man hands me a diamond pin as cheerfully as if its a clutch of posies he has a lovely generous heart he does speaking of him whats he up to well hes either working or being entertained by the carstairs what characters do you know rogan tells me when they went to the gallery they tried to charm him into selling them the antique table in the upstairs sitting room doesnt surprise me in the least shes nearly talked me into buying sight unseen a lamp she says will be perfect for my parlor a fine discount shell give me too brianna chuckled ill miss them when they leave tomorrow i have a feeling theyll be back she paused when does gray go probably next week brianna kept her eyes on the road and her voice even hes doing no more than tinkering on the book now from what i can tell and do you think hell be back i hope he will but i wont count on it i cant have you asked him to stay i cant do that either no maggie murmured you couldnt nor could i under the same circumstances still she thought hes a bloody fool if he leaves would you like to close up the cottage for a few weeks or have mrs omalley look after it you could come to dublin or use the villa no though its sweet of you to think of it ill be happier at home that was probably true maggie thought and didnt argue well if you change your mind youve only to say making a determined effort to lighten the mood she turned toward her sister what do you think brie lets buy something foolish when we get to shop street the first thing that strikes our fancy something useless and expensive one of those trinkets that we used to look at with our noses pressed up to a shop window when da would bring us like the little dolls with the pretty costumes or the jewelry cases with the ballerinas that spun around on top oh i think we can find something a little more suited to our ages but yes thats the idea all right then well do it it was because theyd talked about their father that memories swarmed brianna after they reached galway with the car parked they joined the pedestrian traffic the shoppers the tourists the children she saw a young girl laughing as she rode her fathers shoulders he used to do that she remembered hed give her and maggie turns up and sometimes hed run so that theyd bounce squealing with pleasure or hed keep their hands firmly tucked in his while they wandered spinning them stories while they jostled along the crowded streets when our ship comes in brianna my love ill buy you pretty dresses like they have in that window there one day well travel up here to galway city with coins leaking out of our pocket just you wait darling and though shed known even then they were stories just dreaming it hadnt diminished the pleasure of the seeing the smelling the listening nor did the memories spoil it now the color and movement of shop street made her smile as it always did she enjoyed the voices that cut through the lilting irishthe twangs and drawls of the americans the guttural german the impatient french she could smell a hint of galway bay that carried on the breeze and the sizzling grease from a nearby pub there maggie steered the stroller closer to a shop window thats perfect brianna maneuvered through the crowd until she could look over maggies shoulder what is that great fat cow there just what i want you want a cow looks like porcelain maggie mused eyeing the glossy blackandwhite body and foolishly grinning bovine face i bet its frightfully priced even better im having it lets go in but whatll you do with it give it to rogan of course and see that he puts it in that stuffy dublin office of his oh i hope it weighs a ton it did so they arranged to leave it with the clerk while they completed the rest of their shopping it wasnt until theyd eaten lunch and brianna had studied the pros and cons of half a dozen food processors that she found her own bit of foolishness the fairies were made of painted bronze and danced on wires hung from a copper rod at a flick of briannas fingers they twirled their wings beating together musically ill hang it outside my bedroom window itll make me think of all the fairy stories da used to tell us its perfect maggie slipped an arm around briannas waist no dont look at the price she said when brianna started to reach for the little tag thats part of it all whatever it costs its the right choice go buy your trinket then well figure out how to get mine to the car in the end they decided that maggie would wait at the shop with the cow with liam and the rest of their bags while brianna drove the car around in a breezy mood she strolled back to the car park she would she thought hang her fairy dance as soon as she got home and then she would play with her fine new kitchen toy she was thinking how delightful it would be to create a salmon mousse or to finely dice mushrooms with such a precision instrument humming she slipped behind the wheel turned the ignition perhaps there was a dish she could try to add to the grilled fish she intended to make for dinner what would gray enjoy especially she wondered as she steered toward the exit to pay her fee colcannon perhaps and a gooseberry fool for dessertif she could find enough ripe gooseberries she thought of the berries season as those first days of june but gray would be gone then she clamped down on the twinge around her heart well it was nearly june in any case she told herself and started to drive out of the lot and she wanted gray to have her special dessert before he went away brianna heard the shout as she started into her turn startled she jerked her head she only had time to suck in a breath for the scream as a car taking the turn too sharp and on the wrong side crashed into hers she heard the screech of metal rending of glass shattering then she heard nothing at all so briannas gone shopping iris commented as she joined gray in the kitchen thats lovely for her nothing puts a woman in a better frame of mind that a good shopping binge he couldnt imagine practical brianna binging on anything she went off to galway with her sister i told her we could manage if she didnt make it home by tea feeling a little proprietary about the kitchen gray heaped the food brianna had prepared earlier onto platters its only the three of us tonight anyway well be cozy right here iris set the teapot in its cozy on the table you were right to convince her to take a day for herself with her sister i nearly had to drag her out to the carshes so tied to this place deep fertile roots its why she blooms just like her flowers out there never in my life have i seen such gardens as hers why just this morning i wasah there you are johnny just in time i had the most invigorating walk carstairs hung his hat on a peg then rubbed his hands together do you know my dear they still cut their own turf you dont say so i do indeed i found the bog and there were stacks of it drying in the wind and sun it was just like stepping back a century he gave his wife a peck on the cheek before turning his attention to the table ah what have we here wash your hands johnny and well have a nice tea ill pour out grayson you just sit enjoying them and their way with each other gray obliged her iris i hope youre not offended if i ask you something dear boy you can ask whatever you like do you miss it she didnt pretend to misunderstand as she passed him the sugar i do from time to time i do that life on the edge sort of feeling so invigorating she poured her husbands cup then her own do you when gray only lifted a brow she chuckled one recognizes one no gray said after a pause i dont miss it well youd have retired quite early so you wouldnt have the same sort of emotional attachment or perhaps you do and thats why youve never used any of your prior experience so to speak in your books shrugging he lifted his cup maybe i just dont see the point in looking back ive always felt you never have a really clear view of whats coming up if you dont glance over your shoulder now and again i like surprises if tomorrows already figured out why bother with it the surprise comes because tomorrows never quite what you thought it would be but youre young she said giving him a motherly smile youll learn that for yourself do you use a map when you travel sure well thats it you see past present future all mapped out with her bottom lip clamped between her teeth she measured out a stingy quarter spoon of sugar for her own tea you may plan a route now some people stick to it no matter what no deviations to explore some little road no unscheduled stops to enjoy a particularly nice sunset a pity for them she mused and oh how they complain when theyre forced to detour but most of us like a little adventure along the way that side road having a clear view of the ultimate destination doesnt have to keep one from enjoying the ride here you are johnny dear your teas just poured bless you iris and with just a drop of cream the way you like it id be lost without her carstairs said to gray oh it appears were having company gray looked toward the kitchen door as murphy opened it con darted in ahead sat at grays feet laid his head in grays lap even as gray lifted a hand to stroke the dogs ears his smile of greeting faded what is it he found himself springing to his feet rattling the cups on the table murphys face was too set his eyes too dark whats happened theres been an accident briannas been hurt what do you mean shes hurt he demanded over iriss murmur of distress maggie called me there was an accident when brie was driving from the car park to the shop where maggie and the baby were waiting murphy took off his cap a matter of habit then squeezed his fingers on the brim ill take you up to galway shes in the hospital there hospital standing there gray felt physically felt the blood draining out of him how bad how bad is it maggie wasnt sure she didnt think it was too bad but she was waiting to hear ill take you to galway grayson i thought wed use your car itd be faster i need the keys his brain felt dull useless i have to get the keys dont let him drive iris said when gray streaked from the room no maam i wont be letting him do that murphy didnt have to argue he simply took the keys from grays hand and got behind the wheel since gray said nothing murphy concentrated on finessing all the speed the mercedes was built for another time perhaps he would have appreciated the response the sleek car offered for now he simply used it for gray the trip was endless the glorious scenery of the west rushed by but they seemed to make no progress it was like animation he thought dimly run over and over again cel by cel while he could do nothing but sit and wait she wouldnt have gone if he hadnt bullied her into it but hed pressured her to go out to take a day so shed gone to galway and now she was christ he didnt know what she was how she was and couldnt bear to imagine it i should have gone with her with the car cruising near ninety murphy didnt bother to glance over youll make yourself sick thinking that way were nearly there now then well see i bought her the fucking car true enough the man didnt need sympathy murphy thought but practicality and you werent driving the one who hit it to my way of thinking if shed been in that rusted bucket she had before things would be worse we dont know how bad they are we soon will so hang on to yourself until we do he slipped off an exit slowed and began to maneuver through denser traffic its likely shes fine and will give us grief for driving all this way he turned into the hospital car park theyd no more climbed out and started for the doors when they spotted rogan walking the baby brianna it was all gray could say shes all right they want to keep her through the night at least but shes all right the feeling went out of grays legs so that he took rogans arm as much for balance as for emphasis where where is she theyve just put her in a room on the sixth floor maggies with her yet i brought her mother and lottie along with me theyre up there as well shes he broke off shifting to block gray from rushing the entrance shes banged up and i think shes hurting more than shes letting on but the doctor told us shes very lucky some bruises from the seat belt which kept it from being worse her shoulders wrenched and thats causing the most pain shes a knot on her head and some cuts they want her kept quiet for twentyfour hours i need to see her i know that rogan stood his ground but she doesnt need to see how upset you are shes one wholl take that to heart and worry over it okay fighting for balance gray pressed his fingers to his eyes all right well keep it calm but i have to see her for myself ill go up with you murphy said and led the way in keeping his own counsel he said nothing as they waited for the elevator why are they all here gray demanded when the elevator opened why are they here maggie her mother rogan lottie if shes all right theyre family murphy pushed the button for six where else would they be now about three years past i broke an arm and cracked my head playing football i couldnt get rid of one sister but another would be at the door my mother stayed for two weeks no matter what i did to boost her on her way and to tell the truth i was glad to have them fussing around me dont go off in a mad rush murphy warned as the elevator stopped irish nurses run a tight ship and heres lottie gracious you must have flown all the way she came forward her smile all reassurance shes doing fine theyre taking grand care of her rogan arranged for her to have a private room so shed have quiet and privacy shes already fretting about going home but with the concussion theyll want to keep an eye on her concussion a mild one really she soothed leading them down the hallway it doesnt seem she was unconscious for more than a few moments and she was lucid enough to tell the man at the car park where maggie was waiting look here brianna youve more visitors already all gray could see was brianna white against white sheets oh gray murphy you shouldnt have come all this way ill be going home shortly youll not maggies voice was firm youre staying the night brianna started to turn her head but the throbbing made her think better of it i dont want to stay the night bumps and bruises is all it is oh gray the car im so sorry about the car the side of its all bent in and the headlamps smashed and shut up will you and let me look at you he took her hand held on she was pale and a bruise had bloomed along her cheekbone above it on the brow side of the temple was a neat white bandage beneath the shapeless hospital gown he could see more bandages at her shoulder because his hand began to tremble he drew it away jammed it in his pocket youre hurting i can see it in your eyes my head aches she smiled weakly lifting a finger to the bandage i feel a bit like ive been run over by an entire rugby team they should give you something they will if i need it shes skittish of needles murphy said and leaned over to kiss her lightly his own relief at seeing her whole showed itself in a wide cheeky grin i remember hearing you howl brianna concannon when i was in dr hogans waiting room and you were getting a shot and im not ashamed of it horrible things needles i dont want them poking me more than they already have i want to go home youll stay just where you are maeve spoke from a chair beneath the window its little enough to have a needle or two after the fright youve given us mother its hardly briannas fault that some idiot yank couldnt remember which side of the road to drive on maggies teeth clenched at the thought of it and they with barely a scratch between them you mustnt be so hard on them it was a mistake and all but frightened them to death the drumming in briannas head increased at the idea of an argument ill stay if i must but if i could just ask the doctor again youll leave the doctor be and rest as he told you maeve pushed herself to her feet and theres no rest with all these people fussing around margaret mary its time you took your baby home i dont want brie to be alone here maggie began im staying gray turned met maeves gaze steadily im staying with her she jerked a shoulder sure its no business of mine what you do we missed our tea she said lottie and i will have something downstairs while rogan arranges to have us taken home do as youre told here brianna and dont make a fuss she leaned over a bit stiffly and kissed briannas uninjured cheek you were never a fast healer so i dont expect this time to be any different her fingers rested for just an instant where her lips had then she turned and hurried out calling lottie to follow she said two rosaries on the drive here lottie murmured rest yourself after a parting kiss she trailed after meave well maggie let out a long breath i think i can trust grayson to see that you behave yourself ill find rogan and see how well deal with getting them both home again ill come back before we go in case grayson needs help ill go with you maggie murphy patted briannas sheetdraped knee if they come to poke you just turn your head away and close your eyes thats what i do she chuckled and when the room emptied looked up at gray i wish youd sit down i know youre upset im fine he was afraid if he sat hed go one better and just slide bonelessly to the floor id like to know what happened if youre up to telling me it was all so fast indulging the discomfort and fatigue she closed her eyes a moment wed bought too much to carry and i was going to fetch the car and drive it around to the shop where maggie was waiting just as i pulled out of the car park i heard someone shout it was the attendant hed seen the other car coming for mine there was nothing anyone could do then there wasnt time it hit on the side she started to shift and her shoulder twanged in protest they were going to tow the car away i cant remember where it doesnt matter well take care of it later you hit your head gently he reached down but kept his fingertips a breath away from the bandage i must have for the next thing i remember there was a crowd around and the american woman was crying and asking me if i was all right her husband had already gone to call an ambulance i was fuddled i think i asked that somebody get my sister and then the three of usmaggie the baby and mewere riding off in an ambulance she didnt add that there had been a great deal of blood enough to terrify her until the medical attendant had staunched the flow im sorry maggie wasnt able to tell you more when she called if shed waited until the doctor had finished looking me over shed have saved you a lot of worry id have worried anyway i donti cant he shut his eyes and struggled to find the words its hard for me to handle the idea of you being hurt the reality of it is even tougher its just bruises and bumps and a concussion a pulled shoulder for both of their sakes he yanked himself back tell me is it truth or myth about not falling asleep with a concussion because you might not wake up its a myth she smiled again but im thinking seriously of staying awake for a day or two just in case then youll want company ill love company i think id go mad lying in this bed alone with nothing to do and no one to see hows this careful not to jar her he sat on the side of the bed the food probably sucks here its hospital law in every developed country ill go out hunt us up some burgers and chips well have dinner together id like that and if they come in and try to give you a shot ill beat them up i wouldnt mind if you did would you do something else for me name it would you call mrs omalley ive haddock waiting to be grilled for dinner i know murphy will see to con but the carstairs need to be served and theres more guests coming tomorrow gray lifted her hand to his lips then rested his brow on it dont worry about it let me take care of you it was the first time in his life hed ever made the request chapter twentythree by the time gray got back with dinner briannas hospital room resembled her garden sprays of roses and freesia spears of lupine and lilies blooms of cheerful daisies and carnations banked her window filled the table beside the bed gray shifted the enormous bouquet he held so that he could see over it and shook his head looks like these are superfluous oh no they arent theyre lovely such a fuss really for a bump on the head she held the bouquet in her uninjured arm much like she held a child then buried her face in it im enjoying it maggie and rogan brought those and murphy those and the last ones there were sent up from the carstairs wasnt that sweet of them they were really worried he set down the large paper bag he held im to tell you theyre going to stay over another night maybe two depending on when you get out of here thats fine of course and ill be out tomorrow if i have to climb through the window she shot a wistful look at the bag did you really bring dinner i did managed to sneak it past the big eagleeyed nurse out there ah mrs mannion terrifying isnt she scares me he pulled a chair close to the bed then sat to dig into the bag bon appetit he said handing her a burger oh here let me take those he rose again to lift the bouquet from her arm i guess they need water huh here you eat he pulled out a bag of chips for her ill go find a vase when he left again she tried to shift to see what else was in the bag hed set on the floor but the shoulder made movement awkward settling back again she nibbled on the burger and tried not to pout the sound of footsteps returning had her pasting a smile on her face where do you want them gray asked oh on that little table over there yes thats lovely your dinnerll be cold gray he only grunted then sitting again took his own share of the meal from the bag feeling any better i dont feel nearly bad enough to be pampered this way but im glad you stayed to have dinner with me only the beginning honey he winked and with the halfeaten burger in one hand reached into the bag oh graya nightgown a real nightgown it was plain white and cotton and all but brought tears of gratitude to her eyes i cant tell you how much i appreciate that this awful thing they put on you ill help you change after dinner theres more slippers too oh a hairbrush thank god actually i cant take credit for all this it was maggies idea bless her and you she said your blouse was ruined bloody he remembered shed told him and took a moment to steady himself well take care of that tomorrow if they spring you now what else do we have here toothbrush a little bottle of that cream you use all the time almost forgot the drinks he handed her a paper cup topped with plastic with a hole for the straw an excellent vintage im told you thought of everything absolutely even the entertainment oh a book a romance novel you have several on your shelf at the cottage i like them she didnt have the heart to tell him the headache would make reading impossible you went to a lot of trouble just a quick shopping spree try to eat a little more dutifully she bit into a chip when you get home will you thank mrs omalley for me and tell her please not to bother with the wash im not going back until you go but you cant stay here all night sure i can gray polished off the burger balled the wrapper and tossed it into the waste can ive got a plan grayson you need to go home get some rest heres the plan he said ignoring her after visiting hours ill hide out in the bathroom until things settle down they probably make a sweep so ill wait until they come in and check on you thats absurd no itll work then the lights go off and youre all tucked in thats when i come out and sit in the dark for the rest of the night grayson im not on my deathbed i want you to go home cant do it and we wont sit in the dark with a smug grin he pulled his last purchase from the bag see this its a book light the kind you clip on so you dont disturb your bed partner if you want to read late amazed she shook her head youve lost your mind on the contrary im extremely clever this way i wont be at the cottage worrying you wont be here alone and miserable ill read to you until youre tired read to me she repeated in a murmur youre going to read to me sure cant have you trying to focus on this little print with a concussion can we no she knew nothing absolutely nothing in her life had ever touched her more i should make you go but i so very much want you to stay that makes two of us you know this sounded pretty good from the back cover copy a deadly alliance he read katrinashe would never be tamed the fieryhaired beauty with the face of a goddess and the soul of a warrior would risk everything to avenge the murder of her father even wed and bed her fiercest enemy he lifted a brow hell of a gal that katrina and the heros no slouch either ianhe would never surrender the bold and battlescarred highland chief known as the dark lord would fight friend and foe to protect his land and his woman sworn enemies sworn lovers they form an alliance that sweeps them toward destiny and into passion he flipped the book over to the front cover reaching idly for a chip pretty good huh and a finelooking couple they are too see it takes place in scotland twelfth century katrinas the only child of this widowed laird hes let her run pretty wild so she does a lot of guy stuff swordplay and archery hunting then theres this evil plot and hes murdered which makes her the laird and prey for the vicious and slightly insane villain but our katrinas no doormat brianna smiled reached for grays hand youve read it i paged through it when i was waiting to pay for it theres this incredibly erotic scene on page two fiftyone well well work our way up to that theyre probably going to come in and check your blood pressure and we dont want it elevated better get rid of the evidence here too he gathered up the wrappings from the smuggled dinner hed barely hidden them in the bag when the door opened nurse mannion big as a halfback bustled in visiting hours are nearly over mr thane yes maam now miss concannon how are we doing any dizziness nausea blurred vision no not at all im feeling fine really in fact i was wondering if thats good thats good nurse mannion easily overroad the expected request to leave as she made notes on the chart at the foot of the bed you should try to sleep well be checking on you through the night every three hours still moving briskly she set a tray on the table beside the bed brianna only had to take one look to go pale whats that i told you i feel fine i dont need a shot i dont want one grayson i ah one steely glance from nurse mannion had him fumbling in the role of hero its not a shot we just need to draw a little blood what for abandoning any pretense of dignity brianna cringed back i lost plenty lake some of that no nonsense now give me your arm brie look here gray linked his fingers with hers look at me did i ever tell you about the first time i went to mexico i hooked up with some people and went out on their boat this was in the gulf it was really beautiful balmy air crystal blue seas we saw this little barracuda swimming along the port side out of the corner of his eye he saw nurse mannion slide the needle under briannas skin and his stomach turned anyway anyway he said speaking quickly one of the guys went to get his camera he comes back leans over the rail and the mama barracuda jumps right up out of the water it was like freeze frame she looked right at the lens of the camera and smiled with all those teeth like a pose then she plopped back into the water got her baby and they swam away youre making it up gods truth he said lying desperately he got the picture too i think he sold it to national geographic or maybe it was the enquirer last i heard he was still out in the gulf of mexico hoping to repeat the experience thats done the nurse patted a bandage in the crook of briannas elbow your dinners on its way miss if you have room for it after your hamburger ah no thank you just the same i think ill just rest now five minutes mr thane grayson scratched his chin when the door swung shut behind her guess we didnt quite pull that off now brianna did pout you said youd beat them up if they came in with needles shes a lot bigger than me he leaned over kissed her lightly poor brie she tapped a finger on the book that lay on the bed beside her ian would never have backed down well hell look how hes built he could wrestle a horse ill never qualify for dark lord ill take you just the same grinning barracudas she said and laughed how do you think of such things talent sheer talent he went to the door peeked out dont see her im going to turn off the light duck into the bathroom well give it ten minutes he read to her for two hours taking her through katrinas and ians perilous and romantic adventures by the tiny light of the book lamp now and again his hand would reach out and brush over hers lingering over the moment of contact she knew she would always remember the sound of his voice the way he slipped into a scottish burr for the dialogue to amuse her and the way he looked she thought the way his face was lit by the small bulb so that his eyes were dark his cheekbones shadowed her hero she thought now and always closing her eyes brianna let the words he read drift over her youre mine ian swept her into his arms strong arms that trembled from the need that gripped him by law and by right youre mine and i am pledged to you katrina from this day from this hour and are you mine ian fearlessly she speared her fingers into his hair drew him closer are you mine dark lord no one has ever loved you more than i he swore it no one ever will brianna fell asleep wishing the words gray read could be his own gray watched her knowing from the slow steady sound of her breathing that shed drifted off he indulged himself then and buried his face in his hands keep it light hed promised himself hed keep it light and the strain was catching up with him she wasnt badly hurt but no matter how often he reminded himself of that he couldnt shake the bonedeep terror that had gripped him from the moment murphy had stepped into the kitchen he didnt want her in a hospital bruised and bandaged he never wanted to think of her hurt in any way and now he would always remember it he would always know that something could happen to her that she might not be as he wanted her always to be humming in her kitchen or babying her flowers it infuriated him that he would have this picture of her to carry with all the others and it infuriated him all the more that hed come to care so much he knew those pictures wouldnt fade as hundreds of other memories had hed remember brianna and that tie would make it difficult to leave and necessary to do so quickly he brooded over it as he waited for the night to pass each time a nurse would come to check brianna he listened to their murmured questions her sleepy responses once when he came back out she called for him softly go back to sleep he brushed the hair away from her brow its not morning yet grayson drifting again she reached for his hand youre still here yeah he looked down at her frowned im still here when she awoke again it was light forgetting she started to sit up and the dull ache in her shoulder jarred her memory more annoyed now than distressed she touched her fingertips to the bandage on her head and looked around for gray she hoped hed found some empty bed or waiting room couch to sleep on she smiled at his flowers and wished shed asked him to put them closer so that she could touch them as well warily she tugged out the bodice of her nightgown bit her lip there was a rainbow of bruises down her breastbone and torso where the seat belt had secured her seeing them she was grateful gray had helped her change into the nightgown in the dark it wasnt fair she thought it wasnt right that she should look so battered for the last few days they had together she wanted to be beautiful for him good morning miss concannon so youre awake a nurse breezed in all smiles and youth and blooming health brianna wanted to hate her i am yes when will the doctor come to release me oh hell be making his rounds soon dont worry nurse mannion said you passed a peaceful night as she spoke she strapped a blood pressure cuff on briannas arm stuck a thermometer under her tongue no dizziness then good good she said when brianna shook her head she checked the blood pressure guage nodded slipped the thermometer back out and nodded again at the results well youre doing fine then arent you im ready to go home im sure youre anxious the nurse made notes on the chart your sisters called already this morning and a mr biggs an american he said he was the one who hit your car yes we reassured them both that youre resting comfortably the shoulder paining you a bit you can have something for that now she said reading the chart i dont want a shot oral she smiled and your breakfast is coming oh nurse mannion said youd need two trays one for mr thane obviously enjoying the joke she glanced toward the bathroom ill be leaving in just a moment mr thane and you can come out she says hes a most handsome man the nurse murmured to brianna with the devils own smile he is lucky you ill get you something for the pain when the door closed again gray stepped out of the bathroom scowled what does that woman have radar were you really in there oh gray i thought youd found a place to sleep have you been up all night im used to being up all night hey you look better he came closer his scowl fading into a look of sheer relief you really look better i dont want to think of how i look and you look tired i dont feel tired now starving he said pressing a hand to his stomach but not tired what do you think theyll feed us you are not going to carry me into the house yes i am gray skirted the hood of his car and opened the passenger door the doctor said you could come home if you took it easy rested every afternoon and avoided any heavy lifting well im not lifting anything am i nope i am careful of her shoulder he slipped an arm behind her back another behind her knees women are supposed to think this kind of stuffs romantic under different circumstances i can walk grayson theres nothing wrong with my legs not a thing theyre great he kissed her nose havent i mentioned that before i dont believe you have she smiled despite the fact that hed bumped her shoulder and the bruises on her chest were aching it was the thought after all that counted well since youre playing at being dark lord sweep me inside then and i expect to be kissed well kissed youve gotten awfully demanding since you got hit on the head he carried her up the walk but i guess i have to indulge you before he could reach for the door it swung open and maggie rushed out there you are it seems weve been waiting forever how are you im being pampered and if all of you dont watch out ill get used to it bring her inside gray is there anything in the car she needs about an acre of flowers ill fetch them she dashed off as the carstairs hurried into the hall from the parlor oh brianna you poor dear thing weve been so worried johnny and i barely slept a wink thinking of you lying in the hospital that way such depressing places hospitals i cant think why anyone would choose to work in one can you do you want some tea a nice cool cloth anything at all no thank you iris brianna managed when she could get a word in im sorry you were worried it was only a little thing really nonsense a car accident a night in the hospital a concussion oh does your poor head ache it was beginning to were glad youre home again carstairs put in and patted his wifes hand to calm her i hope mrs omalley made you comfortable shes a treasure i assure you where do you want these flowers brie maggie asked from behind a forest of posies oh well ill put them in your room she decided for herself roganll be up to see you as soon as liam wakes from his nap oh and youve had calls from the whole village and enough baked goods sent over to feed an army for a week theres our girl drying her hands on a towel lottie bustled out from the kitchen lottie i didnt realize you were here of course i am im going to see you settled and cared for grayson take her right on into her room she needs rest oh but no grayson put me down gray only shifted his grip youre outnumbered and if you dont behave i wont read you the rest of the book this is nonsense over her protests brianna found herself in her room being laid on the bed i might as well be back in the hospital now dont make a fuss im going to make you a nice cup of tea lottie began arranging pillows smoothing sheets then youll nap youre going to be flooded with visitors before long and you need your rest at least let me have my knitting well see about that later gray you can keep her company see that she stays put brianna poked out a lip folded her arms go away she told him i dont need you about if you wont stand up for me well well the truth comes out eyeing her he leaned comfortably on the doorjamb youre quite a shrew arent you a shrew is it i complain at being bullied and ordered about and that makes me a shrew youre pouting and complaining about being cared for and looked after that makes you a shrew she opened her mouth closed it again well then i am you need your pills he took the prescription bottle out of his pocket then walked into the bathroom to fill a glass with water they make me groggy she muttered when he came back holding out the capsule do you want me to have to pinch your nose to get you to open up and swallow the notion of that humiliation had her snatching the pill then the glass there happy ill be happy when you stop hurting the fight went out of her im sorry gray im behaving so badly youre in pain he sat on the side of the bed took her hand ive been battered a couple of times myself the first days a misery the seconds hell she sighed i thought it would be better and im angry its not i dont mean to snap at you heres your tea now lamb lottie came in and balanced the saucer in briannas hands and lets get these shoes off so youll be comfortable lottie thank you for being here oh you dont have to thank me for that mrs omalley and ill keep things running around here till youre feeling yourself again dont you fret over a thing she spread a light blanket over briannas legs grayson you see that she rests now wont you you can count on it on impulse he rose to kiss lotties cheek youre a sweetheart lottie sullivan oh go on flushing with pleasure she bustled back into the kitchen so are you grayson thane brianna murmured a sweetheart oh go on he said he tilted his head can she cook she laughed as hed hoped she would a fine cook is our lottie and it wouldnt take much to charm a cobbler from her if youve a taste for one ill keep that in mind maggie brought in the book he picked it up from where maggie had set it on briannas night table are you up for another chapter of blistering medieval romance i am you fell asleep while i was reading last night he said as he paged through the book whats the last thing you remember when he told her he loved her well that certainly narrows it down the first time she patted the bed wanting him to sit beside her again no one forgets the first time they hear it his fingers fumbled on the pages stilled and he said nothing understanding brianna touched his arm you mustnt let it worry you grayson what i feel for you isnt meant to worry you it did of course it did but there was something else and he thought he could give her that at least it humbles me brianna he lifted his gaze those goldenbrown eyes uncertain and it staggers me one day when you remember the first time you heard it i hope it pleasures you content for now she sipped her tea smiled tell me a story grayson chapter twentyfour he didnt leave on the first of june as hed planned he could have knew he should have but it seemed wrong certainly cowardly to go before he was positive brianna was well on the mend the bandages came off hed seen for himself the bruises and had iced down the swelling of her shoulder hed suffered when she turned in her sleep and caused herself discomfort he scolded when she overdid he didnt make love with her he wanted her hourly at first hed been afraid even the most gentle of touches would hurt her then he decided it was best as it was a kind of segue he thought from lover to friend to memory surely it would be easier for them both if his remaining days with her were spent in friendship and not in passion his book was finished but he didnt mail it gray convinced himself he should take a quick detour to new york before his tour and hand it over to arlene personally if he thought from time to time how he had asked brianna to go off with him for a little while he told himself it was best forgotten for her sake of course he was only thinking of her he saw through the window that she was taking down the wash her hair was loose blowing back from her face in the stiff western breeze behind her the finished greenhouse glistened in the sunlight beside her flowers shed planted swayed and danced he watched as she unhooked a clothespin popped it back on the line moved onto the next gathering billowing sheets as she went she was he thought a postcard something that personified a place a time a way of life day after day he thought year after year she would hang her clothes and linens to dry in the wind and the sun and gather them up again and with her and those like her the repetition wouldnt be monotony it would be traditionone that made her strong and selfreliant oddly disturbed he walked outside youre using that arm too much the doctor said exercise was good for it she glanced over her shoulder the smile that curved her lips didnt reach her eyes and hadnt for days he was moving away from her so quickly she couldnt keep up i barely have a twinge now its a glorious day isnt it the family staying with us drove to ballybunion to the beach da used to take maggie and me there sometimes to swim and eat icecream cones if youd wanted to go to the beach youd only had to ask id have taken you the tone of his voice had her spine stiffening her movements became more deliberate as she unpinned a pillowslip thats kind of you im sure grayson but i dont have time for a trip to the sea ive work to do all you do is work he exploded you break your back over this place if youre not cooking youre scrubbing if youre not scrubbing youre washing for christs sake brianna its just a house no she folded the pillowslip in half then half again before laying it in her wicker basket tis my home and it pleases me to cook in it and scrub in it and wash in it and never look past it and where are you looking grayson thane thats so damned important she choked off the bubbling temper reverted to ice and who are you to criticize me for making a home for myself is it a homeor a trap she turned then and her eyes were neither hot nor cold but full of grief is that how you think really in your heart that one is the same as the other and must be if it is truly im sorry for you i dont want sympathy he shot back all im saying is that you work too hard for too little i dont agree nor is that all you said perhaps it was all you meant to say she bent down and picked up her basket and its more than youve said to me for these past five days dont be ridiculous he reached out to take the basket from her but she jerked it away i talk to you all the time let me take that ill take it myself im not a bloody invalid impatiently she set the basket at her hip youve talked at me and around me grayson these last days but to me and of anything you were really thinking or feeling no you havent talked to me and you havent touched me wouldnt it be more honest to just tell me you dont want me anymore dont she was already stalking past him toward the house hed nearly grabbed at her before he stopped himself where did you get an idea that like every night she let the door swing back and nearly caught him in the face with it you sleep with me but you dont touch me and if i turn to you you turn away youre just out of the fucking hospital ive been out of the hospital for nearly two weeks and dont swear at me or if you must swear dont lie she slapped the basket onto the kitchen table anxious to be gone is what you are and not sure how to be gracious about it and youre tired of me she snapped a sheet out of the basket and folded it neatly corner to corner and havent figured out how to say so thats bullshit thats just bullshit its funny how your way with words suffers when youre angry she flipped the sheet over her arm in a practiced move mating bottom to top and youre thinking poor brie shell be breaking her heart over me well i wont another fold and the sheet was a neat square to be laid on the scrubbed kitchen table i did well enough before you came along and ill do well enough after very cool words from someone who claims to be in love i am in love with you she took out another sheet and calmly began the same routine which makes me a fool to be sure for loving a man so cowardly hes afraid of his own feelings afraid of love because he didnt have it as a boy afraid to make a home because he never knew one were not talking about what i was gray said evenly no you think you can run away from that and do every time you pack your bag and hop the next plane or train well you cant any more than i can stay in one place and pretend i grew up happy in it i missed my share of love too but im not afraid of it calmer now she laid the second sheet down im not afraid to love you grayson im not afraid to let you go but im afraid well both be sorry if we dont part honestly he couldnt escape that calm understanding in her eyes i dont know what you want brianna and he was afraid for the first time in his adult memory that he didnt know what he wanted himself for himself it was hard for her to say it but she thought it would be harder not to i want you to touch me to lie with me and if youve no desire for me anymore it would hurt much less if youd tell me so he stared at her he couldnt see what it was costing her she wouldnt let him see only stood her back straight her eyes level waiting brianna i cant breathe without wanting you then have me now in the daylight defeated he stepped forward cupped her face in his hands i wanted to make it easier for you dont just be with me now for now he picked her up made her smile as she pressed her lips to his throat just like in the book better he promised as he carried her into the bedroom this will be better than any book he set her on her feet combing her windtossed hair back from her face before reaching for the buttons of her blouse ive suffered lying beside you at night and not touching you there was no need i thought there was very gently he traced a fingertip over the yellowing marks on her skin youre still bruised theyre fading ill remember how they looked and how my stomach clenched when i saw them how id tighten up inside when youd moan in your sleep a little desperate he lifted his gaze to hers i dont want to care this much about anyone brianna i know she leaned forward pressed her cheek to his dont worry on it now theres only us two and ive been missing you so with her eyes half closed she ran a line of kisses up his jaw while her fingers worked on the buttons of his shirt come to bed grayson she murmured sliding the shirt from his shoulders come with me a sigh of the mattress a rustle of sheets and they were in each others arms she lifted her face and her mouth sought his the first frisson of pleasure shuddered through her then the next as the kiss went deep his fingertips were cool against her flesh soft strokes as he stripped her and his lips were light over the fading bruises as if by wish alone he could vanish them a bird sang in the little pear tree outside and the breeze sent the fairy dance shed hung singing billowed the delicate lace of her curtains it fluttered over his bare back as he shifted over her as he laid his cheek under her heart the gesture made her smile cradle his head in her hands it was all so simple a moment of gold she would treasure and when he lifted his head and his lips sought hers again he smiled into her eyes there was need but no hurry and longing without desperation if either of them thought this might be their last time together they looked for savoring rather than urgency she sighed out his name breath hitching he trembled then he was inside her the pace achingly slow their eyes remained open and their hands palm to palm completed the link with interlacing fingers a shaft of light through the window and dust motes dancing in the beam the call of a bird the distant bark of a dog the smell of roses lemon wax honeysuckle and the feel of her the warm wet feel of her yielding beneath him rising to meet him his senses sharpened on it all like a microscope just focused then there was only pleasure the pure and simple joy of losing everything he was in her she knew by dinnertime that he was leaving in her heart she had known when they had lain quiet together after loving watching the sunlight shift through her window she served her guests listened to their bright talk of their day at the seaside as always she tidied her kitchen washing her dishes putting them away again in the cupboards she scrubbed off her stove thinking again that she should replace it soon perhaps over the winter she would have to start pricing them con was sniffing around the door so she let him out for his evening run for a time she just stood there watching him race over the hills in the glowing sunlight of the long summer evening she wondered what it would be like to run with him to just race as he was racing forgetting all the little details of settling the house for the night forgetting most of all what she had to face but of course she would come back this was where she would always come back she turned closing the door behind her she went into her room briefly before going up to gray he was at his window looking out at her front garden the light that hung yet in the western sky gilded him and made her think as she had so many months before of pirates and poets i was afraid youd have finished packing she saw his suitcase open on the bed nearly full and her fingers tightened on the sweater she carried i was going to come down and talk to you braced for it he turned to her wishing he could read her face but shed found a way to close it off from him i thought i could make dublin tonight its a long drive but youll have light for a while yet brianna i wanted to give you this she said quickly please she wanted to beg no excuses no apologies i made it for you he looked down at her hands he remembered the dark green wool how shed been knitting with it the night hed come into her room late and picked a fight with her the way it had spilled over the white of her nightgown you made it for me yes a sweater you might find use for it in the fall and winter she moved toward him holding it up to measure i added to the length of the sleeves youre long in the arm his already unsteady heart shifted as he touched it in the whole of his life no one had ever made him anything i dont know what to say whenever you gave me a gift youd always tell me to say thank you so i did he took it felt the softness and warmth on the palms of his hands thank you youre welcome do you need some help with your packing without waiting for an answer she took the sweater back and folded it neatly into his suitcase youve more experience with it i know but you must find it tedious please dont he laid a hand on her shoulder but when she didnt look up dropped it again youve every right to be upset no i dont and im not you made no promises grayson so youve broken none thats important to you i know have you checked the drawers youd be amazed at what people forget i have to go brianna i know to keep her hands busy she opened the dresser drawers herself painfully distressed to find them indeed empty i cant stay here the longer i do now the harder it is and i cant give you what you need or think you need next youll be telling me youve the soul of a gypsy and theres no need for that i know it she closed the last drawer and turned around again im sorry for saying what i did earlier i dont want you to go remembering hard words between us when there was so much more her hands were folded again her badge of control would you like me to pack you some food for the trip or a thermos of tea perhaps stop being the gracious hostess for christs sake im leaving you im walking out youre going she returned in a cool and steady voice as you always said you would it might be easier on your conscience if i wept and wailed and made a scene but it doesnt suit me so thats that he tossed some socks into the case youve made your choice and i wish you nothing but happiness youre welcome back of course if you travel this way again his gaze cut to hers as he snapped the case closed ill let you know ill help you down with your things she reached for his duffel but he grabbed it first i carried them in ill carry them out as you please then she cut out his heart by coming to him and kissing him lightly on the cheek keep well grayson goodbye brie they went down the steps together he said nothing more until theyd reached the front door i wont forget you i hope not she walked part way with him to the car then stopped on the garden path waiting while he loaded his bag climbed behind the wheel she smiled lifted her hand in a wave then walked back into the cottage without looking back an hour later she was alone in the parlor with her mending basket she heard the laughter through the windows and closed her eyes briefly when maggie came in with rogan and the baby she was nipping a thread and smiling well now youre out late tonight liam was restless maggie sat lifting her arms so rogan could pass the baby to her we thought hed like some company and heres a picture the mistress of the house in the parlor mending im behind in it would you like a drink rogan i wouldnt turn one down he moved toward the decanter maggie aye a little whiskey would go down well and brie thank you i think i will she threaded a needle knotted the end is your work going well maggie its wonderful to be back at it yes it is she planted a noisy kiss on liams mouth i finished a piece today it was gray talking about those ruins hes so fond of that gave me the notion for it turned out well i think she took the glass rogan handed her lifted hers well heres to a restful night ill give you no argument there her husband said with fervor and drank liam doesnt think the hours between two and five am should be for sleeping with a laugh maggie shifted the baby onto her shoulder we wanted to tell you brie the detectives tracking amanda dougherty towhere is that place rogan michigan he has a lead on her and the man she married he glanced at his wife and the child she had a daughter brie maggie murmured cuddling her own baby he located the birth certificate amanda named her shannon for the river brianna whispered and felt tears rise up in her throat we have a sister maggie we have we may find her soon for better or worse i hope so oh im glad you came to tell me it helped a little took some of the sting out of her heart itll be good to think of it it may just be thinking for a while rogan warned the lead hes following is twentyfive years old then well be patient brianna said simply far from certain of her own feelings maggie shifted the baby and the topic id like to show the piece ive finished to gray see if he recognizes the inspiration where is he working hes gone brianna sent the needle neatly through a buttonhole gone where to the pub no to dublin i think or wherever the road takes him you mean hes gone left she rose then making the baby chortle with glee at the sudden movement yes just an hour ago and you sit here sewing what should i be doing flogging myself flogging hims more like why that yank bastard to think id grown fond of him maggie rogan laid a warning hand on her arm are you all right brianna im fine thank you rogan dont take on so maggie hes doing whats right for him to hell with whats right for him what about you take the baby will you she said impatiently to rogan then arms free went to kneel in front of her sister i know how you feel about him brie and i cant understand how he could leave this way what did he say when you asked him to stay i didnt ask him to stay you didntwhy the devil not because it would have made us both unhappy she jabbed the needle swore lightly at the prick on her thumb and i have my pride a fat lot of good that does you you probably offered to fix him sandwiches for the trip i did oh disgusted maggie rose turned around the room theres no reasoning with you never has been im sure youre making brianna feel much better by having a tantrum rogan said dryly i was just but catching his eye maggie bit her tongue youre right of course im sorry brie if you like i can stay awhile keep you company or ill pack up some things for the baby and well both stay the night you both belong at home ill be fine maggie on my own i always am gray was nearly to dublin and the scene kept working on his mind the ending of the book the damn ending just wouldnt settle thats why he was so edgy he should have mailed the manuscript off to arlene and forgotten it that last scene wouldnt be digging at him now if he had he could already be toying with the next story but he couldnt think of another when he wasnt able to let go of the last mcgee had driven away because hed finished what hed come to ireland to do he was going to pick up his life again his work he had to move on because because he had to gray thought irritably and tullia had stayed because her life was in the cottage in the land around it the people she was happy there the way she never would be anywhere else briannatullia he corrected would wither without her roots the ending made sense it was perfectly plausible fit both character and mood so why was it nagging at him like a bad tooth she hadnt asked him to stay he thought hadnt shed a tear when he realized his mind had once again shifted from tullia to brianna he swore and pressed harder on the accelerator thats the way it was supposed to be he reminded himself brianna was a sensible levelheaded woman it was one of the things he admired about her if shed loved him so damn much the least she could have done was said shed miss him he didnt want her to miss him he didnt want a light burning in the window or her darning his socks or ironing his shirts and most of all he didnt want her preying on his mind he was footloose and free as hed always been as he needed to be he had places to go a pin to stick in a map a little vacation somewhere before the tour and then new horizons to explore that was his life he tapped his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel he liked his life and he was picking it up again just like mcgee just like mcgee he thought with a scowl the lights of dublin glowed in welcome it relaxed him to see them to know hed come where hed intended to go he didnt mind the traffic of course he didnt or the noise hed just spent too long away from cities what he needed was to find a hotel check in all he wanted was a chance to stretch his legs after the long drive to buy himself a drink or two gray pulled over to a curb let his head fall back against the seat all he wanted was a bed a drink and quiet room the hell it was brianna was up at dawn it was foolish to lie in bed and pretend you could sleep when you couldnt she started her bread and set it aside to rise before brewing the first pot of tea she took a cup for herself into the back garden but couldnt settle even a tour of the greenhouse didnt please her so she went inside again and set the table for breakfast it helped that her guests were leaving early by eight shed fixed them a hot meal and bid them on their way but now she was alone certain she would find contentment in routine she set the kitchen to rights upstairs she stripped the unmade beds smoothed on the sheets shed taken fresh from the line the day before she gathered the damp towels replaced them and it couldnt be put off any longer she told herself shouldnt be she moved briskly into the room where grayson had worked it needed a good dusting she thought and ran a finger gently over the edge of the desk pressing her lips together she straightened the chair how could she have known it would feel so empty she shook herself it was only a room after all waiting now for the next guest to come and she would put the very next one into it she promised it would be wise to do that it would help she moved into the bath taking the towels hed used from the bar where theyd dried and she could smell him the pain came so quickly so fiercely she nearly staggered under it blindly she stumbled back into the bedroom sat on the bed and burying her face in the towels wept gray could hear her crying as he came up the stairs it was a wild sound of grieving that stunned him made him slow his pace before he faced it from the doorway he saw her rocking herself for comfort with her face pressed into towels not cool he thought or controlled not levelheaded he rubbed his hands over his own face scraping away some of the travel fatigue and the guilt well he said in an easy voice you sure as hell had me fooled her head shot up and he could see now the heartbreak in her eyes the shadows under them she started to rise but he waved a hand no dont stop crying keep right on it does me good to know what a fake you are let me help you pack gray why dont i fix you some food for your trip ill get along just dandy without you she struggled against the tears but couldnt win as they poured out she buried her face again you had me going really had me you never even looked back thats what was wrong with the scene it didnt play it never did he crossed to her pulled the towels away youre helplessly in love with me arent you brianna all the way in love no tricks no traps no trite phrases oh go away why did you come back here i forgot a few things theres nothing here youre here he knelt down taking her hands to keep her from covering the tears let me tell you a story no go on crying if you want he said when she tried to pull away but listen i thought he had to leave mcgee youve come back to talk to me about your book let me tell you a story i figured he had to leave so what if hed never cared for anyone the way he cared for tullia so what if she loved him had changed him changed his whole life completed it they were miles apart in every other way werent they patiently he watched another tear run down her cheek she was struggling against them he knew and she was losing he was a loner gray continued always had been what the hell would he be doing planting himself in some little cottage in the west of ireland and she let him go because she was too damn stubborn too proud and too much in love to ask him to stay i worried over that he continued for weeks it drove me crazy and all the way to dublin i chewed on it figured i wouldnt think of you if i was thinking of that and i suddenly realized that he wouldnt go and she wouldnt let him oh theyd survive without each other because theyre born survivors but theyd never be whole not the way they were together so i did a rewrite right there in the lobby of the hotel in dublin she swallowed hard against tears and humiliation so youve solved your problem good for you one of them youre not going anywhere brianna he tightened his grip until she stopped dragging at her hands when i finished the rewrite i thought ill get a drink somewhere and go to bed instead i got in the car turned around and came back here because i forgot that i spent the happiest six months of my life here i forgot that i wanted to hear you singing in the kitchen in the morning or see you out of the bedroom window i forgot that surviving isnt always enough look at me please when she did he rubbed one of her tears away with his thumb then linked his hands with hers again and most of all brianna i forgot to let myself tell you that i love you she said nothing couldnt as her breath continued to hitch but her eyes widened and two new tears plopped onto their joined hands it was news to me too he murmured more of a shock im still not sure how to deal with it i never wanted to feel this way about anyone and its been easy to avoid it until you it means strings and responsibilities and it means maybe i can live without you but id never be whole without you gently he lifted their joined hands to his lips and tasted her tears i figured youd gotten over me pretty quick with that sendoff last night that started me panicking i was all set to beg when i came in and heard you crying i have to say it was music to my ears you wanted me to cry maybe yeah he rose then releasing her hands i figured if youd done some sobbing on my shoulder last night if youd asked me not to leave you id have stayed then i could have blamed you if i screwed things up after a short laugh she wiped at her cheeks ive accommodated you havent i not really he turned back to look at her she was so perfect he realized with her tidy apron her hair slipping from its pins and tears drying on her cheeks i had to come around to this on my own so ive got no one else to blame if i mess it up i want you to know im going to try hard not to mess it up you want to come back she gripped her hands tight together it was so hard to hope more or less more actually the panic was still there brewing inside him he only hoped it didnt show i said i love you brianna i know i remember she managed a smile as she rose you dont forget the first time you hear it the first time i heard it was the first time i made love to you i was hoping id hear it again i love you grayson you know i do were going to see about that he reached into his pocket and took out a small box you didnt have to buy me a gift you only had to come home i thought about that a lot driving back from dublin coming home its the first time i have he handed her the box id like to make it a habit she opened the box and bracing a hand on the bed behind her sat again i harassed the manager of the hotel in dublin until he had the gift shop opened you irish are so sentimental i didnt even have to bribe him he swallowed i thought id have better luck with a traditional ring i want you to marry me brianna i want us to make a home together grayson i know im a bad bet he hurried on i dont deserve you but you love me anyway i can work anywhere and i can help you here with the inn as she looked at him her heart simply overflowed he loved her wanted her and would stay grayson ill still have to travel some he plowed over her terrified shed refuse him but it wouldnt be like before and sometimes you could come with me wed always come back here brie always this place it means almost as much to me as it does to you i know i you cant know he interrupted i didnt know myself until id left its home youre home not a trap he murmured a sanctuary a chance i want to make a family here he dragged a hand through his hair as she stared at him jesus i want that children longterm plans a future and knowing youre right there every night every morning no one could ever love you the way i do brianna i want to pledge to you he drew an unsteady breath from this day from this hour oh grayson she choked out his name dreams it seemed could come true ive wanted ive never loved anyone before brianna in my whole life theres been no one but you so ill treasure you i swear it and if youd just oh be quiet will you she said between laughter and tears so i can say yes yes he plucked her off the bed again stared into her eyes no making me suffer first the answers yes just yes she put her arms around him laid her head on his shoulder and smiled welcome home grayson
