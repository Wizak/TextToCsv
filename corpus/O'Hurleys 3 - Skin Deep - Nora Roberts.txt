 prologue i dont know what were going to do with that girl now molly with his eye on the mirror frank ohurley added a touch of pancake makeup to his chin to make certain his face didnt shine onstage you worry too much worry as she twisted to pull the zipper up the back of her dress molly remained at the dressing room door so that she could watch the corridor backstage frank we have four children and i love every one of them but chantels middle name is trouble youre too hard on the girl because youre not hard enough frank chuckled then turned around to scoop his wife into his arms more than twenty years of marriage hadnt dulled his feelings for her a whit she was still his molly pretty and bright even though she was the mother of his twentyyearold son and his three teenage daughters molly my love chantels a beautiful young girl and she knows it molly peeked over franks shoulder at the backstage door willing it to open where was that girl they had fifteen minutes before they were due onstage and chantel had yet to make an appearance when she had given birth to her three daughters each within minutes of the next she hadnt known that the first one would give her more to worry about than the other two combined its her looks that are going to get her in trouble molly muttered when a girl looks like chantel boys are bound to come sniffing around she can handle the boys maybe that worries me too she handles them too well how could she expect a man as simple and kindhearted as her frank to understand the complexities of women instead she fell back on an old standard shes only sixteen frank and how old were you when you and i that was different molly said but she was forced to laugh at the grin frank sent her well it was she straightened his tie then brushed powder from his lapels as she spoke she might not have the good fortune to meet a man like you cupping his hands under her elbows he held her still what kind of man is that with her hands on his shoulders she looked at his face it was thin and already lined but the eyes were the eyes of the smoothtalking boy shed lost her head over though hed never quite come up with that moon on a silver platter that hed once promised her they were partners in every sense of the word for better or worse through thick and thin there had been a lot of thin shed spent more than half of her life with the man molly thought and he could still charm her a dear one she told him and brought her lips to his at the sound of the back door closing molly pulled away now dont jump on her molly frank began as he caught his wifes arm you know itll just put her back up and shes here now grumbling molly drew away as chantel danced down the corridor she was wearing a vivid red sweater and snug black slacks that showed off her blooming young shape the brisk fall air had whipped color into her cheeks highlighting alreadyelegant bones her eyes were a deep deep blue and held a breezy selfsatisfied expression chantel with her natural flair for drama and timing chantel paused outside the door of the dressing room she shared with her sisters mom her lips turned up at the corners and the smile spread farther when she saw her father wink at her over mollys shoulder she knew she could always count on pop i know im a little late but ill be ready i had the most wonderful time excitement added spark to beauty michael let me drive his car that fancy little red number frank began then he coughed into his hand as molly leveled him with a look chantel youve only had your license a few weeks how she hated to lecture molly thought as she wound herself up for it she knew what it was to be sixteen and because of that she knew there was no way around what she had to do your father and i dont think youre ready to drive unless one of us is with you and in any case she continued before chantel could get out her first protest it isnt smart to get behind the wheel of someone elses car we were on the back roads chantel came over and kissed her mother on both cheeks dont worry so much i have to have some fun or ill just shrivel up molly recognized the ploy too well and she stood firm chantel youre too young to go off in some boys car michaels not a boy hes twentyone that only makes my point hes a creep trace announced calmly as he came into the corridor he only lifted a brow when chantel turned on him eyes flashing and if i find out hes touched you ill rip his face off its none of your business chantel told him it was one thing to be lectured by her mother quite another to hear it from her brother im sixteen not six and im sick and tired of being hovered over too bad he took her chin in his hand holding it steady when she tried to jerk away he had a rougher masculine version of chantels beauty looking at them frank felt pride swell in him until he thought he was going to burst they were the fireeaters of the family more like their mother than him he loved them with all his heart all right now all right playing peacemaker he stepped up well get into all this business later right now chantel has to change ten minutes princess he murmured dont dawdle come on molly lets go warm up the crowd molly sent chantel a quiet look that warned her the business wasnt over then softened and touched her daughters cheek weve a right to worry about you you know maybe chantels chin was still high but you dont need to i can take care of myself im afraid you can with a little sigh she walked with her husband down toward the small stage where they would earn their living for the rest of the week far from mollified chantel put her hand on the knob of the door behind her before she faced her brother i decide who touches me trace remember that just make sure your friend with the fancy car behaves himself unless youd like both his arms broken oh go to hell probably will he said easily then he tugged her hair ill be clearing a path for you little sister because she wanted to laugh chantel yanked open the door then shut it in his face maddy glanced over as she buttoned the back of abbys costume so you decided to show up dont you start moving quickly chantel pulled a dress that matched her sisters off an iron bar that spanned the width of the room wouldnt dream of it sounded interesting out in the hall though i wish theyd stop fussing over me chantel tossed the dress down then peeled off her sweater the skin below was pale and smooth the curves already soft and feminine look at it this way maddy said as she finished abbys buttons theyre so busy fussing at you they hardly ever pick on abby and me you owe me chantel slipped out of her slacks with brisk movements and stood in bra and panties mom really was worried abby interjected since her own makeup and hair were finished she arranged the tubes and pots that would set chantels face for the stage feeling a little pang of guilt chantel plopped down in front of the mirror the three of them shared she didnt have to be i was fine i had fun did he really let you drive his car interested maddy picked up a brush to fix chantels hair yeah it felt i dont know it felt important she glanced around the cramped windowless room with its concrete floor and dingy walls im not always going to be in a dump like this you know now you sound like pop with a smile abby handed her a makeup sponge well im not with years of experience already behind her chantel added the color to her face in quick strokes one day im going to have a dressing room three times this big all white with carpet so thick youll sink up to your ankles id rather have color maddy said dreaming herself for a moment lots and lots of color white chantel repeated firmly then she stood to put on her dress and its going to have a star on the door im going to ride in a limo and have a sports car that makes michaels look like a toy her eyes darkened as she pulled on the dress which had been mended too many times to count and a house with acres of garden and a big stone pool because dreams were part of their heritage abby elaborated as she did up chantels buttons when you walk into a restaurant the maitre d will recognize you and give you the best table and a bottle of champagne on the house youll be gracious to photographers maddy went on handing chantel her earrings and never refuse an autograph naturally enjoying herself chantel clipped the glass stones at her ears thinking of diamonds therell be two enormous suites in the house for each of my sisters well sit up at night and eat caviar make it pizza maddy instructed resting an elbow on her shoulder pizza and caviar abby put in then stood on the other side with a laugh chantel slipped her arms around her sisters waists they were a unit now just as they had been in the womb were going to go places were going to be somebody we already are abby tilted her head to look at chantel the ohurley triplets chantel looked at the reflection the mirror tossed back and nobodys ever going to forget it chapter one contents prev next the house was big and cool and white in the earlymorning hours a breeze came through the terrace doors chantel had left unlatched bringing in the scents of the garden across the lawn hidden from the main house by trees was a gazebo painted white with wisteria climbing up the trellises sometimes when the wind was right chantel could catch the perfume from her bedroom window on the east side of the lawn was an elaborate marble fountain it was quiet now she rarely had it turned on when she was alone near it was the pool an octagonal stone affair skirted by a wide patio and flanked by another smaller white house there was a tennis court beyond a grove of trees but it had been weeks since shed had the time or the inclination to pick up a racket surrounding the estate was a stone fence twice as tall as a man that alternately gave her a sense of security or the feeling of being hemmed in still inside the house with its lofty ceilings and cool white walls she often forgot about the fence and the security system and the electronic gate it was the price she paid for the fame she had always wanted the servants quarters were in the west wing on the first floor no one stirred there now it was barely dawn and she was alone there were times chantel preferred it that way as she bundled her hair under a hat she didnt bother to check the results in the threefoot mirror in her dressing room the long shirt and flatheeled shoes she wore were chosen for comfort not for elegance the face that had broken mens hearts and stirred womens envy was left untouched by cosmetics chantel protected it by pulling down the brim of her hat and slipping on enormous sunglasses as she picked up the bag that held everything she thought she would need for the day the intercom beside the door buzzed she checked her watch five fortyfive then she pushed the button right on time good morning miss ohurley good morning robert ill be right down after flipping the switch that released the front gate chantel started down the wide double staircase that led to the main floor the mahogany rail felt like satin under her fingers as she trailed them down overhead a chandelier hung its prisms quiet in the dim light the marble floor shone like glass the house was a suitable showcase for the star she had worked to become chantel had yet to take any of it for granted it was a dream that had rolled from then into other dreams and it took time and effort and skill to maintain but then shed been working all her life and felt entitled to the benefits she had begun to reap as she walked to the front door the phone began to ring damn it had they changed the call on her because she was up and the servants werent chantel crossed the hall to the library and lifted the receiver hello automatically she picked up a pen and prepared to make a note i wish i could see you right now the familiar whisper had her palms going damp and the pen slipped out of her hand and fell soundlessly on the fresh blotter why did you change your number youre not afraid of me are you you mustnt be afraid of me chantel i wont hurt you i just want to touch you just touch you are you getting dressed are you with a cry of despair chantel slammed down the receiver the sound of her breathing in the big empty house seemed to echo back to her it was starting again minutes later her driver noticed only that she didnt give him the easy flirtatious smile she usually greeted him with before she climbed into the back of the limo once inside chantel tipped her head back closed her eyes and willed herself to calm she had to face the camera in a few hours and give it her best that was her job that was her life nothing could be allowed to interfere with that not even the fear of a whisper over the phone or an anonymous letter by the time the limo passed through the studio gates chantel had herself under control again she should be safe here shouldnt she here she could pour herself into the work that still fascinated her inside the dozens of big domed buildings magic happened and she was part of it even the ugliness was just pretend murder mayhem and passion could all be simulated fantasyland her sister maddy called it and that was true enough but chantel thought with a smile you had to work your tail off to make the fantasy real she was sitting in makeup at sixthirty and having her hair fussed over and styled by seven they were in the first week of shooting and everything seemed fresh and new chantel read over her lines while the stylist arranged her hair into the flowing silverblond mane her character would wear that day such incredible bulk the stylist murmured as she aimed the handheld dryer i know women who would sell their bluechip stocks for hair as thick as this and the color she bent down to eye level to look in the mirror at the results of her work even i have a hard time believing its natural my grandmother on my fathers side chantel turned her head a bit to check her left profile im supposed to be twenty in this scene margo am i going to pull it off with a laugh the stringy redhead stood back thats the least of your worries its a shame theyre going to dump rain all over this she gave chantels hair a final fluff youre telling me chantel stood when the bib was removed thanks margo before shed taken two steps her assistant was at her elbow chantel had hired him because he was young and eager and had no ambitions to be an actor are you going to crack the whip larry larry washington flushed and stuttered as he always did during his first five minutes around chantel he was short and well built fresh out of college and had a mind that soaked up details his biggest ambition at the moment was to own a mercedes oh you know id never do that miss ohurley chantel patted his shoulder making his blood pressure soar somebody has to larry id appreciate it if youd scout up the assistant director and tell him im in my dressing room im going to hide out there until theyre ready to rehearse her costar came into view carrying a cigarette and what chantel accurately gauged to be a filthy hangover would you like me to bring you some coffee miss ohurley as he asked larry shifted to distance himself everyone with brains had quickly figured out that it was best to avoid sean carter when he was dealing with the morning after yes thanks chantel nodded to a few members of the crew as they tightened up the works on the first set a train station complete with tracks passenger cars and a depot shed say her desperate goodbyes to her lover there she could only hope hed gotten his headache under control by then larry kept pace with her as she crossed the set walking under lights and around cables i wanted to remind you about your interview this afternoon the reporter from star gaze is due here at twelvethirty dean from publicity said hed sit in with you if you wanted no thats all right i can handle a reporter see if you can get some fresh fruit sandwiches coffee no make that iced tea ill do the interview in my dressing room all right miss ohurley earnestly he began to note it down in his book is there anything else she paused at the door of her dressing room how long have you been working for me now larry ah just over three months miss ohurley i think you could start to call me chantel she smiled then closed the door on his astonished pleasure the dressing room had been recently redecorated for her taste and comfort with the script still in her hand chantel walked through the sitting room and into the small dressing area beyond knowing her time was limited she didnt waste it after stripping out of her own clothes she changed into the jeans and sweater she would wear for the first scene she was to be twenty a struggling art student on the down slide of her first affair chantel glanced at the script again it was good solid the part shed gotten would give her an opportunity to express a range of feeling that would stretch her creative talents it was a challenge and all she had to do was take advantage of it and she would chantel promised herself she would when she had read strangers shed cast herself in the part of hailey the young artist betrayed by one man haunted by another a woman who ultimately finds success and loses love chantel understood hailey she understood betrayal and she thought as she glanced around the elegant little room again she understood success and the price that had to be paid for it though she knew her lines cold she kept the script with her as she went back to the sitting room with luck she would have time for one quick cup of coffee before they ran through the scene when she was working on a film chantel found it easy to live off coffee a quick light lunch and more coffee the part fed her there was rarely time for shopping a dip in the pool or a massage at the club until a film was wrapped those were rewards for a job well done she started to sit but a vase of vivid red roses caught her eye from one of the studio heads she thought as she walked over to pick up the card when she opened it the script slid out of her hand and onto the floor im watching you always always at the knock on her door she jerked back stumbling against the counter the scent of the roses at her back spread heady and sweet with a hand to her throat she stared at the door with the first real fear shed ever experienced miss ohurley chantel its larry i have your coffee with a breathless sob she ran across the room and jerked open the door larry its black the way you whats wrong i i just she cut herself off control she thought desperately you lose everything if you lose control larry do you know anything about these flowers she gestured back but couldnt look at them the roses oh one of the caterers found them while she was setting up breakfast since they had your name on them i went ahead and put them in here i know how much you like roses get rid of them but please she stepped out of the dressing room people she wanted lots of people around her just get rid of them larry sure he stared at her back as she walked toward the set right away four aspirin and three cups of coffee had brought sean carter back to life it was time to work and nothing could be allowed to interfere with that not a hangover not a few frightening words printed on a card chantel had worked hard to project an image of glamour and style shed worked just as hard not to develop a reputation as a temperamental actress she was ready when called and always knew her lines if a scene took ten hours to shoot then it took ten hours she reminded herself of all of this as she approached sean and their director how come you always look as though you stepped out of the pages of a fashion magazine sean grumbled but chantel observed that makeup had dealt with the shadows under his eyes his skin was tanned and shaved smooth his thick mahoganycolored hair was styled casually falling across his brow he looked young healthy and handsome the dream lover for an idealistic girl chantel lifted a hand and let it rest on his cheek because darling i did what a woman because the aspirin had made him feel human again sean grabbed chantel and leaned her back in a dramatic dip let me ask you this rothschild he said calling to the director while his lips hovered inches from chantels how could a man in his right mind leave a woman like this it hasnt been established that you or brad mary rothschild corrected referring to the role is in his right mind and youre such a cad chantel reminded sean pleased to remember it sean brought her up again i havent played a real cad in about five years i dont think ive properly thanked the writer yet you can do it later today rothschild told him hes over there chantel glanced over to the tall rangy man who stood chainsmoking nervously on the edge of the set shed met him a handful of times in meetings and during preproduction as she recalled he had said little that hadnt dealt directly with his book or his characters she sent him a vaguely friendly smile before turning back to the director as rothschild outlined the scene she pushed everything else out of her mind all that would be left was the heartbreak and hope her character felt as her lover slipped away mechanically their minds on angles and continuity she and sean went over their brief but poignant love scene i think i should touch your face like this chantel reached up to rest her palm on his cheek and looked pleadingly into his eyes then ill take your wrist sean wrapped his fingers around it then turned her palm to his lips ill wait for you and so forth chantel skipped over the lines as one of the crew dropped a barn door into place with a clatter she gave a small broken sigh and pressed her cheek to his then ill start to bring my arms up lets try this sean took her shoulders held her for a moment while they stared at each other then placed two nibbling kisses on either side of her mouth oh brad please dont go then i kiss you until your teeth rattle sean grinned im looking forward to it lets run through it rothschild held up a hand women directors were still the exception to the rule she couldnt afford to give herself or anyone else an inch i want a lot of steam when you get to the kiss she told both of them keep the tears coming chantel remember deep in your heart you know hes not coming back i really am a cad sean said pleasantly places extras scrambled to their marks a few members of the camera crew broke off making plans for a poker game quiet on the set rothschild moved over too until she had the best angle for chantels entrance action chantel dashed out on the platform looking around frantically while groups of people milled around her it all showed on her face the desperation the last flames of hope the dream that wasnt ready to die there would be a thunderstorm brewing thanks to special effects lightning flashing thunder rolling then she spotted brad she called out his name pushing her way through the crowd until she was with him they rehearsed the scene three times before rothschild was satisfied enough to roll film chantels makeup and hair were freshened when the clapper came down she was ready throughout the morning they perfected the first part of the scene her search the impatience and rush of the crowd her meeting with brad take after take she repeated the same moves the same words at times with the camera no more than a foot away on the sixth take rothschild finally gave the signal for the rain the sprinklers sent down a drizzle that misted over her as she stood facing brad her eyes filled and her voice trembled as she begged him not to leave wet and cold they continued to go over what would be five minutes on the screen until lunch break in her dressing room chantel stripped out of haileys clothes and handed them to the wardrobe mistress so that they could be dried her hair would be styled again then soaked again before she could call it a day the roses were gone but she thought she could still smell them when larry came to the door to tell her that the reporter had arrived she asked him to give her five minutes then send him along shed put it off too long she told herself as she picked up the phone it wasnt going to stop and shed reached the point where she could no longer ignore it the burns agency i need to speak to matt im sorry mr burns is in a meeting may i this is chantel ohurley i have to speak to matt now of course miss ohurley chantel couldnt resist a slight smirk at how quickly the receptionist had changed her tune searching a drawer for the pack of cigarettes she kept for emergencies she waited for matt to come on the line chantel whats up i need to see you tonight well sweetheart im kind of tied up why dont we make it tomorrow tonight some of the panic fought its way through chantel lighted the cigarette and drew deeply its important i need help she let the smoke out in a slow stream i really need your help matt because hed never heard fear in her voice before he didnt question her ill come by what eight yes yes thats fine i appreciate it can you tell me what its about i cant not over the phone not now she was calming again just knowing she was about to take a step seemed to help whatever you say ill be there tonight thanks she hung up the phone just as the knock came at her door chantel carefully stubbed out her cigarette tossed her stilldamp hair back and ushered the reporter in with a gracious smile why in the hell didnt you tell me about this before matt burns paced around chantels spacious living room with an unfamiliar feeling of helplessness in twelve years hed scrambled his way up from mail clerk to assistant to top theatrical agent he hadnt gotten there by not knowing what to do in any given situation now he had a hornets nest on his hands and he wasnt sure which way to toss it damn it chantel how long has this been going on the first phone call came about six weeks ago chantel sat on a low oystercolored sofa and nursed a glass of mineral water like matt she didnt like the feeling of helplessness she disliked having to ask someone else to do something about a problem of hers even more look matt the first couple of calls the first couple of letters seemed harmless ice clinked in her glass as she set it down then picked it up again with my face plastered all over magazines and all over the screen obviously ill attract attention not all of its healthy i figured if i ignored it it would stop but it didnt no she looked down at her glass remembering the words printed on the card im watching you always always no it got worse she shrugged trying to pretend to herself and to him that it wasnt as bad as it sounded i had my number changed and for a while it worked you should have told me youre my agent not my mother im your friend he reminded her i know she held out a hand real friendships were few and far between in the world shed chosen thats why i called you before i went off the deep end im not a hysterical woman he laughed then released her hand to pour himself another drink anything but when those roses well i knew i had to do something but i didnt know what the what is to call the police absolutely not she lifted a finger when he started to object matt i imagine you can write the scenario as easily as i can we call the police then the press gets hold of it headline chantel ohurley haunted by twisted admirer whispered phone calls desperate love letters she pulled a hand through her hair we might be able to laugh that off even use it to a point but it wouldnt be long before a few more unbalanced personalities decided to write me some fan letters or camp out at the front gate i dont think i can handle more than one at a time what if hes violent dont you think ive thought of that she plucked one of his french cigarettes from his pocket and waited for him to light it you need protection maybe i do she took a quick hurried drag maybe im just about ready to admit that but im in the middle of a film you bring cops on the set and people wouldnt stop talking since when has gossip worried you never she managed an easy smile except when its about something really personal my ah extraordinary love affairs and hedonistic lifestyle are one thing my life as it really is is quite another no police matt at least not yet i need another alternative he took the cigarette from her and inhaled thoughtfully chantels first job on the screen had been negotiated by him hed seen her through everything from shampoo commercials to feature films and it was rare very rare for her to ask for help with something personal in all the years he had known her even matt had seldom gotten beneath the image of the woman they had both manufactured i think i have one trust me havent i always sit tight im going to make a call chantel settled back and closed her eyes when matt left the room maybe she was overreacting maybe she was being foolishly jumpy about a fan whod taken admiration just a few steps too far im watching you watching you no unable to sit chantel sprang up to pace around the room she enjoyed being watched on the screen she could accept being photographed whenever she swept in or out of a club whenever she attended a party or a premiere but this was frightening she admitted as if someone were just outside the windows looking in the thought made her glance nervously over her shoulder of course there was no one there she had the electronic gate the walls the security but she couldnt stay locked in her house twentyfour hours a day she stopped by the antique mirror above the white marble fireplace there was the face she was familiar with the face critics had called devastating incomparable even heartlessly beautiful a lucky accident she sometimes thought the combination of pearly skin nordic blue eyes and icesharp cheekbones shed done nothing to earn the face the classic oval shape of it the full lush mouth or the thick mane of angelblond hair shed been born with that but shed worked for the rest and worked hard shed been performing since she could walk traveling endlessly around the country with her family in clubs and regional theater shed paid her dues long before she had come to hollywood at nineteen not starryeyed but determined in the years that had passed she had won roles and lost them had hawked shampoo and sold gallons of perfume in unapologetically sexy often silly commercials when her first break had come shed been ready more than ready to play the soulless maneater who stayed on screen less than twenty minutes shed stolen that movie from a pair of veterans and had gone on to star in one of her own thered been no looking back that first break had brought her the stardom she had always craved and had indirectly nearly destroyed her life yet shed survived chantel reminded herself as she faced her own reflection she hadnt allowed what had happened all those years ago to ruin her she refused to allow what was happening now to ruin her either hes coming right over she turned away from the mirror as matt strode into the room again what i said hes coming right over let me fix you a real drink no i have to be on the set at sixthirty whos coming right over quinn doran he might just be the answer and since we go back a ways i was able to persuade him to think about it chantel stuck her hands in the pockets of her white satin loungers who is quinn doran hes sort of a private investigator sort of he runs a security business corporate small business whatever at one time he worked in some sort of covert operation might have been for our government but i couldnt swear to it sounds fascinating but i dont think i want a spy matt a threehundredpound wrestler might be more appealing and obvious he reminded her you could hire yourself a couple of bruisers for bodyguards sweetheart but what you want here is brains and discretion thats quinn he finished off his drink and contemplated having another he doesnt do much of the legwork himself now he has plenty of operatives or whatever theyre called to handle that keeps himself available as a troubleshooter but in this case i want you to have the best and thats quinn chantel mimicked dropping onto the arm of the sofa whats he supposed to do i dont have any idea thats why i called him hes a moody bastard he said reminiscently not too well polished but id trust him with my life or in this case mine matts expression changed immediately chantel if youre really that worried no no with a wave of her hand she brushed off his concern i have the feeling that this quinn doran of yours is likely to listen to what i have to say roll his eyes and give me a lecture on how to handle the obscene phone caller i dont like him already youre just nervous matt patted her knee as he crossed to the bar youre allowed to be nervous chantel no im not she smiled determined to lighten her own mood nerves dont fit the image its an image you helped me mold you didnt need any help with that with a smile for her he turned back and studied the flow of white satin that suited her so well you were born with the talent i just helped you expand it she tilted her head and gave him a long luxurious smile howd we do ill say this no one looking at you today would think that youd once mended your panty hose she laughed and slid down on the sofa youre so good for me matt ive been telling you that for years theres the bell ill get it chantel picked up her warming mineral water and swirled it if matt thought quinn doran was an answer shed have to take his word for it but it galled her it galled her right down to the ground to tell her personal problems to a stranger then the stranger walked in if she had had to cast someone in the roll of a spy a private investigator or an alley fighter her choice would have been quinn doran he filled the archway to her living room inches taller than matt inches broader in the shoulders yet with a wiry leanness that made her think he could move fast and move well the quick flutter of feminine approval she accepted as natural even before she looked at his face then she thought it unnatural he wasnt leadingman handsome but he had tough gotohell looks that would make any womans pulse uneven dark thick hair curled over his ears and trailed over the collar of a denim work shirt his skin was tanned and taut over strong facial bones and the pale shade of his eyes seemed almost startlingly cool his lashes were too long too thick for a man but they were anything but feminine there was nothing about him that wasnt totally masculine when he walked he walked with the soft measured stride of a man who knew how to stalk his mouth turned up slightly as he crossed to her but chantel didnt see humor or appreciation in his eyes she saw recognized and stiffened against derision so this is the ice palace he said in a surprisingly beautiful voice and the queen chapter two contents prev next hed seen her before of course on the screen she looked larger than life indomitable untouchable the face almost mystically perfect could rule a mans fantasies a facade quinn understood facades how they could be formed altered or hacked away as circumstances demanded he wondered as with a casual glance he took in everything about her how much substance there was beneath that silkandsatin exterior matt had known quinn too long to be disturbed by his cavalier attitude chantel quinn doran satin slid over satin as she crossed her legs with a lazy kind of grace she offered her hand charming she murmured stiffening as his fingers curled firmly over hers he didnt shake her hand nor did he bring it to his lips in the casual european gesture she suddenly felt he was capable of he just held it while his pale green eyes held hers her skin was like the satin she wore smooth fragrant and coolly feminine his was hard unyielding and darkened by the sun they froze for a moment her on the sofa him on his feet with their hands still locked chantel had been in combat with men before and only once had she lost she understood that the glove had been tossed down and she accepted the challenge is it still vodka rocks matt asked quinn as he turned to the bar yeah with a slight inclination of his head quinn indicated that he knew the game was on he relaxed his fingers slowly to let her hand slide from his matt tells me you have a problem apparently i do chantel plucked a cigarette from a porcelain holder on the table then lifted a brow when quinn drew a lighter out of his pocket and flicked it on she smiled and leaned a bit closer im afraid i dont know if youre the man to deal with it her gaze lifted and held his before she leaned back again mr doran im inclined to agree with you miss ohurley for the second time their gazes locked and something not entirely pleasant hummed between them but since im here why dont you tell me about it quinn accepted the glass from matt then shot him a look before he could speak why dont we let miss ohurley fill me in since its her problem as an agent matt knew when to negotiate and when to back off fine ill just fill my mouth with a few of these canapés he sat leaving them to each other ive been getting some annoying phone calls she said it casually but the tension showed briefly in the way her fingers curled and uncurled quinn was used to picking up on small details at the moment he noticed that her hands were quite small and narrow with long fingers the rounded tips painted with clear lacquer the fingers themselves were never quite still phone calls and letters she moved her shoulders and the satin whispered quietly it started about six weeks ago obscene phone calls chantel lifted her chin unable to resist the urge to look down her small straight nose i suppose that would depend on your definition of obscene yours might be quite different than mine humor touched his eyes and made them strangely appealing she wondered fleetingly how many woman had stepped into his lions den and been devoured im sure it is go on at first at first you could say i was almost amused it seemed harmless enough though annoying then she moistened her lips and brought the cigarette to them then he became a bit bolder more explicit it made me uneasy you should change your number ive done that the phone calls stopped for about a week they started again today as he leaned back quinn sampled the vodka like her it was a quality brand you recognize the voice no he whispers you could change your number again the ice clinked in his glass as he shrugged or have the police put a tap on it im tired of changing my number with quick impatience she stubbed out the cigarette and i dont want the police i prefer to keep this discreet matt seems to think youre the answer to that quinn drank again the room was done in different shades of white but it wasnt virginal the very absence of color with her at the center was outrageously alluring he was sure she knew it in every one of her films she had acted the role of a woman who deliberately played on a mans needs his weaknesses his most private dreams quinn could drum up little sympathy for a woman who deliberately projected an image designed to arouse men then complained about a few harmless phone calls miss ohurley youre probably aware that men who make these kind of calls dont do anything but talk id suggest you change your number again then have one of your servants answer the phone for a while until he gets tired of it quinn matt swirled his own drink he had a habit of keeping in motion when under pressure his hands his feet now he cleared his throat and tried to settle thats not much help she can hire a bodyguard if it makes her feel better her security here could certainly be tightened maybe i need barbed wire vicious guard dogs chantel interjected and rose thats the price you pay quinn told her coolly for being what you are what i am her eyes already a vivid searing blue sharpened oh i see i parade myself on the screen i dont dress in burlap and wear a veil over my face therefore i asked for what i got and i deserve it her cool beauty was compelling but her passionate outburst was like seeing fire in ice quinn ignored the tightening in his gut and shrugged thats close enough thank you for your time she said and turned away before she could stop herself she was whirling back why dont you take a walk into the twentieth century just because a woman is attractive and doesnt disguise the fact doesnt mean she deserves to be abused verbally physically or emotionally i dont believe i said an attractive woman or any woman deserves abuse quinn commented his careless tone only stoked the fires just because im an actress and sexuality is part of my craft doesnt mean im fair game for any man who wants a piece of me if i play the part of a murderer it doesnt mean i should go on trial you appeal to a mans most primitive fantasies miss ohurley and you do it in technicolor theres bound to be a little backwash so i should just take my medicine she murmured youre an idiot youre the kind of man who wears his brain below his belt the kind who thinks if a woman agrees to have dinner with him she should pay for it with a romp between the sheets well i can pay for my own dinner mr doran and i can handle my own problems im sure you can find the door chantel matt began but she turned on him like a cat ill just have a few more canapés he muttered miss ohurley what chantel spun around to face her tall aging majordomo then drew in a long cleansing breath yes marsh what is it it was the tone that had quinn narrowing his eyes there was an underlying straightforward quality to it that ignored any domestic caste system and spoke human to human though nerves had her body strung tight she smiled at the old man these were just delivered for you thank you chantel crossed the room to him and took the vase of daylilies i wont need you any more tonight marsh very good miss stepping behind quinn she went to a table by the windows why dont you show your friend out matt i dont think she had the card in her hands and was staring at it her fingers trembled momentarily before she crushed the paper before she could drop it on the floor quinn had her wrist and was slowly drawing the mangled note from her what he read made his stomach tighten this time in disgust no more than i deserve chantels voice was cold almost detached but her eyes when quinn looked into them were terrified he slipped the paper into his pocket as he took her arm why dont you sit down was it another one matt started toward them but quinn motioned to the bar get her a brandy i dont want a drink i dont want to sit down i want you to go when she started to pull her arm away quinn merely tightened his hold and led her to the sofa how often do you get one of these nearly every day she picked up a cigarette then put it back all of them as direct no she took the brandy and sipped at it hating to admit she needed it that started a couple of weeks ago what did you do with the notes i tossed out the first few then when the tone started to change i was going to burn them the brandy warmed her but did nothing to settle her i kept them im not sure why i suppose i thought i should have them if things got out of hand call your servant back in i want to ask him some questions and go get the other letters his orders did what the brandy hadnt chantel felt her spine straighten its none of your concern mr doran weve already settled that this just unsettled it he drew the paper out of his pocket and watched her slight but definite recoil i dont want your help i didnt say id give it yet he let that hang as they continued to stare at each other the letters unless youve got a better idea what to do about all this at that moment at that one shimmering moment she despised him she could have hidden it she was skilled enough she didnt bother before she could speak matt laid a hand on her shoulder his fingers moved as restlessly as hers please chantel think before you say anything she kept her eyes on quinns i wouldnt want to say what im thinking when his lips curved again she gritted her teeth or perhaps i would chantel matt gave her shoulder a light squeeze i dont like ultimatums but if we cant deal with quinn im going to call the police no he continued when her head shot back i mean it youre a smart woman be practical she hated being backed into a corner quinn could see it she was a woman who insisted on having the choice and the control in her own hands it was something he could admire even respect maybe just maybe there was more to chantel ohurley than met the eye all right well do it your way for now she rose at once regal and strong dont badger marsh she met quinns eyes levelly hes old and getting frail i dont want him upset i havent kicked a dog all day quinn told her only small children and kittens she murmured then swept from the room quite a woman your client shes all of that matt agreed and shes scared right down to her toes she doesnt scare easily i bet she doesnt quinn took out a cigarette and tapped it idly against the pack he was forced to admit that he had thought she was simply dramatizing the few sentences printed on the card had changed his mind they were just short of vile for quinn the line of demarcation between right and wrong was flexible but the card fell well on the wrong side still before he decided just how much he wanted to be involved there were a few things he had to know he glanced back at matt watching him pace just how close are the two of you we have a solid mutually advantageous arrangement matt gave quinn a sober smile and she doesnt sleep with me youre slipping she knows what she wants and what she doesnt want she wanted an agent but i do care about her he cast a worried look at the doorway shes already gone through enough enough of what with a shake of his head matt sat again another story and nothing to do with this are you going to be able to help her quinn drew slowly on his cigarette i dont know excuse me marsh stood in the doorway still dressed in his black suit and starched collar miss ohurley said you wanted to speak with me i wondered if you could tell me about the person who delivered the flowers quinn gestured toward them and watched the old man squint nearsighted he thought they were delivered by a young man eighteen perhaps twenty he rang from the gate and explained that he had a delivery for miss ohurley was he wearing a uniform marshs brows knit as he concentrated i dont believe so i cant say for certain did you happen to see his car no sir i took the flowers at the back door would you recognize him if you saw him again perhaps i think i might thank you marsh marsh hesitated then remembering his position he bowed stiffly very good sir as he walked back into the hallway quinn heard chantel stop him for a brief murmured conversation her voice he noticed was soothing from a distance quiet and easy up close its smoky quality could twine around a mans nerve endings and make him want she came back in carrying a small pack of letters im sure youll find it fascinating reading she said as she tossed them into quinns lap my guess is its close to the technique you use to court women shed regained her spirit quinn decided as he ignored her and opened the first envelope the address on it like the text inside was printed in small block letters the paper was dimestore quality he could work for weeks and never trace it the first few notes he read were fawning in their admiration and subtly suggestive and well written quinn added silently the work of an educated person as he went on the prose and syntax remained good but the content deteriorated even a man who had seen and done what he had felt instant distaste the writer went into graphic and pitiless detail outlining his fantasies his needs and his intentions the last few letters added veiled hints that the writer was close by watching waiting when hed finished quinn stacked the letters in a neat pile you sure you dont want the cops in on this chantel had seated herself across from him and now she folded her hands in her lap she didnt like him she told herself she didnt like the way he looked the way he moved she didnt like the fact that his voice was almost poetic so very different from his livedin face so why if all this was true did she feel as though she wanted even needed his help she kept her eyes on his sometimes you made bargains with the devil no i dont want the police i dont want publicity on this what i want is for this man to be found and stopped quinn rose and poured himself another drink both the glasses and ice bucket were rosenthal he appreciated elegant things just as he appreciated the cruder things in life beer from a bottle or wine from a crystal glass it hardly mattered as long as your thirst was quenched he appreciated beauty but he wasnt duped by it an outer shell meant nothing hed shed plenty of his own when the occasion had called for it chantel ohurley had beauty had elegance if he took the job by the very nature of it he was bound to discover how much was shell how much was substance that was what had him hesitating he understood just how dangerous knowledge of another person could be to all involved he could control the attraction he felt for her looks as long as he chose to his mood on that could change from day to day what he wouldnt control had never been able to control was his curiosity as to what lay beneath the skin swallowing his vodka he turned back around she was sitting back in her chair and one would have thought from looking at her that she was relaxed even aloof the fingers on her left hand moved just a little curling together spreading apart as if she had managed to center her nerves only there he shrugged and matched his mood to hers five hundred a day plus expenses she lifted a brow it was the only movement she made with it she conveyed a range of feeling amusement consideration and dislike what it didnt show was the surge of relief that passed through her thats a princely sum mr doran youll get your moneys worth thats something i insist on leaning back she steepled her fingers under her chin her wrists were slender and her hands were as delicate as her face a diamond flashed on her right hand then became as white and cool as the rest of her just what do i get for five hundred a day plus expenses his lips curved just before he brought the glass to them you get me miss ohurley she smiled a little sparring helped she was back in control again and the fear was ebbing interesting the look she sent him was designed to pin a man to the wall and make him beg quinn felt the punch and acknowledged the power what do i do with you youve got it backward he walked to her then stopping by her chair to lean close she caught a hint of scent not cologne not soap or powder but raw and completely comfortable masculinity though she didnt retreat from it she braced herself recognizing her own attraction just what do i have backward mr doran she looked like a painting one he thought hed seen in the louvre a lifetime ago its what i do with you five hundred a day angel and your trust thats my price you pay it and you get twentyfourhour protection starting with one of my men posted as a guard at that gate of yours if i already have the gate why do i need a guard did it ever occur to you that a gate doesnt do a hell of a lot of good if youre going to open it up to anyone who asks what didnt occur to me was that id have to lock myself in get used to it because whoevers sending you flowers doesnt have a clean bill of health panic came and went in her eyes he gave her points for how quickly she mastered it im aware of that i need your schedule starting tomorrow one of my men goes with you every time you stick your pretty nose out the door no the ohurley stubbornness came through as she rose to face him for five hundred a day i want you doran youre the one matt trusts and youre the one im paying for they stood close very close he could smell the scent that seemed to seep through her pores neither quiet nor subtle the perfection of her face could take a mans breath away her hair swept back from it in a glorious cascade like an angels if a man touched it would he find heaven or be cast from the clouds when it came to that quinn wouldnt worry about the consequences you might regret it he murmured then smiled slowly so she might chantel already knew that but pride wouldnt let her back down i pay for you mr doran thats the deal youre the boss he lifted his drink to her two of my men will come by in the morning to wire the phone i dont want i dont take the job if you tie my hands his easy smile was gone as quickly as it had formed we tap the phone maybe he says something to give himself away maybe we get lucky and trace it just think of us as doctors he smiled at her again enjoying himself if you want to say something intimate to one of your friends dont worry weve heard it all and more temper had always been the most difficult of her emotions to master it surged up and was fought back down before she spoke again im quite sure you have what else ill take the letters with me its doubtful well be able to trace the paper but well give it a shot now is there anyone you know who you think could be doing this no the answer came immediately and with complete confidence he decided to run a check on everyone close to her dump anyone in the last few months that may be carrying a torch for you thousands cute he drew a pad and the stub of a pencil out of his pocket i need the names of who youve slept with well go back three months go to hell she said sweetly then started to sit he caught her by the wrist look im not going to play games with you im not personally interested in how many men youve had in your bed this is business thats right she tossed her head back my business her skin was warmer than it looked that was something he filed away to think about later one of them might just have gone off the deep end maybe you slept with him a couple times and it gave him delusions of grandeur think about it this all started six weeks ago so who were you with before that no one annoyance covered his face as he tightened his hold give me a break angel i havent got all night i said no one she yanked her arm away for a moment she wished she could rattle off a dozen names two dozen names just to see him sweat believe whatever you like i tell you what i dont believe and thats that you spend your evenings alone darning socks i dont jump into bed with every man who passes within five feet of me in a calculated move she dropped her gaze down as if measuring the distance between them it looks like about ten inches to me he murmured sorry to disappoint you but i have to be interested first and i havent been besides ive been working and it tends to take up a great deal of my time unconsciously she rubbed at her wrist where his fingers had pressed satisfied come on quinn ease off feeling trapped in the middle matt moved over and put an arm around chantels shoulders shes had it rough enough its not my job to hold her hand quinn scooped up the letters annoyed by the twinge of selfdisgust he felt ill be back tomorrow what time do you get up fivefifteen she couldnt resist a smirk when he only stared at her i leave for the studio at five fortyfive thats am mr doran can you handle it you just write the check fifteen hundred in advance youll have it good night mr doran its been unusual do yourself a favor and dont answer your phone any more tonight with that he nodded to matt and strode out chantel waited for the sound of the door closing behind him she went to the coffee table and drew out another cigarette your friends a bastard matt always has been he agreed but hes the best chapter three contents prev next chantel had thought she wouldnt sleep the house had seemed so enormous around her and so enormously quiet but she had climbed into bed with a vision of quinn doran hovering in her mind just the thought of him made her furious insulted her intelligence nipped at her ego and made her feel safe she slept only six hours but she slept deeply music woke her pouring from the wall unit beside the bed she rolled over surrounded by pillows covered with ivory linen sheets and nothing else the bed had been one of the first luxuries she had indulged herself with almost before she could afford it it was huge and old with a carved cherrywood headboard that had made her think of princesses waking up from a hundred years of sleep growing up she had invariably slept in hotel beds and shed decided that a sinfully beautiful bed was something she deserved to indulge herself in when she signed her first film contract a small part in a fulllength feature had been enough to pin her hopes on years later when she awoke in the antique fourposter it still gave her the same satisfaction she thought back to the time when she had still lived in the small apartment in la the bed had taken up the entire room and she had had to crawl over it to reach the doorway her two sisters had visited once and the three of them had stretched across it and talked and giggled for hours she wished they could be with her now the feeling of safety would be more tangible shed nearly told maddy about the letters and calls when shed gone to new york a few weeks before part of her had wanted to needed to but maddy had been so preoccupied shed been entitled chantel reminded herself as she sat up and stretched her play had been nearly ready to open and her heart had been wrapped up in the man who was backing it all for a good cause chantel thought with a smile the play was a smash and maddy was planning her wedding hed better be good to her chantel thought as the old protective instinct rose up in her she had had to watch one sister go through a miserable marriage she couldnt bear it if maddy was hurt as well maddy would be fine she reassured herself just as abby was fine they had both found the right man at the right time so she had one sister planning a wedding and the other preparing for the birth of her third child she couldnt spoil all that by dumping her problems on them now besides she was the eldest triplet if only by a matter of minutes to chantel that meant that she had the responsibility to be the strongest they would be there for her of course just as she would be there for them but she was the oldest theyd come so far chantel sat in the middle of the lush bed and looked around a room that was larger than the whole of her first apartment in california why was it she felt as though she still had so far to go now wasnt the time for philosophizing after turning up the volume on the radio she climbed out of bed and prepared to face another day on the set quinn wasnt accustomed to rising before dawn it was much more his style to see the night through and find his bed at sunrise rather than climbing out of it at that hour not that he didnt appreciate an la sunrise it was simply more to his taste to watch the sky take on color after a night of celebration in bed or out he drove across town under a pinkandmauve sky casting an occasional look of mild contempt at a jogger designer sweat suits werent his style if he wanted to tone up he went to the gym and not one of those pastelwalled spas where they piped in classical music a real gym you didnt see cute leotards there and the sweat ran as free and healthy as the fourletter words a mans world and no one drank carrot juice frappe a woman like chantel ohurley wouldnt poke her milliondollar nose through the front door quinn shifted in his seat and scowled at nothing in particular he couldnt remember the last time a woman had made him uncomfortable chantels looks were designed to make a man squirm and ache the hell of it was she knew it and quinn was certain enjoyed it he couldnt let that be a problem she was paying him to do a job the only thing he could be concerned about from this point on was her security the check she would give him entitled her to the best and he was the best besides he didnt care for the content of the letters shed shown him not that quinn was a supporter of the womens movement to his way of thinking men and women were different end of story if a woman walking by a construction site was insulted because she got a few whistles or invitations he figured she should walk someplace else after all that was just good clean fun thered been nothing clean or fun in the letters though and chantel hadnt looked insulted either if he knew anything quinn knew what genuine fear looked like sooner or later he would find out who had written them that would take patience in the meantime hed give chantel the roundtheclock protection she was paying for remembering her face quinn acknowledged that that would take willpower he had it he thought with a shrug as he pulled up to the iron gates besides chances were that shed look like a hag at this hour of the morning he reached out the window and leaned on the buzzer yes the frown moved into his eyes even in one word chantels voice was easily recognizable he hadnt expected her to answer the intercom herself doran he said curtly youre prompt you get what you pay for there was no answer but the gates slowly swung open quinn cruised through them then stopped to make certain they shut behind him in the daylight he got a better look at the lay of the land anyone determined enough could find his way over the wall he and a partner had once scaled a sheer cliff in afghanistan with nothing more than rope and nerve the trees that flowered over the lawn sent up a sweet scent and would provide morethanadequate cover for an intruder he was going to have to get a good look at the alarm system in the house though he knew anything that could be put in could be deactivated quinn pulled up just beyond the steps then got out to lean on the hood of his car you couldnt hear any traffic from here just the sound of birds he took out a cigarette a glance around showed him a few floodlights maybe a dozen ground lights obviously placed more for aesthetic purposes than for added security after a look at his watch quinn decided to walk around the house and check a few things out for himself perhaps out of spite chantel decided to let quinn cool his heels outside while she dallied in her dressing room under other circumstances she might have invited him in for a quick cup of coffee before the limo arrived she wasnt feeling gracious instead she took her time bundling her hair back from her face checking the contents of her bag then writing a few instructions for her maid when the buzzer from the gate rang again she spoke to her driver then gathered up her script she turned toward the bedroom and walked into quinn he watched initial shock turn to anger what the hell are you doing in here just checked out your security system he leaned against the doorway and noted with a quick twinge that regardless of the hour she looked fantastic its pitiful a boy scout with two merit badges could get past it chantel settled the strap of her bag on her shoulder and promised herself she would pay matt back if it was the last thing she ever did when it was installed i was assured it was the best on the market supermarket maybe ill have my men beef it up shed been born practical and the years had done nothing to change that how much dont know for sure until theyre into it three to five id say thousand sure like i said you get what you pay for she murmured walking around him all right mr doran you go right ahead as she spoke she moved to her nightstand but the next time you decide to check out the system i wouldnt advise you sneaking into my bedroom when she turned she had a pearlhandled her hand i tend to be nervous quinn regarded the gun with a raised brow hed been on the wrong end of one plenty of times before know how to use one of those angel you just pull this little trigger here she smiled of course my aims terrible id point at your leg and end up shooting you right through the brain theres only one rule about guns he began then scowled over her shoulder when chantel turned to look he was on her with a move too quick to judge he had the gun in his hand and her beneath him on the bed the rule is dont point one unless you intend to use it she didnt squirm beneath him but lay still letting the heat of fury and dislike pour out with a casual gesture he flipped open the pistols chamber its not loaded of course its not i wouldnt keep a loaded gun in the house a guns not a souvenir he closed it again before he looked down at her her face was untouched by makeup and it was as beautiful as it was furious despite himself quinn found the combination very much to his liking her body was small and strong beneath his not as cushioned and feminine as hed expected but her scent was there as it had been the night before outrageously feminine nice bed he murmured unable to resist the urge to sweep his gaze down to her mouth he thought but couldnt be sure that her heartbeat increased your approval means everything to me mr doran now if you dont mind i have to get to work how many other men had pinned her between their bodies and this wide firm mattress how many other men had felt this wild edgy flare of desire both thoughts ran through his head before he could stop them because they did he rolled aside and yanked her to her feet but she was still close maybe well keep this business he told her quietly and maybe we wont though her pulse was racing chantel wasnt dishonest enough to blame it on temper desire was something she understood even if she had rarely felt it for a man it was also something that could be controlled instinct warned her that it was vital to do that now and to continue to do so when it applied to quinn you tempt me to put bullets in that gun mr doran it wouldnt hurt quinn dropped it back in her bedside drawer and make it quinn angel after all weve been to bed together taking her arm he escorted her downstairs and outside good morning robert chantel smiled at her driver as he opened the back door of the limo mr doran will be accompanying me to the studio for a few days very good miss ohurley quinn didnt miss the wistful look the driver sent him before they were closed in behind smoked glass how does it feel to infatuate the male of the species chantel settled back hes just a boy does that make a difference behind her dark glasses chantel shut her eyes oh i forgot im one of those heartless women who tease and flaunt then toss men aside after ive drained them like empty pop bottles amused quinn stretched out long legs that pretty much covers it you have a remarkable disdain for women mr doran no youre wrong women happen to be one of my favorite pastimes past chantel caught herself before she sputtered she drew her glasses completely off wishing she could see if he was baiting her or speaking the simple truth wanting to believe the worst of him she went with the latter youre a classic chauvinist mr doran id thought your species nearly extinct were a hardy breed angel he pushed a button and watched the compact bar rotate toward him quinn considered mixing a bloody mary but settled for straight orange juice replacing her glasses chantel decided against beating her head against a brick wall i prefer not to introduce you as my bodyguard i can do without that sort of speculation fine how do you want to handle it theyll just assume youre my lover coolly she took the glass of juice from him and sipped im accustomed to that sort of speculation i bet its your game play it any way you want she handed him back the glass i intend to and what will you do my job as they passed through the studio gates he drained the glass you just smile pretty at the cameras angel and dont worry about it she found that her jaw was tensed so tightly it hurt acting on impulse chantel turned to him and curled her fingers into his shirt oh quinn its just that im so frightened im so very frightened not knowing from one minute to the next if im safe her voice broke as she leaned closer i cant tell you what it means to me just to know youll be there protecting me im defenseless vulnerable and youre so strong she was close so close he could see her eyes flutter shut behind the tinted glasses her body trembled lightly as she leaned into him desire flared along with a need to comfort and protect she was soft pliant and helpless as he drew her nearer her scent tangled around his senses until his head throbbed with it you dont have to worry he murmured im going to take care of you quinn her head tilted up until her lips were only a whisper away from his when she felt him tense she jerked back and pressed something into his hand your check she said carelessly then stepped out of the limo quinn sat for a full ten seconds and wondered why hed never entertained thoughts of strangling a woman before when he stepped out beside her he curled his fingers around her arm youre good very very good yes i am she gave him a slow easy smile and i get much better as chantel went through her morning routine of makeup and hairstyling quinn simply observed there were a dozen people chantel came in contact with during the first hour alone there were other actors technicians and a parade of assistants hed want a list and he was beginning to realize just how extensive it would be whoever was hounding her obviously knew her routine that made the people she worked with his priority miss ah chantel larry stopped by her side with a cup of fresh coffee oh thanks you read my mind he preened a bit pleased i knew the hair was going to take longer this morning he watched as the stylist patiently threaded pearls through the alreadycomplicated arrangement youre going to be just beautiful for the ballroom scene a far cry from yesterday she sipped the coffee if theyd watered me one more time id have melted miss rothschild said the dailies were great i checked thanks she caught sight of quinns reflection in the mirror and decided that moment was as good a time as any larry this is quinn doran a friend of mine only years of training kept her from choking on the word as she held a hand over her shoulder for quinns larrys my right hand and often my left as well quinns going to watch the filming for a few days oh well larry cleared his throat thats nice quinn saw that the young man thought it was anything but another conquest he thought but he couldnt afford to feel sympathy only suspicion ill keep out of the way quinn promised making the most of it by rubbing his thumb over chantels knuckles i just want to see chantel at work isnt that sweet chantel said with a brilliant smile quinns between jobs at the moment and has time on his hands now dont be sensitive darling she gave his hand a pat before drawing hers away we all understand how difficult the job market is especially for botanists satisfied chantel rose i have to get into costume theyve scheduled publicity shots this morning larry told her after an uncertain glance at quinn as soon as youre ready youre supposed to go to the ballroom set fine ill go with you darling quinn slipped an arm around her shoulders and squeezed just a few degrees too hard you might need some help with buttons and snaps ease up doran she muttered as they walked away im wearing a strapless dress for this scene and i cant afford the bruises you tempt me to put them where they wont show a botanist ive always been attracted to the sensitive introspective type like larry hes my assistant leave him alone dont tell me how to do my job hes a nice boy he came with excellent references and how long ago annoyed chantel yanked open the door of her dressing room about three months when the door shut at his back quinn drew out a notebook lets have his full name larry washington but i dont see you dont have to what about the makeup guy george dont be absurd hes old enough to be my grandfather quinn merely shifted his gaze until it met hers the name angel theres no age limit on a disturbed mind she muttered it then swept back into the private dressing alcove i dont like the way you work doran ill notify the complaint department lowering to the arm of a chair he took a quick interested look around her dressing room like her home it was meticulously decorated in white on white while were at it give me the names of the rest of the men you deal with on the set there was a brief pregnant pause all of them thats right thats impossible she told him i couldnt possibly remember everyone oh most by sight and by first name but not everything about everyone then find out i have a job to do i cant so do i get me the names chantel yanked up the zipper at her back and scowled at the wall that separated them ill see if larry can get me a list no you wont i dont want to rouse anyones suspicions all right all right for a moment she was convinced the cure was more trouble than the problem then she remembered the contents of the last note like it or not she needed quinn the assistant directors name is amos leery the cinematographers chuck powers and damn it they didnt walk into town yesterday theyve been in the business for years they have families what difference does that make an obsessions an obsession when she walked back into the room quinn was still sitting scribbling in his notebook what about the director the directors a woman chantel slipped off her watch and laid it aside i think we can rule her out what about the he made the mistake of looking up as he spoke the words stopped because his thought processes simply disintegrated she was wearing red a hot vibrant red that seemed to lick at her skin the dress scooped low and snug at her breasts then followed the lines of her body the skirt hung straight hitched up on one side nearly to the hip where it was secured by a circlet of glittering stones his mouth went suddenly and completely dry chantel saw the look recognized it normally it would have made her smile either with pleasure or in automatic response now she found she couldnt because her heart was thudding too hard he rose slowly and she stepped back it wouldnt occur to her until much later that it was the first time in her life she had retreated from a man ill have to give you the rest later she said quickly theyll be waiting for me on set what are you supposed to be in that he didnt take another step toward her selfpreservation held him back chantel moistened her lips a woman out for revenge he looked at her again gradually up then down then up again until their eyes met id say you get it making a conscious effort she drew in a breath then let it out again play the role she told herself it was always possible to play the role like it deliberately she turned a slow circle revealing the daring plunge at the back its a bit much for seventhirty in the morning think so she smiled more comfortable now wait until you see the hardware that goes with it cartiers lending us a necklace and earrings two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of all that glitters well have two armed guards and a very nervous jeweler here shortly why not use paste it shines too because the real thing makes for better publicity coming he stopped her at the door with just a fingertip on her bare shoulder each of them felt the jolt one question you wear anything under that she managed another smile only because her hand was already on the knob this is hollywood mr doran we leave little details like that up to your imagination she stepped out hoping the constriction in her chest would ease before the first take by noon quinn had been forced to revise his opinion of chantel at least in one area she wasnt the pampered temperamental prima donna he had expected she worked like a horse a thoroughbred perhaps but she went through her paces time and time again without complaint shed been gracious to the photographers even when the session had run on for ninety minutes she hadnt snapped at the makeup artist as one of her costars had when it had been time for yet another retouch the temperature on the set was sizzling thanks to the lights but she didnt wilt between takes she sipped from an everpresent glass of mineral water unable to sit because wardrobe had fussed about creases in her costume two armed guards kept their eyes trained on her and on the quarter million in jewels she wore they suited her he was forced to admit the thick gold band crusted with diamonds and rubies that circled her neck the symphony of diamonds and hot red stones that dripped from her ears she wore them with the ease of a woman who knew she deserved them quinn stayed well off the set and wondered how the actors could take the sheer monotony of repetition incredible isnt it quinn turned his head and glanced at the tall graying man beside him whats that how it takes them hours and hours to film a twominute scene he pulled out a thin black cigarette and lighted it from the butt of another i dont know why i come it makes me nervous but i cant stay away while they dissect my brainchid quinn lifted a brow no i suppose not he drew in smoke deeply before he smiled im not mad or perhaps i am i wrote the screenplay rather i wrote what it appears this will loosely resemble he offered a wellkept rather thin hand james brewster quinn doran yes i know youre miss ohurleys friend he smiled again with a negligent shrug word travels fast in small towns shes quite brilliant isnt she i dont know much about it oh i assure you she is there was really no one else who could be hailey cold vindictive clawing and at the same time vulnerable and desperate for love one of the few things i dont worry about as far as this little extravaganza goes is chantels interpretation of hailey she seems to know what shes doing more she feels what shes doing brewster took another quick puff as the crew set up for the next take it gives me enormous pleasure just to watch her quinn slipped his hands into his pockets and mentally added brewster to his growing list of men to check out shes an extraordinarily beautiful woman that goes without saying but then to use a cliché thats only skin deep its whats inside chantel ohurley that fascinates quinns eyes narrowed fractionally and whats that i would say mr doran that every man would have to discover that for himself the director called for quiet and brewster lapsed into a nervous silence quinn contemplated his own considerations she did seem to feel the part the key scene called for her to confront her lover three years after he had left her alone and abandoned even after a half a dozen takes her eyes would frost over on cue her voice would take on just the necessary hint of venom on a dance floor crowded with people she set out to seduce and humiliate chantel did both with such apparent ease that quinn felt she must enjoy it even to him a man whod learned how to look beyond illusions it seemed that she was only aware of the man in whose arms she danced there might not have been any cameras any technicians any dollies or lifts it went on for hours but quinn was patient it interested him to see that whenever a break lasted longer than five minutes her assistant appeared at her elbow with a fresh glass of mineral water more than once the assistant director came over to take her hand and murmur to her the makeup artist retouched her face time and again as though it were a rare canvas it was after seven before they wrapped they had taken an hour for lunch and apart from that quinn calculated she had been on her feet for fourteen hours all in all he decided hed rather spend eight hours digging ditches ever think of another line of work quinn asked her as they closed themselves in her dressing room again oh no chantel eased out of her shoes and felt her arches cramp instantly i love the glamour where was it the smile came automatically you catch on fast if shed called for one more take just one more i was going to ask you to shoot her in the knee get the zipper for me will you my arms are like rubber thats because you had them wrapped around carter for most of the day just one of the perks of the job she arched her back as quinn brought the zipper down below her hips hes okay if you like the smooth posterboy type she looked over her shoulder with a half smile i adore them ever think it might be carter whos sending you flowers she stiffened a bit then walked into the dressing area hes too busy trying to untangle himself from his third wife besides ive known him for years people change or do the unexpected and you spend several hours a day in a clinch with him thats work nice work if you can get it in any case you shouldnt trust anyone except you thats right brewster seemed pretty taken with you too brewster the writer really amused chantel walked back in still buttoning her blouse james is much more interested in his characters than the people who play them and hes been happily married for twentyodd years dont you ever read the gossip columns never miss them he stopped in the act of reaching for a cigarette when she sat abruptly and grabbed her foot problem its always after you take those damn things off that youre in agony she winced swore and kneaded i can tell you it was a man who invented the high heel the same one who invented the bra its you women who wear the things he pointed out but knelt down and took her foot in his hand got you in the arch yes but her protest died on her lips as he began to press with a long sincere sigh she leaned back yes thats wonderful youve missed your calling you could make a fortune as a masseur you should see what i could do for the rest of you she opened one eye well just stick with the feet thanks if i were a few inches taller or sean a few inches shorter i could have gotten away with flats for most of the shots ill tell you this his love scenes with you seemed pretty sincere theyre supposed to bonetired she opened both eyes look were professionals it looked that way because we played it that way not because either one of us has any physical interest in the other it looked like interest from my angle especially when he put his hand on your try another tune doran i think youre about to tell me how to do my job again id like you to do your job she shot back instead of harping on a man just because hes good at his work just checking him out angel i dont want my friends and associates spied on if you want someone whos afraid to step on toes you hired the wrong man ive come to that conclusion several times myself she couldnt have said why her temper was building so quickly but his hands moving slowly up and down the arch of her foot were doing things they shouldnt to her system she wanted him out and gone why dont you take a walk doran she jerked her foot away youre just not my style rising she stepped around him you can keep the change fine he was as angry as she and just as baffled as to the cause he only knew that for one quick moment hed felt something for her something soft and easy it was gone now erased as if it had never been in its place was the anger and a need just as strong that demanded physical release i might as well take a bonus while im at it he grabbed her shed known he wouldnt be gentle his hand tangled in her hair as his mouth came down on hers shed known he would show little finesse what she hadnt known or hadnt admitted was that she could respond so completely no man held her when she didnt choose to be held no man took from her what she didnt willingly offer yet he was holding her and she found nothing within herself to make him stop his face was rough against her and his fingers dug into her skin as he held her close defending herself should have been simple even automatic yet she didnt struggle in his arms her knees trembled but she didnt even feel it everything was bound up in the sensation of his mouth on hers and the explosion of the taste of him delectable her lips parted and invited him in he rarely worried about consequences and even less frequently questioned his instincts when he had felt the need to touch her to take her this way he had done so he was already paying for it she was more than he had imagined she could be softer smoother warmer it wasnt an image he held in his arms but a passionate hotblooded woman even as he discovered and explored the flavor and texture of her lips he understood that he needed more that was the trap and hed fallen right into it he drew her away because he wanted to see her face after she had tasted him her eyes opened slowly so dark so very blue that for an instant he was more vulnerable to her than either of them could have guessed he felt the need shift to an ache and the ache to uncertainty before he pulled himself back its been an interesting day angel and one he was afraid he wouldnt easily forget why dont you tell matt to find you somebody else it had been a long time since she had felt rejection it hurt more than she remembered training and pride had her straightening and kept her voice icy cool if youve finished your show of male dominance you can go the image was back even before her pulse had started to level if i hear of someone who needs a bodyguard for their poodle ill give them your card chantel turned away when the phone rang she picked up the receiver then looked over her shoulder until she saw quinn open the door with a toss of her head she brought it back to her ear yes hello the voice was too familiar now and a degree more frightening ive waited all day to talk to you youre so beautiful so exciting all day ive been imagining how we would why dont you stop control snapped as she shouted into the phone why dont you just leave me alone before she could slam the receiver down quinn snatched it out of her hand dont be angry the edgy desperation in the voice had him tensing i love you i can make you happy happier than youve ever been miss ohurleys happier without you quinn said calmly you really should stop bothering her there was a long silence and quinn heard the breathing on the other end of the phone grow heavier she doesnt need you she needs me she needs me the voice repeated before the connection was broken quietly quinn replaced the receiver chantels back was to him but after a moment she turned around he could see that shed worked hard even in those few moments to regain her composure but her skin was as white as the room around them i thought youd gone so did i he made it a policy never to apologize for his actions it was not that he didnt believe he could be wrong just that apologies tended to weaken his position in this case he decided to come as close as possible without crossing the line look we dont have to like each other much to get this job done and i dont like to leave things before theyre finished why dont we just forget about what happened before she didnt care for compromises any more than quinn did for apologies but she cared less for the thought of going on alone to satisfy both her needs and her pride she gave him a bland smile did something happen before he acknowledged the gibe with a slight nod not a thing lets get out of here chapter four contents prev next chantel had long ago acknowledged that one couldnt have both privacy and fame in order to achieve and maintain the second the first almost invariably had to be sacrificed if she went out for a quiet dinner with a friend she would read about it the next day if she danced with another celebrity there would be pictures and speculation before the music stopped according to the press her life was full of men full of wild sizzling romance and blistering affairs she accepted that she was also shrewd enough to know that if she were rude or belligerent to the paparazzi both her reputation and her photographs would be unflattering so she was willing within reason to court them and present a glamorous and unflappable image to the public but the tap on her phone and the guard at her gate were entirely different they werent part of the creamy silkanddiamonds mystique shed chosen to develop if she had the choice every time that thought ran through her head chantel gritted her teeth and reminded herself that she didnt she should be grateful it was difficult to acknowledge that fact but she knew she should be since the phone call in her dressing room there had been nothing no letters no flowers no whispering voice she told herself she should be relieved instead she felt as though she were waiting for the other shoe to drop during the week her work kept her too busy to think she could for a few hours a day plunge herself into haileys character and her problems as long as the film was rolling and the pressure was on it was difficult to think of her own personal crises work had gotten her through other rough periods she counted on its doing the same for her now but it was saturday and the film was going smoothly so she had no call normally she treasured mornings when she could lounge in bed for a few extra hours indulging in the things that were reported to be part of her everyday life by seven she was awake disgusted she ordered herself back to sleep at sevenfifteen she was staring at the ceiling and thinking a great deal too much for her own peace of mind beautiful glamorous women were supposed to sleep until noon then pamper themselves with massages and facials shed have believed that herself if she hadnt been in the game so long tossing the covers aside she went into the office that adjoined her dressing room of all the rooms in her home this one and only this one showed the other side of her the furnishings though sophisticated were simple and functional the material for the curtains might have been imported from paris but the space as a whole was imbued with a sense of organization and practicality her desk had been purchased for its usefulness as well as its appearance and she did use it she also used the computer that rested on it it was true that she had an agent and personal manager a team of publicists and an assistant but chantel believed in keeping a handle on her own life her own business she knew what stocks she owned and the gross she received from the pictures shed made copies of her contracts were meticulously filed chantel didnt simply sign them she read them she went directly to her desk and ignoring her thick appointment book and the pile of phone messages left by her maid picked up a fat stack of papers there were three scripts she hadnt so much as glanced at the filming on strangers wouldnt last forever the sooner she started thinking about her next project the less idle time shed have chantel got back into bed propped the first script on her knees and told herself she would wait until eight oclock for coffee it only took half that time for her to discover that the first script was hopeless the story itself had a few things going for it but most of them were scenes with her naked wrapped in one passionate embrace after another she wasnt a prude but neither was she willing to use her body as a selling point for a mediocre script in any case she was tired of playing the vamp or the victim she tossed the script aside and picked up another it caught her from the first page a comedy at last someone had sent her an intelligent story that didnt rely exclusively on her sexuality to sell it not only was the dialogue sharp the plot had twist after twist and made her chuckle out loud the jokes were as much physical as verbal and would she knew exhaust her her character would make a fool of herself onscreen time after time shed end up with her face in the mud and chantel would love it bless you matt halfway through the script chantel hugged it to her breast he knew she wanted to do something at odds with the image they had both carefully created over the last six years it would be a risk would people pay to see her face with mud on it chantel was willing to bet they would happier than shed been in weeks chantel pushed the intercom button and ordered breakfast brought up she wasnt budging until she finished the last page and when she did she was going to call matt if she had to go to a casting call for this one she would if she had to read for the part shed read for it shed take a cut in salary if need be but this was going to be hers chantel snuggled back against the pillows brought up her knees and turned the next page when the knock came at her door she was totally absorbed she answered absently then began to chuckle as the character her character punched her way out of another crisis must be pretty funny stuff quinn commented chantels head whipped around the amusement in her eyes turned instantly to annoyance it was too bad she thought that he had to look so damn good a pity i didnt load that gun you wouldnt shoot a man whos bringing you breakfast in bed he moved across the room set the tray on her lap then made himself comfortable on the bed beside her he wore a tshirt and faded jeans and didnt seem to mind that his sneakers were on her handsewn spread what are you reading he asked then stretched out his legs and crossed his arms behind his head the stock market reports yeah i always get a kick out of them too the pillows carried her scent sexy exotic and alluring she was a bit rumpled from sleep her hair tumbling around her shoulders and down her back even in the strong morning light he couldnt find a single flaw on her face there were two skinny straps over her shoulders and a very little bit of lace low at her breasts he remembered what he shouldnt have what it felt like to hold her against him and kiss her until his mind went dim he plucked a piece of toast off the tray and reached for the jelly help yourself she muttered fighting the urge to inch away thanks he leaned over the tray as he spread on a healthy portion of jelly when his breath whispered warm over her bare shoulder she stiffened and reminded herself how much she disliked him like i said before this is a great bed when i get the bill for laundering the spread ill deduct it from your fee determined not to show any reaction chantel reached for the pot of coffee and poured a cup what can i do for you doran he nibbled on the toast and just looked at her the smile bloomed slowly very slowly dont embarrass yourself she told him and sipped the coffee while it was too hot when it scalded her tongue she decided she didnt simply dislike him she detested him ask a silly question he began then proceeded to pour himself a cup of coffee look im busy so if yeah i can see that i happen to be reading some scripts any good chantel drew a deep breath some men were more thickheaded than others she reminded herself perhaps if she humored him a little as a matter of fact yes i want to finish this one this morning so if weve business to discuss you going to chew up another man in this one patience chantel told herself it was compassionate to show patience to an idiot no as it happens this is a comedy a comedy he let out one quick laugh before he drank you her eyes narrowed dont push your luck doran come on angel yours isnt the kind of face that a man pushes a pie into its mud what in this case my face gets pushed in mud he chose a piece of melon from her bowl that id have to see im counting on several million people having your attitude with a natural flair she whipped the napkin from its ring and passed it to him you are after all the common man arent you as common as they come he said easily now why dont you tell me why youre here this morning with your feet on my bed and your hands in my breakfast just part of the service great coffee ill give your compliments to the chef now why dont you get to the point arent you going to eat doran okay he took a small folder out of the side basket of the tray and opened it i have a couple of preliminary reports thought youd be interested reports on what larry washington amos leery james brewster also have a bit on the makeup guy and your driver my driver youre investigating robert her appetite gone chantel pushed herself farther up in bed quinn saw dark rose silk beneath the lace and wondered how far down it went thats the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard angel dont you ever read mysteries the one you least suspect is always the one who done it im not paying you to play sam spade and im damned if i can see paying you to run investigations on people like robert and george after brief consideration quinn decided on a strawberry have you ever noticed how your robert looks at you the lace rose up then settled again with her breathing deliberately chantel tilted her head darling all men look at me like that he gave her a long stare before he sipped his coffee again even he had problems separating her act from reality since i have to start somewhere im starting with the men closest to you the next thing youll tell me is youre investigating matt when he said nothing she looked at him again you must be joking matts a man quinn finished for her you just said that was all it takes furious chantel picked up the tray then dumped it in his lap coffee sloshed over the rims of the cups look lets just stop this right now im not going to have people i care about spied on and embarrassed matts the closest friend i have and i was under the impression he was your friend too this is business lets say our business is concluded the calls have stopped and so have the letters for a whole fortyeight hours thats enough for me ill pay your fee through today and well she broke off the words sticking in her throat as the phone beside the bed began to ring without realizing it chantel found her hand in quinns her fingers locked tight theyll pick it up downstairs he murmured dont panic if its him just keep calm try to get him to talk to stay on the line as long as possible we need time to run a trace when the intercom buzzed she jumped pull yourself together chantel you can handle it working at keeping her breathing steady chantel spoke into the intercom yes theres a man on the line miss ohurley he wont give his name but he says its important shall i tell him youre unavailable yes i quinns hand curled around her wrist no no ill take it thank you take it slow quinn told her just let him talk her fingers were stiff and cold as she picked up the receiver hello quinn only had to look at her face to know she was hearing the familiar whisper dont lose it he said quietly keeping her free hand in his just keep him on the line stay calm and answer him thank you she managed despite the block in her throat yes yes ive gotten all your letters no im not angry she closed her eyes and tried to pretend that the things he was saying didnt make her skin crawl i wish youd tell me who you are if youd caught between frustration and relief she brought the receiver away from her ear he hung up damn after setting the tray on the floor beside the bed quinn leaned over her and punched a few buttons on the phone its quinn he swore again yeah just keep on it right not enough time he told chantel as he hung up the phone again did he say anything that rang a bell anything that makes you think of someone you know no she trembled once before she regained control no one i know has a mind like that drink some coffee he poured more into her cup then handed it to her she drank to ease the tightness in her throat quinn she had to swallow again he said he said he had a surprise for me a big surprise when she turned her head to look at him her eyes were huge and dark he said it wouldnt be much longer let me worry about him hed always had a soft spot for the defenseless it had gotten him into trouble before in south america in afghanistan and in countless other places even though he knew it might be dangerous in a more personal way he slipped an arm around her shoulders and brought her close thats what youre paying me for angel hes going to get to me she said it with such flat finality that he tightened his hold i can feel it hell have a hard time doing that with me in the way listen ive got two men patrolling the grounds two others monitoring the phones it doesnt seem to help she closed her eyes and for a moment let herself lean on him maybe its because i cant see them you can see me cant you yeah and she could feel him could feel the hard working muscles of his arm and shoulder the notsosmooth skin of his face want to see more of me cautious chantel lifted her face to look into his there was humor there but she was sure she was mistaken it looked as though there were genuine concern as well i beg your pardon i like the way you do that angel you could cut a man off at the knees without lifting a finger its a talent of mine explain doran why dont i move in for a while now dont let your ego get the best of you he warned as she started to stiffen youve got plenty of rooms in this place and though i am developing a real fondness for your bed i can make do with another what do you say angel want a housemate she frowned at him hating to admit how much safer she would feel with him around all the time the house was certainly big enough to keep them out of each others way though privacy would go out of the window the real problem would be remembering just how hed made her feel during that one sizzling kiss if he were around twentyfour hours a day remembering might not be enough maybe i should buy that vicious dog chantel muttered your choice that was true it was and she knew exactly how to handle it and him go ahead and get your duffel bag doran well find a corner for you to sleep in sitting up she flipped through the script again she felt better she couldnt deny it the icy fist in her stomach had loosened how much extra is this going to cost me meals and i want more than a bowl of fruit in the morning use of the facilities and since this is going to play hell with my social life another two hundred a day two hundred chantel gave a quick unladylike snort i cant imagine your social lifes worth more than fifty isnt that the going rate in the massage parlors what do you know about massage parlors she slanted him a look just what i see in the movies darling how about a handson demonstration he lifted a finger and slid a strap from her shoulder instead of replacing it chantel simply studied the script no thanks i doubt if theres anything you could teach me i was thinking more the other way around when he nudged the other strap aside chantel lifted her gaze to his he was baiting her and she wasnt ready to nibble try me when ive got a few weeks to spare doran with you im afraid wed have to start from scratch im a fast learner he slid his hand up her shoulder until his thumb brushed her jaw she grabbed his wrist before she could stop herself but her voice remained steady watch your step if you watch your step you miss too much hed wanted to touch her again to feel her skin smooth and warm under his hands hed wanted to see her eyes darken partly from anger partly from temptation when he did she looked ready to rake his face but the bite of her nails wouldnt stop him from sampling the fire she held so well banked inside her the fire she let flame so explosively on screen when her free hand came up he grabbed it she held one of his he held one of hers as far as quinn was concerned they were even he thought it was pride that kept her from struggling pride and the confidence that she could bring him to his knees whenever she chose he wasnt as certain as he wanted to be that she couldnt he was just about to let her go when her chin lifted and her eyes dared him hed always been a sucker for a dare with his eyes open and on hers he lowered his mouth but he didnt kiss her chantel felt the impact both surprised and aroused when he caught her bottom lip between his teeth the chilly nonresponse shed been determined to give him began to heat she could have stopped him her brother trace had taught her and her sisters how to defend themselves from overamorous members of the male sex chantel was aware that she could take quinn by surprise and have him bent over double and gasping for air with one quick jerk of her knee she lay still hypnotized by the green eyes that watched her she wasnt supposed to have these kind of feelings this kind of hunger she had blocked them out years before when her emotions had made a fool of her she wasnt supposed to have this slow curling sensation in her stomach her bones werent supposed to liquify at a touch shed done love scene after love scene choreographed blocked out shot and reshot for the camera and had felt nothing that hadnt been programmed into her character she knew just how little the most passionate embrace could mean to the two people involved this light nibbling sensation on her lip should have done nothing but annoy her but she lay still trapped by an urgent desire to absorb the rushing range of feeling it brought to her impossible it had to be impossible but he felt innocence shimmering around her if it was an act she was more skilled than she had a right to be if it wasnt but he couldnt think she did something to his mind that she shouldnt be permitted to do she pushed her way into it and filled it until he was ready to forget everything but her desire desire was something easily quenched and easily forgotten it would pay to remember that any man was bound to want her but he wasnt sure any man would be able to forget her there was too much power in her the power to make a man hunger to make him ache to make him weak quinn couldnt afford to lose his hold with her lips warm and soft under his he reminded himself that he had two priorities one was to keep her safe the other was to look out for himself when he felt himself sinking he pulled back the ground was too unsteady here for once he would indeed watch his step you pack a punch angel steady she told herself struggling to find a foothold it meant nothing to him nothing more than the eternal war of wills men and women fought he hadnt gone soft inside or felt the need to be loved the need to believe that maybe just maybe this was right she wouldnt give him the satisfaction of knowing she had next time itll flatten you you might be right he muttered and shifted away your skins a little pale he skimmed his gaze over her bare shoulders and cursed himself for the twist of need he felt get dressed and meet me out by the pool ill bring you up to date on what we have so far he rolled from the bed and taking the file with him left her alone he needed some air fast quinn cut through the water of the pool like an eel smooth fast and quiet when chantel came onto the patio she stood in the sunlight and watched him she hadnt been wrong about the feel of his muscles she could see them now rippling with each stroke of his arm bunching with each kick of his leg hed chosen brief black trunks from the stack she kept in the poolhouse for guests they fit low and snug over his hips still she imagined hed picked them for comfort rather than impact as far as she could tell quinn doran considered himself too irresistible to think about such things she chose a chair by an umbrellaed table and waited for him to surface the physical exertion helped quinn realized hed pushed himself closer to the limit with her than hed intended he still wasnt sure why hed made a move toward her when he knew she was the kind of woman a smart man kept his distance from hed always been smart that was the way you survived but hed also always had a habit of giving in to temptation that was the way you lived though his life had never been dull chantel ohurley was his biggest temptation so far by the time hed crossed the length of the pool and back thirty times most of the tension had drained under other circumstances he would have used a punching bag to relieve it but he was willing to make use of whatever was available tossing wet hair from his face he stood in the shallow end water lapping at his thighs and he saw her tipped back in the chair her face shaded by a big white umbrella she was the epitome of cool gutwrenching beauty shed pulled her hair up and back so that her face was unframed it needed no framing the sleek severe style only accented that fact the snug top she wore was cut deep at the shoulders and cinched into the waistband of cropped shorts that showed off long long legs his gaze lingered on those legs as he hauled himself out of the pool youve got a hell of a foundation angel so im told reaching beside her she picked up a towel i see youre finding your way around all right she tossed the towel to him but he did no more than sling it around his neck the sunlight shimmered on the drops of water on his bronzed skin nice pool i like it then you should use it more swimmings a great way to keep in shape ill worry about my shape doran temper was licking its way to the surface chantel coated it with sarcasm is this going to take long i want to get my nails done this afternoon well fit it in we she couldnt prevent a smile as he sat across from her somehow i cant picture you in a chichi little place like nail it down ive been in worse he shifted the chair slightly placing himself in full sunlight anything else on your agenda today oh maybe a little windowshopping on rodeo drive she said on the spur of the moment just to make things tougher lunch at ma maison i think or perhaps the bistro she rested her chin on the back of her hand its been days since ive seen anyone you do have something appropriate to wear dont you ill get by then theres that charity dinner tonight her smile faded how did you know about that its my job to know though he didnt need them quinn flipped through his notes my secretary contacted sean carter and explained you had another escort then she can contact him again sean and i arranged to go together to help promote the film are you willing to get into a dark limo with a man who might be its not sean after cutting him off chantel reached for the pack of cigarettes quinn had tossed on the table well just play this my way quinn picked up his lighter and flicked it on ill take you to your little party and if you like you can cuddle with sean for the cameras what about tomorrow chantel gave him a poisonous look you tell me quinn patiently flipped open his file youve got a reporter and photographer from lifestyles coming at one to do a story on you and the house thats all ive got she dropped the cigarette in an ashtray and let it smolder because thats all there is i have some personal things to attend to here at home then i go to bed early because mondays a working day matt said you were practical quinn flipped the page over larry washington get on with it she told him you wont be happy until you do the kid looks clean enough on the surface graduated ucla last year with a degree in business management seems he always had a thing for the theater but preferred the setups and backstage stuff to the acting which is exactly why i hired him apparently he had a pretty heavy thing going with a coed until about six months ago a very attractive blueeyed blonde she dumped him he didnt have to spell out the implications a lot of women have blue eyes and a lot of college romances break up amos leery he continued ignoring her did you know his first wife divorced him because he couldnt keep his hands off other women yes i know and it was fifteen years ago so old habits die hard george mclintoch thats pitiful doran even for you hes been a makeup artist for thirtythree years has five grandchildren and another due in the fall since his wife died a couple of years ago hes had a few problems with the bottle thats enough she rose and paced to the edge of the pool the water was calm and crystal clear so had her life been only a few weeks before thats really enough im not going to sit here and listen to you dissect the personal problems of people i work with she looked back over her shoulder youre in a filthy business thats right not by a flicker did he reveal his feelings on the subject james brewster seems like a pretty stable family life married twentyone years one son studying law in the east interesting that hes been in analysis for over ten years everyone in this towns in analysis youre not i will be if i keep you around he smiled briefly then turned the page your driver robert is an interesting character young robert defranco has himself a string of ladies just your kind of man cant help but admire his stamina matt burns she turned all the way around then this time he saw not anger but revulsion it ripped at something inside him how could you she said it quietly and painfully hes your friend this is my job its your job to spy into the personal lives of people youre supposed to care about he kept his eyes on hers i cant afford to care about anyone but my clients when theyre paying me thats the service then keep this part of it to yourself whatever you dug up about matt i dont want to know he wouldnt allow her to make him regret what hed done hed done worse much worse he wondered how shed look at him if she knew chantel youre going to have to consider all the possibilities no you are and at this point youre getting seven hundred a day to do it its your job to find whoevers hounding me and to keep me safe while youre doing it this is the way i do it fine since it is all i want to see from you is the bill she started to storm back into the house but he blocked her path grow up taking her by the shoulders he held her still she was hurting he realized really hurting for the people she cared for he had to convince her that she couldnt afford to anyone at all could be making those calls maybe its someone youve never even met but my instincts tell me different he knows you lady he gave her a quick shake to accentuate his point and he wants you real bad until we find him youre going to do just like i say that mornings call was still too fresh in her mind if a compromise had to be made shed make it but she wouldnt like it ill do what you say doran to a point ill have my phone tapped ill have the damn guards at the gate and you in my house but i wont listen to this garbage in other words youll make a good showing but you dont want the details you got it he dropped his hands i thought you had more guts than that she opened her mouth to yell then shut it again because he was right she just didnt have the stomach for it dry off doran she turned on her heel and walked away as he stood watching her quinn decided his instincts were as reliable as ever when push came to shove she wouldnt crumble chapter five contents prev next when they got through the weekend without chewing any pieces off each other chantel decided they might make it it hadnt pleased her to go to dinner with him and pretend in front of three hundred other people that she enjoyed being with him chantel had told herself to look at it as a job a particularly difficult and unappealing job then quinn had thrown her a curve hed been charming surprisingly black tie suited him though it didnt quite disguise his rough edges it made them all the more appealing he would never be suave or smooth or glossy for some reason chantel found she was pleased to know that he might wear a silk tie and the trappings of sophistication but you knew at least if you were a woman you knew that a barbarian lay underneath before the evening was over he had drunk champagne with this years top boxoffice draw and had danced with a threetime oscarwinning actress the seventyyearold veteran had patted chantel on the knee and told her that her taste in men was improving though that had been difficult to swallow not once during the evening had quinn given chantel the opportunity to smirk at him on sunday he left her to herself when the reporters came and she gave them an interview and a tour of her home it was as if he werent even there she knew he was around somewhere but he didnt infringe on her privacy she was free to get back to her reading to indulge in a long soothing whirlpool bath and to catch up on correspondence and a few niggling business matters by the time they left the house on monday morning chantel was almost ready to revise her opinion of him she felt rested and eager for work the night before she had finished the script shed begun on saturday morning and was more enthusiastic than ever shed woken matt out of a sound sleep to tell him to go after the part it might have been shy of am but chantel felt wonderful she glanced over at quinn beside her legs stretched out eyes closed behind tinted glasses from the look of him he hadnt shaved since saturday it seemed unfair that the slightly dissipated aura suited him so rough night he opened one eye then finding it too much effort he closed it again poker game you played poker last night i didnt know youd gone out in the kitchen he muttered wondering how soon he could get his hands on another cup of coffee my kitchen chantel frowned a little annoyed that she hadnt been asked to play with whom gardener rafael he hardly speaks english dont have to to know a full house beats a straight i see a smile tugged at her lips so you and rafael played poker in the kitchen got drunk and told lies and marsh and marsh what she stopped in the act of reaching for a glass marsh played cards my marsh tall guy not much hair really quinn hes nearly eighty and quite creaky im surprised even you would take advantage of him took me for eightythree dollars canny old son of a serves you right she said with satisfaction sitting down in my kitchen swilling beer and smoking cigars and bragging about women when im paying for your time you were asleep i hardly think that matters youre being paid to watch out for me not play fivecard stud fivecard draw jacks or better and i was watching out for you really she brought a glass of juice to her lips thats odd i didnt see hide nor hair of you yesterday i was around you enjoy your whirlpool i beg your pardon you spent damn near an hour in that tub he took the glass from her and drained it maybe it would wash the cotton out of his mouth funny i figured a woman like you would have two dozen bathing suits guess you couldnt find one you were watching me he handed the glass back to her then settled back again thats what youre paying me for indignation rippled through her as she slammed the glass back in its holder im not paying you to be a peeping tom get your prurient kicks on your own time my time is your time angel i saw nearly that much of you when i plunked down fourfifty to see thin ice besides if id been out for kicks id have joined you id have drowned you she tossed back but he only smiled and shut his eyes again his head was pounding like a jackhammer hed gotten less sleep before but that had usually been of his own choosing the poker game had been his way of distracting himself from the knowledge that she was sleeping upstairs his way of trying to forget the way shed looked stretched out in the foaming water of the spa that afternoon he hadnt as he wanted her to believe watched her hed seen her go into the poolhouse then when she hadnt come out hed gone to check on her shed been lounging in the big tub rachmaninoff wafting from the overhead speakers her hair had been left down and floated in the frothing water and her body her body had been long and slender and pale he could still feel the impact like a sledgehammer straight to the solar plexus he hadnt stayed to tease and taunt but had left as quietly as hed come there had been a fear a definite fear that if shed opened her eyes and looked at him hed have crawled thoughts of her haunted him day and night he knew he should be able to prevent it nothing and no one was permitted to have power over him but he was beginning to understand how a woman could become an obsession by simply existing he was beginning to understand how a man could become overwhelmed by his own fantasies it made him worry about himself but it made him worry more about her if another man had become obsessed with her and that other man had crossed certain lines to what lengths might he go to have her the letters and calls were gradually becoming more urgent when would he stop them and try something more desperate as frightened as she was quinn didnt believe chantel had any conception of just how far that kind of madness could push a man the longer he was around her the more he realized just how far that was they would shoot on the back lot that day another camera crew was already in new york filming exteriors chantel was looking forward to the time when she and other members of the crew would fly east for the handful of scenes to be shot on location it would give her a chance to see her sister maddy and with any luck catch her play on broadway the thought of it brought back her earlier cheerful mood it lasted even through an hours delay while technicians worked out a few bugs looks like new england quinn commented as he glanced around the openair set massachusetts to be exact chantel told him nibbling on a sticky bun ever been there i was born in vermont i was born on a train chantel broke off another piece of her bun and laughed well nearly my parents were on their way to a gig when my mother went into labor they stopped off long enough to have my sisters and me your sisters and you thats right im the oldest of triplets there are three of you good god theres only one of me doran she popped a piece of the bun in his mouth enjoying the fresh air and sunshine were triplets but each of us manages to be her own person abbys raising horses and kids in virginia and maddys currently wowing them on broadway you dont look like the family type really she felt too good to be offended i also have a brother i cant tell you what he does because no ones quite sure i lean toward professional gigolo or international jewel thief youd get along beautifully with him she watched one of the prop men pick up a boulder and move it a few feet amazing isnt it quinn studied the trees they looked real just like the ones back home until you saw the wood base they sat on anything real around here not a great deal give them a few hours and they could make this a jungle in kenya stretching her back she toyed with the ice in her cup she was used to waiting we were going to shoot this on location but there were some problems theres a lot of waitaround in this business its not for the restless ive gone back to my dressing room and sat for hours to be called back for a fiveminute scene other days you put in fourteen hours nonstop why why what why do you do it because its what ive always wanted to do it was a stock answer why she felt obliged to elaborate on it she didnt know when i was little and i sat in a theater and saw what could happen i knew i had to be a part of it so you always wanted to be an actress she tossed her hair back and smiled ive always been an actress i wanted to be a star looks like you got what you wanted looks like she murmured shaking off a hint of depression what about you did you always want to be a whatever it is you are i wanted to be a juvenile delinquent and was doing a pretty good job of it sounds fascinating she wanted to know more to be honest she wanted to know everything about him but shed take care how she asked why arent you serving tentotwenty in san quentin i got drafted he grinned but she sensed the joke was very much his own the army builds men something like that anyway i learned to do what i was good at make a profit and stay out of jail and what are you good at he turned his head just enough that she could see the amusement and the challenge in his eyes forget i asked lets try something else how long were you in the army i didnt say i was in the army he offered her a cigarette then lighted it himself when she shook her head you said you were drafted i was drafted and governmenttrained want some more coffee no how long were you in too long is that where you learned not to give a direct answer yeah he smiled at her again then before either of them realized his intention he reached out to touch her hair you look like a kid her heart shouldnt have been hammering but it was it was only a touch after all only a few words and a long look in a pretend world teeming with people thats the idea she managed after a moment im twenty in this scene innocent eager naive and about to be deflowered here no actually just over there she pointed to a small clearing in the forest the crew had created brad the cad seduces me promising me his everlasting devotion he taps the passion that so far ive only given to my painting then exploits it quinn clucked his tongue with all these people watching i love an audience and you got mad because i watched you in the tub you theyre ready for you chantel after giving her assistant a nod chantel stood up then carefully brushed off the seat of her pants get yourself a good seat doran she suggested you might learn something taking her advice quinn watched her run through the scene several times on low power from his angle it seemed a lukewarm stock scene a gullible woman a clever man in a pretty springtime setting plastic he thought pure plastic down to the leaves on the trees quinn kept his eyes on george as the makeup artist retouched chantels face to keep that dewy neverbeentouched look intact one of the prop men handed her back her sketchpad and pencil places quiet on the set the hubbub died away to be replaced by silence speed roll film the clapper came down for take action it began the same way with chantel sitting on a rock sketching sean made his entrance and stood watching her for a moment when chantel glanced up and saw him quinn felt his mouth go dry everything a man could want was in that look love trust desire if a man had a woman look at him that way he could win wars and scale mountains hed never wanted to be loved love tied you down made you responsible to someone other than yourself it took as much as or more than it gave that was what hed thought that was what hed been certain of until hed seen the look come into chantels eyes a movie he reminded himself when he realized hed missed five minutes of shooting they were already doing a second take the look in her eyes was as much an illusion as the forest they were in and it hadnt been aimed at him in any case it was a movie she was an actress and it was all part of the script the first time sean carter touched her quinn felt his jaw lock tight fortunately for him the director cut the scene when they continued quinn told himself he was under control he told himself that he was only there because he was paid to be she meant nothing to him personally she was a case it didnt matter to him how many men she made love with on or offcamera then he watched her touch her lips softly hesitantly to seans and he thought of murder it was only a scene in a movie with fake rocks fake trees and fake emotions but it seemed so real so honest there were dozens of people around him with machines to run the lights the mikes even as sean gathered chantel closer a camera edged in on them but she trembled damn it he saw her quiver as sean pulled the band from her hair and let it tumble free her voice shook when she told him she loved him she wanted him she wasnt afraid quinn found his hands were balled into fists in his pockets her eyes shut as sean rained kisses all over her face she looked so young so vulnerable so ready to be loved quinn didnt notice the camera come in close he only saw sean unbuttoning her blouse and her eyes wide and blue locked on her lovers hesitantly she unbuttoned his shirt color washed her cheeks as she drew the shirt aside and pressed her cheek to his chest they lowered to the grass cut quinn came back to reality with a thud he watched chantel sit up then say something to sean that made him laugh she was wearing a brief strapless bra that would stay below camera range and a pair of baggy jeans larry draped her discarded blouse over her shoulder and she gave him an absent smile lets take it again chantel after you take off his shirt i want you to lift your head mary rothschild hunkered down as chantel rebuttoned her blouse i want a kiss there a good long one before you two go down on the grass sometime during the fifth take quinn found his objectivity he searched the faces of those looking on if there was an uncomfortable stirring in his stomach he could ignore it now his job was to find out who might be watching chantel not clinically not approvingly as she completed the scene but someone who might be eaten alive with jealousy or fantasizing it wasnt going to do either one of them any good if it was him quinn took out another cigarette and watched the faces around him he had reports coming in on everyone from the cinematographer to the prop man gut instinct told him that whoever was sending her letters was someone she knew someone she might speak to casually every day quinn wanted to find him and he wanted to find him quickly before he developed an obsession of his own the assistant director put his arm around chantels shoulders and with his head bent close to her ear led her off the set before they reached the trailer that was chantels dressing room quinn was in front of them going somewhere chantel shot him a narrowed look but hung on to her temper as a matter of fact i was going to get out of the sun for awhile amos was giving me the rest of todays schedule youll have to forgive quinn amos hes a bit possessive hard to blame him goodnatured and a bit tubby around the middle amos patted her shoulder you were terrific chantel just terrific well call when we need you for the closeups and reaction shots you should have about a half hour thanks amos she waited until he was out of earshot before she turned on quinn dont do that do what all you needed was a knife between your teeth she muttered jerking open the door of the trailer i told you amos was harmless he has a habit of touching women one of those women is my client chantel chose a diet drink from the small refrigerator and collapsed with it onto the sofa if i didnt want him to touch me i assure you he wouldnt this isnt the first time ive worked with amos and unless you insist on acting like an idiot it wont be the last quinn opened the refrigerator and to his satisfaction found a beer look angel i cant narrow down the list of suspects to suit your requirements its time you stopped pretending that the person youre so afraid of isnt someone you know im not pretending she began you are he chugged back some of the beer before he sat beside her and youre not pretending with half as much style as you were out there rolling on the grass a few minutes ago thats work this is my life exactly he took her chin in a way that made her eyes flash im supposed to take care of it if it makes you feel better ive just about eliminated carter sean she felt a quick surge of relief then one of caution why simple enough reasoning he took another sip of beer and kept her hanging seems to me that if a man was obsessed with a woman well agree that were dealing with an obsession yes damn it she snatched the bottle out of his hand what are you getting at just that if i were going over the edge about a woman i wouldnt be able to stand up dust myself off and turn aside after id spent a good part of the day tangled halfnaked with her is that so chantel handed him back his beer ill be sure to keep that in mind relaxed again chantel leaned back against the pillows and stretched out her legs so what did you think of the scene it ought to fog up a few bifocals oh come on quinn she held up her drink and watched moisture bead the sides of the bottle it wasnt just a matter of sex you know it was a betrayal of innocence and trust what happened to hailey in that new england wood will affect the rest of her life a quick tumble on the pine cones doesnt do that but a quick tumble on the pine cones sells tickets this is television were after ratings damn it quinn i put a lot into that scene its the turning point of haileys life if it doesnt mean more than you were good he cut in and had her staring at him well she set her drink down mind repeating that i said you were good i dont hand out the awards angel she brought her knees up and dropped her chin onto them with the thin slash of sunlight coming through the curtains she still looked young and innocent how good how do you manage to feed that ego when youre alone ive never denied the size of my ego how good good enough to make me want to give carter a black eye really delighted she caught her bottom lip between her teeth shed play it light it wouldnt do to let him know just how much it meant to her to hear him praise her work before or after the cameras were rolling before during and after unexpectedly he reached over and took the front of her shirt in his hand and dont push your luck angel ive got a habit of taking what looks good to me youve such class doran she uncurled his fingers from her blouse such low class just keep that in mind you know angel you gave me a twinge or two when i watched you and carter paw each other we werent give it any name you want but good as you are i didnt spend all my time watching you i looked around and saw a few interesting things such as brewster smoked a half a pack of cigarettes while you and carter were working hes a nervous man ive seen writers do worse when their scripts being filmed leery practically fell in your lap trying to get a closer look its his job to look and your assistant nearly swallowed his tongue when carter took your shirt off just stop it springing up she paced to one of the windows they would call her soon she wouldnt be any good if she let what quinn was saying get her all churned up as far as im concerned youre giving your own gutterheight views to everyone on set that brings up another thought he settled back and waited for her to look around at him matts yet to show up on the set strange arent you his top client she stared at him for a long moment youre determined to leave me without anyone anyone at all thats right he ignored the quick bitter taste in his throat for the moment you trust me and only me theyll be calling me soon im going to go lie down without looking at him again she walked to the back of the trailer and through a doorway quinn had a sudden fierce urge to throw the bottle against the wall just to hear it shatter she had no business making him feel guilty he was looking out for her that was what he was paid for and it was easier all around if she was suspicious if that meant she shed a few tears it couldnt be helped he wasnt worried about it he didnt give a damn swearing he slammed the bottle down on the table beside him lecturing himself all the way he strode through the trailer to the bedroom look chantel she was sitting at the foot of the bed staring down at an envelope in her hands he smelled the dark sweet scent of wild roses before he saw them on the dresser i cant open it she murmured when she looked up at him something twisted in his stomach it wasnt just her pallor it wasnt just the fear he could see in the way her fingers shook it was the complete and utter despair in her eyes i just cant take any more you dont have to with a compassion he thought had been erased in him years before he sat beside her and gathered her close thats what im here for he slipped the envelope out of her numb fingers i dont want you to open any more of the letters if they come you give them to me i dont want to know what it says she shut her eyes and hated herself for it just rip it up dont worry about it he stuffed the letter into his back pocket as he pressed a kiss to the top of her head he had questions to ask a lot of questions as to who might have gone into her dressing room that day part of the deal is that you trust me just let me take care of things the head resting against his shoulder shook once in quick denial you cant take care of the way this makes me feel i always wanted to be someone i always wanted to feel important is that why this is happening with a dry sob she pulled away from him maybe you were right maybe i asked for this stop it he took her hard by the shoulders and prayed shed control the tears he could see were threatening i was out of line youre beautiful youre talented and youve made use of it that doesnt mean youre to blame for someones sickness but its me that he wants she said quietly and im afraid im not going to let anything happen to you she let out a deep breath as her hand wrapped around his sign that in blood he smiled and ran a fingertip down her cheek whose needing the contact she rested her cheek against his for a moment the gesture left him shaken thanks sure look i know i havent been making this easy for you she drew back again as hed hoped the tears hadnt fallen i havent wanted to trouble is my business besides i like your style white were being nice to each other i guess ill say i like yours too a redletter day he murmured and brought her hand to his lips it was a mistake they both realized it the instant the contact was made over their joined fingers their gazes met and held she thought she could feel the tension jump from his palm to hers this wasnt a matter of temptation or of anger or of passion flaring quickly but of need she needed to feel his arms around her again holding her tight she needed to feel his lips on hers warm hard demanding everything else would fade she knew if only they came together now their hands were still joined but she didnt protest as his fingers tightened painfully on hers what was he thinking it suddenly seemed imperative that she understand that she see what he felt in his mind in his heart did he want her could he possibly want her as badly this moment as she wanted him no other woman had ever made him ache like this not just from wanting no other woman had ever made his blood swim not just from looking he thought it would be possible to sit there through eternity and just look at that face was it only her beauty could it possibly be that he was twisted around inside because of a flawless facade or was it something else something that seemed to glow from within there was something elusive almost secretive that showed in her eyes only if you looked quickly and carefully enough he thought he saw it now then all he could think of was how much he wanted her with his free hand he reached up to trail his fingers through her hair spun gold like an angels thats what it made him think of but she was flesh and blood not a fantasy a woman he leaned closer then watched her lashes flutter down the knock on the trailer door had her shooting up like an arrow out of a bow she put both hands to her face but shook her head when quinn reached for her no its all right thats just my call to go on the set sit down ill tell them youre not feeling well no she dropped her hands to her sides no this isnt going to interfere with my work the fingers of her left hand balled into a fist but he could see she was working to regain control i cant let that happen turning her head she stared at the roses on the table i wont let it he wanted to overrule her but knew this was the one thing hed admired about her from the first she was strong strong enough to fight back okay you want a few more minutes yeah maybe she walked to the window and drew the curtains aside to let in more sun it was frightening much too frightening to think about darkness at night she was alone with her thoughts and her imagination the sun was out she reminded herself sighing deeply she had work to do would you mind letting them know ill be out in a minute ill take care of it he hesitated wanting to go to her knowing it would be a mistake for both of them ill be right outside chantel dont come out until youre ready ill be fine she waited until she heard him walk away before she dropped her forehead onto the glass weeping would be such a relief weeping screaming just letting go would ease the hammerlock her nerves had on her system but she couldnt let go any more than she could allow herself to get churned up like this there were hours more to put in that day she needed her wits and her stamina shed make it chantel promised herself drawing a deep breath she turned from the window the flowers were gone she stared at the table with a foolish sense of relief hed taken them away she hadnt even had to ask what kind of a man was he rude and rough one moment tender the next why couldnt he be easy to understand and easy to dismiss with a shake of her head she started down to the front of the trailer he was impossible to understand and he stirred things in her he was anything but the kind of man a woman could be comfortable with and she felt so safe knowing he was close by if she hadnt known herself so well been so certain of her own control she would almost have believed she was falling in love with him chapter six contents prev next it was anything but a quiet restful week though chantel spent a good chunk of it in bed the bed was big and plush and ornate and it was on the set on soundstage d the major scene to be shot was her wedding night haileys wedding night not to the man she loved but to the man she wanted to love the props included an ice bucket with champagne a fulllength sable draped over a chair and a table laden with roses that had to be spritzed constantly to keep them fresh under the lights don sterling a relative unknown had been chosen to play the man she would marry hed been selected mainly because of looks and chemistry though his final reading with chantel had been excellent his nerves had him blowing the scene a halfdozen times during the morning locked in his arms chantel felt him tighten up before he could do so himself she flubbed the scene hoping to take some of the pressure off him sorry she gave a delicate shrug can we take five mary im getting stale make it ten rothschild ordered then turned to consult with her assistant how about a cup of coffee chantel accepted the robe she was handed and slipped into it as she smiled at don only if i can drown myself in it lets try drinking it first she signaled to larry then found two seats in a relatively quiet corner when she saw quinn start to approach she shook her head and leaned closer to don its a tough scene it shouldnt be he ran a hand through a mass of thick dark hair look the order theyre shooting this miniseries in weve only had a couple of scenes together so far the first thing you know were married and on our honeymoon she took the coffee from larry i dont know about you but i think its easier to jump into bed with someone if you have more than a passing acquaintance he held the coffee in both hands and managed a chuckle im supposed to be an actor me too you could run through this scene with your eyes closed he sipped the coffee then with a sound of disgust set it aside ill be honest you intimidate the hell out of me when she only lifted a brow he let out a long breath and looked away when my agent called and told me i had this part and that id be playing opposite you i almost went into a coma that makes it tough to work up any passion she put a hand on his look your reading with me was great no one else even came close the bit in haileys art studio he picked up his coffee with a rueful look not a bed in sight the first love scene i ever played was opposite scott baron hollywood legend the worlds sexiest man i had to kiss him and my teeth were chattering i was so scared he took me aside bought me a tunafish sandwich and told me stories half of which were certainly lies then he told me something true he said all actors are children and all children like to play games if we didnt play the game well wed have to grow up and get real jobs the tension shed spotted around his mouth had already relaxed did it work it was either that or the tuna fish but we went back on the set and played the game you stole that movie from him she smiled ive heard it said she continued to smile as she sipped coffee dont think im going to let you steal this one from me you blew that last line on purpose she could become a prima donna with little more than a tilt of her head i dont know what youre talking about you have a reputation for being cold and driven he mused i never expected you to be well nice dont let it get around rising she offered him a hand lets get this honeymoon off the ground the scene went like clockwork quinn didnt know what chantel had said during her brief huddle with her costar but it had turned the trick for himself he was learning not to tense up when chantel was in someone elses arms it was difficult to work up any resentment when so much technology went into setting the scene the lights had to be adjusted to simulate candlelight chantel and don lay in the bed he stripped to the waist she in a thighlength chemise the camera was nearly on top of them the director knelt on the bed and went over the moves on cue chantel and don turned to each other as if they were the only two people on earth it was so easy for her quinn reflected to fabricate passion when he watched her like this he wondered if she had any real feelings at all her emotions were turned off and on as direction indicated like an exquisitely crafted puppet he thought beautifully formed on the outside hollow within yet hed held her himself hed felt passion shimmer in her the feelings needs uncertainties had been there for him to touch had that been just part of her act as well it shouldnt matter to him he reminded himself as he lighted a cigarette he couldnt let it matter she was an assignment and nothing more if she stirred feelings in him as she did with uncanny regularity he would just have to take a step back involvement with a woman like chantel ohurley was suicide for a man who didnt have himself under complete control but when he looked at her his mouth went dry just desire he told himself or more accurately lust there was no denying that wanting her was as easy as natural as drawing breath but it hadnt been desire or lust he had felt when hed held her in his arms moments ago so he had some compassion left in him quinn found a chair then discovered he was too wired to sit hed have been pretty low if he hadnt felt sympathy or been able to offer comfort to a frightened and vulnerable woman but it hadnt been sympathy it had been rage he recognized it even now that hot bubbling fury at the thought of his woman being threatened his woman that was the problem the longer he was with her the easier it became to think of her as his take a step back from that doran he ordered himself and make it fast if he didnt pull himself together soon he was going to be in over his head a man could only hold his breath for so long he crushed out his cigarette and wished the interminable day would end there had been two more letters that week letters he hadnt shown her the tone had shifted from pleading to nearwhimpering it worried quinn more than the subtle menace the earlier letters had contained the author was about to break when he did quinn was certain it would be like a geyser fast and violent because his own patience was thin he hoped it would be soon it would give him some outlet for the fury building inside him thats a wrap people dont have too much fun over the weekend we want you alive and coherent on monday still in her chemise chantel sat on the edge of the bed and held an earnest conversation with don jealousy where it had come from and why quinn couldnt begin to answer quinn had always been a liveandletlive sort of person if a woman even a woman he was involved with decided to look to another man that was her prerogative no strings no pain no complications hed managed very well that way for years hed never experienced this sharp twist in the gut over a woman before he felt it now and he didnt like it or himself unable to stop himself he walked over and drew chantel to her feet playtimes over he said and pulled her with him let go of me she told him under her breath as he walked toward her dressing room larry started forward with her robe saw the look on quinns face and backed away just shut up doran this is my place of business but if you keep it up im going to create the biggest juiciest scene even your twisted brain can imagine youll read about it in the paper for weeks go ahead she set her teeth just what is your problem youre my problem lady for a woman who should be watching her step you were awfully chummy with that kid kid don for gods sake hes an associate and hes not a kid hes two years older than i am you were steaming up his contact lenses dont you get tired of playing the same tune she jerked her arm free and pulled open her dressing room door herself if youve been doing your job you already have a report on don sterling and you know hes practically engaged to a woman hes been involved with for two years and the woman in question is three thousand miles away in new york i know that as she pushed her hair out of her face the chemise shifted whispering silkily over her skin he was just telling me that hes going to catch the redeye to the east coast so that he can spend the weekend with her hes in love doran though i realize you might not understand the term a man could be in love with another woman and still want you she slammed the dressing room door and leaned back against it what would you know about love what would you know about any genuine emotion you want emotion he slapped his palms on the door at either side of her head though her eyes widened in shock she stood firm you want a taste of the kind of emotion you push out of a man the real thing angel not something out of the pages of a script think you can take it her heart was beating in her throat it was crazy to actually want to be dragged against him to be plundered drained and weakened she could see nothing but raw fury in his eyes but somehow she relished it if it was all he could feel for her it was almost enough shed be willing to settle and that scared the hell out of her just leave me alone she whispered youre smart to be scared of me im not scared of you he leaned a little closer youre trembling im furious she pressed her damp palms against the door maybe you are and maybe thats because youre not quite sure of what happens next its not written out for you is it chantel not so easy to turn the switch off and on get out of my way not just yet i want to know what you feel his body pressed lightly against hers i want to know if you feel she was losing ground and what she had left was shaky if he touched her now really touched her she was afraid she would lose everything how could she tell him what she felt when what she felt was against all the rules she wanted to be held protected cherished loved if she told him that hed only smile and take what he wanted shed been left empty before and it would never never happen to her again chantel lifted her chin and waited until his lips hovered an inch from hers youre no better than the man i hired you to protect me from he stepped back as if shed slapped him the stunned look on his face made her want to reach out to him instead she pressed back against the door and waited for his next move get some clothes on he told her and turned aside as she walked away he reached into the refrigerator for a beer she was right quinn twisted off the top and took two long swallows hed wanted to frighten to weaken then take her there on his terms if he could have proven to himself that what happened between them was cold and calculated he might have believed she meant nothing to him hed wanted to hurt her she was threatening his peace of mind and hed needed to strike back he would have used sex to purge himself and to repay her for the restless nights the wave of selfdisgust was as unfamiliar and as unpalatable as the surge of jealousy hed felt earlier hed told himself to take a step back yet hed taken a leap forward and had landed in the mire hed done things and seen things in his life that would have left others pale and speechless yet for the first time in his life he felt truly soiled when he heard her coming back he tossed the bottle into the trash she wore rosecolored linen slacks and a jacket with a muted floral design she looked cool composed and nothing like the restless questing character shed played all day without a word she walked by him and put her hand on the knob before she could open the door quinn placed his hand over hers he cursed himself when she stiffened and sent him a cool disinterested look youre entitled to take a few shots he said mildly i wont even duck for a moment she said nothing then as the anger dissipated she sighed she was tired drained from the constant play and replay of emotion ill take a rain check as she twisted the knob he tightened his hand on hers chantel what he wanted to apologize it wasnt his style but he wanted badly to tell her he was sorry the need was there but the words wouldnt come nothing lets go they rode home in silence while guilt ate at him it would fade he assured himself it was just one more of the odd emotions she drew out of him she looked exhausted now though he remembered shed looked fine in fact shed looked wonderful before hed damn it he couldnt waste his time worrying about things like that he had a job to do and if hed stepped out of line it wouldnt happen again case closed hed see her into the house make certain the doors were locked and the alarm on then hed relax he needed to go over the report from his field man though he was already aware theyd turned up nothing on the stationery they needed a mistake so far no matter how mentally unstable chantels admirer was hed been smart quinn sat back as the limo cruised through the gates wishing he could say the same thing about himself he preferred to act on impulse as he stepped out of the car he didnt hesitate or think twice taking chantel by the hand he began to lead her around the side of the house what are you doing its friday night and im sick of being cooped up in that house were going out to eat he stopped by his car and nodded to one of the men who patrolled the grounds did it ever occur to you that i might not feel like going out where i go you go he opened the door and started to nudge her inside doran ive put in sixty hours this week and im tired i dont want to go to a restaurant and be stared at who said anything about a restaurant just get in angel you dont want to embarrass yourself in front of my man over there im not hungry i am he gave her a quick shove then shut the door behind her has anyone ever mentioned that youre totally lacking in manners or any of the other social graces constantly he gunned the motor and sent the car barreling down the drive chantel reached for her seat belt if you wreck this heap with me in it the producers are going to have your head on a platter for a moment she wondered if it wouldnt be worth it nervous you dont make me nervous doran you simply annoy me everyones got to be good at something he turned the radio dial and loud throbbing rock poured out chantel closed her eyes and pretended to ignore him when the car came to a halt she didnt move determined to show nothing but indifference she sat still as the silence grew outside the car she heard the bump and grind of weekend traffic heating up she had no idea where they were and told herself she didnt care quinns door opened and closed and she still didnt move but she did open her eyes she saw him stride up to the little fastfood joint and fought back a chuckle she would not be amused at home she could have had a nice glass of wine and a crisp salad with her cooks special herb dressing god knew what quinn was carrying back to the car in the white bag she simply wouldnt eat she told herself shed let him get whatever he had in his system out but she wouldnt eat closing her eyes again she tried not to react as aromas really wonderful aromas filled the car he glanced over smiled then started the car again again she didnt know where he was heading but the road began to wind and the sounds of traffic faded she very nearly dozed off as her system absorbed the quiet sunset drive she hadnt realized how much shed needed to get away from work from her house maybe from herself it was going to be hard not to be grateful to him but chantel told herself she would manage when the car stopped again she refused to move curiosity gnawed at her but she kept her eyes firmly shut saying nothing quinn reached for the bag rattling it so that the scent seeped through the car then he stepped out and closed the door behind him chantels stomach contracted reminding her that the plate of fruit and cheese shed had for lunch wasnt enough the least he could do was force her to eat something the way hed forced her to do other things she hadnt wanted to but no she thought as her temper began to rise he would just go off and gobble up whatever was in that bag and let her starve opening her eyes chantel pushed open her door as she let it slam behind her the noise seemed to echo forever astonished she looked around her they were farther up in the hills than she had ever gone before below miles below la stretched forever glistening just a bit as lights winked on she could see the separate levels of color in the sky as the sun went down deep blue led to paler blue and paler blue to mauve and rose and pink all glistening with gold the first star blinked to life overhead and waited patiently for others to join it the breeze whistled through the brush but the city she knew so well seemed encased in glass it was so quiet pretty impressive isnt it she turned and saw quinn leaning against a giant h the hollywood sign she realized and nearly laughed shed seen it so often it no longer registered from the hills it looked white invulnerable and perhaps immortal up close like the town it heralded it was mostly illusion it was big and bold certainly but a little grimy a little shaky graffiti was etched in clumps near the base it could use a fresh coat of paint she murmured no its more honest this way he kicked aside a beer can teenagers come up here to hang out and make out she tilted her head and you oh i just like the view he climbed over a few rocks effortlessly and planted himself on the base of an l and the quiet if youre lucky you can come up here and not hear a thing except for a coyote now and again coyote she glanced over her shoulder thats right not bothering to hide a grin he dug in the bag want a taco a taco you dragged me all the way up here to eat tacos got some beer lovely its getting warm youd better drink up i dont want anything suit yourself he unwrapped a taco and bit into it got some fries too he said with a full mouth a little greasy maybe but theyre not cold yet i dont know how i can resist she turned away from him to look down at the city again as fate would have it the breeze carried the spicy scents to her her mouth watered chantel scowled down at the lights and wished quinn doran to hell i guess a woman like you turns her nose up if it isnt champagne and caviar spinning around chantel stood with the city and the sunset at her back quinn felt his heart turn over in his chest shed never looked more beautiful you know nothing about me nothing at all her voice had an edge to it now a dull gritty edge that had his eyes narrowing i spent nearly the first twenty years of my life shuffling from town to town eating in greasy spoons or over a hot plate in a motel room sometimes if we were lucky and the gig was good we got to wolf down a meal in the hotel kitchen if we werent so lucky there were always hardboiled eggs and coffee dont you sit there in your smug little world and toss stones at me doran you dont know what i am or who i am all you know is what ive made myself slowly he set the beer on the rock behind him well well he said quietly i wouldnt read any of that in your official bio would i she could only stare what was it about him that made her lose control why had she been compelled to yank herself out and expose her roots to him i want to go back no you dont his voice wasnt curt now but gentle it was that gentleness that chipped away her defenses theres no one here but me chantel why dont we just sit up here and look down at the rest of the world for a while before shed thought it through shed taken a step toward him when he rose and held out a hand to help her up she reached for it without hesitation hesitation came the moment his palm met hers she remembered the feel of it the strength of it and her gaze lifted and locked with his they stood there a moment with the sky darkening around them then he hauled her up im sorry the apology surprised him as much as it did her for what she started to draw her hand from his but he reached up to brush back her hair for what happened before i dont know why but something about you makes me edgy she kept her eyes level with his then were even the wind tossed the hair back from his face in every situation he knew there came a time for honesty perhaps this was such a time chantel i want you im having a hell of a time dealing with that other men had wanted her other men had told her so in more beautiful ways but the words had never made it difficult for her to breathe i could fire you it wouldnt matter no i dont suppose it would she looked away surprised at how strong a longing could be quinn i cant go to bed with you i figured youd feel that way quinn she took his hand again as he started to step away i dont know what you think my reasons are but i guarantee you youre wrong not your style he said picking up his beer again not your league chantel snatched the bottle from him and heaved it spray spewed against the rocks before the glass shattered dont tell me what i think dont tell me what i feel then you tell me he grabbed her and pulled her against him i dont have to tell you anything i dont have to explain myself to you damn you i just want some peace i just want a few hours where the pressures off i dont know if i can take being squeezed at all sides for much longer okay okay his hold gentled immediately as he murmured his hand stroked up and down her back youre right i didnt bring you up here to fight with you but you make me edgy lets just go back no sit down please he added brushing his lips over her hair lets see if we can stay here for an hour together and not pick on each other have a taco he smiled at her as he pulled her down to sit chantel took one look at the bag and gave up im starving yeah i figured as much he handed her a wad of paper napkins for the next few minutes they ate in companionable silence was your childhood rough chantel stopped in the act of opening a little packet of salt for the fries oh no i didnt mean that it was just different my parents are entertainers theyve been a songanddance team for over thirty years the six of us trouped around the country and some of the places we played were dives but my family she smiled absently accepting a beer theyre wonderful trace did some routines but he was best on the piano it always used to frustrate me that no matter how hard i tried i couldnt play better than he did sibling rivalry sure life would be pretty dull without it trace and i were always so much alike that we couldnt stay off each others backs for very long there was never much of that between my sisters and me we were just too much a part of each other she sipped the beer straight from the bottle and looked down at the city below we still are god sometimes its so hard to be away from them when we were little we made all these plans for keeping the act together forever she remembered them with a little pang of regret then we grew up what kind of an act laughing she licked salt from her fingers you never heard of the ohurley triplets sorry youd probably be sorrier if you had heard of us threepart harmony show tunes and popular music a few old standards thrown in you sing doran i dont just sing im terrific you never sing in your movies she shrugged a shoulder it hasnt come up matt keeps saying we should give the public a surprise one of these days and get a guest spot where i can do a few numbers and dance maybe too yes she added when he slanted a look at her i can dance my father would have died of shame otherwise why dont you do it the time just hasnt been right besides ive been concentrating on what im best at he balled up the empty bag and set it beside his feet whats that she gave him a quick mocking look playing roles instead of smiling back he tucked her hair behind her ear my guess is youre not playing one now she turned her head quickly and looked out the sky was nearly dark but there was only a smattering of stars you cant be sure im not sure myself half the time i think youre sure when she turned her head back his mouth was close close and tempting dont i told you i cant but his lips brushed over hers light as a whisper and stopped her cold do you know how i felt when you were lying on that bed with sterling today no i dont want to know ive told you its my job she was already half seduced he could hear it in her voice there was a thrill of anticipation along his skin as he thought of taking her beyond the next step i wasnt sure if i wanted to put my hands around his throat or yours but i did know i wanted you to look at me the way you were looking at him its just a part im supposed to there arent any cameras here chantel just you and me and thats what i think youre afraid of no ones here to tell you what youre supposed to be feeling no ones going to yell cut before things go just a little too far i dont need anyone to tell me what to feel i dont need anyone she repeated and tugged his mouth back to hers she wanted it she wanted to experience the wild flood of sensation he could bring her no one else she could tell him thered been no one else who had touched her just this way but hed never believe her the image her image was all but carved in stone and shed polished it herself what she was inside belonged to her she was determined that no one would ever share that part of her again but she could have this the heat the need the desperation she could take this and she could give it back to him as long as she promised herself she wouldnt give him too much as long as she didnt give him everything the sky darkened above them and the wind whistled through the brush she was pulling something from him drawing something out of him he couldnt seem to stop her his hands werent steady as they reached up to tangle in her hair his mind was swimming in a mist of his needs but the needs werent as simple as hed told himself they had to be desire could make you ache but it shouldnt be allowed to slice you open he wanted to take her there there in the rocks and dirt he wanted to treat her like porcelain delicately and with intense care his body was coiled tight ready to explode god he had to touch her even if it was only once in one smooth stroke he brought his hand along her leg over her hip until he found and cupped her breast she was small incredibly fragile and as soft as water compelled he flicked open the two buttons on her jacket to feast on the warm flesh inside it had been so long so long since she had allowed herself to be touched since shed felt the need for intimacy she wanted his hands on her his lips on her his body hard and demanding against hers the hell with where they were who they were the hell with the price she would surely pay for allowing herself to love him in an act of surrender that left him shaken she brought her arms around him and buried her face against his throat chantel he started to tilt her face up longing for reasons he couldnt be sure of to see what was in her eyes then he heard it a rustling in the brush that came once then twice and had him tensing what what is it she had heard it too and she dug her fingers into his arm an animal yeah probably but he didnt think so his nerves were humming as he drew her aside where are you going to take a look just stay here quinn she was already standing just sit tight its probably just a rabbit it was no rabbit she heard it in his voice he wasnt nearly the actor she was fear made her want to cringe away pride had her matching him step for step im going with you chantel sit down no she held his arm and scrambled over the rocks resigned quinn helped her regain her balance all right then be careful you get any scratches on that skin and ill get blamed for it damn right because the light had faded he went to his car and found a flashlight why dont you just sit no swearing under his breath he took her by the arm again he walked slowly toward the brush casually angling his body to shield hers lot of game up here he began but his muscles were coiled and ready he moved softly quietly pushing brush aside as chantel hung on to his hand i remember coyote yeah he crouched down when he spotted prints in the soft dirt the beam of his light swept over them then held chantel pressed her lips together i guess coyote dont wear shoes none that ive seen he hated hearing that hint of fear in her voice look it was probably just a kid no you dont believe that and neither do i she stared down at the scuffed prints the brush where they were wasnt more than five yards from where theyd been sitting a moment before someone was watching us and i think we both know why god she pressed her fingers to her eyes he was here he was right here just watching why doesnt he stop why doesnt he get a hold of yourself quinn took her by the shoulders and shook she took a deep breath then nearly screamed when the sound of an engine starting echoed back to them he followed me she stopped trembling her body felt too numb even for that how many other times has he been there watching me i dont know frustrated quinn stared out at the darkening road even if he dared leave her there alone hed never catch up with the other car now just remember hes watching us now im not going to let him get to you for how long she said quietly then turned away i want to go back chapter seven contents prev next it just doesnt seem like were getting anywhere chantel poured herself a brandy then freshened matts glass im sorry chantel id have sworn if anyone could dig up an answer it would be quinn im not blaming him cupping her brandy in both hands she walked to the window the sun was setting it reminded her of another dusk with the snifter at her lips she watched night fall youve changed your tune from the first time we talked about him more than you know she thought but shrugged her shoulders i cant claim hes not doing everything he can thats all then maybe i have to matt returned hating to hear the tired resignation in her voice he hasnt come up with anything solid what about the letters the stationery the letters were written on could have come from any of dozens of dime or drugstores in the la area theres no way for him to trace it but the flowers restless matt walked to the white baby grand then back to the fireplace his cigarette trailing expensive smoke behind him there has to be a way to trace where they were bought apparently not most of the time they just appear in my dressing room or somewhere on the set so far no ones seen who delivers them florists keep records if you pay cash and pick up the flowers yourself there wouldnt be any reason to ask for id she pressed her fingers to the back of her neck pressed and released fruitlessly working at a knot of tension someone might remember who quinn tells me his men have done a sweep of the florists in the area theres nothing the phone calls they havent been able to get a trace damn it if something or someone existed matt felt there must be a way to find him chantel maybe you should reconsider the police she turned back with him she could allow the weariness to show matt do you really think they could do more than quinns done i dont know the quiet desperation in her eyes was difficult to face he scowled down at his brandy i just dont know setting down his drink he crossed to her i was sure this thing would be tied up in a matter of days its not as simple as that it seems hes clever or cautious at any rate are you sure youve told quinn everything you know what i dont tell him he finds out nerves had her swirling the brandy around and around in her glass but not drinking hes running investigations on everyone i know well that including you he stopped to stare at her with a grimace he stuck his hands in his pockets and nervously pulled out his lighter hes thorough anyway i dont like it matt for the first time real emotion came into her voice into her eyes i feel i dont know sleazy when i think of him poking into the keyholes of peoples lives and on my account not quite comfortable matt slipped an arm around her shoulder look baby if rattling a few skeletons in my closet helps get to the bottom of this thing then its worth it he was silent a moment then cleared his throat so what did he find out about you thats a good place to start i dont know letting out a long breath she leaned her head on his shoulder the sun had disappeared completely leaving only a hint of color streaking the clouds i told him i didnt want to know matt he started to give me reports on people like larry and james brewster and i hated it she could still remember his cool disapproval of her cowardice chantel gritted her teeth against the memory we agreed that id take the precautions hed outlined and that hed keep what information he had to himself with one hand he flicked on the silver monogrammed lighter hed been toying with thats burying your head in the sand chantel i dont care listen theres no one certainly no one whos made it past twenty who hasnt done something theyre ashamed of something theyd prefer to keep covered he shifted but made himself speak matteroffactly quinns got a right to investigate and because of who he is nothing he finds out would go any farther thanks for the vote of confidence quinn paused in the doorway and studied them matt still had his arm around her chantels head rested on his shoulder as the dim light through the window behind them settled over her hair she looked comfortable with him quinn realized with a twinge of resentment she looked as though shed be content to snuggle up against him and sit for hours im the one who recommended you matt said easily id hate to say id made a mistake you didnt quinn crossed to the bar to pour himself a double shot of brandy howve you been matt i thought wed be seeing more of you ive been tied up sensing the restraint between them chantel took a step forward just stop it she told quinn dont start on him youre telling me how to do my job again angel im not going to allow you to use your third degree on my friends quinn tossed back his brandy too bad i left my rubber hose upstairs why dont we sit down matt put a hand on chantels shoulder i appreciate it babe but it isnt necessary his gaze locked with quinns i guess when i told chantel to hire you i should have figured youd dig it up quinn met the look but there was nothing to show his feelings yeah you should have dig what up she demanded quinn lifted his glass in a half salute maybe youd like to tell her yourself yes i would sit down chantel when she only looked at him matt squeezed her shoulder please sit down she felt the nowfamiliar churning in her stomach as she chose a chair all right im sitting a few years back almost ten now i ran into some financial problems he retrieved his brandy and took a deep swallow matt you dont have to tell me about this yes i do he looked back at quinn i want you to hear it from me he held up a hand before she could protest again just hear me out when im finished maybe i wont feel as though the blades about to fall on my neck all right she said evenly but her left hand moved restlessly on the arm of her chair gambling he said with a hint of fear in his voice matt thats absurd she nearly laughed you wont even play gin for matchsticks thats now this was then i couldnt keep away from the horses with a selfmocking smile he looked back at her its a fever and mine ran pretty hot until id dropped more than i could afford i was desperate id borrowed money from a certain group of people the kind who break small bones in your body if they dont get their weekly payment oh matt i needed ten thousand i didnt have i forged a check a clients check he closed his eyes before he took another swallow chantel sat in silence of course it didnt take long for it to come to light my client didnt want the publicity so he didnt press charges i mortgaged my soul then hocked the rest to pay him back you could call it a turning point in my life this time he laughed but there was no humor in it my career was on the line so i took a good hard look at myself because what i saw left me pretty shaken i checked into an organization for obsessive gamblers its been nearly eight years since ive been to the track even though gambling nearly ruined my life i have to fight the urge every day to place just one bet he set down his glass and looked at her if you want another agent ill understand she rose slowly and walked to him without a word she put her arms around him and gathered him close over his shoulder she sent quinn a long neutral look i dont want another agent you know i insist on the best with a muffled laugh he pressed a kiss to her brow youre a special lady someones always telling me that he gripped her fingers hard and she felt how damp his palms were i wouldnt let you down chantel i know he kissed her again before he drew away ive got to get going youll call if theres anything i can do of course he turned to quinn for a moment the men studied each other across the room if there was regret on either side they didnt show it take care of her i intend to with a brief nod matt let himself out chantel turned on quinn immediately how could you how could you humiliate him that way it was necessary but necessary or not it left a foul taste in his mouth quinn poured another brandy knowing that taste wouldnt be so easily washed away necessary why what does a gambling debt nearly ten years ago have to do with whats happening to me now if a man can develop one obsession he can develop another thats ridiculous no thats a fact a quiver ran through her not of fear but of anger matt burns has never attempted to be anything to me other than my agent and my friend and hes had abundant opportunity would you have let him chantel took a cigarette then flicked the table lighter three times before she managed to get it to flame what does that have to do with it he came closer curling his hand firmly around her arm would you no tossing her head she blew out smoke no and he knows it when she jerked her arm away he watched her pace the room youre good with scenarios try this one the man works with you for years he watches you soar straight to the top hes helped you layer by layer to build that illusion of cool icehard sexuality maybe he wants what he helped to create a shiver ran down her spine but her eyes were calm and level when she turned to him it doesnt play doran it plays as well as anything else no it doesnt the fear was back she fought hard to keep it from showing why wouldnt a man i know a man im close to just approach me openly because hes a man you know a man youre close to quinn countered he knows he doesnt have a chance with you on that level impatient she stubbed the cigarette out how would he know if hes never asked quinn put a hand to her cheek to stop her nervous pacing dont you think a man knows when a womans interested running a thumb down her jaw he brought her an inch closer it was there as it had been from the first humming between them she felt it damn it he knew she felt it even though she refused to show that she did dont you think he can look at a woman see the way she looks at him and know if theyre going to be lovers she put a hand to his wrist and carefully drew his away her skin felt as though it would stay warm for hours im tired she told him im going to bed when he was alone the brandy tempted him because it seemed too easy a way out he turned his back on it he went outside to walk the grounds chantel was finding sleep harder and harder to come by in the late hours she would toss and turn then fall into a light doze only to awake again nervous and groggy to toss and turn some more several times she had been tempted to give in and get a prescription for sleeping pills each time she remembered her promise never to tranquilize herself against pressure personal or professional she thought of matt of the selfdisgust and apology in his voice as hed told her something she had no business knowing she thought of quinn firm and unyielding but offering matt the chance to explain for himself oddly enough she thought of her brother and an argument theyd had when shed been a teenager trace had threatened to knock some boys block off if he got too familiar with her chantel remembered being furious at him for interfering and telling everyone she could handle things why wasnt she in control now she always had been even trace had known then she hadnt needed him to stand up for her perhaps because shed been one of three in the womb shed been born ready to handle her own problems shed faced tragedy personal loss and disillusionment but had always managed to fight her way back she wasnt fighting now and she should be it had never been necessary for her to look to a man for protection and yet then she thought of quinn again and his promise to protect her she wanted to believe him when he was there right beside her she did but it was the middle of the night and her brain was hazy she only wanted to sleep the sheets twisted around her as she turned again and finally drifted off when the phone rang she groped for it half dreaming she thought it was her mother calling to scold her for being late for rehearsal yes she mumbled into the receiver yes im coming i cant sleep i cant sleep for thinking of you the whisper had a low desperate edge to it that shocked chantel fully awake you have to stop this but i cant ive tried but i cant dont you know what you do to me every time i see you every time pro near you i no she shouted into the phone then to her disgust she began to weep please leave me alone please i dont want to hear any more but she could hear him as she turned her face into the pillow she could hear him still as she fumbled to hang up the phone even when she had the receiver cradled she could hear his voice echoing in her head chantel curled into a ball and let the tears come quinn was staring out his window when the phone rang cursing he dashed across the room hoping to get to it before it awakened chantel but the whispering had already started for a moment he thought he recognized something a speech pattern accent or turn of phrase he tried to focus on it block out the words themselves and chantels terror then his mouth tightened to a grim line as he heard chantel plead then begin to cry he heard her hang up then heard a man sobbing before the connection was broken after slamming down the receiver quinn plunged his hands into his pockets his fingers balling into fists hed lost something maybe something vital because his concentration and his objectivity had been broken when shed begun to cry the woman was making him soft he couldnt allow it wouldnt allow it he had to leave her alone shed want to be alone he told himself she wouldnt like to have him see her now that shed lost control a woman like chantel would shed her tears in private even if she looked for consolation the last person shed want it from was him struggling against an overpowering sense of rage and helplessness he stalked back to the window shed sounded so frightened he couldnt leave her alone now not now he thought as he pounded his clenched hand lightly against the windowsill she might want to be alone but she needed to be with him he only hoped he could figure out what to do once he was with her there were a few slashes of moonlight coming through her windows they turned everything to silver he came in quietly hoping shed fallen asleep again and that he could just check on her maybe sit with her awhile without her being aware of it if she knew how badly he wanted to be with her protect her damn it cherish her wouldnt that give her all the more reason to push him aside hed never had to use caution with a woman before because he was forced to admit no woman had really mattered until her and she mattered too much she wasnt asleep quinn could hear her muffled weeping as he crossed to the bed he stopped where he was terrified by the small helpless sound he knew how a grenade sounded when it exploded in the dirt and sent shrapnel hurtling through the air hed heard the horrific noise of gunfire and the unspeakable sound of a bullet striking flesh those were things hed faced with more confidence than he faced chantels quiet sobbing with now if she had been angry he could have played on it if she had merely been frightened he could have insulted her out of it but she was weeping soundlessly he went to the side of the bed and crouched down wishing he knew the right words but knowing he didnt he laid a hand on her hair at his touch she sprang up screaming its me its only me he took both her hands and squeezed relax no ones going to hurt you quinn her hand went limp in his then tensed again as she fought for control you startled me sorry the moonlight was strong enough that he could see her face and the tears damp on her cheeks you okay yes her chest was hurtfully tight her throat raw from unshed tears yes im fine i guess you heard the phone i heard it he dropped her hands because he was afraid hed break her fingers why dont i get you something water he stuck his hands in his pockets again something no i dont need anything she brought the heels of her hands over her face to dry her tears i couldnt keep him talking i just couldnt do it its all right no its not bringing her knees up she dropped her head on them its my problem and as long as i keep running from it its not going away everything youve said so far has been true everything youve done has been right and i havent been holding up my end nobodys blaming you chantel he started to reach out for her again to touch her creamy shoulders which were slumped in despair catching himself quinn clenched his hand you should try to get some sleep yeah he strained against his own helplessness where had he gotten the stupid idea that she needed him he didnt know the way to comfort and soothe he didnt have the pretty words that would relax her and help her sleep again he had nothing but a rage boiling inside him and a fierce desire to keep her safe neither of those would help her now look i can get you something go downstairs and make i dont know some tea with her face still pressed against her knees she squeezed her eyes tight no thanks ill be fine damn it i want to do something the explosion ripped out of him before he could stop it i cant stand seeing you like this let me get you some aspirin or sit in the chair until you can get to sleep something you cant ask me to just leave you alone hold me the words came out in a sob as she lifted her head could you just hold me a minute he sat beside her and gathering her close pressed her head to his shoulder sure as long as you want go ahead and let go angel she didnt have the strength to stop it and she no longer wanted to with his arms strong around her she let the full force of the tears come quinn cradled her close and murmured things he hoped would help things he wasnt even certain she heard when she began to quiet he stroked the hair back from her face and said nothing at all quinn hmmm thanks any time i dont make a habit of it she sniffled got a handkerchief no reluctant to shift away even slightly she reached for a tissue on her bedside table i guess i figured a man like you would head for the hills when a woman started she sniffled again blubbering this is different she tilted her head back her eyes were swollen her cheeks tearstreaked why its just different he brushed a tear from her lashes then though he felt foolish he let the moisture linger on his thumb feel better yes she did unaccountably for shed never believed tears solved anything now that they were shed she felt drained and embarrassed id ah appreciate it if we both forgot about this lapse in the morning never give yourself an inch do you i hate to cry she said it with such bitter finality that he knew shed shed hot tears over something before or someone me too that made her smile youre a nice guy when you put a little effort into it i try not to let it happen often he stroked her hair again before he shifted her closer it hadnt been so hard to comfort he discovered it wasnt so hard to be needed think you can sleep now i guess she closed her eyes discovering it felt enormously good to let her cheek rest against his he ran a comforting hand over her back then tensed when he felt silk give way to flesh tomorrows sunday you can stay in bed all day i have a photo session at one with her eyes still closed she explored the muscles of his shoulders with her fingertips you can cancel it ill be okay the photographers accommodating me because of the shooting schedule then youd better get some rest or youll look like hell thanks a lot youre welcome when he drew her back she tilted her head up and smiled at him his fingers tensed on her shoulders and hers on his and her smile faded the need vibrated between them so urgently that it set the air humming id better go no the decision had already been made she knew perhaps before theyd even met her heart had just accepted it she loved there was no changing it until now until him she hadnt known how much she needed to have the chance to love again i want you to stay she slid her hands over his shoulders i want you to make love with me the ache that had begun to throb just from looking at her turned sharp and stabbing a painfully sweet sensation her hands felt so cool on his skin her eyes looked so warm and dark the moonlight dappled over her like a dream but he couldnt afford to forget reality chantel i want you so much right now i can hardly breathe but he slid his hands up to her wrists i dont know if i could live with the fact that this happened between us because you were scared and shaky a smile curved her lips as she brought them closer to his havent you figured out yet that i know what i want she turned her head slightly so that her kiss brushed his chin didnt you say that a man could tell just by the way a woman looked at him cant you see the way im looking at you maybe i only see the way i want you to look but his fingers had tangled in her hair i want you to stay she repeated not because im scared i want you to stay because of the way you make me feel when you kiss me when you hold me when you touch me she rubbed her cheek against his i want you to stay because you can make me forget theres anything outside of this room something snapped inside him some would call it control with an oath he dragged his hands through her hair and plundered her mouth she was everything dark and desperate and desirable she was pure aphrodisiac as they knelt on the bed he let his dreams spring to life and rained kisses over her face her hair her throat the scent that was so much a part of her misted through his brain like a fog and she trembled not on cue but from pleasure from the pleasure he gave her halfmad he crushed his lips to hers again and tasted her passion never before and she was certain never again would a man bring her to life this way never before and never again would she want like this her body was like a furnace pumping heat and energy while her mind was flooded with a brilliant kaleidoscope of sensation no never again would a man bring her this because there was only one man shed known it somehow from the first everything was so clear she felt the scrape of his chin over her shoulder felt the mattress sink under their combined weights as they knelt torsototorso she could see the moonlight against his skin as she ran her hands over his shoulders and down his muscles contracted at her touch and she heard the soft hiss of his indrawn breath desperation flavored his kisses and fueled her own need a kaleidoscope a whirlwind a race the scents from her garden crept into the room with a gurgle of delight she lowered her lips to his shoulder and nipped a man could lose his mind and his soul to her quinn felt his chest constrict as he ran his hands freely over her pain and power they were both twined together in his need for her she made him hurt and made him soar just by being in his arms it wasnt just the perfection of form of face but the wild wanton sexuality she had encased in glittering ice released it was a pandoras box of emotions some dark some dangerous some desperately exciting he wouldnt resist her he couldnt he could feel her tremble hear her moan as he touched and tasted and tempted her skin was hot already damp her breath caught on his name tonight even if it was just for tonight he would make her as frenzied as he he gathered her hair in his hand drawing her head back to expose the long white line of her throat her pulse beat frantically as he traced his tongue over it her hands moved over his chest then lower and his stomach muscles quivered at her touch as she tugged at the snap on his jeans he found her breast through the thin silk she wore when he drew both silk and flesh into his mouth she strained against him shuddering her throat filled with indistinct murmurs of pleasure she tugged the denim over his hips the feel of her hands on him drove every rational thought from his mind in one crazed movement he ripped the silk from her rending it down the middle her gasp was muffled against his mouth as he dragged her down beneath him he couldnt think he could only feel when he plunged into her she was so warm so moist he wondered if a man could die from being given his ultimate wish then she was wrapped around him driving him even as he sought to drive her he could see her her hair spread out on tumbled white sheets her eyes half closed her lips slightly parted as the breath trembled out quinn his name whispered from her as she was tossed by titanic waves of sensation heat light wind nothing had prepared her for this she tried to tell him but his lips were on hers again she was a part of him release came in a torrent that left her too stunned for speech she didnt know what to say would he expect some clever phrase some easy words it wasnt possible to explain that she had given herself to only one other man and never truly never like this if it hadnt mattered so much if he hadnt mattered so much she was sure she could have come up with something to break the long silence and the tension she felt building again he didnt know what to say hed taken her like a madman she deserved better more care certainly more finesse if only he hadnt lost control but he had quinn reminded himself ruthlessly he couldnt change that any more than he could change the fact that hed damaged whatever might have been growing between them he could only hope it wasnt too late to repair it both of them tensed then turned then spoke each others names at the same time the awkwardness lasted only a moment before they grinned i was thinking you were right she began about me needing a script i cant think of what i want to say ive been having some trouble with that myself he took her hand and brought it to his lips i guess i was a little rough were you amused and relieved chantel groped for the remains of her silk teddy lifting a brow she dropped it on his chest quinn rubbed the material between his thumb and forefinger you could deduct it from my check i intend to three hundred and fifty three hundred and fifty he rose on one elbow and examined the ripped silk more carefully youve got to be crazy to spend threefifty on something you sleep in i enjoy indulging myself to prove her point she leaned over and nibbled on his lips and under the circumstances i think it only fair that i deduct half the price half it was a joint effort she smiled and ran a fingertip over his chest besides it was worth it was it his hand came up her leg to rest on her hip you sure well im a cautious woman and you know what they say in the business no her hair teased his shoulders as she leaned over him what do they say in the business take chantel sighed lowering herself to him chapter eight contents prev next quinn i promise you this is going to take a good three hours maybe four chantel got out of the car then leaned over to take her garment bag from the hook by the passenger door he noticed how nicely the slim skirt fit over her bottom i can be patient a photo session is often very tedious for the people involved much less for someone who just has to sit there let me worry about that he advised and took the bag from her i have to worry about it knowing youre hanging around grumbling under your breath is going to make me tense chantel pressed a buzzer on the outside door then tipped down her sunglasses to peer over them and tension will show in the pictures this layout for the scene is very important he pushed the glasses back up on her nose so are you it warmed her she no longer knew how to pretend it didnt chantel rose on her toes to brush a kiss over his lips i appreciate that but ill be perfectly safe margot will be there to do my hair and the makeup artist is a freelancer ive worked with before mrs alice cooke they have to stay for the whole session ill be surrounded by wellmeaning women and the photographer he reminded her im not letting you alone with this bryan mitchell or any other man chantel started to correct him then thought better of it a woman was entitled to take every advantage offered she ran a finger over the collar of his shirt jealous cautious bryan mitchell the voice coming through the intercom was low smooth and feminine its chantel ohurley for the one oclock session right on time there was a mechanical buzz from inside the door and then it unlatched bryan mitchell is a tall gorgeous blonde chantel began as they climbed the inside stairs weve been friends for years quinn wrapped his fingers around hers all the more reason im not leaving you alone with him until this thing is settled the only man youre having solitary dealings with is me well chantel paused at the studio door and wrapped her arms around him i like that she murmured and met his lips with hers i bet you do bryan stood in the open doorway grinning quinn doran chantel laid a hand lightly on his arm bryan mitchell the photographer was indeed tall blond and gorgeous she was also a woman quinn shot chantel a look as she smiled nice meeting you bryan offered him a hand already wondering if she could convince him to sit for her welcome to chaos she told them as she gestured them inside im still setting up chantel you know where the cold drinks are hairdressing and makeup are in the back room having an argument about fashion personally i cant get emotionally involved over whether henna is back to stay as she spoke she walked over to a set of white umbrellas and adjusted them chantel walked to a cramped little room off the side of the studio and poked in the refrigerator quinn its going to be like this for hours there must be something else you want to do he could hear the other two women chattering in the back room something about facial packs and eye tucks i can think of a couple dozen then go do them chantel set down the bottle of soda to take both of his hands bryan had the security system installed a few months ago when there was a rash of robberies in the neighborhood no one gets through the outside door unless she releases the lock im surrounded by women wholl be fussing over me for hours and youll distract all of us go play some handball or something she was right shed be safe here and hed be in the way as well as unmercifully bored then too it would help him to have a couple of hours away from her a couple of hours of pure physical exertion would he work her out of his system gyms a couple of blocks down he muttered jim who the gym he corrected putting his hands on her hips you mean one of those places with weights and nasty machines that make you grunt and sweat more or less taking out his notebook he wrote down a name and number call me when youre finished and ill come back and pick you up rizzos she kept her face bland as she looked up at him sounds serious just call he leaned down to bite her lightly on the bottom lip why dont you go make yourself beautiful she kept her arms around him as she lifted a brow arent i already he knew she hadnt so much as picked up a tube of mascara that morning her eyes were blue and brilliant her skin luminous and pale fresh and dewy as it was now her beauty was heartbreaking he lifted a hand to skim it over her cheek such a hag before she could retaliate he had her close cutting off her breath in a kiss that seemed to last for hours he needed to lift weights quinn thought he had to sweat some of the need for her out of his system try to do something about that face will you take a walk doran he grinned at her then slipped back into the studio chantel let out a shaky breath and leaned her palms against the cluttered counter beside the refrigerator there was nothing she could do and she was nearly ready to admit there was nothing she wanted to do about the fact that she was in love with him it was probably a mistake a desperate one but it had already been made somehow if she could somehow draw back a part of herself she wouldnt be so devastated when he went his own way and he would wouldnt he a man like quinn lived alone worked alone walked alone when his job was over hed kiss her goodbye and go she caught her bottom lip between her teeth and straightened no he wouldnt not if she had anything to do with it youre going to lose this match doran she promised herself no way was he going to walk away and leave her chantel theyre ready for you she was ready too chantel left the drink on the counter she was more than ready for two hours she worked nonstop her hair was frizzed smoothed sprayed and gelled her face was painted and powdered every time she changed her outfit her hair and face were subtly altered to enhance the look bryan worked with a slow steady enthusiasm as she always did i havent asked you how shade is put your right hand on your left shoulder bryan instructed spread your fingers good shades terrific hes home changing diapers she caught chanters quick mischievous grin on film that id like to see hes great at it organized you know well i can tell you you dont look as though you had a baby two months ago who has time to eat tilt your chin up and try for aloof thats it she crouched shifting angles andrew colby is a tenpound slave driver and youre crazy about him bryan lowered her camera and beamed hes the most fantastic baby between shade and me weve taken at least five hundred rolls of film every day theres some little change she tossed her long blond braid behind her back you can see how bright he is just by the way he looks at things just yesterday he she cut herself off with a laugh stop me its an obsession no chantel smiled though the quick pang of envy she felt surprised her its lovely it is you know i never saw myself as a mother she lifted the camera back into place now i cant imagine life without andrew or shade the right man can change your outlook i guess bryan decided the wistful expression that flitted across chanters face would be the best shot yet you sure make my work easier bringing herself back chantel looked at the camera hows that turn to the side and look over your shoulder a bit more smolder a little she pressed the shutter four times in rapid succession a face like yours is always a pleasure to shoot especially when you bring so much to it but i didnt expect the bonus what bonus chantel asked as she shifted to look over her other shoulder theres nothing more terrific than photographing a woman in love close your mouth she ordered then lowered her camera to stretch her shoulders slowly chantel turned to face bryan again its that obvious dont you want it to be no yes i dont know she pushed a hand through her carefully groomed hair i dont want to make a fool of myself that kind of goes hand in hand with falling in love but i think youll survive it hes got a great face i dont suppose you could talk him into sitting for me maybe if you bound him hand and foot bryan how did you handle shade bryan took a chocolate bar out of her back pocket youre asking me for advice on men chantel accepted a sliver of the chocolate dont let it get around have you felt like murdering him yet several times youre making progress the best thing i can tell you is to let things happen were wrapped here she bit into the candy if i were you i wouldnt waste whats left of the weekend the gym smelt like men damp athletic men the air was filled with sweat and swearing most of the patrons had stripped down to shorts and a few had added tshirts on a mat a man with weights on his legs grunted his way through a series of situps on a bench press another man swore repetitively every time he extended the bar over his head the equipment was topnotch but it had long since lost its shine chantel strolled in and absorbed both brows lifted the first one who saw her was a young man pulling weights up the walls with two ropes he was working steadily the veins in his neck bulging out as he rotated his arms his mouth dropped open and the ropes snapped back against the wall chantel smiled at him careful to keep her skirts clear she circled around the bench press the man stopped swearing as his eyes bugged out it took less than ten seconds for the noisy steamy gym to drop into silence then she saw quinn he hadnt noticed the sudden quiet with his back to the room he was systematically jabbing at a punching bag its buffeting noise was the only sound in the room he looked magnificent legs spread eyes intense his powerful back tensed as he concentrated on his timing the small brown bag was a blur as his fists never let it rest chantel walked over to him waited a moment then ran a fingertip down his back hello darling he swore and spun his hand still fisted and lifted chantel raised a brow then her chin as if inviting him to take his best shot what the hell are you doing here watching you she took a finger and pushed at the bag tell me whats the purpose of beating at this little thing i told you to call me he swiped sweat out of his eyes in order to glare at her better i felt like a walk besides i wanted to see where a man like you played deliberately she looked over her shoulder and scanned the room fascinating every man in the room sucked in his stomach with an oath quinn took her by the arm you must be crazy you dont belong in a place like this why ever not as they passed the man on the bench press chantel sent him a brilliant smile the weights clattered against the safety bar cut that out he muttered rizzo im using your office oh where is he as he dragged her out chantel glanced back im dying to meet him shut up do you have to walk in here with legs like that theyre all i have to walk on sit he shoved her into a torn plastic chair what the hell am i supposed to do with you would you like a multiple choice this isnt a joke damn it he pushed at the clutter on rizzos desk until he found a crumpled pack of camels look chantel we made an arrangement you were supposed to call there are reasons he shook out a cigarette and lit it quinn its a beautiful afternoon and it wasnt far there isnt much opportunity to stroll in la and i couldnt resist if youre going to tell me i cant walk two blocks on a public street in broad daylight ill scream she glanced toward the door i cant imagine what your ah associates would make of that he exhaled a long stream of smoke then crushed the cigarette into a mess of brown tobacco and white paper you go nowhere without me you had instructions chantel and i trusted you to follow them oh lighten up she rose and put her palms on his bare chest im sweating like a pig he muttered taking her wrists i noticed i dont know what it is that attracts men to a place that smells like old athletic socks but if this is how you keep in shape she glanced down approvingly i might just have to install a gym at home dont change the subject what subject was that i dont want anything to happen to you she touched her tongue to her upper lip and edged closer why youve already been paid for this week i dont care about the damn money he said with violence what do you care about quinn you he said it between his teeth before he spun away hed thought he needed space just some space and time to get his equilibrium back there wasnt that much space in the whole world dont pull anything like this again all right im sorry ive got to shower stay in here when the door slammed at his back chantel sat again he cared she closed her eyes and hugged the knowledge to her he cared about her if shed gotten him to say it the next step was getting him to like it how long are you going to be angry they were driving home with the top down chantel had let the first fifteen minutes pass in silence im not angry youre clenching your teeth consider yourself lucky thats all im doing quinn ive already said i was sorry im not going to apologize again no ones asking you to he downshifted around a curve what i am asking is that you take the situation youre in seriously you dont think i am not after that little stunt of yours this afternoon she shifted in her seat the wind picked up her hair and tossed it as her temper snapped stop treating me like a child i understand the situation im in perfectly i live with it twentyfour hours a day every day every night every time the phone rings every time i go through my mail when i go to sleep at night thats what im thinking of when i wake up in the morning thats what im thinking of if i cant have an hour now and then when i can push it aside ill go crazy im trying to survive doran dont talk to me as though im irresponsible she shifted away again and again silence reigned he was right quinn told himself as he slacked his speed but so was she there were times because she put up such a good front when he believed shed forgotten she was in any danger she never forgot he realized she just refused to buckle except in her private moments he didnt know how to tell her he loved her for that above everything else loved her that was a tough one to swallow but then the truth often was the more his feelings for her grew the more he worried about her wellbeing he knew she worked hard and for long hours with the kind of strain she was under she could only keep up that pace for a limited time even a woman as strong willed as chantel would lose eventually damn it he wished he had something anything to go on they were moving into their third week and he was no closer to putting things right than he had been on the first day he needed to see her safe secure content even though he was afraid that once she was shed write him a check and kiss him off quinns hands tightened on the wheel then gradually relaxed she was going to have a fight on her hands when it came to that relax he told himself she wasnt going to get away moving only his eyes he took in the stiff angry way she sat angel he told her silently im just the man to clip your wings quinn tossed his arm casually over the back of the seat youre pouting go to hell youre going to get lines all over your face if you keep that up then where will you be kiss my love to he pulled over to the side of the road she didnt even have the chance to snarl at him before he gathered her close why dont i start with that homely face of yours and work my way down no okay if youd rather i take it from the bottom up when he started to shift her she began to struggle in earnest stop it i dont want you to kiss me anywhere are you sure he brought her wrist to his lips and brushed them over the inside how about there no here then he pressed his mouth to the side of her throat she stopped struggling no well other options are a little risky on the side of the road but if you insist stop the laughter bubbled up as she shoved him away chantel leaned against the door and crossed her arms you creep i love it when you insult me then youre going to love this she began but he was too quick whatever shed had in mind was muffled against his mouth response came instantly from the heart her arms went around him and her lips parted for a moment there was nothing but the warm lateafternoon sun and sheer unbridled pleasure her eyes stayed closed seconds after hed drawn his lips from hers when they opened slowly the irises were dark and clouded are you trying to make up she murmured for what her lips curved as she framed his face with her hands never mind lets go home quinn he touched his lips to hers again lingering before he sat back and started the engine by the way rizzo wanted to know if he could have an autographed picture for his office chantel laughed then sat back to enjoy the rest of the drive as they rode by the high wall surrounding her grounds she began to toy with the idea of a long dip in the pool bryan was right it would be a pity to waste what was left of the weekend even as she turned to ask quinn to join her he was bringing the car to a fast stop quinn we really should wait until were inside theres a car in front of the gates his tone had her tensing as she looked around a mans there see looks like hes causing quite a bit of commotion you dont think that she moistened her lips he wouldnt come right to the front gate why dont we find out he took the keys from the ignition and unlocked the glove compartment chantel watched as he drew out a revolver it was nothing like her dainty little and she was just as certain it wasnt unloaded quinn stay here no i dont argue but i dont want you to as the argument at the gate heated up the voices drifted to her listening intently chantel tightened her grip on quinn i dont believe it she murmured she squinted trying to make out the figure in the distance i just dont believe it she repeated and sprang out of the car before quinn could stop her chantel its pop laughing she spun back to quinn its pop my father her long legs flashed as she sped up the rest of the road pop still laughing she threw her arms wide frank ohurley turned from his spirited argument with the guard his thin face erupted into a grin theres my girl spry and wiry he pumped down the remaining distance and caught chantel close with a whoop he spun her in three dizzying circles hows my little princess surprised she kissed his babysmooth face then hugged him again he smelled as he always did of powder and peppermint i didnt know you were coming dont need an invitation do i dont be silly well tell that to the joker on the other side of the gate the idiot wouldnt let me in even when i told him i was your own flesh and blood im sorry miss ohurley the stifffaced man behind the gate speared frank with a look the crazy old man had threatened to pull out his tongue and wrap it around his neck there was no one here to verify thats all right all right frank piped up he was primed and ready for a donnybrook all right when your own fathers treated like a trespasser dont be cranky chantel brushed at his lapels ive added to the security thats all why immediately alert he cupped chantels chin whats wrong its nothing well get into all that later now im just glad to see you she glanced back at the dusty rental car wheres mom said she wasnt fit to see anyone until shed been to the beauty parlor i wasnt going to sit around cooling my heels while shes getting primped up shell be taking a cab out later but tell me what youre doing here how long you can stay what god be praised girl cant it wait until a mans washed the dust out of his throat drove clear from vegas today vegas i didnt know you had a gig in vegas you dont know everything he tweaked her nose then looked over her shoulder as quinn pulled up now who might this be thats quinn she shot him a quick look quinn doran youre right pop we can talk better inside especially after youve had a glass of the irish now youre talking frank hopped back in his car then sailed through the nowopen gates chantel saw him look down his nose at the guard your father quinn asked when she climbed back in the car yes i wasnt expecting him but thats nothing new her fingers twisted together you put the gun away he lifted a hand to the guard as he drove through dont worry but i am i didnt want to bring my family into all this chantel pressed the bridge of her nose between her thumb and forefinger im going to have to tell them something hes seen the guard at the gates hes bound to notice the men patrolling the grounds why dont you try the truth i dont want to worry my parents damn i only get to see them three or four times a year and now this she looked at quinn as he slowed at the end of the drive and i have to explain you the truth he repeated all right i cant think of anything else she put a hand on his arm before he could climb out but ill do it my way i want to play it down as much as possible well now beaming and affable frank strolled over to the car looks like youve got yourself a fine strong fellow here chantel quinn doran my father frank ohurley pleased to meet you frank offered a hand and pumped quinns exuberantly wouldnt mind helping me in with the bags would you son chantel had to smile when frank popped open his trunk and took out a small shoulder bag leaving two large cases for quinn you never change she murmured hooking an arm through his to lead him into the house just leave them there she told quinn gesturing to the base of the staircase you can take them up later thanks she met his sarcasm with an easy smile why dont you two go into the living room and have a drink i want to tell the cook therell be two more for dinner leaving quinn with a brief warning look she started down the hall well son i dont know about you frank said giving quinn a solid slap on the back but i could use a drink he trotted off into the living room and headed directly to the bar whats your pleasure scotch frank shrugged his narrow shoulders then poured to each his own locating the bottle of whiskey he gave a satisfied grunt and poured a generous three fingers well now quinn is it why dont we drink to my girl he tapped his glass solidly against quinns without regard for the pricey rosenthal crystal then swallowed deeply now thats a drink a man can wrap his heart around have a seat son have a seat still playing the congenial host he gestured to a chair before finding one for himself now he settled back and sighed then abruptly his eyes were shrewd and sharp just what are you doing with my daughter pop grateful for her timing chantel strolled into the room then sat on the arm of her fathers chair youll have to excuse him quinn hes never been subtle quinn regarded his scotch for a moment seems like a reasonable question to me there satisfied with what he saw frank nodded were going to get along just fine i wouldnt be surprised she murmured ruffling her fathers hair so tell me how it went in vegas be glad to he sipped his whiskey again appreciating its smooth heat just as soon as you explain why you have a trained gorilla at your front gate i told you i added some security but when she started to rise frank put a firm hand on her knee you wouldnt try to con an old hand like me would you princess it would be useless she admitted and settled back ive been getting some annoying phone calls thats all it seemed wise to take a few precautions what kind of phone calls just nuisance calls chantel he knew his daughter too well a few nuisance calls would have been brushed off laughed off and forgotten is someone threatening you no no its nothing like that realizing she was being backed into a corner she shot a pleading look at quinn i still opt for the truth he said simply thanks for the help just be quiet frank told her and there was such uncharacteristic authority in his tone that she closed her mouth instantly you tell me whats going on he ordered quinn and what you have to do with it quinn chantel margaret louise ohurley shut your mouth and keep it shut when she did quinn could only smile nice trick he said to frank i use it selectively to keep it fresh frank swallowed the rest of his whiskey lets hear it briefly concisely quinn outlined what chantel was dealing with as he spoke franks brows lowered his thin face reddened and the hand still resting on chanters knee clenched slimy bastard frank rose out of the chair like a terrier ready to charge if youre a detective quinn doran why in hell havent you found him because he hasnt made a mistake quinn set down his glass and met franks outraged glare levelly but he will and ill find him if he hurts my girl hes not going to get near her quinn interrupted flatly because he has to go through me first frank swallowed his fury it was something he didnt often bother to do and measured the man in front of him hed always prided himself on being a good judge of character you needed to know whether to raise your fists or laugh and back off the man in front of him was hard as a rock and mean as they came if he had to trust his daughter to someone this was the one so youre staying here in the house with chantel thats right im going to take care of her mr ohurley you have my word on that frank hesitated only a moment before his teeth showed in a smile if you dont ill skin you alive and make it frank cool and regal chantel rose perhaps i could say a word now dont put that face on with me girl frank crossed to her then gently framed her face in his hands you should have come to your family with this there was no point in worrying you point frank shook his head from side to side were family were the ohurleys we stick together pop maddys getting married at the end of the week abbys pregnant trace is youll kindly leave him out of it frank said stiffly family business has nothing to do with your brother thats his choice really pop after all this time you should and dont change the subject your mother and me and your sisters are entitled to worry about you it wasnt the time to go to her brothers defense and chantel wasnt entirely sure hed care one way or the other now she wanted to smooth those lines of worry from her fathers face all right then she kissed him soundly worry all you want but everything that can be done is being done he kept his hand on her shoulder but turned to quinn were off to new york on friday to see my daughter married off youll be going with us i didnt think it was necessary to drag quinn to im going he interrupted his eyes met chanters in something like a challenge ive already made the arrangements you never mentioned it to me why should i he countered for the simple pleasure of watching fury rise in her eyes it hardly seems im necessary does it feeling squeezed from all sides she bristled if youll both excuse me im going to go soak my head nasty little number isnt she frank asked with obvious pride as she stalked out all that and more its the irish you know were either poets or fighters ohurleys are a bit of both im looking forward to meeting the rest of your family and theyll want to get a look at you frank said to himself tell me quinn he began in an amiable tone do you intend to ah keep your eye on chantel so to speak after this business is settled quinn studied the man across from him it seemed it was still time for truths yes whether she likes it or not frank gave a quick laugh lets have another drink chapter nine contents prev next mom theres no reason for you to do that molly ohurley carefully folded a white silk jacket in tissue why should you call a maid up here years of experience had molly packing chantels clothes with a minimum of fuss its her job molly brushed her objections away with the back of her hand i never feel i can speak my mind in front of maids and butlers chantel looked at the suitcase and at her stacks of clothes shed spent the first twenty years of her life packing and unpacking as a matter of principle she hadnt done so in years but shed never been able to win a fight with her mother resigned chantel began a careful selection of her toiletries im sorry we havent had much time together the past few days dont be silly brisk and practical molly rattled more tissue paper youre in the middle of that film your father and i didnt expect to be entertained pop seemed to be entertained the day you came to the set chuckling molly glanced up she was a pretty trim woman who managed to look a decade younger than her years with a minimum of effort looking at her chantel acknowledged that the rush and craziness of her parents lifestyle suited molly just as much as it did frank he did didnt he still i dont think he should have argued with the director about how to set the scene mary has a a sense of humor good thing for the next few moments they packed in silence chantel were worried about you mom thats exactly what i dont want you to do we love you you cant expect us to love you and not be concerned i know she slipped a bottle of perfume into a padded travel box thats why i didnt want to tell you about what was going on you had to worry enough about me when i was growing up you dont expect a parent to turn off the juice just because a childs past the age of twentyone no i suppose not she smiled and slipped her set of makeup brushes into their cases but it seems like you should have less to worry about after a certain age i can only tell you that one day youll find out differently yourself there was that pang again chantels brows drew together as she tried to ignore it i dont know about that she murmured i do know i dont want this business to affect the family what affects one of us affects all of us thats that molly said it so matteroffactly chantel was forced to smile your irish is showing and why shouldnt it molly wanted to know your father and i think we should come back with you after the wedding back here chantel stopped to stare you cant you have a gig in new hampshire molly folded a pair of linen slacks by the pleats and said with a little smile chantel your father and i have been performing for over thirtyfive years i dont think canceling one engagement is going to make much of a ripple no chantel set down the bottles and pots in her hands to reach for her mother i cant tell you how much it means to me to know that you would but what could you do we could be with you you could hardly even do that mom ill be filming for weeks more youve seen in the last few days how little im home id be a wreck thinking about you sitting around here twiddling your thumbs when youd want to be working sitting around here as in lounging by the pool chantels lips curved but she shook her head if i could believe youd be content for more than fortyeight hours it would be different be logical mom if you stayed id be worried because you were worried pop would drive the staff crazy and i wouldnt even be around to enjoy it i told frank youd feel this way with a sigh molly touched chantels hair i always worried about you the most you know i guess i gave you the most cause you did what you had to and trace also was going to go his own way no matter what your father refused to see it but it was there from the time he could walk somehow i always knew abby and maddy would be all right even when abby was going through the mess of her first marriage and maddy was struggling to keep herself in dancing shoes but you molly caressed her daughters cheek i was always afraid youd miss what was beside you because you were always looking so far ahead i want you to be happy chantel i am no i am really these past few weeks even with this other business hanging over my head ive found something quinn chantel made a restless movement before walking to the windows its obvious to everyone but him the way i feel molly had formed her own opinion of quinn doran he wasnt an easy man nor would he often be a gentle one but her daughter didnt need an easy gentle man she needed one whod give her a run for her money men are more thickheaded molly commented she was a woman who knew well just how thickheaded men could be why dont you tell him no she turned back then rested the heels of her hands on the windowsill at least not yet this is going to sound foolish but i want i need him to respect me me she repeated for what i am i need to be certain hes not just passing the time chantel you cant use dustin price as a yardstick im not anger crept into her voice she managed to control it only because her mothers eyes remained so steady no im not but it isnt something thats easy to forget no its impossible but you cant live your life with that as the foundation have you told quinn about him no i cant mom there are so many complications now why bring up another its been nearly seven years do you trust quinn yes dont you think hed understand she pressed her fingers to her eyes for a moment if i was sure he loved me really sure that whats between us is real i could tell him anything even that i wish i could tell you there were guarantees but i cant molly crossed to her and gathered chantel close i can tell you that i wouldnt consider leaving you not for a minute until everything was resolved if i wasnt sure quinn was going to protect you he makes me feel safe until i met him i didnt know anyone could she squeezed her eyes shut i didnt know i needed anyone who could we all need to feel safe chantel and loved molly stroked her hair the light silverblond locks shed brushed and braided so often in the past theres something i havent told you something i should have told you a long time ago she embraced chantel im very proud of you oh mom as the tears welled up molly shook her head now none of that she murmured if we go downstairs with puffy eyes your father will be pinching at me to find out why weve been sitting up here crying she kissed chantels cheek and held on for another moment lets finish packing mom yes dear ive always been proud of you too well molly cleared her throat but her voice was still husky when she spoke thats quite a thing to hear from a grown daughter youre going to be all right im going to be fine im going to be terrific thats my girl now lets be about our business turning away molly made herself busy look at this clucking her tongue she held up a brief nightgown fashioned of black silk and lace it looks like sin chantel rubbed a knuckle under her eyes to dry them and giggled i cant give it an evaluation yet i just bought it molly held it up to the sunlight i think it speaks for itself you like it pleased chantel came over folded it carefully and handed it back to her mother a souvenir from beverly hills dont be silly but molly couldnt resist rubbing a thumb over the silk i couldnt wear a thing like this why not im the mother of four grown children you didnt pick us from under cabbage leaves well your father would she trailed off speculating chantel watched a wicked gleam come into her eyes thank you dear molly set the nightgown apart from the rest of chantels lingerie and ill thank you for your father in advance by the time they went downstairs again frank could be heard picking his banjo hes practicing molly said so he can play at the reception theyll have to knock him unconscious to keep him from performing you know maddy wouldnt have it any other way its about time woman frank looked up as his family walked in but his fingers never stilled a man needs some backup you know this one here he jerked his head toward quinn wont sing a note just doing you a favor quinn said easily as he lounged back on the sofa never heard of a body that wouldnt sing frank commented heard plenty that couldnt but never one who wouldnt sit here molly my love lets show the man what the ohurleys are made of obligingly molly sat beside him picked up the count and launched into the song with a strong practiced voice chantel sat on the arm of the sofa beside quinn and listened to the familiar sound of her parents working together it was good it was solid the tension of the past weeks drained away come on princess you remember the chorus chantel joined in the words and rhythm of the bright novelty number coming easily she rarely sang on her own to chantel singing was a family affair even now as she added her voice to her parents she thought of trace and her sisters and the countless times theyd all sung that same old song shed surprised him quinn sat back enjoying himself as frank merged one tune into another chantel wasnt the cool movie star now nor was she the restless passionate woman hed discovered beneath that facade she was at home with the nonsense songs her father played she was a daughter a loving one the innocence hed once sensed in her was apparent as she laughed and accused her father of missing a note her scent was there dark and sultry in contrast to her relaxed playful behavior hed never seen her like this never known she could be like this he wondered if she realized how much her family meant to her if she knew how her hollywood image faded when she was with them it had been a good week chantel didnt know of the letters that had come because hed intercepted them nor did she know that they had traced one of the calls to a phone booth downtown quinn saw no reason to tell her or to hit her with the fact that two of the letters had begged for a meeting in new york he knew her plans quinn lifted a hand and ran it down her arm chanters fingers linked naturally with his there was no point in telling her she wouldnt be alone in new york not for a moment hed already arranged for three of his best men to fly to manhattan every step chantel took would be monitored frank interrupted quinns train of thought as he shot a challenging look at his daughter do you still play that thing or do you use it as a doorstop chantel glanced at the white baby grand then examined her nails i manage to hit a few keys with a big beautiful instrument like that you should be able to do a lot more i dont want to show you up pop thatll be the day with a shrug she stood and moved to the piano deliberately she fluttered her lashes sat then went into a long complicated arpeggio youve been practicing frank accused then cackled with delight chantel shot a look at quinn i dont spend my evenings darning socks quinn acknowledged the hit with a slight inclination of his head your daughters full of surprises frank no need to tell me that the stories i could tell you why there was the time requests chantel interrupted sweetly unless pop wants me to tie his tongue in a nice neat bow always cautious frank cleared his throat why dont you do that little number your mother wouldnt let you sing until you turned eighteen abby always did that one best true enough franks grin was crooked and amiable but you werent halfbad molly managed to hide a smile as chantels eyes narrowed halfbad she wrinkled her nose at him as she gave herself a flowing introduction the low torchy ballad prickled along quinns skin her voice was as smooth as the scotch in his hand and just as potent the words were plaintive vulnerable but with her voice they became seductive she wore white as she sat behind the glossy white piano but he no longer thought of angels the room grew warmer just from the sound of her voice it seemed to weigh on him pressing down until he was no longer sure he was even breathing then she brought her gaze up from the keys to meet his it wasnt a song of love but of love lost the thought came to him then that if he lost her there were no words written that could describe his desperation shed made him ache before and shed made him burn now for the first time she made him weak she played the last chords with her eyes still locked on his not halfbad frank repeated pleased with her delivery now if youd its late frank molly patted his hand loving him for the knucklehead he was we should go up to bed tomorrows going to be a long day late nonsense its barely late molly repeated and getting later by the minute i have a surprise for you upstairs but i was just getting a surprise thats right come along frank good night quinn molly but he couldnt take his eyes off chantel all right all right im coming good night you two chantel see if that cook of yours can make waffles in the morning will you night pop she tilted her cheek for his kiss but her eyes stayed locked on quinns as he climbed the stairs with his wife frank could be heard demanding what his surprise was you were right quinn murmured when the room was silent again about what you are terrific he rose and came to her taking both her hands he turned them palm up and pressed his lips to the center of each one the more im with you he murmured the more i know you the more i want with her hands still in his she stood light glowed in her eyes ive never in my life felt about anyone the way i feel about you i need you to believe that and i need to believe it they were close very close to taking that final step commitments promises dependence he felt himself teeter on the edge ready but was afraid she would pull back and away if he pressed too soon tell me what you want chantel you she could give that answer truthfully enough without demanding more than she thought he was ready to give i only want to be with you for how long he wanted to ask but fear stopped him he would take today tonight and fight for tomorrow come to bed hands linked hearts lost they climbed the stairs they left a low light burning beside the bed odd she thought that her pulse should be hammering so hard that her nerves should be fluttering so wildly when she already knew what they could bring to each other why should it feel so different this time so special so much she realized dimly like the first time the only time she offered her mouth anticipating the hard demand of his he was gentle he was tender as he brushed his lips lightly over hers she felt her muscles go lax and her bones melt he cupped her face with his hands so that his thumbs traced like whispers like promises over her throat she sighed his name as she felt herself float what kind of passion was this that crept in so quietly desire was there already thrumming but with each caress he soothed it and stoked it his mouth was patient gliding over her face as if he wanted to memorize the essence of her through touch and taste he strung small feathery kisses down her cheekbones then sought her mouth his tongue traced the outline then lingered to stroke lazily over her bottom lip the room began to whirl inside her head she was priceless this time he promised himself he would show her she had a beauty he knew now reached beneath the skin he would cherish it he combed his fingers through her hair delighting in the silken feel of it he murmured and she sighed and pressed herself against him as his mouth continued to explore he began to undo the row of buttons at her back when the material parted he ran his hands along her spine gently as a man touches fragile glass as the silk slithered to the floor she trembled she was warm and naked beneath it his heart hammered in his throat it was as though she had waited all evening for this moment with him quinn drew her away to look at her all of her in the lamplight she was so small so delicate with skin like porcelain and a form that might have been carved from alabaster her hair tumbled over her shoulders ending just before the curve of her breasts her rib cage was narrow he ran his hands down it amazed that the strength he knew she possessed came from such delicacy her waist tapered so that he could almost span it with his hands before flaring out gently to slender hips and long slim thighs youre so beautiful his voice was strained as he brought his gaze back to hers you take my breath away she stepped forward into his arms the material of his shirt was rough against her bare skin with her eyes half closed chantel moved against him urging his mouth to take its fill her tongue found his and began a silent exotic seduction all the while his fingertips played over her as exquisitely as hers had played over the piano keys through the window the breeze stirred threatening rain chantel inhaled the fragrances of the night as they tangled with the musky scent of passion slowly and with as much care as he had shown her she undressed quinn she rubbed her palms over the hard coiled muscles of his shoulders delighting in the feel temptingly she pressed her lips to his chest there was a power and discipline in his body that urged her to touch to tease the ridges of muscles in his torso fascinated her with a murmur of approval she bought her lips back to his they lowered themselves onto the bed no hurry no rush the moment was drawn out dreamlike as they pleasured each other chantel shifted to look down at him how could she tell him what hed come to mean to her how could she explain how much she needed him to be with her now tomorrow forever did a man like quinn believe in forever she shook her head quickly thrusting the questions aside she couldnt tell him she couldnt ask him but she could show him softly chantel brought her mouth to his then ran her fingertip over it as if to test the warmth shed elicited approving she brought her lips to his again to savor he hadnt known it could be like this even in the wildest rages of passion theyd incited in each other he hadnt known there could be such wonder hed told himself before that she belonged to him but now with her pliant and soft in his arms he could finally believe it and what was more he was hers completely utterly love fueled by tenderness was more consuming than any madness he slipped into her easily naturally with a sigh she accepted him they rose together in a harmony of movement that was its own kind of beauty when there was nothing left to give they gathered each other close and slept dont rush me dont rush me with a spring in his step frank waltzed in front of the skycap desk im going to make sure they dont send my banjo to duluth la guardia with a grin the skycap showed frank the stubs dont worry about a thing easy for you to say ive had that banjo longer than ive had my wife then with a chuckle he squeezed mollys shoulder not that you mean less to me my love but we run neck and neck did you take your dramamine frank yes yes dont fuss franks a hideous air traveler molly put in as she pocketed the tickets and boarding passes thats where chantel got it from surprised quinn stopped in the act of hefting his small carryon bag you dont like to fly im fine shed already downed half a roll of antacids and two air sickness pills molly glanced at the watch on her wrist wed better get moving women always rushing frank gave quinn a slap on the back why do we put up with it boy only game in town right you are delighted with the world in general frank cackled as he strolled through the automatic doors youre feeling chipper this morning chantel commented dryly refusing to acknowledge the leaden feeling in her own stomach and why not frank beamed as they rode up the escalator toward their gate a good nights sleeps just the ticket he quirked his brow at molly and wondered if shed wear that little black number again anytime soon as they passed through gate security chantel began the slow and even breathing technique that helped her get on board angel quinn drew her off to the side dont you have a tranquilizer or something i dont take them she twisted the strap of her bag in her fingers besides im fine he unclenched her fingers and soothed them with his your hands are like ice its chilly in here quinn noted a man mopping his brow as the room filled with body heat i didnt realize you were nervous about flying dont be silly i fly all the time i know it must be rough disgusted with herself she stared over his shoulder everyones entitled to a phobia thats right he brought her hand to his lips let me help she started to draw her hand away but found it held firmly quinn i feel like an idiot id rather you just let it go fine but you wouldnt mind holding my hand during the flight would you its six hours she muttered six incredibly long hours he tilted her face to his we ought to be able to think of something to pass the time as he lowered his mouth to hers neither of them noticed a man wearing dark glasses slip into a seat in the corner of the departure lounge neither of them noticed the way his hands clenched into fists as he watched them if we do what youre thinking of well be arrested chantel murmured but the tension in her shoulders eased quinn nipped at her lip im surprised at you i was thinking of gin rummy like hell when their flight was called she drew a deep breath and kept her hand in his a dollar a point youre on laughing she walked with quinn and her parents through the gate the man in dark glasses rose and pulled a lowbrimmed hat over his head then took out his boarding pass he merged with the crowd that surged onto the plane chapter ten contents prev next are you sure you dont mind being drafted into the family chantel carefully zipped a dress into her garment bag shed hired one of hollywoods leading designers to create it but it wasnt for the stage or the screen it wasnt every day she was maid of honor at her sisters wedding is that what you call it amused quinn sat on the unmade bed dressed only in a towel there was a freshly pressed suit in the closet that he didnt even want to think about i dont know what else preoccupied chantel checked her makeup bag if shed forgotten anything maddy was sure to have it probably still in the box pop said you had to be at reeds suite an hour before the ceremony she paused and glanced back at him just what is it men do before a wedding state secret and no i dont mind she stopped again tapping a brush against her palm what did you think of reed quinn i know we only had a few hours together last night but you must have formed an impression worried about your sister it goes with the territory he settled back against the pillows and looked at her trim slacks a silk blouse silverblond hair pulled back from an extraordinary face with hammered gold combs chantel ohurley didnt look anything like a mother hen but hed learned to see farther than skin deep when it came to her family she was a marshmallow dependable certainly successful meticulous id guess conservative and maddy scattered theatrical and a shade wideeyed thats maddy chantel murmured it doesnt seem as though theyd have enough in common for more than a tenminute conversation but but it feels right with a sigh she dropped the brush into her bag it just feels right then what are you worried about shes my baby sister by how many minutes he asked dryly time has nothing to do with it she said it with such offhand certainty that he was sure the question had been put to her before she is my baby sister and shes always been the most trusting one the most loving one abbys so solid she said and ive got enough meanness in me to keep my head above water but maddy maddys the kind of woman who believes the check is in the mail the alarm didnt go off or the gas gauge was broken i think your sister knows exactly what she wants and how to make it work so do i really i guess im just being sentimental quinn arched a brow why dont you come over here and be sentimental she sent him a slow smile i thought you were waiting for room service hate to wait alone quinn if i get back in that bed yeah im going to make incredible love to you threats huh he lay back and crossed his arms behind his head why dont you come over here and say that she tossed her cosmetic bag aside and walked to him you havent got a chance big talk i can do more than talk she murmured and ran her fingertips up his leg to where the towel skimmed the top of his thigh much more before she could prove it quinn grabbed her wrist and yanked so that she tumbled across his chest her laughter came first then was muffled to a sigh against his lips it didnt seem possible that she could want him as much as she had the night before when theyd first slipped between the linen hotel sheets but the excitement was just as new now just as vital the scent of his shower was on him fresh and tangy his hair was slightly damp as it brushed across her face his body was there for her strong virile unclothed with another laugh she pressed her lips to his throat something funny i feel safe she tossed back her head to smile at him so wonderfully safe he brushed the hair away from her face holding it a moment then letting it stream through his hands how had she come to mean so much to him in so short a time safes not the only thing i want you to feel no she lowered her lips to his shoulder and let her tongue glide across his skin what else love loyalty devotion it was frightening that those were his first thoughts to protect himself and maybe to protect her he didnt tell her that the physical loving wouldnt hurt either of them not the way emotions could why dont i show you in one quick move he had chantel on her back beneath him the towel around his waist was held in place only by the press of their bodies when his lips found hers she began to tug the towel aside aroused he laughed and made quick work of the buttons on her blouse a knock on the door of the adjoining parlor had them both groaning chantel rose on her elbow and tossed her mussed hair back you had to have breakfast didnt you let him bring it back later quinn slipped a hand under her skirt to explore her thigh the knock came again more insistently this time ill get it shifting away from quinn she adjusted her blouse then with a grin she picked up the towel and tossed it across the room you stay here she kissed him again quickly right here youre the boss keep that in mind chantel was smiling as she hurried into the parlor quinn would have his breakfast but he was going to eat it cold in bed quinn reached over and idly turned on the radio a little music he thought with the drapes still drawn the room was dim they might be anywhere for a moment he let himself imagine they were in their bedroom not in her house not in his not in some plush hotel but in a home theyd made between them when you loved he realized you didnt just think of now but of always maybe it was time to tell her time to admit to her not just to himself that he loved her and wanted to share his life with her his life that meant past present future not just the fleeting urge to satisfy passion to quench desire there was passion but it would never be satisfied desire would never be quenched and more much more there was emotion that swelled and expanded every moment he was with her he wanted her for his wife that should have terrified him but it almost amused him he wanted her in all the traditional ways the ways hed always shrugged aside as restrictive and unimportant a home a family his ring on her finger and hers on his quinn doran family man it suddenly seemed to fit she might balk she probably would hed just have to apply the right kind of pressure thinking of it made him smile a little persuading chantel ohurley to marry him might just be the toughest nut hed ever cracked quinn yeah would you come out here a minute he heard it in her voice just a hint of tension quinn pushed aside his fantasies and reached for his robe he saw the flowers as soon as he stepped into the parlor a dozen bloodred roses with their petals just opened sat on the table by the door chantel stood beside them her face as white as the card she held in her hand he knows im here she managed to keep her voice even almost calm he says hed follow me anywhere her fingers were steady as she handed the card to quinn but when his brushed over them he found them cold he says hes waiting for the perfect time quinn took the note and glanced briefly at the message in the corner of the envelope was the printed name of the florists shop hes made his first mistake he murmured who brought these up a bellboy she stared at the far wall at a monet print and wondered why she felt nothing nothing at all i didnt even tip him stop it his voice snapped her back after one long shudder chantel looked at him she wouldnt get sympathy from quinn or soothing words or empty promises she didnt want them she wanted the truth hes here isnt he he might even be in this hotel sit down he started to take her arm but she backed away i dont need to sit down i need some answers chantel at the next knock she pressed a hand to her mouth to muffle a scream swearing quinn pushed her into a chair then went to the door through the peephole he saw a roomservice waiter with a breakfast tray its all right he tossed over his shoulder just room service quinn opened the door to let the waiter roll the cart to the table by the window after scrawling his name on the tab he followed the waiter to the door to take a quick scan of the hall you could use some coffee quinn said moving past chantel to the breakfast tray no answers though her knees were wobbly she rose im not sure why but i think you have them you knew hed be here despite her refusal quinn poured two cups yeah yeah a dry laugh came from nowhere as she pressed her fingers to her temple youre not a man to elaborate are you quinn how did you know hed be here sixth sense gut hunch instinct any of those would do he felt a sick curling in his stomach as he turned to face her again i expect him to go where you go but in addition to that he said hed be here in the last few notes he sent she crossed her arms over her chest the chill had sprung to her skin quickly she was beginning to feel now and feel sharply you didnt think i should know if id thought you should know id have told you why dont you eat something yes there were feelings now they were boiling inside her threatening to bubble out with the first word she spoke chantel walked to the table and keeping her eyes on quinns picked up a plate and very deliberately dropped it on the floor just who the hell do you think you are her voice carried more venom when it was low and steady how dare you treat me as though im some brainless gutless female who needs to be led around by the nose i had a right to know he intended to follow me that things would be the same here as they were on the coast he could let his temper go or he could control it quinn sat down and picked up his coffee anger had taken the dazed look out of her eyes hed let her take it as far as she could i handled it my way you pay me to handle things my way caught off guard she stepped back she paid him how could she have forgotten he was only doing a job an arrow of pain passed through her even that somehow was better than the numbness i expect to be kept informed of your progress doran fine he picked up a piece of toast and began to heap on jelly ill just leave you to enjoy your breakfast chantel his voice was soft but it had enough punch to stop her before she crossed the room you might as well sit down youre not going anywhere by yourself im going down to maddys room you can try to leave he set his knife very deliberately on the side of his plate you wont make it ill take you down myself as soon as im dressed he sent her a cool challenging look and youll stay there inside the room until i come back for you i dont ive got a man stationed in the room across the hall and another in the room across from your sisters youre perfectly safe inside but i want to take you down myself she was almost angry enough to take her chances chantel measured the distance to the door and the look in quinns eyes without a word she dropped down onto a chair and ignored him while he finished his breakfast quinn found the cramped little flower shop in the west sixties in spite of the airconditioning the air was sultry inside and heavy with a barrage of floral scents three customers were crowded in two of them in front of a long chipped counter covered with scraps of papers and a shrilling phone the harried little man behind the counter ignored another customer stood in front of a display window and studied arrangements cant have them there before four cant the owner scrawled on a form and kept shaking his head he took a credit card and ran it through a machine for authorization yes itll be pretty he answered to the customers murmured question big pink carnations some sprays of babys breath tasteful very tasteful sign here quinn wandered to a grouping of lilies while the man dealt with the other customers okay okay you want to buy flowers or just look at them quinn glanced over to see the man piling the papers on the counter pretty busy today youre telling me nothing the little man pulled out a handkerchief to wipe the back of his neck got problems with the air conditioner my clerk gets appendicitis and too many people are dying when quinn lifted a brow the man settled down a bit funerals got a run on gladiolas this week tough quinn skirted a spray of daisies in a watering can this one of yours he glanced at the card in quinns hand says so right there the mans squat finger punched at the name flowers by bernstein im bernstein you have a problem with a delivery a question red roses a dozen delivered to the plaza this morning who bought them you ask me who bought them bernstein gave a long nasal laugh young man i sell twenty dozen roses this week if i sell one how am i supposed to know who buys you keep records quinn gestured toward the register receipts you should have a receipt for a dozen red roses delivered to the plaza at lets say tenthirty eleven this morning you want me to go through my receipts quinn reached in his pocket and drew out a twenty thats right the little man stood straight his drooping jowls quivered with indignation i dont take bribes you got twenty dollars you buy twenty dollars worth of flowers fine how about the receipts you a cop private bernstein hesitated then grumbling he went into the drawer that held the days receipts he mumbled to himself as he flipped through them nobody bought red roses today yesterday that earned quinn a disgusted look but bernstein went into another drawer red roses to maine two dozen to pennsylvania a dozen to twentyseventh street he mumbled out a few more addresses a dozen to the plaza hotel suite for delivery this morning can i take a look at that without waiting for an answer quinn plucked it out of his hand paid cash i got no problem taking cash but cash meant no signature quinn passed the receipt back what did he look like what did he look like the man let out another snort of laughter how am i going to remember what you look like tomorrow people come in here and buy their flowers i dont care if they got an eye in the middle of their forehead so long as their credits good or their cash is green just think about it a minute quinn pulled out another twenty you got some great flowers here the florist gave him a shrewd look the carnations on display here are getting wilted i happen to be very fond of carnations with a nod the man pocketed the two twenties then took the slightly drooping carnations from behind the glass i remember he said to send the roses to chantel ohurley things were pretty busy here yesterday they hauled my clerk out in an ambulance my other clerks on vacation and weve got two weddings because the florist had a genuine love for flowers he took out a plastic bottle and spritzed the carnations anyhow he says to send them to her so i say hey is that the actress you know the wife and i go to the movies a lot oh yeah i ask him if hes from california he was wearing a hat one of those panama types and dark glasses what did he say i dont think he did and dont ask me what he looked like again cause i dont know i had mrs donahue in here fussing about her daughters wedding rose petals bags of em pink he shook his head he was a guy and i never saw much of his face how old couldve been younger than you couldve been older but he wasnt built so big nervous hands he remembered suddenly and in a moment of conscience added some fresh greenery to the carnations why do you say that came in here smoking some foreign cigarette i dont allow smoking no matter how classy the tobacco not good for the flowers how do you know it was foreign how do i know how do i know i know an american cigarette when i see one the florist said testily and this wasnt one of them made him put it out too dont care how much money you spend in here you aint gonna pollute my flowers okay so he had nervous hands couldnt keep them still once he put the thing out look i had enough trouble in here yesterday without this character mrs donahue was driving me to grief and my clerk was getting her appendix out next thing you know shell want to claim it on workmans compensation anything else quinn steered him patiently away from his clerks appendectomy anything he did or said that sticks in your mind money clip he said abruptly yeah he took the cash out of a clip instead of a wallet a nice one nothing youd pick up on the street silver monogrammed what initials initials the florist began to file away his stack of receipts what do i know from initials it had squiggly lines on it any rings a watch i dont know i notice the clip because the guys got a nice fat wad tucked into it maybe hes got jewelry maybe he doesnt im taking his cash not giving him an appraisal thanks quinn took out a card and wrote his number at the hotel on the back id appreciate it if youd call if you remember anything else or if he comes back he in trouble lets just say id like the chance to talk to him dont forget your carnations quinn tucked the arrangement under his arm and headed for the door guess you get some weirdos out in california bernstein commented our share movie stars he gave another quick snort guy said he worked close with miss ohurley real close quinns fingers tightened around the knob thanks as he stepped onto the sidewalk he thrust the flowers into the arms of a woman dragging a shopping cart he didnt look back to see her staring at him there was a sick feeling starting in his stomach he knew someone who occasionally carried a silver money clip a clip that had been a present from chantel matt burns he didnt want to believe it matt was a friend and no one knew better than quinn how hard it was to make and keep friends in his business yet how well did he really know matt burns he hadnt known about the gambling until hed dug it up matt had betrayed a client then because of a weakness didnt that make him first in line to betray chantel because of another kind of weakness a lot of men carried money clips quinn reminded himself as he headed away from the hotel rather than toward it he needed to think things through before going back to chantel a lot of men carried silver money clips quinn continued just the way a lot of men smoked foreign cigarettes but he wondered how many men who knew chantel who worked closely with chantel did both he was being stupid quinn decided as he stopped at a phone booth the word was soft he corrected thats what the woman had done to him it wasnt his job to find reasons why it couldnt be matt but find reasons why it could flipping open his notepad he scanned for matts number and dialed answering for matt burns i need to speak with him im sorry mr burns is unavailable until monday make him available sweetheart its important the voice became very prim im sorry mr burns is out of town nerves skimmed down quinns spine where im not permitted to give out that information this is quinn doran im calling for chantel ohurley oh im sorry mr doran you should have told me who you were mr burns is out of town im afraid should i have him get in touch with you if he checks in ill get in touch with him on monday where is he he flew to new york mr doran on some personal business yeah he bit off an oath as he hung up the phone it was very personal this was going to hurt her quinn thought and it was going to hurt deep three more hours maddy ohurley jumped up from her chair paced across the room and plopped onto the sofa we should have gotten married in the morning itll be afternoon soon enough chantel sipped at her third cup of coffee and wondered when she would hear from quinn again shouldnt you be enjoying your last hours as a single woman im too wired to enjoy anything maddy was up again her mop of red hair bouncing with the movement im so glad youre here she stopped long enough to give chantel a quick squeeze id be going crazy now if you werent i wish abby would come down she will as soon as she dumps dylan and the boys on pop think about something else something else maddys slim dancers body spun in a circle how can i think of something else walking down that aisle is the biggest entrance ill ever make speaking of entrances tell me about the play its terrific her amber eyes lighted with love of the theater maybe im prejudiced because it was the play that brought reed and me together but its the best thing ive done i was hoping youd be able to see it ill be back in new york shooting on location soon youll be back from your honeymoon and onstage chantel reached restlessly for a cigarette and if the reviews are any indication the things going to be running for years maddy watched her sister toy with then light the cigarette it was something she did rarely and only when she was tense hows the filming going no complaints and this quinn is it serious chantel moved her shoulders hes just a man come on chantel this is maddy ive seen you with just a man before did you have an argument she managed to keep herself still long enough to sit on the arm of chantels chair last night you seemed so happy you practically glowed every time you looked at him of course im happy she gave maddys arm a quick pat my baby sisters getting married to a man ive decided is nearly worthy of her dont hedge chantel abruptly serious maddy took chantels restless hands in hers nerves seemed to leap from one sister to the other hey somethings really wrong isnt it dont be silly i she broke off at the knock on the door maddy felt her sisters fingers tense chantel what is it nothing disgusted with herself chantel made her muscles relax just make sure who it is darling we dont want an overexuberant bridegroom walking in far from satisfied maddy rose and walked to the door its abby she said as she looked through the peephole and with abbys help she thought shed get to the bottom of what was worrying their sister how come youre not fat yet she accused as she opened the door with a laugh abby put one hand on her stomach and the other on maddys cheek because i have over five months to go how come youre not getting ready yet because the weddings not for three hours just enough time abby draped a garment bag over the back of a chair and went to chantel think we can whip her into shape maybe at least if we start on her she cant pace around the suite thank god reed talked you into giving up that apartment wed have been sitting on top of each other i still miss it with a grin maddy moved over to wrap an arm around each of her sisters i have such a hard time picturing me in a penthouse uptown are dylan and the boys with pop i left them at his door moms getting her hair done and pop was about to talk dylan into a prewedding toast i cant wait to see ben in his tux again he looks like such a little man and chris is annoyed that were renting them instead of buying them he thinks its just the thing to show off to his friends at home and by the way she gave chantel a squeeze before she released her i liked your quinn the possessive pronouns a bit premature chantel managed a smile then on impulse she went to the phone i know whats missing here she told them punching up room service id like a bottle of champagne three glasses dom perignon yes madeline ohurleys suite thank you abby arched a brow and leaned her arm on maddys shoulder its barely eleven whos counting chantel wanted to know the ohurley triplets are going to celebrate without warning her eyes filled oh god sometimes i miss the two of you so much i can hardly stand it in an instant they were together holding close in the bond that had cemented them even before birth maddy sniffled abby soothed and then to her sisters amazement chantel broke down completely oh baby abby lowered her to the sofa casting a quick concerned look at maddy whats wrong chantel its nothing nothing she brushed her tears aside just being sentimental i guess im a little edgy working too hard just seeing the two of you you with your beautiful family abby and maddy about to start one of her own i wonder if things had been different she let her words trail off with a shake of her head no i made my choices now i have to deal with them abby brushed the hair from chantels face her voice was always calm her hands always gentle chantel is this about quinn yes no she lifted both hands then dropped them i dont know im having a little trouble with an overenthusiastic fan she said downplaying her problem i hired quinn to more or less keep him at a distance and then i fell in love with him and she trailed off again letting out a deep breath i just said it out loud maddy bent down to kiss the top of her head did it help some of the tension uncurled maybe im being an idiot she fumbled for a tissue and ill be damned if im going to walk down the aisle as maid of honor with puffy eyes that sounds more like chantel maddy murmured and besides if youre in love with quinn everythings going to work out always the optimist absolutely abby found dylan i found reed so its your turn now if we could just pin down trace youre really reaching chantel said with a laugh if theres a woman out there who can put a hobble on big brother id love to meet her she started at the knock on the door but brought herself back quickly must be the champagne stuffing the tissue in her pocket chantel went to the door but checked the peephole first uhoh a smile hovered on her lips as she glanced over her shoulder weve got the champagne all right but theres more abby drag maddy into the bedroom theres a lovesick maniac at the door reed is it reed maddy was halfway to the door before her sisters headed her off no way she might be nearly four months pregnant but abby was still agile she had an arm hooked around maddys waist bad luck honey you get into the bedroom chantel and i can transmit any messages this is silly im not opening the door until youre out of the room chantel said simply and leaned back on it all the way out after wrinkling her nose maddy slammed the door behind her as a precaution abby posted herself in front of it with a nod of satisfaction chantel pulled open the door to the hall just over there she told the waiter and you she put a slender manicured finger to reeds chest not a step farther i just want to see her for a minute chantel managed to force back a smile and shook her head she could almost feel the love coming from him the nerves the longing he hadnt changed into his tux yet and he was wearing a pair of casual slacks and a shirt that reflected his conservative style he looked like an executive he was an executive she thought with another shake of her head and the farthest thing from the type one would have imagined with her freespirited bohemian sister yet they fit chantel imagined maddy had fallen for those calm gray eyes first the rest would have been a smooth drop look i have something for her used to getting his own way reed took a step forward only to be blocked easily by chantel ill be in and out before you know it you wont be in at all chantel corrected were irish reed and were theater people youre not going to find a group more superstitious youll see maddy at the church thats right hearing a stirring behind her abby hooked her hand firmly around the knob of the bedroom door im sure youre too much of a gentleman to try to get through both of us using the ultimate weapon she smiled and put a hand to her stomach or should i say all three of us reed wasnt so sure he wanted to see maddy touch her if only for a minute to assure himself it was all real abby smiled at him with warm sympathetic eyes but she didnt budge chantel signed the receipt for the wine without moving from the doorway go down to the eighth floor and have a drink with pop she advised i just want to forget it then she softened and kissed his cheek just a couple of hours reed believe me itll be worth the wait only minutes before reed had managed to talk his way around dylan and override franks objections but he knew when he was out of his depth would you give her this he took a small box from his pocket it was my grandmothers i was going to give it to her later but well id like her to wear it today shell wear it she started to hustle him out again then stopped reed yeah welcome to the family then she shut the door in his face lord another minute of that and id have been in tears again let her out what did he give you maddy was already nudging past her sister she took the box from chantel and opened it inside was a tiny heart of diamonds on a thin silver chain oh isnt it lovely its going to look even lovelier against your dress abby ran a fingertip over the stones here ill clasp it for you now im going to cry maddy closed her hand over the heart he was going to be hers truly hers in a matter of hours and her new life would begin no more tears chantel released the cork from the wine with a swoosh it landed on the carpet to be ignored as she poured wine to overflowing into three glasses were going to get just a little drunk well two of us are going to get a little drunk and abbys going to have half a glass then between the three of us were going to create the most beautiful bride to ever walk down the aisle at st pats heres to you little sister no maddy touched her glass to chantels then to abbys heres to us as long as we have each other were never alone chapter eleven contents prev next at chantels insistence she and quinn caught the redeye to la saturday night new york hadnt been the haven shed hoped for with the wedding over and her sister off on a caribbean honeymoon chantel could only think of getting home the reception had been a strain shed caught herself watching strangers studying familiar faces and wondering even when she willed herself to sleep on the plane she promised herself that the next time she came back to new york it would be without fear and what could she say to quinn she felt betrayed by his silence yet had she by the extent of her dependence on him asked for it was she so weak so cowardly that he felt it necessary to shield her from everything she wanted his protection but she also wanted his respect had she forfeited that by refusing to listen to his reports by allowing him to intercept the notes and keep the contents from her it was time that stopped all her life except for one brief period she had had her hand on the controls now through fear shed relinquished them starting now she was taking back the helm quinn wondered how long it would take her to unfreeze shed certainly been cool enough throughout the afternoon and evening cool aloof distant it was something he had no choice but to accept yet when hed seen her walking down the aisle in front of her sister wearing that pale blue dress all filmy and romantic hed wanted to step out of his seat scoop her up and carry her off somewhere anywhere he wondered what it would feel like to stand where reed valentine had stood to watch chantel as reed had watched maddy walk toward him wearing white lace what would it be like to hear her make the promises her sister had made he shook himself out of the mood they were almost ready to land and chantel was dozing restlessly beside him couldnt she understand that hed done what hed done for her sake because hed needed so badly to see her relax even if only for a couple of days she didnt understand or wouldnt and he hadnt tried to explain he didnt know how he didnt have the flair of one of her leading men he didnt have the words all neatly typed in a script he could memorize he had only what was inside him and there didnt seem to be a way to explain that words werent feelings phrases werent emotions and emotions were all he had when they landed chantel looked fresh and rested as though shed spent eight hours sleeping on a soft bed rather than snatching naps on a plane they got their luggage without incident and within twenty minutes were riding in the back of a limo toward beverly hills chantel lighted a cigarette then glanced casually at her watch right now she felt wired restless jet lag would hit tomorrow but she would function id like to see your reports all of your reports by noon tomorrow streetlights flashed intermittently against the windows his face was in shadow but chantel doubted she would have been able to read his expression in any case fine i have the file at your place id also like an update on anything you came up with in new york youre the boss im glad you remember that he could have strangled her he thought about ways that were quick and quiet but instead he simply sat back and bided his time he stepped out of the limo at the gate though chantel had been gone hed thought it best to leave the twentyfourhour guard in place a few brief words and he was back in the limo gliding through the open gates at the entrance chantel sailed past him she had reached the head of the main staircase before he caught her something eating you angel i dont know what youre talking about you will excuse me now quinn delicately she peeled his fingers from her arm i want to take a long hot bath no one did it better he had to give her that as he watched her walk down the hall to her room she could with a look with an inflection slice a man in half without leaving a drop of blood he thought he was calm he thought he was controlled until the moment he heard the lock click on her door then the rage hed held in throughout the day clawed free he didnt hesitate maybe he wasnt even thinking quinn walked to her bedroom door and kicked it in she wasnt often speechless chantel just stood there the jacket of her suit had already been discarded leaving her in a pale pink teddy and a rosecolored skirt one hand remained frozen on top of her head where she had begun to pin up her hair shed seen fury before real and simulated but shed never seen anything like what was boiling in quinns eyes dont you ever lock a door on me his voice was so quiet after the crash of splintering wood that she shivered dont you ever walk away from me slowly she lowered her hand so that her hair tumbled to her shoulders i want you to leave maybe its time you learned even you cant have everything you want im here to stay youre going to have to do a hell of a lot more than turn a key to keep me out when he came toward her she stiffened but refused to retreat she was through backing away from anything even him he took her hair and wrapped it around his hand you wanted to slap me down and thats fine but ill be damned if ill take it from you for doing my job i wont be treated like a fool or a weakling the lace of the teddy trembled over her breasts as she took an unsteady breath you knew he was going to follow me to new york you knew id be no safer there than i was here thats right i knew you didnt and you had one night when you didnt toss in your sleep you had no right i had every right the hand in her hair tightened she wanted to wince but she didnt seem to be able to move at all i have the right to do anything everything to keep you safe to give you some peace of mind and im going to keep on doing it because theres nothing that matters to me more than you chantel let out a breath she hadnt been aware of holding shed seen it in his eyes beneath the anger beneath the frustration but she hadnt been certain she could believe it is that your she stopped pressing her lips together it wouldnt do for her voice to tremble now she wanted to be strong for him as well as herself is that your way of telling me you love me he stared down at her a good deal more stunned by his announcement than she he hadnt meant to throw it at her like a threat hed wanted to give them both time to give them both room so that he could coax her along until she realized she needed him but hed never been good at coaxing take it or leave it take it or leave it she repeated in a murmur how like him would you mind letting go of my hair i need it for a couple of scenes on monday besides that way youd have both arms to put around me before he could she was pressed against him holding tight and hard and praying it wasnt a dream i guess this means youre taking it he buried his face in her hair and wondered how hed ever survived without her scent without her touch yeah ive been trying to figure out a way to make you fall in love with me so you wouldnt be able to walk away she tossed her head back to look at him tell me youre not going to walk away im not going anywhere then he found her mouth and made it a promise let me hear you say it he took her hair again but drew it back gently until their eyes met look at me and say it no lights no camera no script i love you quinn more than i thought it was possible to love it scares the hell out of me good he kissed her again harder it scares the hell out of me too weve got so many things to talk about later he was already drawing down the zipper of her skirt later she agreed tugging his shirt out of the waistband of his slacks want to take a bath as she asked she yanked his shirt over his shoulders yeah before with a laugh she nipped at his chin or after after and he pulled her with him onto the bed it had been wild before fierce violent passionate and it had also shimmered with gentleness but now there was love felt spoken answered shed stopped believing that her life would lead her to this love acceptance understanding in the end shed only had to open her hand and take it in a burst of emotion they were caught close mouths open and hungry bodies heated and aware she heard his long indrawn breath as he buried his face in her hair as if he too had just realized what a gift theyd been given she thought he trembled her hands pressed against his back felt the quick tensing of muscle she didnt want to soothe it she wanted him to be as she was stunned a little afraid and deliriously happy when she pressed her lips to his throat she felt the throb of excitement tasted the heat in one long possessive stroke she ran her hands down his back then up again he was hers from this moment he was hers she was there for him soft yielding yet strong enough to hold him hed never looked for her quinn understood himself well enough to know hed never looked for anyone to share his life still hed found her and in her hed found everything a mate there was something primitive yet soothing in the word it meant someone to tumble between the sheets with on hot sultry nights it meant someone to wake with in the cool lazy mornings it was someone to confide in someone to protect someone to reach out to just the thought of it made him close his eyes as if to keep the fantasy trapped forever with his fingertips he traced her face so that her image hovered there in his mind so beautiful he murmured here his finger lingered on her cheek and here slowly he slid his hand down her body then he opened his eyes to look into hers and inside no i dont contradict the man who loves you he brought her palm to his lips watching her he turned her hand over kissing each finger the diamond glittered on one a symbol of what she was to the world cool sex glamour with a hard polish her hand trembled like a young girls he brushed kisses along her jawline and her breath came in slow quiet gasps she could almost hear her skin hum as his fingers whispered over it with each touch she drifted deeper into a dark liquid world where sensations were her only guide only he could make her forget the boundaries shed once set for herself only he could make her forget that when you loved you risked with him she could give without fear without reservations or restrictions there would be a tomorrow with quinn there would be a lifetime of tomorrows he wasnt sure he knew how to show her how he felt he wasnt used to pampering romance was for books for movies for the young and foolish yet he had a need a growing one to show her that his feelings went so far beyond desire that he couldnt measure them rising to his elbow he brushed the hair carefully away from her face combing his fingers through it as it fell silveryblond over the spread gently as though she might crumble at the slightest touch he cupped her face in his hand could she be more beautiful now somehow it seemed so to him as he watched the first beams of daylight steal through the windows and over her skin he ran his thumb over her lips fascinated by the shape by the softness by the flavor he imagined would linger on his own flesh as if it were the first time and perhaps it was he touched his lips to hers her body went weak as his lips lingered the hand she had pressed to his back slipped down limp shed thought she understood possession but shed been wrong shed thought she could imagine what it was like to be loved loved fully but shed had no idea something fluttered through her so softly that it might have been a dream but it expanded within her and a promise was made the heat centered focused and grew strength flooded back into her and with it a passion so rich that she moaned from the pleasure together they rolled until she lay over him together they let themselves go his hands were quick but no more urgent than hers his lips were hungry but his desperation had met its match sanity was discarded as easily as silk and lace they came together like thunder in a storm that lingered into the morning as dawn rose they took each other into the dark im so glad its sunday chantel eased her shoulders down into the hot frothy water she picked up a wineglass from the side of the tub and laughed at quinn over the rim youre not supposed to scowl at the bubbles youre supposed to enjoy them quinn shifted to reach for his own glass chantels tub was easily big enough for two and the skylight overhead showed a perfect blue sky the water that lapped nearly to the edge was layered with white fragrant bubbles im going to smell like a woman darling she touched her tongue to the rim of her glass no ones going to smell you but me with all the stuff you dumped in here ill be lucky if it wears off in a week he shifted again and his leg slid over hers but it has its compensations mmmm with her eyes half closed she leaned back for both of us i need this the shooting schedule next week is murder there are three scenes in particular that i know will leave me limp the one where brad and hailey nearly die in the fire is the worst what fire read the script she said lazily smiling when he tossed bubbles at her i trust special effects but it doesnt make it any easier to crawl around in a shack on the back lot or on the set on the soundstage while theyre shooting flames and pumping smoke in thats why its especially nice that its sunday and i can lie in the tub and think about making love with you she looked at him through eyes that were hardly more than slits again you can lie in the tub and make love with me he twisted his body bringing it forward until his face was close to hers at the same time chantel laughed and linked her hands behind his head as water lapped over the tub and onto the floor too much water you filled it up my mistake i usually bathe alone not anymore bubbles burst between them as he kissed her why dont you pull the plug cant get to it she tilted her head to change the angle of the next kiss its ah behind me now i bet a big strong man like you could manage it all by himself back here his hand trailed over her breast then slipped to her rib cage close very close she felt his fingers slide over her hip getting closer why dont we the words were cut off as she found herself submerged his mouth hard on hers up again she drew in air swiped at her face and squinted at him quinn slipped he found the lever easily and flipped it down i bet now ive got soap in my eyes he started to grin but his mouth went dry when she rose up magnificent and let water drain from her skin as she reached for a towel remind me to bring a snorkel next time we take a bath chantel she was holding the towel to her face but she lowered it with a half smile that faded when he stood beside her without a word he gathered her to him they stood where they were while the bubbles drained beneath them and dried on their skin i never knew it could be like this she murmured not like this that makes two of us hed found her it seemed so incredible that hed found her found everything without looking youre getting cold feeling the chill on her skin he took a towel and wrapped it around her i guess id have a lot to answer to if you went to work tomorrow with a red nose i never get a red nose she took a towel in turn and wrapped it around him its in my contract think you could take a break when you finish filming that depends she smiled again on where and with whom with me we can talk about the where i should be wrapped in three weeks you pick the where she started to step from the tub then braced herself against the wall careful weve flooded the place just toss down a couple towels quinn plucked another from the shelf and let it fall to the floor to soak up the water my housekeepers going to love you out of habit chantel picked up a jar of moisturizer and began to rub a light cover over her skin after were married theres going to have to be a change in the rules of the tub he was hooking the towel at his waist and didnt notice the way her fingers froze in place on her cheek bubbles are okay but theyve got to be unscented its one thing for the staff to sniff but we cant have the kids wondering if their father wears perfume somehow she managed to get the lid back on the jar and set it down without dropping it were getting married he didnt have to look at her to know shed taken three paces back he heard it in her voice absolutely her heart was hammering in her throat but shed trained herself to speak clearly over nerves you want children yeah one by one the muscles of his stomach knotted is that a problem i things are moving pretty fast she managed were not teenagers chantel i think we both know what we want i have to sit down she didnt trust her legs so she moved quickly back to the bedroom and took a chair she held the towel together in front of her with hands that had gone white at the knuckles quinn waited a moment the steam had fogged the walllength mirror opposite the tub but he could imagine her sitting there her beauty reflected slim young perfect she was a dream and more she was a star someone who lighted up the screen and created fantasies his jaw was tight when he walked into the bedroom looks like i pushed the wrong buttons digging up his shirt he found his cigarettes i thought thats what you wanted too lighting one he drew smoke in deeply i guess a husband and kids dont go with the image she looked up slowly her eyes were dry but he recognized pain something deep and dull and lasting chantel no she stopped him with a gesture of her hand maybe i deserved that rising she went to the closet and chose a robe with deliberate motions she dropped the towel then slipped the robe on and belted it she linked her fingers a moment then let them fall to her sides my career is important to me but ive never let it interfere with my personal life or vice versa my work is demanding youve seen for yourself that the hours can be brutal so theres no room for me and a family something came into her face again pain again but with a touch of anger this time my parents raised four children on the road there was always room always time for family then what is it she dipped her hands into her pockets then took them out again unable to keep them still first i want to tell you that theres nothing i want more than to marry you and start a family please dont she said quickly when he started to come to her sit down quinn it would be easier for me if you would sit all right when he had she drew a deep breath there are things you have to know before we go any farther its difficult at least for me to admit past mistakes but you have a right to know if id listened to my mother i would have told you before it might have been easier then look if you want to tell me youve been with other men her low laugh cut him off it was strained not exactly this doesnt fit the image either but i only slept with one other man before you surprise she said quietly when he simply stared she went to stand at the window i was barely twenty when i met him i was doing commercials going to acting classes i even had a parttime job selling magazines on the phone i kept telling myself it was just a matter of time and i believed it but it was tough oh god it was so tough to be alone then matt called and said hed gotten me a test for a small part on a feature lawless my first real break the producer was dustin price chantel turned back from the window her hand was curled in a fist yes how do you know that a lot of movie buffs might but the fact is i already know about price he turned up when i did a background check on you you did a check on me she found herself braced against the windowsill on me its standard chantel i do a run on you maybe somebody turns up youve forgotten or forgotten to mention like dustin price hes clean by the way been in england eighteen months standard she repeated letting the rest sift away like sand i guess i should have expected it what difference does it make now so you slept with him you needed a break he could give you a break it was years ago and i dont give a damn every muscle in her body went rigid is that what you think you think i slept with him to get a part im telling you i dont care dont touch me she whipped away from him as he reached for her i dont have to sleep with anyone to get a part and i never have i may have made compromises i may have given up more than i should but i never prostituted myself im sorry this time he took her arms ignoring her resistance im trying to tell you that whatever happened between you and price doesnt matter oh it matters she pulled away and poured wine into a fresh glass it matters when matt called me to tell me i had the part i was so happy i knew it was the beginning i was going places i was going to be somebody she pressed her fingers to her lips until she was sure she could speak calmly dustin sent me a dozen roses a bottle of champagne and a lovely letter of congratulations he said he knew i was going to be a star and suggested we have dinner to discuss the film and my career she drank because her throat was dry then set down the glass refusing to rely on wine to get her through the story of course i agreed he was one of the top producers riding on a wave of three boxoffice smashes of course he was married but i didnt think of that the derision was in her voice again selfderision selfdisgust chantel it was years ago there are some things you never stop paying for i was going to be sophisticated we were just having dinner colleagues god he was charming the memory still hurt but the pain was dull now covered with scar tissue the flowers kept coming the dinners he knew so much about the business the people who to talk to who to be seen with all of that was so important to me then i thought i could handle it the truth was i was just a naive young girl on her own for the first time i fell in love with him i believed everything he said about him and his wife living together for appearances only about the quiet divorce that was already in the works about the two of us making the best and brightest team hollywood had seen since the golden age the whole thing might have run its natural course as i got a little smarter and he a bit bored but before all that happened i made a mistake she ran her damp palms down her robe then linked them i got pregnant she managed to swallow you didnt find that in your background check did you rage hit and he smothered it no he had enough money enough influence to keep it quiet and it wasnt an issue for very long he was struggling fighting desperately to understand you had an abortion thats what he wanted he was furious i suppose a lot of men would be when their mistress and thats what i was really turns up pregnant and threatens his very comfortable marriage of course hed never planned on getting a divorce or marrying me all of that came out when i told him i was going to have his baby he used you quinn spit out you were twenty years old and he used you no strange that she could say it so calmly now i was twenty years old and i pretended i knew all the rules i pretended very well i made one mistake then i made another mistake i told him he could go to hell but i was keeping the baby things got ugly then he threatened to destroy my career if i didnt play his way well theres no use going into what was said except that the affair was over and my eyes were wide open youre still hurting quinn said quietly yes but not for the reasons you might think i thought i loved him but as soon as the glitter washed off i knew i never had i called my parents i was ready to run home and leave everything behind i bought plane tickets quinn i dont know what i would have ultimately done once i was thinking clearly thats the worst of it not knowing there was an accident on the way to the airport she took a deep breath struggling to finish nothing major the taxi driver had a couple of broken bones and i i lost the baby with a broken sob she pressed her fingers to her eyes i lost the baby and i tried to tell myself it was for the best but all i ever could think was that it had never had a chance i was only six weeks pregnant six weeks here then gone matt pulled me out of it got me back to work almost as soon as i was out of the hospital everything clicked for me then the parts the people the fame id always wanted all i had to do was lose a baby chantel he came to her running his hands over her face her hair her shoulders theres nothing i can say nothing i know how to do theres more no more he started to gather her close but she backed away when i lost the baby there were complications the doctors told me well they said it was possible i could have other children but it wasnt something they could guarantee possible just possible not even probable there might never be another baby another chance do you understand he took her hands are you going to marry me quinn arent you listening i just told you i heard you his fingers linked with hers and held firm you might not be able to have children i want them chantel yours mine if we can have them thats great but first always he bent to touch his lips to hers i want you i need you angel the rest is up to chance quinn i love you then lets get married tomorrow no she put her hands to his chest to hold him off i want you to think about this really think about it you need some tune i need you he corrected i dont heed time i feel i owe it to you lets leave things as they are a few days he could have pushed he could have won but the hurt seemed too close to the surface just then a very few days come here this time she went willingly into his arms im not going to let anyone hurt you again he murmured she closed her eyes hoping she could promise him the same thing even if she were speaking of herself chapter twelve contents prev the day started at six and never let up filming began at a shack on the back lot the interior was no more than that a small frame building that had been used in a handful of films for strangers it had been given a facelift a false front that had turned it into a rustic cabin in the woods of new england in a climactic scene special effects would burn it down the fire starting under mysterious circumstances with hailey and brad inside the interior scenes would be shot later on a twostory set on the soundstage but the morning was spent on exteriors chantel drove haileys ferrari to the deserted cabin she was older now but still caught between the man she had married and the man who had betrayed her the scene called for her on the verge of a breakdown to seek solace in the remote cabin searching for the roots of her art which shed lost in the tangle of success all the scenes were shot out of sequence and then would be edited together for several hours of this shoot there was no dialogue she was filmed unloading her art equipment setting an easel on the narrow porch walking through the door and out again with costume changes there was a long lingering closeup of her leaning on the porch rail with a cup of coffee in her hand without words chantel could use only her face to show the turmoil her character was feeling she painted on the porch sketched on the porch steps planted flowers through posture and gestures and by relaxing the set of her face chantel showed her characters gradual healing from the sidelines quinn watched her and felt his pride in her grow he didnt know the story but he understood the woman she became for the cameras and he began to root for hailey there was a poignant scene in which hailey sat on the porch and poured out her heart to a stray dog it was the examination of a life with all its flaws its wrong turns its regrets even when it was reshot to change the angle the emotion generated remained intense quinn saw more than one member of the crew wipe their eyes before lunch they had wrapped a number of scenes including a short vicious argument between hailey and brad on the porch during an hours break chantel took a quick necessary nap then shored up her energy with fruit cheese and a protein drink before going to the soundstage for the interiors the set was as rustic as the outside of the cabin had promised but there were a few of haileys paintings on the wall the props included a large carved music box that had been a wedding present from her husband the earlier tension was back in her character as chantel opened the box and let the strains of the moonlight sonata out dissatisfied with the way the scene was going chantel and the director went into a discussion on mood and motion what do you think of our little story james brewster appeared beside quinn the two of them watched larry washington bring chantel a glass of juice hard to say when you see it chopped up this way quinn kept his eye on larry as the young man hovered around chantel ready to jump at the tiniest gesture but i expect itll sell it has it all sex violence melodrama you dont write a bestseller by leaving them out brewster said easily of course hailey is the key the hinge what she does what she feels affects every character when i started the book i thought i was telling a tale of betrayal and birth but it became a story of how one woman and what happens to her determines the destiny of everyone she touches he broke off with a laugh it sounds pretentious and perhaps it would be without chantel she is hailey she does make you believe quinn murmured exactly pleased brewster gave a quick nod as a writer theres no greater reward than watching one of your characters come to life particularly one you feel strongly about i nearly killed her in the fire you know quinn stiffened what do you mean brewster laughed again and drew out a cigarette youre a very literal man mr doran i meant i nearly ended the book here in this cabin with hailey losing everything including her life in a fire set by the only man who really loved her i found it impossible she had to go on you see and survive they both watched as the stage was set for the next take an extraordinary woman brewster murmured every man here is just a little bit in love with her and you a wry smile in his eyes brewster turned im a writer mr doran i deal in fantasies chantel is very much flesh and blood at the assistant directors signal the set fell silent and filming began again quinn watched brewster carefully the writer seemed less nervous than he had in the early days of shooting perhaps he was pleased with the progress it was larry washington who seemed on edge now chantels assistant was never still for long was always moving from one spot to the next did the tension quinn felt on the set come from him it was there quinn sensed it sparking the air something nervy and desperate yet everywhere he looked people were going about their jobs with the drumtight efficiency the director insisted on perhaps the tension was just within himself there was plenty of cause chantel was still just out of reach not yet ready or not yet able to commit herself when a man who had lived his life avoiding commitments finally found one he wanted he was bound to be impatient so quinn told himself as he watched chantel listen to the music box with pain and indecision in her eyes were her thoughts on him he wondered or was she in character her talent made it nearly impossible to separate the actress from the role every eye was on her but she was alone in a cabin in the woods at a turning point in her life cut print wonderful mary rothschild straightened from her position behind the camera operator really wonderful chantel thanks she drew a deep breath and tried to shake off the emotion that had carried her through the scene im glad i dont have to do that again were going to go to the confrontation with brad as she spoke mary began to knead chantels shoulders you know what youre feeling you still want him after everything hes done everything you know you cant quite remove yourself from the young woman who fell in love with him you want to love your husband youve tried but the only thing youve managed to do is hurt him youre on the edge of your life here you know if you go with brad youll never survive yet youre drawn im fighting myself more than him exactly lets run through it they worked until six before it was over special effects had pumped smoke onto the set hailey dazed by the smoke terrified of the fire that had begun to roar through the cabin crawled along the wooden floor in a desperate search for the door all she carried was the music box hell of a day quinn commented later when they were in chantels dressing room tell me about it weary she creamed off the streaks of soot makeup had smeared her face with i dont even want to eat just sleep ill tuck you in she smiled and after drying her face swung her bag over her shoulder tuck me in i prefer having someone to snuggle against youll have that too in a few hours they walked out of the dressing room past the soundstage where the director and cinematographer were having an impromptu meeting going somewhere ive got some business he thought of matt his friend and of chantel the woman he loved ill tell you about it when i get back id rather you told me now when they were outside chantel headed straight for the waiting limo quinn i dont want to be protected this way not anymore she was right and hed known that sooner or later hed have to tell her when she settled into the limo he slid his arm behind ready to comfort her i didnt want to get into it in new york you had your sisters wedding and we had our own problems to deal with yesterday he hesitated still not sure how to describe what that one twentyfourhour period had meant to him i wanted yesterday for both of us i understand she lifted a hand to his so what is it quinn i got a lead on the man who ordered the flowers he felt her tense but didnt try to soothe her she wouldnt want soothing now he paid cash so theres no record the florist couldnt give me much of a description the guy wore dark glasses and a hat there were a couple things the florist noticed though he hesitated hating to be the one to destroy a trust and a friendship she was more important than both than anything he smoked a foreign brand of cigarette and carried a monogrammed silver money clip for a moment her mind was blank slowly the meaning came through rather than disillusionment he saw a quick flash of determination a lot of men prefer foreign tobacco and clips a lot of men dont work closely with you this one said he did he could have been lying could have been we both know he wasnt all along the one thing we could bank on was that this man knows you and you know him chantel you gave a silver money clip to someone who works with you its not matt angel its time to separate what you want from what is or at least what might be it doesnt matter what you say i wont believe it i called matt while we were in new york he lifted a hand to cup her face his grip was firm he was out of town chantel so he was out of town there was a quick flutter just beneath her heart but she ignored it a lot of people go out of town on weekends he was in new york on personal business she paled but just as quickly shook her head quinn i have to go talk to him i dont want you to accuse a look from him cut her off all right she murmured turning her head to stare out the window im not supposed to tell you how to do your job thats right angel look he took her shoulder and turned her toward him look at me when she did he swore under his breath and brushed the hair back from her face i dont want this to hurt you youre telling me that my closest friend is your top suspect i cant help but be hurt go home he leaned closer and touched his lips to hers go to bed stop thinking about it tonight for me he said before she could speak i love you chantel stay home and show me no he caught her face in his hands i wont be long and this is going to be over i promise you that they went through the gate and up the long quiet drive i trust you she told him and forced herself to relax im going to wait for you wait for me in bed he murmured hoping for her sake that shed fall asleep quickly they stepped out of the limo youll be careful im always careful she started up the steps then stopped and turned back i hate this but i cant regret it anymore because it brought you come back soon she walked into the house without looking back she wouldnt think the days work had drained her body and she would concentrate on that shed have a late supper brought upstairs when quinn came back for now she would wind down with a swim and a whirlpool if it was matt it could all be over tonight over for a moment her hope centered there abruptly she felt the sickness hit the pit of her stomach no she wouldnt wish for that running away from her own thoughts she hurried upstairs to change im glad i caught you in even superagents dont party every night matt was dressed in a casual sweater and slacks and comfortable boat shoes and was wound tight as a spring actually im having a quiet dinner at home tonight i didnt expect to see you want a drink no thanks matt set the decanter down hows chantel shes fine rather he was going to see that she was fine no matter what he had to do funny i thought youd be checking a bit more closely on that yourself i figured shed be in good hands with you matt rocked back and forth on his heels not sitting not offering quinn a chair and ive been a little tied up on some personal business the business take you into new york over the weekend new york matts brows drew together what makes you think that the florist got a pretty good look quinn drew out a cigarette watching matt as he lighted it yeah with a half laugh matt finally sat what the hell are you talking about quinn the roses you sent to chantel you made a mistake this time the envelope for the card had the florists name on it roses i sent matt dragged a hand through his hair as he shook his head i dont know what youre getting at i he stopped then as understanding came into his eyes good god you think ive been doing this to her you think its me damn it quinn he sprang out of the chair i thought we knew each other so did i whered you spend the weekend matt none of your damn business blowing out smoke quinn remained in his chair you can tell me or i can find out either way im going to see to it that youre out of her life fury showed in clenched fists quinn glanced at them almost hoping matt would put them to use a physical outlet would be more to his taste than this psychologic sparring hoping to wear down his opponents resistance im her agent im her friend when she hit rock bottom i was there for her if id had those kind of feelings i could have acted on them then where were you over the weekend quinn demanded determined to play this through to the bitter end i was out of town matt snapped personal business youve had a lot of personal business going lately you havent shown up at all during the filming youre such a good friend of chantels but youve only seen her twice since you found out what was going on guilt flashed briefly in his eyes but then temper obscured it if chantel had wanted me she would have called me i wonder if its you whos been calling her youre crazy but marts hands shook a bit as he went to pour a drink you use a money clip matt a silver one quinn continued one chantel gave you the florist picked up on a couple little details like that you want to see my money clip furious matt reached into his pocket and yanked out a wad of bills held together by a small metal clip it hit the table with a quiet thud frowning quinn picked it up it was gold not silver with matts initials engraved on it ive been using that for two months since youre so interested ever since marion gave it to me he picked up his drink and tossed it back if it wasnt for chantel id take a shot at tossing you out youre entitled to try quinn dropped the clip again maybe youd be smarter to level with me where were you over the weekend matt new york swearing he walked to the window and back brooklyn from friday night until sunday afternoon i was meeting marions parents marion lawrence a twentyfouryearold schoolteacher twentyfour he repeated under his breath rubbing a hand over his face i met her about three months ago shes twelve years younger than me bright innocent trusting i should have walked away instead i fell in love with her after sending quinn a furious look he fumbled for a cigarette of his own ive spent the last three months thinking about how i relate to houses with picket fences this young beautiful woman is going to marry me and i spent the weekend trying to convince her conservative and very concerned parents that i wasnt some hollywood playboy out to take their daughter for a ride id rather have faced a firing squad he puffed on his cigarette without inhaling listen quinn if i havent been around as much as chantel needed it was because ive lost my head over an elementary schoolteacher look at her matt flipped a photograph out of his billfold she looks like she could still be in school ive been living on nerves for weeks quinn believed him with a mixture of relief and frustration quinn shut the billfold it could have been a lie but one man in love easily recognizes another what the hell does she see in you matt gave a shaky laugh she thinks im terrific she knows about the gambling about everything and she thinks im terrific i want to marry her before she finds out any different good luck yeah matt put the billfold away his temper was gone as were his embarrassment and his nerves but guilt remained if weve got that straightened out id like you to fill me in about chantel this character sent her flowers in new york thats right he looked like me i dont know what he looked like but you said i lied you always were a bastard matt said without heat hows she holding up shes struggling shes going to be better knowing youre clear let me ride out with you he rubbed the back of his neck i wouldve told her about marion before but i felt i guess i felt like an idiot here lies matt burns agent of the stars knocked unconscious by a woman who helps kids tie their shoelaces all day with her hair wet and loose chantel came into the poolhouse after a quick swim the water and exercise had helped clear her head now all she wanted was to soothe her body hitting the switch for the whirlpool she sent the bubbles gushing a sigh of gratitude purred out as she lowered her body into the hot churning water quinn would be back soon and one way or the other they would work things out she had to concentrate on that and not on the circumstances that had brought them together not on the circumstances that had taken him away tonight beams from the setting sun came through the ribbon of high windows the skylights above were deep blue with early evening chantel let the jets of water beat the fatigue out of her muscles and soothe the lingering tension from her limbs she was on the verge of having everything she wanted she had only to say yes to quinn he loved her chantel closed her eyes on that thought he loved her for what she was not what she appeared to be on the surface no one but her family had ever accepted her totally with her flaws her insecurities her mistakes quinn did a woman could live a lifetime and not find a man who loved what she was on the inside what held her back from taking what she needed was the fear that she might not be able to give him everything not a family of his own she wanted children his children what if she ultimately disappointed him that way what if he too had to pay for her past mistakes if she didnt love him so much it would be so easy to say yes she wanted him to come back to be with her now if he could just hold her now shed know somehow the right answer to give him chantel closed her eyes and let herself sink a little deeper when he came back to her she would know and whatever she did would be right for both of them she heard a sound a soft one at the back of the poolhouse straightening chantel pushed the wet hair away from her face quinn dont say anything now she closed her eyes again just come here then she heard the music and her heart shot to her throat it was quiet lovely with the belllike quality only the best music boxes achieve the sky was nearly dark as the strains of the moonlight sonata flowed over the sound of churning water quinn but she said his name knowing he wasnt there her hand shook as she reached over and turned off the jets in the silence the music box continued to play putting the heels of her hands behind her chantel pushed herself out of the tub ive waited so long for this at the whisper the air clogged in her throat she had to breathe she told herself if she was to get to the door she had to breathe and the door was so far away the lights dimmed and the fear raced along her skin youre so beautiful so incredibly beautiful nothing i could imagine or create could be as perfect tonight well finally be together he was in the shadows near the rear door chantel forced herself to look but even then she couldnt see who it was there are guards outside she balled her hand into a fist refusing to allow her voice to quiver i could scream theres only the guard at the gate and hes too far away i had to hurt the others sometimes you have to hurt when you love she gauged the distance to the front door how did you get in over the wall by the tennis courts you havent been using the tennis courts ive been watching for you the alarm i took care of the alarm i have some knowledge my reputation for careful research is well deserved brewster stepped out of the shadows with the music box in his hands james the air in the poolhouse was sultry but chantel began to shiver why are you doing this i love you his eyes were glazed and she could see no emotion in them as he walked closer when you first formed in my mind i knew i had to have you then you were there flesh blood real i had this made for you he held out the music box and chantel stepped back dont be afraid of me hailey james im chantel chantel yes yes of course he smiled at her then set the box down on a little table beside the tub it continued to play romantic and sweet chantel ohurley with the perfect face ive dreamed of you for months i cant write my wife thinks im agonizing over my new book but there is no book therell never be another book chantel you wouldnt keep my flowers im sorry quinn would be back she told herself the nightmare would be over she felt exposed in her brief suit so she reached for her wrap training kept her gestures casual even as her heart roared in her head it was the way you sent them james you frightened me i never meant to hailey chantel she corrected a flutter of panic in her voice im chantel james i think we should go into the house and talk about this chantel he looked momentarily puzzled no no i want to be alone with you ive waited too long for tonight the perfect night when the moon is full the song he looked at the music box it was meant for you why didnt you just talk to me you would have rejected me rejected me he repeated in a rising voice do you think im a fool ive seen you with those young men all muscles and smooth faces but none of them love you like i do youve driven me mad with waiting you were obsessed with brad it was always brad there is no brad she shouted hes a character there is no hailey you made them up theyre not real youre real ive seen you with him ive watched the way you look at him let him touch you when it should be me but ive been patient tonight he started toward her ive waited for tonight chantel raced for the front door knowing that if she could beat him shed have a chance grabbing the knob she pulled but it held firm i locked it from the outside brewster told her quietly i knew youd try to run away i knew youd throw my love back in my face chantel spun around pressing her back to the door you dont love me youre confused im an actress im not your hailey he winced as if in pain and pressed his fingers to his eyes such headaches he murmured no dont he warned when she edged toward the back door he blocked her way then stepped back into the shadows to pick something up i know what i have to do and theres no running for either of us now hailey im not its too late he said viciously too late i guess ive always known i hate what youve done to me he pressed his fingers to his temple as tears welled up in his eyes but as god is my witness i cant let another man have you youre mine from the first moment you were mine if you could only understand that james she was afraid to touch him but she took a small step closer please come into the house with me im im cold she said quickly im wet i need to change then we can sit down and talk he looked at her but saw only what he wanted to see you cant lie to me i created you youre going to try to leave you want to see them put me away my doctor wants to put me away but i know what i have to do for both of us it ends here hailey he held up the can and she smelled the gasoline oh god no you were meant to die in the fire before but i couldnt do it then now i have to he turned the can over as she lunged at him it hit the floor with a clatter then skidded gas soaking into the wood she fought to get past him chantel heard him sob as he shoved her down and her head hit the table suddenly there were shooting stars in front of her eyes chantels going to want to open a bottle of champagne i think we could all use it matt commented as they walked into the house quinn id appreciate it if youd let me tell her youre entitled he looked around the cool quiet hall you were entitled to take a swing at me back there youre bigger than i am matt said easily i overreacted matt im not used to that he thought about chantel waiting for him upstairs and what he would have done would continue to do to keep her safe the thing is i jumped on you with both feet because it was the first solid lead ive had in this whole mess from what you told me it looks like everything the florist told you fit me what fits you fits someone else im missing it quinn murmured im missing it because im too close you know what the first rule of law enforcement private or public service is dont get involved a little late for that i take it way too late she believed in you he added i think you should know that even after i spelled it all out for her she stood behind you touched matt fiddled with the lapel of his jacket shes a very special woman shes the most beautiful woman ive ever met inside and out integrity you dont see the integrity when you look at her or the guts or the loyalty its taken me awhile to get under the surface and see all there is to her he moved his shoulders restless dissatisfied maybe if id had a little more of her faith in the people she cares for i wouldnt have chased down a blind alley matt followed quinns gaze up the stairs if quinn had overreacted he thought then he himself had underreacted the past few weeks hed been too involved with his own world to give one of his closest friends the kind of time and attention she needed he turned the bottle in his hand he was going to start making up for it now look i was pretty steamed before but i think youre as crazy about chantel as i am about marion i probably would have done the same thing myself maybe quinn glanced at the stairs again he didnt want champagne he only wanted to be alone with chantel but she needed to see matt needed to talk to him shed be relieved and yet he wondered if she would feel the same frustration he was experiencing theyd come so far yet theyd gone nowhere i hate what shes going through so do i matt laid a hand on his shoulder the past couple months have taught me that love can drive anybody crazy i guess its like brewster said in that interview what interview it was in the paper tonight they did an article on strangers focusing on hailey the way he described her hell youd have thought she was real but he said something that rang true about how when a man really loves a woman he sees her as no one else does that no matter what he accomplishes what he fails at she stays at the center of his life rules it just by being i guess i was feeling sentimental when i read it matt said with a trace of embarrassment but i thought i knew what he meant he even got chantel and haileys names mixed up once what you could tell the reporter got a charge out of that he played up how chantel must be turning in an emmywinning performance to have the writer confuse the actress with the character damn quinn slammed his fist against the newel post and started up the stairs he practically confessed this afternoon he all but spit it in my lap what are you but quinn was gone matt just shrugged and wondered if he had time to telephone marion call the fire department quinn shouted taking the steps three at a time the poolhouse is going up its on fire shes in there quinn was at the door before matt picked up the phone hes got her in there chantel shook her head to try to clear it the room swam and she struggled to her hands and knees she smelled the smoke first thick and pungent as it had been that afternoon during the filming but this wasnt special effects she remembered she heard the crackle of flames and looked over to see the floor turn to fire he was still blocking the back door standing there as if hypnotized by the fire which was spreading fast he wasnt trying to leave he would die here he wanted to die here and he would take her with him chantel stood choking on smoke as she looked around frantically her head throbbed and spun but she couldnt allow herself the luxury of passing out the windows were too high shed never get out that way the front door was barred there was only one exit she had to get past him before the fire closed it off her breath came in a fit of coughing but he didnt hear the flames held his attention as they ate greedily at the far wall the heat was growing visible in waves that shimmered between her and the door moving fast chantel grabbed a towel and dumped it in the tub then draping it over her face she looked for a weapon the music box sat on the table playing though the tune was muffled by the sound of flames she took it and on legs that threatened to buckle walked behind brewster he was crying she heard it now as she raised the heavy wooden box over her head tears were streaking her own face blurring her vision it was so much like the scene she had studied rehearsed tried to understand hailey she thought as smoke clouded her brain it was the cabin her new england retreat she was hailey and shed brought tragedy on herself on those who had loved her past mistakes past loves past lives if only she hadnt given her love and her innocence to brad to dustin her vision went gray and she fought to clear it there was no brad only quinn quinn was real and she was chantel an ohurley ohurleys were survivors weeping she smashed the box down on brewsters head when he crumpled at her feet she could only crouch panting struggling to find air in a room consumed by smoke and flame had she killed him she looked at the doorway framed now by flames her only way out survival she took a step forward stopped then bent over brewster hed loved her mad or sane whatever hed done had been tied to her somehow later she would sort it out but she couldnt save herself without trying to save him she snatched off the towel and covered his face with it the ceiling gave an ominous crack but she didnt dare look she didnt think everything was centered on living hooking her hands under his armpits chantel began to drag him toward the door and closer to the flames she was losing there was no air to fill her lungs as she dragged the deadweight of brewsters unconscious body the fire was winning edging closer she felt the furnace blast of heat on her skin and wished desperately that shed taken the time to wet some towels inches from the door she stumbled and fell lightheaded from lack of oxygen a little farther she demanded dragging herself and brewster across the floor oh god just a little farther she watched too dazed to be frightened as a beam fell flaming into the hot tub chantel she heard the shout dimly as her consciousness started to waver somehow she managed to gain another two inches quinn kicked in the front door and saw nothing but a wall of flame he screamed for her again and heard nothing but fire the roof was going he ran for the doorway but the heat drove him back it was then he saw her or thought he did slumped by the far wall with the flames separating them coughing on the smoke hed swallowed he raced around the building praying for the first time in his adult life shed almost made it that was his first thought as he saw her collapsed against brewster near the door burning wood showered from the ceiling as he hurled his body over hers he felt it hit and sear his hand before he dragged her out onto the grass in the name of god matt began as he raced to them brewsters in there quinn managed take care of her quinn fought the heat again nearly giving way at what had been the back doorway crawling on his belly he inched closer until he managed to grip brewsters wrist if there was a pulse he couldnt feel it but he dragged him back as the roof collapsed inward he left brewster lying on the grass and rolled onto his back to draw in air chantel still coughing he crawled to her her face was smeared with soot he heard the sirens as she opened her eyes to look at him quinn he i got him out dont try to talk now she began to shiver though the heat was still intense quinn stripped off his shirt and covered her shes in shock he said tersely smoke inhalation she needs the hospital i told them to send an ambulance matt peeled off his sweater and added it to quinns shirt shes going to be all right shes tough yeah quinn cradled her head in his lap yeah he thought i was hailey she groped for his hand as she wavered in and out of consciousness i know shhh he took her hand and squeezed the pain from his burns was real she was real and they were alive i for a little while in there so did i quinn tell me who i am chantel ohurley the only woman ive ever loved thanks she whispered and drifted off by the time he was allowed to see her quinn had gone twentyfour hours without sleep hed refused to leave the hospital to change and his clothes were streaked and reeking of smoke throughout the night hed paced the halls and driven the nurses crazy shed been treated for shock and smoke inhalation the doctors had assured him that all she needed was rest he intended to see and speak to her himself before he went anywhere and when he went she was going with him at dawn the day after the fire chantel awoke from a drugged sleep when the doctor came out of her room he was shaking his head he looked at quinn noting his bandaged hand and singed clothing you can see her now im going to process her discharge papers though if you have any influence you should talk her into staying one more day for observation i can take care of her at home the doctor sent a dubious look in the direction of the door maybe you can mr doran quinn stopped with his hand on the knob yes shes a very strongwilled woman i know for the first time in hours quinn smiled he opened the door to see chantel sitting up in bed frowning into a mirror i look horrible beautys only skin deep he said as she lowered the mirror to look at him its a good thing because you look worse than i do oh quinn she spread her arms wide youre really here she whispered as she used all her strength to squeeze its all right now isnt it everythings going to be all right its over i should have taken better care of you ill dock your pay damn it chantel its not a joke you saved my life she told him as she drew away when i think of what might have happened no she put her fingertips to his mouth i dont want to think of what ifs anymore quinn im safe and so are you thats all that matters now and and james hell live quinn said answering her unspoken question he stood and began to prowl the room hes going to be put away chantel im going to help see to that quinn he was so pathetic so confused he created something that overwhelmed him he would have killed you he would have killed hailey she corrected i can only pity him forget him quinn told her knowing he would have to if he didnt want to be eaten alive by bitterness your familys coming here all of them your sisters your parents nobody knows how to reach trace quinn i dont want to disrupt maddys honeymoon and everyone else wants to make sure youre all right thats what families are for right yes she folded her hands it is quinn you deserve a family your own family he turned to her ready to fight for what he needed i know what i want chantel yes i think you do shed made her decision when shed opened her eyes on the grass and seen his face quinn before all of this happened last night i was waiting for you i knew when you came back and held me id make the right choice for both of us she glanced around the room then into the mirror with a grimace she set it facedown on the table beside her this isnt exactly how i expected things to be but it would help a lot if youd come here and put your arms around me he sat on the bed beside her and gathered her close listen i have to tell you this when i got there last night and the poolhouse was burning i knew you were inside because my heart had stopped if i had lost you it would never have started again quinn she lifted her head searching for his lips finding them she found all the answers she needed id like a short engagement she said smiling very very short
