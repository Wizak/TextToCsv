a dream of armageddon by h g wells editors notes by blake linton wilfong the existence of premonitory and past life dreams has never been scientifically substantiated but there are countless anecdotal reports of both in h g wells gave us a new twist on these concepts with a story about a series of consistent vivid future life dreams revealing events taking place hundreds of years hence pseudoscience fantasy not necessarily some of wells stories involved a kink in space a sort of transdimensional connection between seemingly distant placeslike modern theories of wormholes and quantum interconnectedness such a kink might also span the dimension of time linking the minds of two men of different epochs wells vision of the future is chillingly accurate before the world wars or the invention of the airplane tank or nuclear bomb he knew technological advances would increase the death and destruction wrought by war he foresaw how one madman could cause it all and he made real and personal the terrible tragedy that results when our vigilance falters written a century ago this is a story for our time the man with the white face entered the carriage at rugby he moved slowly despite his porters urgency and even while he was still on the platform i noted how ill he seemed he dropped into the corner across from me with a sigh made an incomplete attempt to arrange his traveling shawl and became motionless his eyes staring vacantly i returned to my reading that book he said pointing a lean finger is about dreams obviously i answered for it was fortnum roscoes dream states and the title was on the cover he hung silent for a space as if seeking words yes he said at last but they know nothing i looked attentively at him there are dreams he said and dreams tell me do you ever dream vividly rarely i answered i doubt i have three vivid dreams in a year ah he said then your dreams dont mix with your memories you dont find yourself in doubt did this happen or did it not hardly ever except for a momentary hesitation now and then i suppose few people do roscoe says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation about intensity of impression and the like to account for its not happening as a rule i suppose you know of these theories they are wrong his emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a time i prepared to resume reading and that seemed to precipitate his next remark he leaned forward almost as though to touch me isnt there something called consecutive dreamingthat goes on night after night i believe there is there are cases given in most books on mental trouble right place for them but what i mean he looked at his bony knuckles is that sort of thing really dreaming or something else i should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the drawn anxiety of his face i remember now the look of his faded eyes and the lids red stained im not just arguing about a matter of opinion he said its killing me dreams if you call them dreams night after night vividso vividthis he indicated the landscape that went streaming by the window seems unreal in comparison i can scarcely remember who i am what business i am on you mean the dream is always the same i asked no its over i died died smashed and killed and now so much of me as that dream was is dead forever i dreamt i was another man living in a different part of the world at a different time night after night i woke into that other life fresh scenes and fresh happeningsuntil i came upon the lastwhen i died it was clear i was in for this dream and after all i had an hour before me the light was fading fast and fortnum roscoe is rather dreary living in a different time i said do you mean in some different age yes to come the year for example i dont know i did when i was asleep and dreaming but not now that i am awake i have forgotten many things since i woke out of these dreams though i knew them at the time when i wasi suppose it was dreaming they called the year differently from our way what did they call it he put his hand to his forehead no i forget he sat smiling weakly i feared he would not tell me his dream as a rule i hate people who tell their dreams but this struck me differently i proffered assistance even it began i suggested it was vivid from the first i seemed to wake up in it suddenly the first time i found myself sitting in a sort of loggia looking out over the sea i had been dozing and suddenly i woke upfresh and vividnot a bit dreamlikebecause the girl had stopped fanning me what girl please dont interrupt i woke up i say because the girl had stopped fanning me i was not surprised to find myself there or anything of that sort you understand i did not feel i had fallen into it suddenly i simply took it up at that point whatever memory i had of this life this thcentury life faded as i woke vanished like a dream i knew all about myself knew that my name was no longer cooper but hedon and all about my position in the world ive forgotten a lot since i woketheres a want of connectionbut it was all quite clear and matteroffact then he hesitated gripping the window strap putting his face forward and looking up to me appealingly this seems bosh to you no no i cried go on tell me what this loggia was like it was not really a loggiai dont know what to call it it faced south it was small it was all in shadow except the semicircle above the balcony that showed the sky and sea and the corner where the girl stood i was on a metal couch with light striped cushionsand the girl was leaning over the balcony with her back to me the light of the sunrise fell on her ear and cheek her pretty white neck and the little curls that nestled there and her white shoulder were in the sun and all the grace of her body was in the cool shadow she was dressedhow can i describe it it was easy and flowing and there she stood so that it came to me how beautiful and desirable she was as though i had never seen her before and when at last i spoke and raised myself upon my arm she turned to face me he stopped i have lived years in this world i have had mother sisters friends wife and daughtersall their faces the play of their faces i know but the face of this girlit is much more real to me i can bring it back into memory so that i see it againi could draw it or paint it and after all he stoppedbut i said nothing the face of a dreamthe face of a dream she was beautiful not that beauty which is terrible cold and worshipful like the beauty of a saint nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions but a sort of glow sweet lips that softened into smiles and grave gray eyes and she moved so gracefully he stopped his face downcast and hidden then he looked up at me and went on making no further attempt to disguise his absolute belief in the reality of his story you see i had given up my plans and ambitions given up all i had ever worked for or desired for her sake i had been a master man away there in the north with influence and property and a great reputation but it was all nothing compared to her i had come to the place this city of sunny pleasures with her and left all those things to wreck and ruin just to save a remnant at least of my life while i had been in love with her before i knew that she too loved me all my life had seemed vain and hollow dust and ashes it was dust and ashes night after night and through endless days i had longed and desiredmy soul had beaten against the thing forbidden but it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things its emotion its a tint a light that comes and goes only while its there everything changes everything the thing is i came away and left them in their crisis to do what they could left whom i asked puzzled the people up in the north you see in this dream i had been a big man a leader who other men trusted and grouped themselves about millions who had never seen me were ready to do things and take risks because of their confidence in me i had played that big laborious gamepoliticsfor years amid intrigues and betrayals speech and agitation at last i had power against the gangan organization whose scoundrelly projects base ambitions and vast public emotional stupidities and catchwords kept the world noisy and blind year by year and drifting toward infinite disaster i cant expect you to understand the shades and complications of that time i had it alldown to the last detailin my dream i rubbed my eyes and thanked god for the sunlight i sat up on the couch looking at the woman and rejoicing that i had come away out of all that tumult folly and violence before it was too late after all i thought this is lifelove and beauty desire and delight are they not worth all those dismal struggles for vague gigantic ends i blamed myself for having ever sought to be a leader when i might have given my days to love all my being went out in love and tenderness to my dear mistress my dear lady who had come at last and compelled me by her invincible charm to lay that life aside you are worth it my dearest one i said without intending her to hear worth pride and praise and all things love to have you is worth them all together and at the murmur of my voice she turned about come and see she criedi can hear her nowcome and see the sunrise upon monte solaro i remember how i sprang to my feet and joined her at the balcony she put a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed toward great masses of limestone flushing as it were into life i looked but first i noted the sunlight on her face caressing the lines of her cheeks and neck how can i describe to you the scene before us we were at capri i have been there i said i have clambered up monte solaro and drunk vero caprimuddy stuff like ciderat the summit ah said the man with the white face then perhaps you can tell meyou will know if this is indeed capri for in this life i have never been there let me describe it we were in a little room one of a multitude of little rooms cool and sunny hollowed out of the limestone of a sort of cape high above the sea the whole island was one enormous hotel complex beyond explaining and on the other side were miles of floating hotels and huge floating stages to which flying machines came they called it a pleasure city of course there was none of that in your timerather i should say is none of that now well this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape so we could see east and west eastward was a great cliffa thousand feet high perhapscoldly gray except for one bright edge of gold and beyond it the isle of the sirens and a falling coast that faded and passed into the hot sunrise when one turned to the west distinct and near was a little bay a little beach still in shadow out of that shadow rose solaro straight and tall flushed and golden crested like a beauty throned and the white moon was floating behind her in the sky and before us from east to west stretched the manytinted sea all dotted with little sailing boats eastward of course these little boats were gray and very minute and clear but westward they were little boats of goldshining goldalmost like little flames and just below us was a rock with an arch worn through it the blue seawater broke to green and foam all around the rock and a galley came gliding out of the arch i know that rock i said i was nearly drowned there it is called the faraglioni i faraglioni yes she called it that answered the man with the white face well that is the first thing i remember the first dream i had that little shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that dear lady of mine with her shining arms and her graceful robe and how we sat and talked in half whispers to one another we talked in whispers not because there was anyone to hear but because there was still such a freshness of mind between us that our thoughts were a little frightened i think to find themselves at last in words and so they went softly presently we were hungry and we went from our apartment going by a strange passage with a moving floor until we came to the great breakfast roomthere was a fountain and music a pleasant and joyful place it was with its sunlight and splashing and the murmur of plucked strings and we sat and ate and smiled at one another and i would not heed a man who was watching me from a table nearby and afterwards we went on to the dancinghall but i cannot describe that hall the place was enormouslarger than any building you have ever seenand in one place there was the old gate of capri caught into the wall of a gallery high overhead light girders stems and threads of gold burst from the pillars like fountains streamed like an aurora across the roof and interlaced likelike conjuring tricks all about the great circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures strange dragons and intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights the place was inundated with artificial light that shamed the newborn day and as we went through the throng the people turned about and looked at us for all through the world my name and face were known and how i had suddenly thrown up pride and struggle to come to this place and they looked also at the lady beside me though half the story of how at last she had come to me was unknown or mistold and few of the men who were there i know but judged me a happy man in spite of all the shame and dishonor that had come upon my name the air was full of music full of harmonious scents full of the rhythm of beautiful motions thousands of beautiful people swarmed about the hall crowded the galleries sat in a myriad recesses they were dressed in splendid colors and crowned with flowers thousands danced about the great circle beneath the white images of the ancient gods and glorious processions of youths and maidens came and went we two danced not the dreary monotonies of your daysof this time i meanbut dances that were beautiful intoxicating and even now i can see my lady dancingdancing joyously she danced you know with a serious face she danced with a serious dignity and yet she was smiling at me and caressing mesmiling and caressing with her eyes the music was different he murmured it wenti cannot describe it but it was infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has ever come to me awake and thenit was when we had done dancinga man came to speak to me he was a lean resolute man very soberly clad for that place and already i had marked his face watching me in the breakfasting hall and afterward as we went along the passage i had avoided his eye but now as we sat in a little alcove smiling at the pleasure of all the people who went to and fro across the shining floor he came and touched me and spoke to me so that i was forced to listen and he asked that he might speak to me for a little time apart no i said i have no secrets from this lady what do you want to tell me he said it was a trivial matter or at least a dry matter for a lady to hear perhaps for me to hear said i he glanced at her as though almost he would appeal to her then he asked me suddenly if i had heard of a great and avenging declaration that evesham had made now evesham had always before been the man next to myself in the leadership of that great party in the north he was a forcible hard and tactless man and only i had been able to control and soften him it was on his account even more than my own i think that the others had been so dismayed at my retreat so this question about what he had done reawakened my old interest in the life i had put aside just for a moment i have taken no heed of any news for many days i said what has evesham been saying and with that the man began nothing loth and i must confess even i was struck by eveshams reckless folly in the wild and threatening words he had used and this messenger they had sent to me not only told me of eveshams speech but went on to ask counsel and to point out what need they had of me while he talked my lady sat a little forward and watched his face and mine my old habits of scheming and organizing reasserted themselves i could even see myself suddenly returning to the north and all the dramatic effect of it all that this man said witnessed to the disorder of the party indeed but not to its damage i should go back stronger than i had come and then i thought of my lady you seehow can i tell you there were certain peculiarities of our relationshipas things are i need not tell you about thatwhich would render her presence with me impossible i should have had to leave her indeed i should have had to renounce her clearly and openly if i was to do all that i could do in the north and the man knew that even as he talked to her and me knew it as well as she did that my steps to duty werefirst separation then abandonment at the touch of that thought my dream of a return was shattered i turned on the man suddenly as he was imagining his eloquence was gaining ground with me what have i to do with these things now i said i have done with them do you think i am coquetting with your people in coming here no he said but why cannot you leave me alone i have done with these things i have ceased to be anything but a private man yes he answered but have you thoughtthis talk of war these reckless challenges these wild aggressions i stood up no i cried i wont hear you i took count of all those things i weighed themand i have come away he seemed to consider the possibility of persistence he looked from me to where the lady sat regarding us war he said as if he were speaking to himself and then turned slowly from me and walked away i stood caught in the whirl of thoughts his appeal had set going i heard my ladys voice dear she said but if they have need of you she did not finish her sentence she let it rest there i turned to her sweet face and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled they want me only to do the thing they dare not do themselves i said if they distrust evesham they must settle with him themselves she looked at me doubtfully but war she said i saw a doubt on her face that i had seen before a doubt of herself and me the first shadow of the discovery that seen strongly and completely must drive us apart forever now i was an older mind than hers and i could sway her to this belief or that my dear one i said you must not trouble over these things there will be no war certainly there will be no war the age of wars is past trust me to know the justice of this case they have no right upon me dearest and no one has a right upon me i have been free to choose my life and i have chosen this but war she said i sat down beside her i put an arm behind her and took her hand in mine i set myself to drive that doubt awayi set myself to fill her mind with pleasant things again i lied to her and in lying to her i lied also to myself and she was only too ready to believe me only too ready to forget very soon the shadow had gone again and we were hastening to our bathingplace in the grotta del bovo marino where it was our custom to bathe every day we swam and splashed one another and in that buoyant water i seemed to become something lighter and stronger than a man and at last we came out dripping and rejoicing and raced among the rocks and then i put on a dry bathingdress and we sat to bask in the sun and presently i nodded resting my head against her knee and she put her hand upon my hair and stroked it softly and i dozed and behold as it were with the snapping of the string of a violin i was awakening and i was in my own bed in liverpool in the life of today only for a time i could not believe that all these vivid moments had been no more than the substance of a dream in truth i could not believe it a dream for all the sobering reality of things about me i bathed and dressed as it were by habit and as i shaved i argued why i of all men should leave the woman i loved to go back to fantastic politics in the hard and strenuous north even if evesham did force the world back to war what was that to me i was a man with the heart of a man and why should i feel the responsibility of a deity for the way the world might go you know that is not quite the way i think about affairs about my real affairs i am a solicitor you know with a point of view the vision was so real you must understand so utterly unlike a dream that i kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details even the ornament of the bookcover that lay on my wifes sewing machine in the breakfastroom recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that ran about the seat in the alcove where i had talked with the messenger from my deserted party have you ever heard of a dream that had a quality like that like so that afterwards you remembered little details you had forgotten i thought i had never noticed the point before but he was right never i said that is what you never seem to do with dreams no he answered but that is just what i did i am a solicitor you must understand in liverpool and i could not help wondering what the clients and businesspeople i found myself talking to in my office would think if i told them suddenly i was in love with a girl who would be born a couple of hundred years or so hence and worried about the politics of my greatgreatgreatgrandchildren i was chiefly busy that day negotiating a year building lease it was a private builder in a hurry and we wanted to tie him in every possible way i had an interview with him and he showed a certain want of temper that sent me to bed still irritated that night i had no dream nor did i dream the next night at least to remember something of that intense reality of conviction vanished i began to feel sure it was a dream and then it came again when the dream came again nearly four days later it was very different i think it certain that four days had also elapsed in the dream many things had happened in the north and the shadow of them was back again between us and this time it was not so easily dispelled i began i know with moody musings why in spite of all should i go back go back for all the rest of my days to toil and stress insults and perpetual dissatisfaction simply to save hundreds of millions of common people whom i did not love whom too often i could do no other than despise from the stress and anguish of war and infinite misrule and after all i might fail they all sought their own narrow ends and why should not iwhy should not i also live as a man and out of such thoughts her voice summoned me and i lifted my eyes i found myself awake and walking we had come out above the pleasure city we were near the summit of monte solaro and looking towards the bay it was the late afternoon and very clear far away to the left ischia hung in a golden haze between sea and sky and naples was coldly white against the hills and before us was vesuvius with a tall and slender streamer feathering at last towards the south and the ruins of torre dell annunziata and castellammare glittering and near i interrupted suddenly you have been to capri of course only in this dream he said only in this dream all across the bay beyond sorrento were the floating palaces of the pleasure city moored and chained and northward were the broad floating stages that received the airplanes airplanes fell out of the sky every afternoon each bringing its thousands of pleasureseekers from the uttermost parts of the earth to capri and its delights all these things i say stretched below but we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual sight that evening had to show five war airplanes that had long slumbered useless in the distant arsenals of the rhinemouth were maneuvering now in the eastward sky evesham had astonished the world by producing them and others and sending them to circle here and there it was the threat material in the great game of bluff he was playing and it had taken even me by surprise he was one of those incredibly stupid energetic people who seem sent by heaven to create disasters his energy to the first glance seemed so wonderfully like capacity but he had no imagination no invention only a stupid vast driving force of will and a mad faith in his stupid idiot luck to pull him through i remember how we stood upon the headland watching the squadron circling far away and how i weighed the full meaning of the sight seeing clearly the way things must go and then even it was not too late i might have gone back i think and saved the world the people of the north would follow me i knew granted only that in one thing i respected their moral standards the east and south would trust me as they would trust no other northern man and i knew i had only to put it to her and she would have let me go not because she did not love me only i did not want to go my will was all the other way about i had so newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility i was still so fresh a renegade from duty that the daylight clearness of what i ought to do had no power at all to touch my will my will was to live to gather pleasures and make my dear lady happy but though this sense of vast neglected duties had no power to draw me it could make me silent and preoccupied it robbed the days i had spent of half their brightness and roused me into dark meditations in the silence of the night and as i stood and watched eveshams airplanes sweep to and frothose birds of infinite ill omenshe stood beside me watching me perceiving the trouble indeed but not perceiving it clearlyher eyes questioning my face her expression shaded with perplexity her face was gray because the sunset was fading out of the sky it was no fault of hers that she held me she had asked me to go from her and again in the nighttime and with tears she had asked me to go at last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood i turned upon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes no she said as if i had jarred with her gravity but i was resolved to end that gravity and make her runno one can be very gray and sad who is out of breathand when she stumbled i ran with my hand beneath her arm we ran down past a couple of men who turned back staring in astonishment at my behaviorthey must have recognized my face and halfway down the slope came a tumult in the air clangclank clangclank and we stopped and presently over the hillcrest those war things came flying one behind the other the man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description what were they like i asked they had never fought he said they were just like our ironclads are nowadays they had never fought no one knew what they might do with excited men inside them few even cared to speculate they were great driving things shaped like spearheads without a shaft with a propeller in the place of the shaft steel not steel aluminum no no nothing of that sort an alloy that was very commonas common as brass for example it was calledlet me see he squeezed his forehead with the fingers of one hand i am forgetting everything he said and they carried guns little guns firing high explosive shells they fired the guns backwards out of the base of the leaf so to speak and rammed with the beak that was the theory you know but they had never been fought no one could tell exactly what was going to happen and meanwhile i suppose it was very fine to go whirling through the air like a flight of young swallows swift and easy i guess the captains tried not to think too clearly what the real thing would be like and these flying war machines you know were only one sort of the endless war contrivances that had been invented and had fallen into abeyance during the long peace there were all sorts of these things that people were routing out and furbishing up infernal things silly things things that had never been tried big engines terrible explosives great guns you know the silly way of these ingenious sort of men who make these things they turn em out as beavers build dams and with no more sense of the rivers theyre going to divert and the lands theyre going to flood as we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again in the twilight i foresaw it all i saw how clearly and inevitably things were driving for war in eveshams silly violent hands and i had some inkling of what war was bound to be under these new conditions and even then though i knew it was drawing near the limit of my opportunity i could find no will to go back he sighed that was my last chance we didnt go into the city until the sky was full of stars so we walked out upon the high terrace to and fro andshe counseled me to go back my dearest she said and her sweet face looked up to me this is death this life you lead is death go back to them go back to your duty she began to weep saying between her sobs and clinging to my arm as she said it go backgo back then suddenly she fell mute and glancing down at her face i read in an instant the thing she had thought to do it was one of those moments when one sees no i said no she asked in surprise and i think a little fearful at the answer to her thought nothing i said shall send me back nothing i have chosen love i have chosen and the world must go whatever happens i will live this lifei will live for you itnothing shall turn me aside nothing my dear one even if you diedeven if you died yes she murmured softly theni also would die and before she could speak again i began to talk talking eloquentlyas i could do in that lifetalking to exalt love to make the life we were living seem heroic and glorious and the thing i was deserting something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine thing to set aside i bent all my mind to throw that glamor upon it seeking not only to convert her but myself to that we talked and she clung to me torn too between all that she deemed noble and all that she knew was sweet and at last i did make it heroic made all the thickening disaster of the world only a sort of glorious setting to our unparalleled love and we two poor foolish souls strutted there at last clad in that splendid delusion drunken rather with that glorious delusion under the still stars and so my moment passed it was my last chance even as we went to and fro there the leaders of the south and east were gathering their resolve and the hot answer that shattered eveshams bluffing forever took shape and waited and all over asia and the ocean and the south the air and the wires were throbbing with their warnings to prepareprepare no one living you know knew what war was no one could imagine with all these new inventions what horror war might bring i believe most people still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and shouting charges and triumphs and flags and bandsin a time when half the world drew its food supply from regions ten thousand miles away the man with the white face paused i glanced at him and his face was intent on the floor of the carriage a little railway station a string of loaded trucks a signalbox and the back of a cottage shot by the carriage window and a bridge passed with a clap of noise echoing the tumult of the train after that he said i dreamt often for three weeks of nights that dream was my life and the worst of it was there were nights when i could not dream when i lay tossing on a bed in this accursed life and theresomewhere lost to methings were happeningmomentous terrible things i lived at nightsmy days my waking days this life i am living now became a faded faraway dream a drab setting the cover of the book he thought i could tell you all tell you every little thing in the dream but as to what i did in the daytimeno i could not telli do not remember my memorymy memory has gone the business of life slips from me he leaned forward and pressed his hands upon his eyes for a long time he said nothing and then said i the war burst like a hurricane he stared before him at unspeakable things and then i urged again one touch of unreality he said in the low tone of a man who speaks to himself and they would have been nightmares but they were not nightmaresthey were not nightmares no he was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a danger of losing the rest of the story but he went on talking again in the same tone of questioning selfcommunion what was there to do but flight i had not thought the war would touch caprii had seemed to see capri as being out of it all as the contrast to it all but two nights after the whole place was shouting and bawling every woman almost and every other man wore a badgeeveshams badgeand there was no music but a jangling warsong over and over again and everywhere men enlisting and in the dancing halls they were drilling the whole island was awhirl with rumors it was said again and again that fighting had begun i had not expected this i had seen so little of the life of pleasure that i had failed to reckon with this violence of the amateurs and as for me i was out of it i was like the man who might have prevented the firing of a magazine the time had gone i was no one the vainest stripling with a badge counted for more than i the crowd jostled us and bawled in our ears that accursed song deafened us a woman shrieked at my lady because no badge was on her and we two went back to our own place again ruffled and insultedmy lady white and silent and i aquiver with rage so furious was i i could have quarrelled with her if i could have found one shade of accusation in her eyes all my magnificence had gone from me i walked up and down our rock cell and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward that flared and passed and came again we must get out of this place i said over and over i have made my choice and i will have no hand in these troubles i will have nothing of this war we have taken our lives out of all these things this is no refuge for us let us go and the next day we were already in flight from the war that covered the world and all the rest was flightall the rest was flight he mused darkly how much was there of it he made no answer how many days his face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched he took no heed of my curiosity i tried to draw him back to his story with questions where did you go i said when when you left capri southwest he said and glanced at me for a second we went in a boat but i should have thought an airplane they had been seized i questioned him no more presently i thought he was beginning again he broke out in an argumentative monotone but why should it be if indeed this battle this slaughter and stress is life why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty if there is no refuge if there is no place of peace and if all our dreams of quiet places are a folly and a snare why have we such dreams surely it was no ignoble cravings no base intentions had brought us to this it was love had isolated us love had come to me with her eyes and robed in her beauty more glorious than all else in life in the very shape and color of life and summoned me away i had silenced all the voices i had answered all the questionsi had come to her and suddenly there was nothing but war and death i had an inspiration after all i said it could have been only a dream a dream he cried flaming upon me a dreamwhen even now for the first time he became animated a faint flush crept into his cheek he raised his open hand and clenched it and dropped it to his knee he spoke looking away from me and for all the rest of the time he looked away we are but phantoms he said and the phantoms of phantoms desires like cloudshadows and wills of straw that eddy in the wind the days pass use and wont carry us through as a train carries the shadow of its lightsso be it but one thing is real and certain one thing is no dreamstuff but eternal and enduring it is the center of my life and all other things about it are subordinate or altogether vain i loved her that woman of a dream and she and i are dead together a dream how can it be a dream when it drenched a living life with unappeasable sorrow when it makes all that i have lived for and cared for worthless and unmeaning until that very moment when she was killed i believed we had still a chance of getting away he said all through the night and morning that we sailed across the sea from capri to salerno we talked of escape we were full of hope and it clung about us to the end hope for the life together we should lead out of it all out of the battle and struggle the wild and empty passions the empty arbitrary thou shalt and thou shalt not of the world we were uplifted as though our quest was a holy thing as though love for another was a mission even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock caprialready scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and hidingplaces that were to make it a fastnesswe reckoned nothing of the imminent slaughter though the fury of preparation hung about in the puffs and clouds of dust at a hundred points amid the gray but indeed i made a text of that and talked there you know was the rock still beautiful for all its scars with its countless windows and arches and ways tier upon tier for a thousand feet a vast carving of gray broken by vineclad terraces and lemon and orange groves and masses of agave and prickly pear and puffs of almond blossom and out under the archway that is built over the piccola marina other boats were coming and as we came round the cape and within sight of the mainland another little string of boats came into view driving before the wind toward the southwest in a little while a multitude had come out the remoter just little specks of ultramarine in the shadow of the eastward cliff it is love and reason i said fleeing from all this madness of war and though we presently saw a squadron of airplanes flying across the southern sky we did not heed it there it wasa line of little dots in the skyand then more dotting the southeastern horizon and then still more until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue specks now they were all thin little strokes of blue and now one and now a multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes of light they came rising and falling and growing larger like some huge flight of gulls or rooks or suchlike birds moving with a marvelous uniformity and ever as they drew nearer they spread over a greater width of sky the southward wind flung itself in an arrowheaded cloud athwart the sun and then suddenly they swept round to the eastward and streamed eastward growing smaller and smaller and clearer and clearer again until they vanished from the sky and after that we noted to the northward and very high eveshams fighting machines hanging high over naples like an evening swarm of gnats it seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of birds even the mutter of guns far away in the southeast seemed to us to signify nothing each day each dream after that we were still exalted still seeking that refuge where we might live and love fatigue had come upon us pain and many distresses for though we were dusty and stained by our toilsome tramping and half starved and with the horror of the dead men we had seen and the flight of the peasantsfor very soon a gust of fighting swept up the peninsulawith these things haunting our minds it still resulted only in a deepening resolution to escape oh but she was brave and patient she who had never faced hardship and exposure had courage for herself and me we went to and fro seeking an outlet over a country all commandeered and ransacked by the gathering hosts of war always we went on foot at first there were other fugitives but we did not mingle with them some escaped northward some were caught in the torrent of peasantry that swept along the main roads many gave themselves into the hands of the soldiery and were sent northward many of the men were impressed but we kept away from these things we had brought no money to bribe a passage north and i feared for my lady at the hands of these conscript crowds we had landed at salerno and we had been turned back from cava and we had tried to cross toward taranto by a pass over mount alburno but we had been driven back for want of food and so we had come down among the marshes by paestum where those great temples stand alone i had some vague idea that by paestum it might be possible to find a boat or something and take once more to sea and there it was the battle overtook us a sort of soulblindness had me plainly i could see that we were being hemmed in that the great net of that giant warfare had us in its toils many times we had seen the levies that had come down from the north going to and fro and had come upon them in the distance amid the mountains making ways for the ammunition and preparing the mounting of the guns once we fancied they had fired at us taking us for spiesat any rate a shot had gone shuddering over us several times we had hidden in woods from hovering airplanes but all these things do not matter now these nights of flight and pain we were in an open place near those great temples at paestum at last on a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes empty and desolate and so flat that a grove of eucalyptus far away showed to the feet of its stems how i can see it my lady was sitting down under a bush resting a little for she was very weak and weary and i was standing up watching to see if i could tell the distance of the firing that came and went they were still you know fighting far from each other with those terrible new weapons that had never before been used guns that would carry beyond sight and airplanes that would dowhat they would do no man could foretell i knew that we were between the two armies and that they drew together i knew we were in danger and that we could not stop there and rest though all these things were in my mind they were in the background they seemed to be affairs beyond our concern chiefly i was thinking of my lady an aching distress filled me for the first time she had owned herself beaten and had fallen aweeping behind me i could hear her sobbing but i would not turn around to her because i knew she had need of weeping and had held herself so far and so long for me it was well i thought that she would weep and rest and then we would toil on again for i had no inkling of the thing that hung so near even now i can see her as she sat there her lovely hair upon her shoulder can mark again the deepening hollow of her cheek if we had parted she said if i had let you go no said i even now i do not repent i will not repent i made my choice and i will hold on to the end and then overhead in the sky flashed something and burst and all about us i heard the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly thrown they chipped the stones about us and whirled fragments from the bricks and passed he put his hand to his mouth and then moistened his lips at the flash i had turned about you knowshe stood up she stood up you know and moved a step toward meas though she wanted to reach me and she had been shot through the heart he stopped and stared at me i felt all that foolish incapacity an englishman feels on such occasions i met his eyes for a moment and then stared out of the window for a long space we kept silence when at last i looked at him he was sitting back in his corner his arms folded and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles he bit his nail suddenly and stared at it i carried her he said toward the temples in my armsas though it mattered i dont know why they seemed a sort of sanctuary you know they had lasted so long i suppose she must have died almost instantly onlyi talked to her all the way silence again i have seen those temples i said abruptly and indeed he had brought those still sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me it was the brown one the big brown one i sat down on a fallen pillar and held her in my arms silent after the first babble was over and after a little while the lizards came out and ran about again as though nothing unusual was going on as though nothing had changed it was tremendously still there the sun high and the shadows still even the shadows of the weeds upon the entablature were stillin spite of the thudding and banging that went all about the sky i seem to remember that the airplanes came up out of the south and that the battle went away to the west one airplane was struck and overset and fell i remember thatthough it didnt interest me in the least it didnt seem to signify it was like a wounded gull you knowflapping for a time in the water i could see it down the aisle of the templea black thing in the bright blue water three or four times shells burst about the beach and then that ceased each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for a space that was all the mischief done except that once a stray bullet gashed the stone hard bymade just a fresh bright surface as the shadows grew longer the stillness seemed greater the curious thing he remarked with the manner of a man who makes a trivial conversation is that i didnt thinkat all i sat with her in my arms amidst the stonesin a sort of lethargystagnant and i dont remember waking up i dont remember dressing that day i know i found myself in my office with my letters all slit open in front of me and how i was struck by the absurdity of being there seeing that in reality i was sitting stunned in that paestum temple with a dead woman in my arms i read my letters like a machine i have forgotten what they were about he stopped and there was a long silence suddenly i perceived that we were running down the incline from chalk farm to euston i started at this passing of time i turned on him with a brutal question with the tone of now or never and did you dream again yes he seemed to force himself to finish his voice was very low once more and as it were only for a few instants i seemed to have suddenly awakened out of a great apathy to have risen into a sitting position and the body lay there on the stones beside me a gaunt body not her you know so soonit was not her i may have heard voices i do not know only i knew clearly that men were coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage i stood up and walked through the temple and then there came into sightfirst one man with a yellow face dressed in a uniform of dirty white trimmed with blue and then several climbing to the crest of the old wall of the vanished city and crouching there they were little bright figures in the sunlight and there they hung weapon in hand peering cautiously before them and further away i saw others and then more at another point in the wall it was a long lax line of men in open order presently the man i had first seen stood up and shouted a command and his men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds toward the temple he scrambled down with them and led them he came facing toward me and when he saw me he stopped at first i had watched these men with a mere curiosity but when i had seen they meant to come to the temple i was moved to forbid them i shouted to the officer you must not come here i cried i am here i am here with my dead he stared and then shouted a question back to me in some unknown tongue i repeated what i had said he shouted again and i folded my arms and stood still presently he spoke to his men and came forward he carried a drawn sword i signed to him to keep away but he continued to advance i told him again very patiently and clearly you must not come here these are old temples and i am here with my dead presently he was so close i could see his face clearly it was a narrow face with dull gray eyes and a black moustache he had a scar on his upper lip and he was dirty and unshaven he kept shouting unintelligible things questions perhaps at me i know now that he was afraid of me but at the time that did not occur to me as i tried to explain to him he interrupted me in imperious tones bidding me i suppose stand aside he made to go past me and i caught hold of him i saw his face change at my grip you fool i cried dont you know she is dead he started back he looked at me with cruel eyes i saw a sort of exultant resolve leap into themdelight then suddenly with a scowl he swept his sword backsoand thrust he stopped abruptly i became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train the brakes lifted their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked this present world insisted upon itself became clamorous i saw through the steamy window huge electric lights glaring down from tall masts upon a fog saw rows of stationary empty carriages passing by and then a signalbox hoisting its constellation of green and red into the murky london twilight marched after them i looked again at his drawn features he ran me through the heart it was with a sort of astonishmentno fear no painbut just amazement that i felt it pierce me felt the sword drive home into my body it didnt hurt you know it didnt hurt at all the yellow platform lights came into the field of view passing first rapidly then slowly and at last stopping with a jerk dim shapes of men passed to and fro without euston cried a voice do you mean there was no pain no sting or smart amazement and then darkness sweeping over everything the hot brutal face before me the face of the man who had killed me seemed to recede it swept out of existence euston clamored the voices outside euston the carriage door opened admitting a flood of sound and a porter stood regarding us the sounds of doors slamming and the hoofclatter of cabhorses and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the london cobblestones came to my ears a truckload of lighted lamps blazed along the platform a darkness a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out all things any luggage sir said the porter and that was the end i asked he seemed to hesitate then almost inaudibly he answered no you mean i couldnt get to her she was there on the other side of the templeand then yes i insisted yes nightmares he cried nightmares indeed my god great birds that fought and tore
