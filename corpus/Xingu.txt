xingu i mrs ballinger is one of the ladies who pursue culture in bands as though it were dangerous to meet alone to this end she had founded the lunch club an association composed of herself and several other indomitable huntresses of erudition the lunch club after three or four winters of lunching and debate had acquired such local distinction that the entertainment of distinguished strangers became one of its accepted functions in recognition of which it duly extended to the celebrated osric dane on the day of her arrival in hillbridge an invitation to be present at the next meeting the club was to meet at mrs bellingers the other members behind her back were of one voice in deploring her unwillingness to cede her rights in favor of mrs plinth whose house made a more impressive setting for the entertainment of celebrities while as mrs leveret observed there was always the picturegallery to fall back on mrs plinth made no secret of sharing this view she had always regarded it as one of her obligations to entertain the lunch clubs distinguished guests mrs plinth was almost as proud of her obligations as she was of her picturegallery she was in fact fond of implying that the one possession implied the other and that only a woman of her wealth could afford to live up to a standard as high as that which she had set herself an allround sense of duty roughly adaptable to various ends was in her opinion all that providence exacted of the more humbly stationed but the power which had predestined mrs plinth to keep a footman clearly intended her to maintain an equally specialized staff of responsibilities it was the more to be regretted that mrs ballinger whose obligations to society were bounded by the narrow scope of two parlourmaids should have been so tenacious of the right to entertain osric dane the question of that ladys reception had for a month past profoundly moved the members of the lunch club it was not that they felt themselves unequal to the task but that their sense of the opportunity plunged them into the agreeable uncertainty of the lady who weighs the alternatives of a wellstocked wardrobe if such subsidiary members as mrs leveret were fluttered by the thought of exchanging ideas with the author of the wings of death no forebodings disturbed the conscious adequacy of mrs plinth mrs ballinger and miss van vluyck the wings of death had in fact at miss van vluycks suggestion been chosen as the subject of discussion at the last club meeting and each member had thus been enabled to express her own opinion or to appropriate whatever sounded well in the comments of the others mrs roby alone had abstained from profiting by the opportunity but it was now openly recognised that as a member of the lunch club mrs roby was a failure it all comes as miss van vluyck put it of accepting a woman on a mans estimation mrs roby returning to hillbridge from a prolonged sojourn in exotic lands the other ladies no longer took the trouble to remember where had been heralded by the distinguished biologist professor foreland as the most agreeable woman he had ever met and the members of the lunch club impressed by an encomium that carried the weight of a diploma and rashly assuming that the professors social sympathies would follow the line of his professional bent had seized the chance of annexing a biological member their disillusionment was complete at miss van vluycks first offhand mention of the pterodactyl mrs roby had confusedly murmured i know so little about metres and after that painful betrayal of incompetence she had prudently withdrawn from farther participation in the mental gymnastics of the club i suppose she flattered him miss van vluyck summed up or else its the way she does her hair the dimensions of miss van vluycks diningroom having restricted the membership of the club to six the nonconductiveness of one member was a serious obstacle to the exchange of ideas and some wonder had already been expressed that mrs roby should care to live as it were on the intellectual bounty of the others this feeling was increased by the discovery that she had not yet read the wings of death she owned to having heard the name of osric dane but that incredible as it appeared was the extent of her acquaintance with the celebrated novelist the ladies could not conceal their surprise but mrs ballinger whose pride in the club made her wish to put even mrs roby in the best possible light gently insinuated that though she had not had time to acquaint herself with the wings of death she must at least be familiar with its equally remarkable predecessor the supreme instant mrs roby wrinkled her sunny brows in a conscientious effort of memory as a result of which she recalled that oh yes she had seen the book at her brothers when she was staying with him in brazil and had even carried it off to read one day on a boating party but they had all got to shying things at each other in the boat and the book had gone overboard so she had never had the chance the picture evoked by this anecdote did not increase mrs robys credit with the club and there was a painful pause which was broken by mrs plinths remarking i can understand that with all your other pursuits you should not find much time for reading but i should have thought you might at least have got up the wings of death before osric danes arrival mrs roby took this rebuke goodhumouredly she had meant she owned to glance through the book but she had been so absorbed in a novel of trollopes that no one reads trollope now mrs ballinger interrupted mrs roby looked pained im only just beginning she confessed and does he interest you mrs plinth enquired he amuses me amusement said mrs plinth is hardly what i look for in my choice of books oh certainly the wings of death is not amusing ventured mrs leveret whose manner of putting forth an opinion was like that of an obliging salesman with a variety of other styles to submit if his first selection does not suit was it meant to be enquired mrs plinth who was fond of asking questions that she permitted no one but herself to answer assuredly not assuredly not that is what i was going to say assented mrs leveret hastily rolling up her opinion and reaching for another it was meant to to elevate miss van vluyck adjusted her spectacles as though they were the black cap of condemnation i hardly see she interposed how a book steeped in the bitterest pessimism can be said to elevate however much it may instruct i meant of course to instruct said mrs leveret flurried by the unexpected distinction between two terms which she had supposed to be synonymous mrs leverets enjoyment of the lunch club was frequently marred by such surprises and not knowing her own value to the other ladies as a mirror for their mental complacency she was sometimes troubled by a doubt of her worthiness to join in their debates it was only the fact of having a dull sister who thought her clever that saved her from a sense of hopeless inferiority do they get married in the end mrs roby interposed they who the lunch club collectively exclaimed why the girl and man its a novel isnt it i always think thats the one thing that matters if theyre parted it spoils my dinner mrs plinth and mrs ballinger exchanged scandalised glances and the latter said i should hardly advise you to read the wings of death in that spirit for my part when there are so many books one has to read i wonder how any one can find time for those that are merely amusing the beautiful part of it laura glyde murmured is surely just this that no one can tell how the wings of death ends osric dane overcome by the awful significance of her own meaning has mercifully veiled it perhaps even from herself as apelles in representing the sacrifice of iphigenia veiled the face or agamemnon whats that is it poetry whispered mrs leveret to mrs plinth who disdaining a definite reply said coldly you should look it up i always make it a point to look things up her tone added though i might easily have it done for me by the footman i was about to say miss van vluyck resumed that it must always be a question whether a book can instruct unless it elevates oh murmured mrs leveret now feeling herself hopelessly astray i dont know said mrs ballinger scenting in miss van vluycks tone a tendency to depreciate the coveted distinction of entertaining osric dane i dont know that such a question can seriously be raised as to a book which has attracted more attention among thoughtful people than any novel since robert elsmere oh but dont you see exclaimed laura glyde that its just the dark hopelessness of it all the wonderful tonescheme of black on black that makes it such an artistic achievement it reminded me when i read it of prince ruperts maniр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р вђрв р в р вђ р в рірср ррірсрўср в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р

noirethe book is etched not painted yet one feels the colourvalues so intensely who is he mrs leveret whispered to her neighbour some one shes met abroad the wonderful part of the book mrs bellinger conceded is that it may be looked at from so many points of view i hear that as a study of determinism professor lupton ranks it with the data of ethics im told that osric dane spent ten years in preparatory studies before beginning to write it said mrs plinth she looks up everything verifies everything it has always been my principle as you know nothing would induce me now to put aside a book before id finished it just because i can buy as many more as i want and what do you think of the wings of death mrs roby abruptly asked her it was the kind of question that might be termed out of order and the ladies glanced at each other as though disclaiming any share in such a breach of discipline they all knew there was nothing mrs plinth so much disliked as being asked her opinion of a book books were written to read if one read them what more could be expected to be questioned in detail regarding the contents of a volume seemed to her as great an outrage as being searched for smuggled laces at the custom house the club had always respected this idiosyncrasy of mrs plinths such opinions as she had were imposing and substantial her mind like her house was furnished with monumental pieces that were not meant to be disarranged and it was one of the unwritten rules of the lunch club that within her own province each members habits of thought should be respected the meeting therefore closed with an increased sense on the part of the other ladies of mrs robys hopeless unfitness to be one of them ii mrs leveret on the eventful day arrived early at mrs ballingers her volume of appropriate allusions in her pocket it always flustered mrs leveret to be late at the lunch club she liked to collect her thoughts and gather a hint as the others assembled of the turn the conversation was likely to take today however she felt herself completely at a loss and even the familiar contact of appropriate allusions which stuck into her as she sat down failed to give her any reassurance it was an admirable little volume compiled to meet all the social emergencies so that whether on the occasion of anniversaries joyful or melancholy as the classification ran of banquets social or municipal or of baptisms church of england or sectarian its student need never be at a loss for a pertinent reference mrs leveret though she had for years devoutly conned its pages valued it however rather for its moral support than for its practical services for though in the privacy of her own room she commanded an army of quotations these invariably deserted her at the critical moment and the only phrase she retained canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook was one she had never yet found occasion to apply today she felt that even the complete mastery of the volume would hardly have insured her selfpossession for she thought it probable that even if she did in some miraculous way remember an allusion it would be only to find that osric dane used a different volume mrs leveret was convinced that literary people always carried them and would consequently not recognise her quotations mrs leverets sense of being adrift was intensified by the appearance of mrs ballingers drawingroom to a careless eye its aspect was unchanged but those acquainted with mrs ballingers way of arranging her books would instantly have detected the marks of recent perturbation mrs ballingers province as a member of the lunch club was the book of the day on that whatever it was from a novel to a treatise on experimental psychology she was confidently authoritatively up what became of last years books or last weeks even what she did with the subjects she had previously professed with equal authority no one had ever yet discovered her mind was an hotel where facts came and went like transient lodgers without leaving their address behind and frequently without paying for their board it was mrs ballingers boast that she was abreast with the thought of the day and her pride that this advanced position should be expressed by the books on her table these volumes frequently renewed and almost always damp from the press bore names generally unfamiliar to mrs leveret and giving her as she furtively scanned them a disheartening glimpse of new fields of knowledge to be breathlessly traversed in mrs ballingers wake but today a number of maturerlooking volumes were adroitly mingled with the primeurs of the press karl marx jostled professor bergson and the confessions of st augustine lay beside the last work on mendelism so that even to mrs leverets fluttered perceptions it was clear that mrs ballinger didnt in the least know what osric dane was likely to talk about and had taken measures to be prepared for anything mrs leveret felt like a passenger on an ocean steamer who is told that there is no immediate danger but that she had better put on her lifebelt it was a relief to be roused from these forebodings by miss van vluycks arrival well my dear the newcomer briskly asked her hostess what subjects are we to discuss today mrs ballinger was furtively replacing a volume of wordsworth by a copy of verlaine i hardly know she said somewhat nervously perhaps we had better leave that to circumstances circumstances said miss van vluyck drily that means i suppose that laura glyde will take the floor as usual and we shall be deluged with literature philanthropy and statistics were miss van vluycks province and she resented any tendency to divert their guests attention from these topics mrs plinth at this moment appeared literature she protested in a tone of remonstrance but this is perfectly unexpected i understood we were to talk of osric danes novel mrs ballinger winced at the discrimination but let it pass we can hardly make that our chief subject at least not too intentionally she suggested of course we can let our talk drift in that direction but we ought to have some other topic as an introduction and that is what i wanted to consult you about the fact is we know so little of osric danes tastes and interests that it is difficult to make any special preparation it may be difficult said mrs plinth with decision but it is necessary i know what that happygolucky principle leads to as i told one of my nieces the other day there are certain emergencies for which a lady should always be prepared its in shocking taste to wear colours when one pays a visit of condolence or a last years dress when there are reports that ones husband is on the wrong side of the market and so it is with conversation all i ask is that i should know beforehand what is to be talked about then i feel sure of being able to say the proper thing i quite agree with you mrs ballinger assented but and at that instant heralded by the fluttered parlourmaid osric dane appeared upon the threshold mrs leveret told her sister afterward that she had known at a glance what was coming she saw that osric dane was not going to meet them half way that distinguished personage had indeed entered with an air of compulsion not calculated to promote the easy exercise of hospitality she looked as though she were about to be photographed for a new edition of her books the desire to propitiate a divinity is generally in inverse ratio to its responsiveness and the sense of discouragement produced by osric danes entrance visibly increased the lunch clubs eagerness to please her any lingering idea that she might consider herself under an obligation to her entertainers was at once dispelled by her manner as mrs leveret said afterward to her sister she had a way of looking at you that made you feel as if there was something wrong with your hat this evidence of greatness produced such an immediate impression on the ladies that a shudder of awe ran through them when mrs roby as their hostess led the great personage into the diningroom turned back to whisper to the others what a brute she is the hour about the table did not tend to revise this verdict it was passed by osric dane in the silent deglutition of mrs bollingers menu and by the members of the club in the emission of tentative platitudes which their guest seemed to swallow as perfunctorily as the successive courses of the luncheon mrs ballingers reluctance to fix a topic had thrown the club into a mental disarray which increased with the return to the drawingroom where the actual business of discussion was to open each lady waited for the other to speak and there was a general shock of disappointment when their hostess opened the conversation by the painfully commonplace enquiry is this your first visit to hillbridge even mrs leveret was conscious that this was a bad beginning and a vague impulse of deprecation made miss glyde interject it is a very small place indeed mrs plinth bristled we have a great many representative people she said in the tone of one who speaks for her order osric dane turned to her what do they represent she asked mrs plinths constitutional dislike to being questioned was intensified by her sense of unpreparedness and her reproachful glance passed the question on to mrs ballinger why said that lady glancing in turn at the other members as a community i hope it is not too much to say that we stand for culture for art miss glyde interjected for art and literature mrs ballinger emended and for sociology i trust snapped miss van vluyck we have a standard said mrs plinth feeling herself suddenly secure on the vast expanse of a generalisation and mrs leveret thinking there must be room for more than one on so broad a statement took courage to murmur oh certainly we have a standard the object of our little club mrs ballinger continued is to concentrate the highest tendencies of hillbridge to centralise and focus its intellectual effort this was felt to be so happy that the ladies drew an almost audible breath of relief we aspire the president went on to be in touch with whatever is highest in art literature and ethics osric dane again turned to her what ethics she asked a tremor of apprehension encircled the room none of the ladies required any preparation to pronounce on a question of morals but when they were called ethics it was different the club when fresh from the encyclopaedia britannica the readers handbook or smiths classical dictionary could deal confidently with any subject but when taken unawares it had been known to define agnosticism as a heresy of the early church and professor froude as a distinguished histologist and such minor members as mrs leveret still secretly regarded ethics as something vaguely pagan even to mrs ballinger osric danes question was unsettling and there was a general sense of gratitude when laura glyde leaned forward to say with her most sympathetic accent you must excuse us mrs dane for not being able just at present to talk of anything but the wings of death yes said miss van vluyck with a sudden resolve to carry the war into the enemys camp we are so anxious to know the exact purpose you had in mind in writing your wonderful book you will find mrs plinth interposed that we are not superficial readers we are eager to hear from you miss van vluyck continued if the pessimistic tendency of the book is an expression of your own convictions or or merely miss glyde thrust in a sombre background brushed in to throw your figures into more vivid relief are you not primarily plastic i have always maintained mrs ballinger interposed that you represent the purely objective method osric dane helped herself critically to coffee how do you define objective she then enquired there was a flurried pause before laura glyde intensely murmured in reading you we dont define we feel otsric dane smiled the cerebellum she remarked is not infrequently the seat of the literary emotions and she took a second lump of sugar the sting that this remark was vaguely felt to conceal was almost neutralised by the satisfaction of being addressed in such technical language ah the cerebellum said miss van vluyck complacently the club took a course in psychology last winter which psychology asked osric dane there was an agonising pause during which each member of the club secretly deplored the distressing inefficiency of the others only mrs roby went on placidly sipping her chartreuse at last mrs ballinger said with an attempt at a high tone well really you know it was last year that we took psychology and this winter we have been so absorbed in she broke off nervously trying to recall some of the clubs discussions but her faculties seemed to be paralysed by the petrifying stare of osric dane what had the club been absorbed in mrs ballinger with a vague purpose of gaining time repeated slowly weve been so intensely absorbed in mrs roby put down her liqueur glass and drew near the group with a smile in xingu she gently prompted a thrill ran through the other members they exchanged confused glances and then with one accord turned a gaze of mingled relief and interrogation on their rescuer the expression of each denoted a different phase of the same emotion mrs plinth was the first to compose her features to an air of reassurance after a moments hasty adjustment her look almost implied that it was she who had given the word to mrs ballinger xingu of course exclaimed the latter with her accustomed promptness while miss van vluyck and laura glyde seemed to be plumbing the depths of memory and mrs leveret feeling apprehensively for appropriate allusions was somehow reassured by the uncomfortable pressure of its bulk against her person osric danes change of countenance was no less striking than that of her entertainers she too put down her coffeecup but with a look of distinct annoyance she too wore for a brief moment what mrs roby afterward described as the look of feeling for something in the back of her head and before she could dissemble these momentary signs of weakness mrs roby turning to her with a deferential smile had said and weve been so hoping that today you would tell us just what you think of it osric dane received the homage of the smile as a matter of course but the accompanying question obviously embarrassed her and it became clear to her observers that she was not quick at shifting her facial scenery it was as though her countenance had so long been set in an expression of unchallenged superiority that the muscles had stiffened and refused to obey her orders xingu she said as if seeking in her turn to gain time mrs roby continued to press her knowing how engrossing the subject is you will understand how it happens that the club has let everything else go to the wall for the moment since we took up xingu i might almost say were it not for your books that nothing else seems to us worth remembering osric danes stern features were darkened rather than lit up by an uneasy smile i am glad to hear that you make one exception she gave out between narrowed lips oh of course mrs roby said prettily but as you have shown us that so very naturally you dont care to talk of your own things we really cant let you off from telling us exactly what you think about xingu especially she added with a still more persuasive smile as some people say that one of your last books was saturated with it it was an it then the assurance sped like fire through the parched minds of the other members in their eagerness to gain the least little clue to xingu they almost forgot the joy of assisting at the discomfiture of mrs dane the latter reddened nervously under her antagonists challenge may i ask she faltered out to which of my books you refer mrs roby did not falter thats just what i want you to tell us because though i was present i didnt actually take part present at what mrs dane took her up and for an instant the trembling members of the lunch club thought that the champion providence had raised up for them had lost a point but mrs roby explained herself gaily at the discussion of course and so were dreadfully anxious to know just how it was that you went into the xingu there was a portentous pause a silence so big with incalculable dangers that the members with one accord checked the words on their lips like soldiers dropping their arms to watch a single combat between their leaders then mrs dane gave expression to their inmost dread by saying sharply ah you say the xingu do you mrs roby smiled undauntedly it is a shade pedantic isnt it personally i always drop the article but i dont know how the other members feel about it the other members looked as though they would willingly have dispensed with this appeal to their opinion and mrs roby after a bright glance about the group went on they probably think as i do that nothing really matters except the thing itself except xingu no immediate reply seemed to occur to mrs dane and mrs ballinger gathered courage to say surely every one must feel that about xingu mrs plinth came to her support with a heavy murmur of assent and laura glyde sighed out emotionally i have known cases where it has changed a whole life it has done me worlds of good mrs leveret interjected seeming to herself to remember that she had either taken it or read it the winter before of course mrs roby admitted the difficulty is that one must give up so much time to it its very long i cant imagine said miss van vluyck grudging the time given to such a subject and deep in places mrs roby pursued so then it was a book and it isnt easy to skip i never skip said mrs plinth dogmatically ah its dangerous to in xingu even at the start there are places where one cant one must just wade through i should hardly call it wading said mrs ballinger sarcastically mrs roby sent her a look of interest ah you always found it went swimmingly mrs ballinger hesitated of course there are difficult passages she conceded yes some are not at all clear even mrs roby added if one is familiar with the original as i suppose you are osric dane interposed suddenly fixing her with a look of challenge mrs roby met it by a deprecating gesture oh its really not difficult up to a certain point though some of the branches are very little known and its almost impossible to get at the source have you ever tried mrs plinth enquired still distrustful of mrs robys thoroughness mrs roby was silent for a moment then she replied with lowered lids no but a friend of mine did a very brilliant man and he told me it was best for women not to a shudder ran around the room mrs leveret coughed so that the parlourmaid who was handing the cigarettes should not hear miss van vluycks face took on a nauseated expression and mrs plinth looked as if she were passing some one she did not care to bow to but the most remarkable result of mrs robys words was the effect they produced on the lunch clubs distinguished guest osric danes impassive features suddenly softened to an expression of the warmest human sympathy and edging her chair toward mrs robys she asked did he really and did you find he was right mrs ballinger in whom annoyance at mrs robys unwonted assumption of prominence was beginning to displace gratitude for the aid she had rendered could not consent to her being allowed by such dubious means to monopolise the attention of their guest if osric dane had not enough selfrespect to resent mrs robys flippancy at least the lunch club would do so in the person of its president mrs ballinger laid her hand on mrs robys arm we must not forget she said with a frigid amiability that absorbing as xingu is to us it may be less interesting to oh no on the contrary i assure you osric dane intervened to others mrs ballinger finished firmly and we must not allow our little meeting to end without persuading mrs dane to say a few words to us on a subject which today is much more present in all our thoughts i refer of course to the wings of death the other members animated by various degrees of the same sentiment and encouraged by the humanised mien of their redoubtable guest repeated after mrs ballinger oh yes you really must talk to us a little about your book osric danes expression became as bored though not as haughty as when her work had been previously mentioned but before she could respond to mrs ballingers request mrs roby had risen from her seat and was pulling down her veil over her frivolous nose im so sorry she said advancing toward her hostess with outstretched hand but before mrs dane begins i think id better run away unluckily as you know i havent read her books so i should be at a terrible disadvantage among you all and besides ive an engagement to play bridge if mrs roby had simply pleaded her ignorance of osric danes works as a reason for withdrawing the lunch club in view of her recent prowess might have approved such evidence of discretion but to couple this excuse with the brazen announcement that she was foregoing the privilege for the purpose of joining a bridgeparty was only one more instance of her deplorable lack of discrimination the ladies were disposed however to feel that her departure now that she had performed the sole service she was ever likely to render them would probably make for greater order and dignity in the impending discussion besides relieving them of the sense of selfdistrust which her presence always mysteriously produced mrs ballinger therefore restricted herself to a formal murmur of regret and the other members were just grouping themselves comfortably about osric dane when the latter to their dismay started up from the sofa on which she had been seated oh wait do wait and ill go with you she called out to mrs roby and seizing the hands of the disconcerted members she administered a series of farewell pressures with the mechanical haste of a railwayconductor punching tickets im so sorry id quite forgotten she flung back at them from the threshold and as she joined mrs roby who had turned in surprise at her appeal the other ladies had the mortification of hearing her say in a voice which she did not take the pains to lower if youll let me walk a little way with you i should so like to ask you a few more questions about xingu iii the incident had been so rapid that the door closed on the departing pair before the other members had time to understand what was happening then a sense of the indignity put upon them by osric danes unceremonious desertion began to contend with the confused feeling that they had been cheated out of their due without exactly knowing how or why there was a silence during which mrs ballinger with a perfunctory hand rearranged the skilfully grouped literature at which her distinguished guest had not so much as glanced then miss van vluyck tartly pronounced well i cant say that i consider osric danes departure a great loss this confession crystallised the resentment of the other members and mrs leveret exclaimed i do believe she came on purpose to be nasty it was mrs plinths private opinion that osric danes attitude toward the lunch club might have been very different had it welcomed her in the majestic setting of the plinth drawingrooms but not liking to reflect on the inadequacy of mrs ballingers establishment she sought a roundabout satisfaction in depreciating her lack of foresight i said from the first that we ought to have had a subject ready its what always happens when youre unprepared now if wed only got up xingu the slowness of mrs plinths mental processes was always allowed for by the club but this instance of it was too much for mrs ballingers equanimity xingu she scoffed why it was the fact of our knowing so much more about it than she did unprepared though we were that made osric dane so furious i should have thought that was plain enough to everybody this retort impressed even mrs plinth and laura glyde moved by an impulse of generosity said yes we really ought to be grateful to mrs roby for introducing the topic it may have made osric dane furious but at least it made her civil i am glad we were able to show her added miss van vluyck that a broad and uptodate culture is not confined to the great intellectual centres this increased the satisfaction of the other members and they began to forget their wrath against osric dane in the pleasure of having contributed to her discomfiture miss van vluyck thoughtfully rubbed her spectacles what surprised me most she continued was that fanny roby should be so up on xingu this remark threw a slight chill on the company but mrs ballinger said with an air of indulgent irony mrs roby always has the knack of making a little go a long way still we certainly owe her a debt for happening to remember that shed heard of xingu and this was felt by the other members to be a graceful way of cancelling once for all the clubs obligation to mrs roby even mrs leveret took courage to speed a timid shaft of irony i fancy osric dane hardly expected to take a lesson in xingu at hillbridge mrs ballinger smiled when she asked me what we represented do you remember i wish id simply said we represented xingu all the ladies laughed appreciatively at this sally except mrs plinth who said after a moments deliberation im not sure it would have been wise to do so mrs ballinger who was already beginning to feel as if she had launched at osric dane the retort which had just occurred to her turned ironically on mrs plinth may i ask why she enquired mrs plinth looked grave surely she said i understood from mrs roby herself that the subject was one it was as well not to go into too deeply miss van vluyck rejoined with precision i think that applied only to an investigation of the origin of the of the and suddenly she found that her usually accurate memory had failed her its a part of the subject i never studied myself she concluded nor i said mrs ballinger laura glyde bent toward them with widened eyes and yet it seems doesnt it the part that is fullest of an esoteric fascination i dont know on what you base that said miss van vluyck argumentatively well didnt you notice how intensely interested osric dane became as soon as she heard what the brilliant foreigner he was a foreigner wasnt he had told mrs roby about the origin the origin of the rite or whatever you call it mrs plinth looked disapproving and mrs ballinger visibly wavered then she said it may not be desirable to touch on the on that part of the subject in general conversation but from the importance it evidently has to a woman of osric danes distinction i feel as if we ought not to be afraid to discuss it among ourselves without gloves though with closed doors if necessary im quite of your opinion miss van vluyck came briskly to her support on condition that is that all grossness of language is avoided oh im sure we shall understand without that mrs leveret tittered and laura glyde added significantly i fancy we can read between the lines while mrs ballinger rose to assure herself that the doors were really closed mrs plinth had not yet given her adhesion i hardly see she began what benefit is to be derived from investigating such peculiar customs but mrs ballingers patience had reached the extreme limit of tension this at least she returned that we shall not be placed again in the humiliating position of finding ourselves less up on our own subjects than fanny roby even to mrs plinth this argument was conclusive she peered furtively about the room and lowered her commanding tones to ask have you got a copy a a copy stammered mrs ballinger she was aware that the other members were looking at her expectantly and that this answer was inadequate so she supported it by asking another question a copy of what her companions bent their expectant gaze on mrs plinth who in turn appeared less sure of herself than usual why of of the book she explained what book snapped miss van vluyck almost as sharply as osric dane mrs ballinger looked at laura glyde whose eyes were interrogatively fixed on mrs leveret the fact of being deferred to was so new to the latter that it filled her with an insane temerity why xingu of course she exclaimed a profound silence followed this challenge to the resources of mrs ballingers library and the latter after glancing nervously toward the books of the day returned with dignity its not a thing one cares to leave about i should think not exclaimed mrs plinth it is a book then said miss van vluyck this again threw the company into disarray and mrs ballinger with an impatient sigh rejoined why there is a book naturally then why did miss glyde call it a religion laura glyde started up a religion i never yes you did miss van vluyck insisted you spoke of rites and mrs plinth said it was a custom miss glyde was evidently making a desperate effort to recall her statement but accuracy of detail was not her strongest point at length she began in a deep murmur surely they used to do something of the kind at the eleusinian mysteries oh said miss van vluyck on the verge of disapproval and mrs plinth protested i understood there was to be no indelicacy mrs ballinger could not control her irritation really it is too bad that we should not be able to talk the matter over quietly among ourselves personally i think that if one goes into xingu at all oh so do i cried miss glyde and i dont see how one can avoid doing so if one wishes to keep up with the thought of the day mrs leveret uttered an exclamation of relief there thats it she interposed whats it the president took her up why its a a thought i mean a philosophy this seemed to bring a certain relief to mrs ballinger and laura glyde but miss van vluyck said excuse me if i tell you that youre all mistaken xingu happens to be a language a language the lunch club cried certainly dont you remember fanny robys saying that there were several branches and that some were hard to trace what could that apply to but dialects mrs ballinger could no longer restrain a contemptuous laugh really if the lunch club has reached such a pass that it has to go to fanny roby for instruction on a subject like xingu it had almost better cease to exist its really her fault for not being clearer laura glyde put in oh clearness and fanny roby mrs ballinger shrugged i daresay we shall find she was mistaken on almost every point why not look it up said mrs plinth as a rule this recurrent suggestion of mrs plinths was ignored in the heat of discussion and only resorted to afterward in the privacy of each members home but on the present occasion the desire to ascribe their own confusion of thought to the vague and contradictory nature of mrs robys statements caused the members of the lunch club to utter a collective demand for a book of reference at this point the production of her treasured volume gave mrs leveret for a moment the unusual experience of occupying the centre front but she was not able to hold it long for appropriate allusions contained no mention of xingu oh thats not the kind of thing we want exclaimed miss van vluyck she cast a disparaging glance over mrs ballingers assortment of literature and added impatiently havent you any useful books of course i have replied mrs ballinger indignantly i keep them in my husbands dressingroom from this region after some difficulty and delay the parlourmaid produced the wz volume of an encyclopaedia and in deference to the fact that the demand for it had come from miss van vluyck laid the ponderous tome before her there was a moment of painful suspense while miss van vluyck rubbed her spectacles adjusted them and turned to z and a murmur of surprise when she said it isnt here i suppose said mrs plinth its not fit to be put in a book of reference oh nonsense exclaimed mrs ballinger try x miss van vluyck turned back through the volume peering shortsightedly up and down the pages till she came to a stop and remained motionless like a dog on a point well have you found it mrs ballinger enquired after a considerable delay yes ive found it said miss van vluyck in a queer voice mrs plinth hastily interposed i beg you wont read it aloud if theres anything offensive miss van vluyck without answering continued her silent scrutiny well what is it exclaimed laura glyde excitedly do tell us urged mrs leveret feeling that she would have something awful to tell her sister miss van vluyck pushed the volume aside and turned slowly toward the expectant group its a river a river yes in brazil isnt that where shes been living who fanny roby oh but you must be mistaken youve been reading the wrong thing mrs ballinger exclaimed leaning over her to seize the volume its the only xingu in the encyclopaedia and she has been living in brazil miss van vluyck persisted yes her brother has a consulship there mrs leveret interposed but its too ridiculous i we why we all remember studying xingu last year or the year before last mrs ballinger stammered i thought i did when you said so laura glyde avowed i said so cried mrs ballinger yes you said it had crowded everything else out of your mind well you said it had changed your whole life for that matter miss van vluyck said she had never grudged the time shed given it mrs plinth interposed i made it clear that i knew nothing whatever of the original mrs ballinger broke off the dispute with a groan oh what does it all matter if shes been making fools of us i believe miss van vluycks right she was talking of the river all the while how could she its too preposterous miss glyde exclaimed listen miss van vluyck had repossessed herself of the encyclopaedia and restored her spectacles to a nose reddened by excitement the xingu one of the principal rivers of brazil rises on the plateau of mato grosso and flows in a northerly direction for a length of no less than one thousand one hundred and eighteen miles entering the amazon near the mouth of the latter river the upper course of the xingu is auriferous and fed by numerous branches its source was first discovered in by the german explorer von den steinen after a difficult and dangerous expedition through a region inhabited by tribes still in the stone age of culture the ladies received this communication in a state of stupefied silence from which mrs leveret was the first to rally she certainly did speak of its having branches the word seemed to snap the last thread of their incredulity and of its great length gasped mrs ballinger she said it was awfully deep and you couldnt skip you just had to wade through miss glyde added the idea worked its way more slowly through mrs plinths compact resistances how could there be anything improper about a river she enquired improper why what she said about the source that it was corrupt not corrupt but hard to get at laura glyde corrected some one whod been there had told her so i daresay it was the explorer himself doesnt it say the expedition was dangerous difficult and dangerous read miss van vluyck mrs ballinger pressed her hands to her throbbing temples theres nothing she said that wouldnt apply to a river to this river she swung about excitedly to the other members why do you remember her telling us that she hadnt read the supreme instant because shed taken it on a boating party while she was staying with her brother and some one had shied it overboard shied of course was her own expression the ladies breathlessly signified that the expression had not escaped them well and then didnt she tell osric dane that one of her books was simply saturated with xingu of course it was if one of mrs robys rowdy friends had thrown it into the river this surprising reconstruction of the scene in which they had just participated left the members of the lunch club inarticulate at length mrs plinth after visibly labouring with the problem said in a heavy tone osric dane was taken in too mrs leveret took courage at this perhaps thats what mrs roby did it for she said osric dane was a brute and she may have wanted to give her a lesson miss van vluyck frowned it was hardly worth while to do it at our expense at least said miss glyde with a touch of bitterness she succeeded in interesting her which was more than we did what chance had we rejoined mrs ballinger mrs roby monopolised her from the first and that ive no doubt was her purpose to give osric dane a false impression of her own standing in the club she would hesitate at nothing to attract attention we all know how she took in poor professor foreland she actually makes him give bridgeteas every thursday mrs leveret piped up laura glyde struck her hands together why this is thursday and its there shes gone of course and taken osric with her and theyre shrieking over us at this moment said mrs ballinger between her teeth this possibility seemed too preposterous to be admitted she would hardly dare said miss van vluyck confess the imposture to osric dane im not so sure i thought i saw her make a sign as she left if she hadnt made a sign why should osric dane have rushed out after her well you know wed all been telling her how wonderful xingu was and she said she wanted to find out more about it mrs leveret said with a tardy impulse of justice to the absent this reminder far from mitigating the wrath of the other members gave it a stronger impetus yes and thats exactly what theyre both laughing over now said laura glyde ironically mrs plinth stood up and gathered her expensive furs about her monumental form i have no wish to criticise she said but unless the lunch club can protect its members against the recurrence of such such unbecoming scenes i for one oh so do i agreed miss glyde rising also miss van vluyck closed the encyclopaedia and proceeded to button herself into her jacket my time is really too valuable she began i fancy we are all of one mind said mrs ballinger looking searchingly at mrs leveret who looked at the others i always deprecate anything like a scandal mrs plinth continued she has been the cause of one today exclaimed miss glyde mrs leveret moaned i dont see how she could and miss van vluyck said picking up her notebook some women stop at nothing but if mrs plinth took up her argument impressively anything of the kind had happened in my house it never would have her tone implied i should have felt that i owed it to myself either to ask for mrs robys resignation or to offer mine oh mrs plinth gasped the lunch club fortunately for me mrs plinth continued with an awful magnanimity the matter was taken out of my hands by our presidents decision that the right to entertain distinguished guests was a privilege vested in her office and i think the other members will agree that as she was alone in this opinion she ought to be alone in deciding on the best way of effacing its its really deplorable consequences a deep silence followed this outbreak of mrs plinths longstored resentment i dont see why i should be expected to ask her to resign mrs ballinger at length began but laura glyde turned back to remind her you know she made you say that youd got on swimmingly in xingu an illtimed giggle escaped from mrs leveret and mrs ballinger energetically continued but you neednt think for a moment that im afraid to the door of the drawingroom closed on the retreating backs of the lunch club and the president of that distinguished association seating herself at her writingtable and pushing away a copy of the wings of death to make room for her elbow drew forth a sheet of the clubs notepaper on which she began to write my dear mrs roby
