war before the sun rose he was harnessd light and to the field goes he where every flower did as a prophet weep what it foresaw in hectors wrath cressida what was his cause of anger alexander the noise goes this there is among the greeks a lord of troyan blood nephew to hector they call him ajax cressida good and what of him alexander they say he is a very man per se and stands alone cressida so do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs alexander this man lady hath robbd many beasts of their particular additions he is as valiant as a lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephanta man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushd into folly his folly sauced with discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of every thing but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty briareus many hands and no use or purblind argus all eyes and no sight cressida but how should this man that makes me smile make hector angry alexander they say he yesterday copd hector in the battle and struck him

complexion above paris cressida why paris hath colour enough pandarus so he has cressida then troilus should have too much if she praisd him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming praise for a good complexion i had as lief helens golden tongue had commended troilus for a copper nose pandarus i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris cressida then shes a merry greek indeed pandarus nay i am sure she does she came to him th other day into the compassd windowand you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin cressida indeed a tapsters arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total pandarus why he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother hector

too pandarus and hector laughd cressida at what was all this laughing pandarus marry at the white hair that helen spied on troilus chin cressida ant had been a green hair i should have laughd too pandarus they laughd not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer cressida what was his answer pandarus quoth she heres but two and fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white cressida this

enterprise but more in troilus thousandfold i see than in the glass of pandars praise may be yet hold i off women are angels wooing things won are done joys soul lies in the doing that she belovd knows nought that knows not this men prize the thing ungaind more than it is that she was never yet that ever knew love got so sweet as when desire did sue therefore this maxim out of love i teach

enter agamemnon nestor ulysses diomedes menelaus and others agamemnon princes what grief hath set these jaundies oer your cheeks the ample proposition that hope makes in all designs begun on earth below fails in the promisd largeness checks and disasters grow in the veins of actions highest reard as knots by the conflux of meeting sap infects the sound pine and diverts his grain tortive and errant from his course of growth nor princes is it matter new to us that we come short of our suppose so far that after seven years siege yet troy walls stand sith every action that hath gone before whereof we have record trial did draw bias and thwart not answering the aim and that unbodied figure of the thought that gavet surmised shape why then you princes do you with cheeks abashd behold our works and call them shames which are indeed nought else but the protractive trials of great jove to find persistive constancy in men the fineness of which metal is not found in fortunes love for then the bold and coward the wise and fool the artist and unread the hard and soft seem all affind and kin but in the wind and tempest of her frown distinction with a broad and powerful fan puffing at all winnows the light away and what hath mass or matter by itself lies rich in virtue and unmingled nestor with due observance of thy godlike seat great agamemnon nestor shall apply thy latest words in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth how many shallow bauble boats dare sail upon her patient breast making their way with those of nobler bulk but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis and anon behold the strongribbd bark through liquid mountains cut bounding between the two moist elements like perseus horse wheres then the saucy boat whose weak untimberd sides but even now corivalld greatness either to harbour fled or made a toast for neptune even so doth valours show and valours worth divide in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze than by the tiger but when the splitting wind makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks and flies fled under shadewhy then the thing of courage as rousd with rage with rage doth sympathise and with an accent tund in selfsame key retorts to chiding fortune ulysses agamemnon thou great commander nerve and bone of greece heart of our numbers soul and only spirit in whom the tempers and the minds of all should be shut uphear what ulysses speaks besides the applause and approbation the which to agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway to nestor and thou most reverend for thy stretchdout life i give to both your speeches which were such as agamemnon and the hand of greece should hold up high in brass and such again as venerable nestor hatchd in silver should with a bond of air strong as the axletree on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears to his experiencd tongueyet let it please both thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak agamemnon speak prince of ithaca and bet of less expect that matter needless of importless burden divide thy lips than we are confident when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws we shall hear music wit and oracle ulysses troy yet upon his basis had been down and the great hectors sword had lackd a master but for these instances the specialty of rule hath been neglected and look how many grecian tents do stand hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions when that the general is not like the hive to whom the foragers shall all repair what honey is expected degree being vizarded th unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask the heavens themselves the planets and this centre observe degree priority and place insisture course proportion season form office and custom in all line of order and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthrond and spherd amidst the other whose medcinable eye corrects the ill aspects of planets evil and posts like the commandment of a king sans check to good and bad but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander what plagues and what portents what mutiny what raging of the sea shaking of earth commotion in the winds frights changes horrors divert and crack rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixture o when degree is shakd which is the ladder of all high designs the enterprise is sick how could communities degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities peaceful commerce from dividable shores the primogenity and due of birth prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels but by degree stand in authentic place take but degree away untune that string and hark what discord follows each thing melts in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters should lift their bosoms higher than the shores and make a sop of all this solid globe strength should be lord of imbecility and the rude son should strike his father dead force should be right or rather right and wrong between whose endless jar justice resides should lose their names and so should justice too then everything includes itself in power power into will will into appetite and appetite an universal wolf so doubly seconded with will and power must make perforce an universal prey and last eat up himself great agamemnon this chaos when degree is suffocate follows the choking and this neglection of degree it is that by a pace goes backward with a purpose it hath to climb the generals disdaind by him one step below he by the next that next by him beneath so ever step exampld by the first pace that is sick of his superior grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation and tis this fever that keeps troy on foot not her own sinews to end a tale of length troy in our weakness stands not in her strength nestor most wisely hath ulysses here discoverd the fever whereof all our power is sick agamemnon the nature of the sickness found ulysses what is the remedy ulysses the great achilles whom opinion crowns the sinew and the forehand of our host having his ear full of his airy fame grows dainty of his worth and in his tent lies mocking our designs with him patroclus upon a lazy bed the livelong day breaks scurril jests and with ridiculous and awkward action which slanderer he imitation calls he pageants us sometime great agamemnon thy topless deputation he puts on and like a strutting player whose conceit lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound twixt his stretchd footing and the scaffoldage such tobepitied and oerwrested seeming he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks tis like a chime amending with terms unsquard which from the tongue of roaring typhon droppd would seem hyperboles at this fusty stuff the large achilles on his pressd bed lolling from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause cries excellent tis agamemnon just now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard as he being drest to some oration thats doneas near as the extremest ends of parallels as like vulcan and his wife yet god achilles still cries excellent tis nestor right now play him me patroclus arming to answer in a night alarm and then forsooth the faint defects of age must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit and with a palsyfumbling on his gorget shake in and out the rivet and at this sport sir valour dies cries o enough patroclus or give me ribs of steel i shall split all in pleasure of my spleen and in this fashion all our abilities gifts natures shapes severals and generals of grace exact achievements plots orders preventions excitements to the field or speech for truce success or loss what is or is not serves as stuff for these two to make paradoxes nestor and in the imitation of these twain who as ulysses says opinion crowns with an imperial voicemany are infect ajax is grown selfwilld and bears his head in such a rein in full as proud a place as broad achilles keeps his tent like him makes factious feasts rails on our state of war bold as an oracle and sets thersites a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint to match us in comparisons with dirt to weaken and discredit our exposure how rank soever rounded in with danger ulysses they tax our policy and call it cowardice count wisdom as no member of the war forestall prescience and esteem no act but that of hand the still and mental parts that do contrive how many hands shall strike when fitness calls them on and know by measure of their observant toil the enemies weight why this hath not a fingers dignity they call this bedwork mappry closetwar so that the ram that batters down the wall for the great swinge and rudeness of his poise they place before his hand that made the engine or those that with the fineness of their souls by reason guide his execution nestor let this be granted and achilles horse makes many thetis sons tucket agamemnon what trumpet look menelaus menelaus from troy enter aeneas agamemnon what would you fore our tent aeneas is this great agamemnons tent i pray you agamemnon even this aeneas may one that is a herald and a prince do a fair message to his kingly eyes agamemnon with surety stronger than achilles an fore all the greekish heads which with one voice call agamemnon head and general aeneas fair leave and large security how may a stranger to those most imperial looks know them from eyes of other mortals agamemnon how aeneas ay i ask that i might waken reverence and bid the cheek be ready with a blush modest as morning when she coldly eyes the youthful phoebus which is that god in office guiding men which is the high and mighty agamemnon agamemnon this troyan scorns us or the men of troy are ceremonious courtiers aeneas courtiers as free as debonair unarmd as bending angels thats their fame in peace but when they would seem soldiers they have galls good arms strong joints true swords and joves accord nothing so full of heart but peace aeneas peace troyan lay thy finger on thy lips the worthiness of praise distains his worth if that the praisd himself bring the praise forth but what the repining enemy commends that breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends agamemnon sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas aeneas ay greek that is my name agamemnon whats your affair i pray you aeneas sir pardon tis for agamemnons ears agamemnon he hears nought privately that comes from troy aeneas nor i from troy come not to whisper with him i bring a trumpet to awake his ear to set his sense on the attentive bent and then to speak agamemnon speak frankly as the wind it is not agamemnons sleeping hour that thou shalt know troyan he is awake he tells thee so himself aeneas trumpet blow loud send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents and every greek of mettle let him know what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud sound trumpet we have great agamemnon here in troy a prince called hectorpriam is his father who in this dull and longcontinued truce is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet and to this purpose speak kings princes lords if there be one among the fairst of greece that holds his honour higher than his ease that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril that knows his valour and knows not his fear that loves his mistress more than in confession with truant vows to her own lips he loves and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hersto him this challenge hector in view of troyans and of greeks shall make it good or do his best to do it he hath a lady wiser fairer truer than ever greek did couple in his arms and will tomorrow with his trumpet call midway between your tents and walls of troy to rouse a grecian that is true in love if any come hector shall honour him if none hell say in troy when he retires the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth the splinter of a lance even so much agamemnon this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas if none of them have soul in such a kind we left them all at home but we are soldiers and may that soldier a mere recreant prove that means not hath not or is not in love if then one is or hath or means to be that one meets hector if none else i am he nestor tell him of nestor one that was a man when hectors grandsire suckd he is old now but if there be not in our grecian mould one noble man that hath one spark of fire to answer for his love tell him from me ill hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vantbrace put this witherd brawn and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandame and as chaste as may be in the world his youth in flood ill prove this truth with my three drops of blood aeneas now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth ulysses amen agamemnon fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand to our pavilion shall i lead you first achilles shall have word of this intent so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent yourself shall feast with us before you go and find the welcome of a noble foe exeunt all but ulysses and nestor ulysses nestor nestor what says ulysses ulysses i have a young conception in my brain be you my time to bring it to some shape nestor what ist ulysses this tis blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be croppd or shedding breed a nursery of like evil to overbulk us all nestor well and how ulysses this challenge that the gallant hector sends however it is spread in general name relates in purpose only to achilles nestor true the purpose is perspicuous even as substance whose grossness little characters sum up and in the publication make no strain but that achilles were his brain as barren as banks of libyathough apollo knows tis dry enoughwill with great speed of judgment ay with celerity find hectors purpose pointing on him ulysses and wake him to the answer think you nestor why tis most meet who may you else oppose that can from hector bring those honours off if not achilles though t be a sportful combat yet in this trial much opinion dwells for here the troyans taste our dearst repute with their finst palate and trust to me ulysses our imputation shall be oddly poisd in this vile action for the success although particular shall give a scantling of good or bad unto the general and in such indexes although small pricks to their subsequent volumes there is seen the baby figure of the giant mas of things to come at large it is supposd he that meets hector issues from our choice and choice being mutual act of all our souls makes merit her election and doth boil as twere from forth us all a man distilld out of our virtues who miscarrying what heart receives from hence a conquering part to steel a strong opinion to themselves which entertaind limbs are his instruments in no less working than are swords and bows directive by the limbs ulysses give pardon to my speech therefore tis meet achilles meet not hector let us like merchants show our foulest wares and think perchance theyll sell if not the lustre of the better yet to show shall show the better by showing the worst first do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet for both our honour and our shame in this are doggd with two strange followers nestor i see them not with my old eyes what are they ulysses what glory our achilles shares from hector were he not proud we all should wear with him but he already is too insolent and it were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes should he scape hector fair if he were foild why then we do our main opinion crush in taint of our best man no make a lottry and by device let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector among ourselves give him allowance for the better man for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends if the dull brainless ajax come safe off well dress him up in voices if he fail yet go we under our opinion still that we have

helenus priam after so many hours lives speeches spent thus once again says nestor from the greeks deliver helen and all damage else as honour loss of time travail expense wounds friends and what else dear that is consumd in hot digestion of this cormorant war shall be struck off hector what say you tot hector though no man lesser fears the greeks than i as far as toucheth my particular yet dread priam there is no lady of more softer bowels more spongy to suck in the sense of fear more ready to cry out who knows what follows than hector is the wound of peace is surety surety secure but modest doubt is calld the beacon of the wise the tent that searches to th bottom of the worst let helen go since the first sword was drawn about this question every tithe soul mongst many thousand dismes hath been as dear as heleni mean of ours if we have lost so many tenths of ours to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us had it our name the value of one ten what merits in that reason which denies the yielding of her up troilus fie fie my brother weigh you the worth and honour of a king so great as our dread fathers in a scale of common ounces will you with counters sum the pastproportion of his infinite and buckle in a waist most fathomless with spans and inches so diminutive as fears and reasons fie for godly shame helenus no marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons you are so empty of them should not our father bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons because your speech hath none that tells him so troilus you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest you fur your gloves with reason here are your reasons you know an enemy intends you harm you know a sword employd is perilous and reason flies the object of all harm who marvels then when helenus beholds a grecian and his sword if he do set the very wings of reason to his heels and fly like chidden mercury from jove or like a star disorbd nay if we talk of reason lets shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts with this crammd reason reason and respect make livers pale and lustihood deject hector brother she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping troilus whats aught but as tis valued hector but value dwells not in particular will it holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein tis precious of itself as in the prizer tis mad idolatry to make the service greater than the godi and the will dotes that is attributive to what infectiously itself affects without some image of th affected merit troilus i take today a wife and my election is led on in the conduct of my will my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears two traded pilots twixt the dangerous shores of will and judgment how may i avoid although my will distaste what it elected the wife i chose there can be no evasion to blench from this and to stand firm by honour we turn not back the silks upon the merchant when we have soild them nor the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve because we now are full it was thought meet paris should do some vengeance on the greeks your breath with full consent benied his sails the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce and did him service he touchd the ports desird and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness wrinkles apollos and makes stale the morning why keep we her the grecians keep our aunt is she worth keeping why she is a pearl whose price hath launchd above a thousand ships and turnd crownd kings to merchants if youll avouch twas wisdom paris went as you must needs for you all cried go go if youll confess he brought home worthy prize as you must needs for you all clappd your hands and cried inestimable why do you now the issue of your proper wisdoms rate and do a deed that never fortune did beggar the estimation which you prizd richer than sea and land o theft most base that we have stoln what we do fear to keep but thieves unworthy of a thing so stoln that in their country did them that disgrace we fear to warrant in our native place cassandra within cry troyans cry priam what noise what shriek is this troilus tis our mad sister i do know her voice cassandra within cry troyans hector it is cassandra enter cassandra raving cassandra cry troyans cry lend me ten thousand eyes and i will fill them with prophetic tears hector peace sister peace cassandra virgins and boys midage and wrinkled eld soft infancy that nothing canst but cry add to my clamours let us pay betimes a moiety of that mass of moan to come cry troyans cry practise your eyes with tears troy must not be nor goodly ilion stand our firebrand brother paris burns us all cry troyans cry a helen and a woe cry cry troy burns or else let helen go exit hector now youthful troilus do not these high strains of divination in our sister work some touches of remorse or is your blood so madly hot that no discourse of reason nor fear of bad success in a bad cause can qualify the same troilus why brother hector we may not think the justness of each act such and no other than event doth form it nor once deject the courage of our minds because cassandras mad her brainsick raptures cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honours all engagd to make it gracious for my private part i am no more touchd than all priams sons and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain paris else might the world convince of levity as well my undertakings as your counsels but i attest the gods your full consent gave wings to my propension and cut of all fears attending on so dire a project for what alas can these my single arms what propugnation is in one mans valour to stand the push and enmity of those this quarrel would excite yet i protest were i alone to pass the difficulties and had as ample power as i have will paris should neer retract what he hath done nor faint in the pursuit priam paris you speak like one besotted on your sweet delights you have the honey still but these the gall so to be valiant is no praise at all paris sir i propose not merely to myself the pleasures such a beauty brings with it but i would have the soil of her fair rape wipd off in honourable keeping her what treason were it to the ransackd queen disgrace to your great worths and shame to me now to deliver her possession up on terms of base compulsion can it be that so degenerate a strain as this should once set footing in your generous bosoms theres not the meanest spirit on our party without a heart to dare or sword to draw when helen is defended nor none so noble whose life were ill bestowd or death unfamd where helen is the subject then i say well may we fight for her whom we know well the worlds large spaces cannot parallel hector paris and troilus you have both said well and on the cause and question now in hand have glozd but superficially not much unlike young men whom aristode thought unfit to hear moral philosophy the reasons you allege do more conduce to the hot passion of distempred blood than to make up a free determination twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than adders to the voice of any true decision nature craves all dues be rendred to their owners now what nearer debt in all humanity than wife is to the husband if this law of nature be corrupted through affection and that great minds of partial indulgence to their benumbed wills resist the same there is a law in each wellorderd nation to curb those raging appetites that are most disobedient and refractory if helen then be wife to spartas king as it is known she isthese moral laws of nature and of nations speak aloud to have her back returnd thus to persist in doing wrong extenuates not wrong but makes it much more heavy hectors opinion is this in way of truth yet neer the less my spritely brethren i propend to you in resolution to keep helen still for tis a cause that hath no mean dependence upon our joint and several dignities troilus why there you touchd the life of our design were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens i would not wish a drop of troyan blood spent more in her defence but worthy hector she is a theme of honour and renown a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds whose present courage may beat down our foes and fame in time to come canonize us for i presume brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promisd glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide worlds revenue hector i am yours you valiant offspring of great priamus i have a roisting challenge sent amongst the dull and factious nobles of the greeks will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits i was advertisd their great general slept whilst emulation in the army crept this i presume will wake him exeunt act ii scene the grecian camp before the tent of achilles enter thersites solus thersites how now thersites what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury shall the elephant ajax carry it thus he beats me and i rail at him o worthy satisfaction would it were otherwise that i could beat him whilst he raild at me sfoot ill learn to conjure and raise devils but ill see some issue of my spiteful execrations then theres achilles a rare engineer if troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves o thou great thunderdarter of olympus forget that thou art jove the king of gods and mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little lessthanlittle wit from them that they have which shortarmd ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web after this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the neapolitan boneache for that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket i have said my prayers and devil envy say amen what ho my lord achilles enter patroclus patroclus whos there thersites good thersites come in and rail thersites if i

agamemnon hear you patroclus we are too well acquainted with these answers but his evasion wingd thus swift with scorn cannot outfly our apprehensions much attribute he hath and much the reason why we ascribe it to him yet all his virtues not virtuously on his own part beheld do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish are like to rot untasted go and tell him we come to speak with him and you shall not sin if you do say we think him overproud and underhonest in selfassumption greater than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself here tend the savage strangeness he puts on disguise the holy strength of their command and underwrite in an observing kind his humorous predominance yea watch his pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if the passage and whole carriage of this action rode on his tide go tell him this and ad that if he overhold his price so much well none of him but let him like an engine not portable lie under this report bring

it cry no recovery agamemnon let ajax go to him dear lord go you and greet him in his tent tis said he holds you well and will be led at your request a little from himself ulysses o agamemnon let it not be so well consecrate the steps that ajax makes when they go from achilles shall the proud lord that bastes his arrogance with his own seam and never suffers matter of the world enter his thoughts

in plight and youth outliving beautys outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays or that persuasion could but thus convince me that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnowed purity in love how were i then uplifted but alas i am as true as truths simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth cressida in that ill war with you troilus o virtuous fight when right with right wars who shall be most right true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truth by troilus when their rhymes full of protest of oath and

out of those many registred in promise which you say live to come in my behalf agamemnon what wouldst thou of us troyan make demand calchas you have a troyan prisoner calld antenor yesterday took troy holds him very dear oft have youoften have you thanks therefore desird my cressid in right great exchange whom troy hath still denied but this antenor i know is such a wrest in their affairs that their negotiations all must slack wanting his manage and they will almost give us a prince of blood a son of priam in change of him let him be sent great princes and he shall buy my daughter and her presence shall quite strike off all service i have done in most accepted pain agamemnon let diomedes bear him and bring us cressid hither calchas shall have what he requests of us good diomed furnish

usd to bend to send their smiles before them to achilles to come as humbly as they usd to creep to holy altars achilles what am i poor of late tis certain greatness once falln out with fortune must fall out with men too what the declind is he shall as soon read in the eyes of others as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies show not their mealy wings but to the summer and not a man for being simply man hath any honour but honour for those honours that are without him as place riches and favour prizes of accident as oft as merit which when they fall as being slippery standers the love that leand on them as slippery too doth one pluck down another and together die in the fall but tis not so with me fortune and i are friends i do enjoy at ample point all that i did possess save these mens looks who do methinks find out something not worth in me such rich beholding as they have often given here is ulysses ill interrupt his reading how now ulysses ulysses now great thetis son achilles what are you reading ulysses a strange fellow here writes me that manhow dearly ever parted how much in having or without or in cannot make boast to have that which he hath nor feels not what he owes but by reflection as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver achilles this is not strange ulysses the beauty that is borne here in the face the bearer knows not but commends itself to others eyes nor doth the eye itself that most pure spirit of sensebehold itself not going from itself but eye to eye opposed salutes each other with each others form for speculation turns not to itself till it hath travelld and is mirrord there where it may see itself this is not strange at all ulysses i do not strain at the position it is familiarbut at the authors drift who in his circumstance expressly proves that no man is the lord of anything though in and of him there be much consisting till he communicate his parts to others nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them formed in th applause where th are extended who like an arch reverbrate the voice again or like a gate of steel fronting the sun receives and renders back his figure and his heat i was much rapt in this and apprehended here immediately th unknown ajax heavens what a man is there a very horse that has he knows not what nature what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth now shall we see tomorrow an act that very chance doth throw upon him ajax renownd o heavens what some men do while some men leave to do how some men creep in skittish fortuneshall whiles others play the idiots in her eyes how one man eats into anothers pride while pride is fasting in his wantonness to see these grecian lordswhy even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder as if his foot were on brave hectors breast and great troy shrinking achilles i do believe it for they passd by me as misers do by beggarsneither gave to me good word nor look what are my deeds forgot ulysses time hath my lord a wallet at his back wherein he puts alms for oblivion a greatsizd monster of ingratitudes those scraps are good deeds past which are devourd as fast as they are made forgot as soon as done perseverance dear my lord keeps honour bright to have done is to hang quite out of fashion like a rusty mail in monumental mockry take the instant way for honour travels in a strait so narrow where one but goes abreast keep then the path for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue if you give way or hedge aside from the direct forthright like to an entred tide they all rush by and leave you hindmost or like a gallant horse falln in first rank lie there for pavement to the abject rear oerrun and trampled on then what they do in present though less than yours in past must oertop yours for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by th hand and with his arms outstretchd as he would fly grasps in the corner the welcome ever smiles and farewell goes out sighing o let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was for beauty wit high birth vigour of bone desert in service love friendship charity are subjects all to envious and calumniating time one touch of nature makes the whole world kin that all with one consent praise newborn gawds though they are made and moulded of things past and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt oerdusted the present eye praises the present object then marvel not thou great and complete man that all the greeks begin to worship ajax since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what stirs not the cry went once on thee and still it might and yet it may again if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late made emulous missions mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction achilles of this my privacy i have strong reasons ulysses but gainst your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical tis known achilles that you are in love with one of priams daughters achilles ha known ulysses is that a wonder the providence thats in a watchful state knows almost every grain of plutus gold finds bottom in th uncomprehensive deeps keeps place with thought and almost like the gods do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles there is a mysterywith whom relation durst never meddlein the soul of state which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours my lord and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home when fame shall in our island sound her trump and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing great hectors sister did achilles win but our great ajax bravely beat down him farewell my lord i as your lover speak the fool slides oer the ice that you should break exit patroclus to this effect achilles have i movd you a woman impudent and mannish grown is not more loathd than an effeminate man in time of action i stand condemnd for this they think my little stomach to the war and your great love to me restrains you thus sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold and like a dewdrop from the lions mane be shook to airy air achilles shall ajax fight with hector patroclus ay and perhaps receive much honour by him achilles i see my reputation is at stake my fame is shrewdly gord patroclus o then beware those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves omission to do what is necessary seals a commission to a blank of danger and danger like an ague subtly taints even then when they sit idly in the sun achilles go call thersites hither sweet patroclus ill send the fool to ajax and desire him t invite the troyan lords after the combat to see us here unarmd i have a womans longing an appetite that i am sick withal to see great hector in his weeds of peace to talk with him and to behold his visage even to my full of view enter thersites a labour savd thersites a wonder achilles what thersites ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself achilles how so thersites he must fight singly tomorrow with hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing achilles how can that be thersites why a stalks up and down like a peacocka stride and a stand ruminaies like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say there were wit in this head an twould out and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking the mans undone for ever for if hector break not his neck i th combat hell breakt himself in vainglory he knows not me i said good morrow ajax and he replies thanks agamemnon what think you of this man that takes me for the general hes grown a very land fish languageless a monster a plague of opinion a man may wear it on both sides like leather jerkin achilles thou must be my ambassador to him thersites thersites who i why hell answer nobody he professes not answering speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue ins arms i will put on his presence let patroclus make his demands to me you shall see the pageant of ajax achilles to him patroclus tell him i humbly desire the valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector to come unarmd to my tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious sixorseventimeshonourd captain general of the grecian army et cetera agamemnon do this patroclus jove bless great ajax thersites hum patroclus i come from the worthy achilles thersites ha patroclus who most humbly desires you to invite hector to his tent thersites hum patroclus and

sinews to make catlings on achilles come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight thersites let me carry another to his horse for thats the more capable creature achilles my mind is troubled like a fountain stirrd and i myself see not the bottom of it exeunt achilles and patroclus thersites would the fountain of your mind were clear again that i might water an ass at it i had rather be a tick in
