hornblower and the hotspur cecil scott forester chapter repeat after me said the parson i horatio take thee maria ellen the thought came up in hornblowers mind that these were the last few seconds in which he could withdraw from doing something which he knew to be illconsidered maria was not the right woman to be his wife even admitting that he was suitable material for marriage in any case if he had a grain of sense he would break off this ceremony even at this last moment he would announce that he had changed his mind and he would turn away from the altar and from the parson and from maria and he would leave the church a free man to have and to hold he was still like an automaton repeating the parsons words and there was maria beside him in the white that so little became her she was melting with happiness she was consumed with love for him however misplaced it might be he could not he simply could not deal her a blow so cruel he was conscious of the trembling of her body beside him he could no more bring himself to shatter that trust than he could have refused to command the hotspur and thereto i plight thee my troth repeated hornblower that settled it he thought those must be the final deciding words that made the ceremony legally binding he had made a promise and now there was no going back on it there was a comfort in the odd thought that he had really been committed from a week back when maria had come into his arms sobbing out her love for him and he had been too softhearted to laugh at her and too too weak too honest to take advantage of her with the intention of betraying her from the moment that he had listened to her from the moment that he had returned her kisses gently all these later results the bridal dress this ceremony in the church of st thomas beckett and the vague future of cloying affection had been inevitable bush was ready with the ring and hornblower slipped it over marias finger and the final words were said i now pronounce that they are man and wife said the parson and he went on with the blessing and then a blank five seconds followed until maria broke the silence oh horry she said and she laid her hand on his arm hornblower forced himself to smile down at her concealing the newly discovered fact that he disliked being called horry even more than he disliked being called horatio the happiest day of my life he said if a thing had to be done it might as well be done thoroughly so that in the same spirit he continued in my life so far it was actually painful to note the unbounded happiness of the smile that answered this gallant speech maria put her other hand up to him and he realized she expected to be kissed then and there in front of the altar it hardly seemed a proper thing to do in a sacred edifice in his ignorance he feared lest he should affront the devout but once more there was no drawing back and he stooped and kissed the soft lips that she proffered your signatures are required in the register prompted the parson and led the way to the vestry they wrote their names now i can kiss my soninlaw announced mrs mason loudly and hornblower found himself clasped by two powerful arms and soundly kissed on the cheek he supposed it was inevitable that a man should feel a distaste for his motherinlaw but here was bush to disengage him with outstretched hand and unusual smile offering felicitations and best wishes many thanks said hornblower and added many thanks for many services bush was positively embarrassed and tried to brush away hornblowers gratitude with the same gestures as he would have used to brush away flies he had been a tower of strength in this wedding just as he had been in the preparation of the hotspur for sea ill see you again at breakfast sir he said and with that he withdrew from the vestry leaving behind him an awkward gap i was counting on mr bushs arm for support down the aisle said mrs mason sharply it certainly was not like bush to leave everyone in the lurch like this it was in marked contrast with his behaviour during the last few whirlwind days we can bear each other company mrs mason said the parsons wife mr clive can follow us you are very kind mrs clive said mrs mason although there was nothing in her tone to indicate that she meant what she said then the happy pair can start now maria take the captains arm mrs mason marshalled the tiny procession in businesslike fashion hornblower felt marias hand slipped under his arm felt the light pressure she could not help giving to it and he could not be cruel enough to ignore it he pressed her hand in return between his ribs and his elbow to be rewarded by another smile a small shove from behind by mrs mason started him back in the church to be greeted by a roar from the organ half a crown for the organist and a shilling for the blower was what that music had cost mrs mason there might be better uses for the money the thought occupied hornblowers mind for several seconds and was naturally succeeded by the inevitable wonderment as to how anyone could possibly find enjoyment in these distasteful noises he and maria were well down the aisle before he came back to reality the sailors are all gone said maria with a break in her voice theres almost no one in the church truth to tell there were only two or three people in the pews and these obviously the most casual idlers all the few guests bad trooped into the vestry for the signing and the fifty seamen whom bush had brought from hotspur all those who could be trusted not to desert had vanished already hornblower felt a vague disappointment that bush had failed again to rise to the situation why should we care he asked groping wildly for words of comfort for maria why should any shadow fall on our wedding day it was strangely painful to see and to feel marias instant response and her faltering step changed to a brave stride as they marched down the empty church there was bright sunshine awaiting them at the west door he could see and he thought of something else a tender bridegroom might say happy is the bride the sun shines on they came out of the dim light into the bright sun and the transition was moral as well as physical for bush had not disappointed them he had not been found wanting after all hornblower heard a sharp word and a ragged clash of steel and there were the fifty seamen in a double rank stretching away from the door making an arch of their drawn cutlasses for the couple to walk beneath oh how nice said maria in childish delight furthermore the array of seamen at the church door had attracted a crowd of spectators all craning forward to see the captain and his bride hornblower darted a professional glance first down one line of seamen and then down the other they were all dressed in the new blue and white checked shirts with which he had stocked the slop chest of the hotspur their white duck trousers were mostly well worn but well washed and long enough and baggy enough to conceal the probable deficiencies of their shoes it was a good turnout beyond the avenue of cutlasses stood a horseless postchaise with bush standing behind it wondering a little hornblower led maria towards it bush gallantly handed maria up into the front seat and hornblower climbed up beside her finding time now to take his cocked hat from under his arm and clap it on his head he had heard the cutlasses rasp back into their sheaths now the guard of honour came pattering forward in a disciplined rush there were pipeclayed drag ropes where the traces should have been and the fifty men seized their coils twentyfive to a coil and ran them out bush craned up towards hornblower let the brake off if you please sir that handle there sir hornblower obeyed and bush turned away and let loose a subdued bellow the seamen took the strain in half a dozen quickening steps and then broke into a trot the post chaise rattling over the cobbles while the crowd waved their hats and cheered i never thought i could be so happy horry darling said maria the men at the drag ropes with the usual exuberance of the seaman on land swung round the corner into the high street and headed at the double towards the george and with the turn maria was flung against him and clasped him in delicious fear as they drew up it was obvious that there was a danger of the chaise rolling forward into the seamen and hornblower had to think fast and reach for the brake lever hurriedly casting himself free from marias arm then he sat for a moment wondering what to do next on this occasion there should be a group to welcome them the host of the inn and his wife the boots the ostler the drawer and the maids but as it was there was no one he had to leap down from the chaise unassisted and single handed help maria down thank you men he said to the parting seamen who acknowledged his thanks with a knuckling of foreheads and halting words bush was in sight now round the corner hurrying towards them hornblower could safely leave bush in charge while he led maria into the inn with a sad lack of ceremony but here was the host at last bustling up with a napkin over his arm and his wife at his heels welcome sir welcome madam this way sir madam he flung open the door into the coffeeroom to reveal the wedding breakfast laid on a snowy cloth the admiral arrived only five minutes ago sir so you must excuse us sir which admiral the honourable admiral sir william cornwallis sir commanding the channel fleet is coachman says wars certain sir hornblower had been convinced of this ever since nine days ago he had read the kings message to parliament and witnessed the activities of the press gangs and had been notified of his appointment to the command of the hotspur and had found himself betrothed to maria bonapartes unscrupulous behaviour on the continent meant a glass of wine madam a glass of wine sir hornblower was conscious of marias inquiring glance when the innkeeper asked this question she would not venture to answer until she had ascertained what her new husband thought well wait for the rest of the company said hornblower ah a heavy step on the threshold announced bushs arrival theyll all be here in two minutes said bush very good of you to arrange about the carriage and seamen mr bush said hornblower and he thought that moment of something else that a kind and thoughtful husband would say he slipped his hand under marias arm and added mrs hornblower says you made her very happy a delighted giggle from maria told him that he had given pleasure by this unexpected use of her new name as he expected mrs hornblower i give you joy said bush solemnly and then to hornblower by your leave sir ill return to the ship now mr bush asked maria i fear i must maam replied bush turning back at once to hornblower ill take the hands back with me sir theres always the chance that the lighters with the stores may come off im afraid youre right mr bush said hornblower keep me informed if you please aye aye sir said bush and with that he was gone here came the others pouring in and any trace of awkwardness about the party disappeared as mrs mason marshalled the guests and set the wedding breakfast into its stride corks popped and preliminary toasts were drunk there was the cake to be cut and mrs mason insisted that maria should make the first cut with hornblowers sword mrs mason was sure that in this maria would be following the example of naval brides in good society in london hornblower was not so sure he had lived for ten years under a strict convention that cold steel should never be drawn under a roof or a deck but his timid objections were swept away and maria the sword in both hands cut the cake amid general applause hornblower could hardly restrain his impatience to take the thing back from her and he quickly wiped the sugar icing from the blade wondering grimly what the assembled company would think if they knew he had once wiped human blood from it he was still engaged on this work when he became aware of the innkeeper whispering hoarsely at his side begging your pardon sir begging your pardon well the admirals compliments sir and he would be glad to see you when you find it convenient hornblower stood sword in hand staring at him in momentary uncomprehension the admiral sir es in the first floor front what we always calls the admirals room you mean sir william of course yes sir very well my respects to the admiral and no ill go up at once thank you thankee sir begging your pardon again hornblower shot his sword back into its sheath and looked round at the company they were watching the maid bustling round handing slices of wedding cake and had no eyes for him at present he settled his sword at his side twitched at his neckcloth and unobtrusively left the room picking up his hat as he did so when he knocked at the door of the first floor front a deep voice that he well remembered said come in it was so large a room that the fourposter bed at the far end was inconspicuous so was the secretary seated at the desk by the window cornwallis was standing in the middle apparently engaged in dictation until this interruption ah its hornblower good morning good morning sir the last time we met was over that unfortunate business with the irish rebel we had to hang him i remember cornwallis billy blue had not changed perceptibly during those four years he was still the bulky man with the composed manner obviously ready to deal with any emergency please sit down a glass of wine no thank you sir i expected that seeing the ceremony youve just come from my apologies for interrupting your wedding but you must blame boney not me of course sir hornblower felt that a more eloquent speech would have been in place here but he could not think of one ill detain you for as short a time as possible you know ive been appointed to the command of the channel fleet yes sir you know that hotspur is under my command i expected that but i didnt know sir the admiralty letter to that effect came down in my coach youll find it awaiting you on board yes sir is hotspur ready to sail no sir the truth and no excuses nothing else would do how long two days sir more if theres delay with the ordnance stores cornwallis was looking at him very sharply indeed but hornblower returned glance for glance he had nothing with which to reproach himself nine days ago hotspur was still laid up in ordinary shes been docked and breamed yes sir shed manned yes sir a good crew the cream of the press rigging set up yes sir yards crossed yes sir officers appointed yes sir a lieutenant and four masters mates youll need three months provisions and water i can stow a hundred and eleven days at full rations sir the cooperage is delivering the waterbutts at noon ill have it all stowed by nightfall sir have you warped her out yes sir shes at anchor now in spithead youve done well said cornwallis hornblower tried not to betray his relief at that speech from cornwallis that was more than approval it was hearty praise thank you sir so what do you need now bosns stores sir cordage canvas spare spars not easy to get the dockyard to part with those at this moment ill have a word with them and then the ordnance stores you say yes sir ordnance are waiting for a shipment of ninepounder shot none to be had here at the moment ten minutes ago hornblower had been thinking of words to please maria now he was selecting words for an honest report to cornwallis ill deal with that too said cornwallis you can be certain of sailing the day after tomorrow if the wind serves yes sir now for your orders youll get them in writing in the course of the day but id better tell you now while you can ask questions wars coming it hasnt been declared yet but boney may anticipate us yes sir im going to blockade brest as soon as i can get the fleet to sea and youre to go ahead of us yes sir youre not to do anything to precipitate war youre not to provide boney with an excuse no sir when wars declared you can of course take the appropriate action until then you have merely to observe keep your eye on brest look in as far as you can without provoking fire count the ships of war the number and rate of ships with their yards crossed ships still in ordinary ships in the roads ships preparing for sea yes sir boney sent the best of his ships and crews to the west indies last year hell have more trouble manning his fleet even than we have ill want your report as soon as i arrive on the station whats the hotspurs draught shell draw thirteen feet aft when shes complete with stores sir youll be able to use the goulet pretty freely then i dont have to tell you not to run her aground no sir but remember this youll find it hard to perform your duty unless you risk your ship theres folly and theres foolhardiness on one side and theres daring and calculation on the other make the right choice and ill see you through any trouble that may ensue cornwalliss wide blue eyes looked straight into hornblowers brown ones hornblower was deeply interested in what cornwallis had just said and equally interested in what he had left unsaid cornwallis had made a promise of sympathetic support but he had refrained from uttering the threat which was the obvious corollary this was no rhetorical device no facile trick of leadership it was a simple expression of cornwalliss natural state of mind he was a man who preferred to lead rather than to drive most interesting hornblower realized with a start that for several seconds be had been staring his commanderinchief out of countenance while following up this train of thought it was not the most tactful behaviour perhaps i understand sir he said and cornwallis rose from his chair well meet again at sea remember to do nothing to provoke war before war is declared he said with a smile and the smile revealed the man of action hornblower could read him as someone to whom the prospect of action was stimulating and desirable and who would never seek reasons or excuses for postponing decisions cornwallis suddenly withheld his proffered hand by jove he exclaimed i was forgetting this is your wedding day yes sir you were only married this morning an hour ago sir and ive taken you away from your wedding breakfast yes sir it would be cheap rhetoric to add anything trite like for king and country or even duty comes first your good lady will hardly be pleased nor would his motherinlaw more especially thought hornblower but again it would not be tactful to say so ill try to make amends sir he contented himself with saying its i who should make amends replied cornwallis perhaps i could join the festivities and drink the brides health that would be most kind of you sir said hornblower if anything could reconcile mrs mason to his breach of manners it would be the presence of admiral the hon sir william cornwallis kb at the breakfast table ill come then if youre certain i shant be unwelcome hachett find my sword wheres my hat so that when hornblower appeared again through the door of the coffeeroom mrs masons instant and bitter reproaches died away on her lips the moment she saw that hornblower was ushering in an important guest she saw the glittering epaulettes and the red ribbon and the star which cornwallis had most tactfully put on in honour of the occasion hornblower made the introductions long life and much happiness said cornwallis bowing over marias hand to the wife of one of the most promising officers in the kings service maria could only bob overwhelmed with embarrassment in this glittering presence enchanted to make your acquaintance sir william said mrs mason and the parson and his wife and the few neighbours of mrs masons who were the only other guests were enormously gratified at being in the same room as let alone being personally addressed by the son of an earl a knight of the bath and a commanderinchief combined in one person a glass of wine sir asked hornblower with pleasure cornwallis took the glass in his hand and looked round it was significant that it was mrs mason whom he addressed has the health of the happy couple been drunk yet no sir answered mrs mason in a perfect ecstasy then may i do so ladies gentlemen i ask you all to stand and join me on this happy occasion may they never know sorrow may they always enjoy health and prosperity may the wife always find comfort in the knowledge that the husband is doing his duty for king and country and may the husband be supported in his duty by the loyalty of the wife and let us hope that in time to come there will be a whole string of young gentlemen who will wear the kings uniform after their fathers example and a whole string of young ladies to be mothers of further young gentlemen i give you the health of the bride and groom the health was drunk amid acclamation with all eyes turned on the blushing maria and then from her all eyes turned on hornblower he rose he had realized before cornwallis had reached the midpoint of his speech that the admiral was using words he had used scores of times before at scores of weddings of his officers hornblower keyed up on the occasion met cornwalliss eyes and grinned he would give as good as he got he would reply with a speech exactly similar to the scores that cornwallis had listened to sir william ladies and gentlemen i can only thank you in the name of hornblower reached down and took marias hand my wife and myself as the laughter died away hornblower had well known that the company would laugh at his mention of maria as his wife although he himself did not think it a subject for laughter cornwallis looked at his watch and hornblower hastened to thank him for his presence and to escort him to the door beyond the threshold cornwallis turned and thumped him on the chest with his large hand ill add another line to my orders for you he said hornblower was acutely aware that cornwalliss friendly smile was accompanied by a searching glance yes sir ill add my written permission for you to sleep out of your ship for tonight and tomorrow night hornblower opened his mouth to reply but no words came for once in his life his readiness of wit had deserted him his mind was so busy reassessing the situation that it had nothing to spare for his organ of speech i thought you might have forgotten said cornwallis grinning hotspurs part of the channel fleet now her captain is forbidden by law to sleep anywhere except on board without the permission of the commanderinchief well you have it thank you sir said hornblower at last able to articulate maybe you wont sleep ashore again for a couple of years maybe more than that if boney fights it out i certainly think hell fight sir in that case you and i will meet again off ushant in three weeks time so now goodbye once more for some time after cornwallis had left hornblower stood by the halfclosed door of the coffeeroom in deep thought shifting his weight from one foot to the other which was the nearest he could get to pacing up and down war was coming he had always been certain of that because bonaparte would never retreat from the position he had taken up but until this moment hornblower had thought recklessly that he would not be ordered to sea until war was declared in two or three weeks time after the final negotiations had broken down he had been utterly wrong in this surmise and he was angry with himself on that account the facts that he had a good crew the first harvest of the press that his ship could be quickly made ready for sea that she was small and of no account in the balance of power even that she was of light draught and therefore well adapted to the mission cornwallis had allotted her should have warned him that he would be packed off to sea at the earliest possible moment he should have foreseen all this and he had not that was the first point the first pill to swallow next he had to find out why his judgement had been so faulty he knew the answer instantly but and he despised himself for this even more he flinched from expressing it but here it was he had allowed his judgement to be clouded on account of maria he had shrunk from hurting her and in consequence he had refused to allow his mind to make calculations about the future he had gone recklessly forward in the wild hope that some stroke of good fortune would save him from having to deal her this blow he pulled himself up abruptly at this point good fortune nonsense he was in command of his own ship and was being set in the forefront of the battle this was his golden chance to distinguish himself that was his good fortune it would have been maddening bad luck to have been left in harbour hornblower could feel the wellremembered thrill of excitement at the thought of seeing action again of risking reputation and life in doing his duty in gaining glory and in justifying himself in his own eyes now he was sane again he could see things in their proper proportion he was a naval officer first and a married man only second and a bad second at that but but that did not make things any easier he would still have to tear himself free from marias arms nor could he stay here outside the coffeeroom any longer he must go back despite his mental turmoil he turned and reentered the room closing the door behind him it will look well in the naval chronicle said mrs mason that the commanderinchief proposed the health of the happy pair now horatio some of your guests have empty plates hornblower was still trying to be a good host when he saw across the room the worried face of the innkeeper again it called for a second glance to see what had caused him to come in he was ushering in hornblowers new coxwain hewitt a very short man who escaped observation across the room hewitt made up in breadth a good deal of what he lacked in height and he sported a magnificent pair of glossy black sidewhiskers in the style which was newly fashionable on the lowerdeck he came rolling across the room his straw hat in his hand and knuckling his forehead gave horatio a note the address was in bushs handwriting and in the correct phrasing although now a lithe oldfashioned horatio hornblower esq master and commander silence fell on the assembled company a little rudely hornblower thought as he read the few lines hm sloop hotspur april sir i hear from the dockyard that the first of the lighters is ready to come alongside extra pay is not yet authorized for dockyard hands so that work will cease at nightfall i respectfully submit that i can supervise the embarkation of the stores if you should find it inconvenient to return on board your obdt servant wm bush is the boat at the hard demanded hornblower yes sir very well ill be there in five minutes aye aye sir oh horry said maria with a hint of reproach in her voice no it was disappointment not reproach my dear said hornblower it occurred to him that he might now quote i could not love thee dear so much but he instantly discarded the idea it would not be at all suitable at this moment with this wife youre going to the ship again said maria yes he could not stay away from the ship while there was work to be done today by driving the hands they could get half the stores on board at least tomorrow they could finish and if ordnance responded to the prodding of the admiral they could get the powder and shot on board as well then they could sail at dawn the day after tomorrow ill be back again this evening he said he forced himself to smile to look concerned to forget that he was on the threshold of adventure that before him lay a career of possible distinction nothing shall keep me from you dear he said he clapped his hands on her shoulders and gave her a smacking kiss that drew applause from the others that was the way to reintroduce a note of comedy into the proceedings and under cover of the laughter he made his exit as he hastened down to the hard two subjects for thought intertwined in his mind like the serpents of the medical caduceus the tender love that maria wished to lavish upon him and the fact that the day after tomorrow he would be at sea in command chapter someone must have been knocking at the bedroom door for some time hornblower had been conscious of it but was too stupid with sleep to think more about it but now the door opened with a clank of the latch and maria awakening with a start clutched at him in sudden fright and he was now fully awake there was the faintest gleam of light through the thick bed curtains a shuffling step on the oak floor of the bedroom and a highpitched female voice eight bells sir eight bells the curtains opened an inch to let in a ray of brighter light still and marias grip tightened but they came together again as hornblower found his voice very well im awake ill light your candles for you piped the voice and the shuffling seep went round the room and the light through the curtains grew brighter wheres the wind what ways the wind asked horns blower now so far awake as to feel the quickening of his heart beat and the tensing of his muscles as he realized what this morning meant to him now that i cant tell you sir piped the voice im not one who can box the compass and theres no one else awake as yet hornblower snorted with annoyance at being kept in ignorance of this vital information and without a thought reached to fling off the bedclothes so as to get up and find out for himself but there was maria clasping him and he knew that he could not leap out of bed in such a cavalier fashion he had to go through the proper ritual and put up with the delay he turned and kissed her and she returned his kisses eagerly and yet differently from on other occasions he felt something wet on his cheek it was a tear but there was only that one single tear as maria forced herself to exert self control his rather perfunctory embrace changed in character darling were being parted whispered maria darling i know you must go but but i cant think how im going to live without you youre my whole life youre a great gust of tenderness welled up in hornblowers breast and there was compunction too a pricking of conscience not the most perfect man on earth could merit this devotion if maria knew the truth about him she would turn away from him her whole world shattered the cruellest thing he could do would be to let her find him out he must never do that yet the thought of being loved so dearly set flowing deeper and deeper wells of tenderness in his breast and he kissed her cheeks and sought out the soft eager lips then the soft lips hardened withdrew no angel darling no i mustnt keep you you would be angry with me afterwards oh my dear life say goodbye to me now say that you love me say that youll always love me then say goodbye and say that youll think of me sometimes as i shall always think of you hornblower said the words the right words and in his tenderness he used the right tone maria kissed him once more and then tore herself free and flung herself on to the far side of the bed face downward hornblower lay still trying to harden his heart to rise and maria spoke again her voice was half muffled by the pillow but her forced change of mood was apparent even so your clean shirts on the chair dear and your secondbest shoes are beside the fireplace hornblower flung himself out of bed and out through the curtains the air of the bedroom was certainly fresher than that inside the door latch choked again and he had just time to whip his bedgown in front of him as the old chambermaid put her head in she let out a high cackle of mirth at hornblowers modesty the ostler says light airs from the suthard sir thank you the door closed behind her is that what you want darling asked maria still behind the curtains light airs from the suthard that means south does it not yes it may serve said hornblower hurrying over to the wash basin and adjusting the candles so as to illuminate his face light airs from the south now at the end of march were hardly likely to endure they might back or they might veer but would certainly strengthen with the coming of day if hotspur handled as well as he believed she would he could weather the foreland and be ready for the next development with plenty of sea room but of course as always in the navy he could not afford to waste any time the razor was rasping over his cheeks and as he peered into the mirror he was vaguely conscious of marias reflection behind his own as she moved about the room dressing herself he poured cold water into the basin with which to wash himself and felt refreshed turning away with his usual rapidity of movement to put on his shirt oh you dress so fast said maria in consternation hornblower heard her shoes clacking on the oaken floor she was hurriedly putting on a fresh mob cap over her hair and clearly she was dressing as quickly as she could even at the cost of some informality i must run down to see that your breakfast is ready she said and was gone before he could protest he folded his neckcloth carefully but with practiced fingers and slipped on his coat glanced at his watch put it in his pocket and then put on his shoes he rolled his toilet things into his housewife and tied the tapes yesterdays shirt and his nightshirt and bedgown he stuffed in the canvas bag that awaited them and the housewife on top a glance round the room told him that he had omitted nothing although he had to look more carefully than usual because there were articles belonging to maria scattered here and there bubbling with excitement he opened the window curtains and glanced outside no sign of dawn as yet bag in hand he went downstairs and into the coffeeroom this smelt of stale living and was dimly lit by an oil lamp dangling from the ceiling maria looked in at him from the farther door heres your place dear she said only a moment before breakfast she held the back of the chair for him to be seated ill sit down after you said hornblower it went against the grain to have maria waiting on him oh no said maria i have your breakfast to attend to only the old woman is up as yet she coaxed him into the chair hornblower felt her kiss the top of his head felt a momentary touch of her cheek against his but before he could seize her reaching behind him she was gone she left behind her the memory of something between a sniff and a sob the opening of the door into the kitchen admitted a smell of cooking the sizzling of something in a pan and a momentary burst of conversation between maria and the old woman then in came maria her rapid steps indicating that the plate she held was too hot to be comfortable she dropped it in front of him a vast rump steak still sizzling on the plate there dear she said and busied herself with putting the rest of the meal within his reach while hornblower looked down at the steak with some dismay i picked that out for you specially yesterday she announced proudly i walked over to butchers while you were on the ship hornblower steeled himself not to wince at hearing a naval officers wife speak about being on a ship he also had to steel himself to having steak for breakfast when steak was by no means his favourite dish and when he was so excited that he felt he could eat nothing and dimly he could foresee a future if ever he returned if ever inconceivably he settled down in domestic life when steak would be put before him on any special occasion that thought was the last straw he felt he could not eat a mouthful and yet he could not hurt marias feelings wheres yours he asked temporizing oh i shant be having any steak replied maria the tone of her voice proved that it was quite inconceivable to her that a wife should eat equally well as her husband hornblower raised his voice and turned his head hey there he called in the kitchen bring another plate a hot one oh no darling said maria all fluttered but hornblower was by now out of his chair and seating her at her own place now sit there said hornblower no more words ill have no mutineers in my family ah here came the other plate hornblower cut the steak in two and helped maria to the larger half but darling i said ill have no truck with mutiny growled hornblower parodying his own quarterdeck rasp oh horry darling youre good to me far too good to me momentarily maria clapped hands and handkerchief to her face and hornblower feared she would break down finally but then she put her hands in her lap and straightened her back controlling her emotions in an act of the purest heroism hornblower felt his heart go out to her he reached out and pressed the hand she gladly proffered him now let me see you eat a hearty breakfast he said he was still using his mockbullying tone but the tenderness he felt was still evident maria took up her knife and fork and hornblower did the same he forced himself to eat a few mouthfuls and so mangled the rest of his steak that it did not appear as if he had left too much he took a pull at his pot of beer he did not like drinking beer for breakfast not even beer as small as this but he realized that the old woman could not be expected to have access to the teacaddy a rattling at the window attracted their attention the ostler was opening the shutters and they could dimly see his face for a moment but it was still quite dark outside hornblower looked at his watch ten minutes to five and he had ordered his boat to be at the sally port at five maria saw the gesture and looked over at him there was a slight trembling of her lips a slight moisture in her eyes but she kept herself under control ill get my cloak she said quietly and fled from the room she was back in no time her grey cloak round her and her face shadowed in her hood in her arms was hornblowers heavy coat youre leaving us now sir piped the old woman coming into the coffeeroom yes madam will settle the score when she returns said hornblower he fumbled out half a crown from his pocket and put it on the table thank you kindly sir and a good voyage and prize money galore the singsong tone reminded hornblower that she must have seen naval officers by the hundreds leaving the george to go to sea her memories must go back to hawke and boscawen he buttoned up his coat and took up his bag ill have the ostler come with us with a lantern to escort you back he said consideringly oh no please darling its so short a way and i know every step pleaded maria and there was enough truth in what she said for him not to insist they walked out into the keen cold air having to adjust their eyes to the darkness even after the miserable light of the coffeeroom hornblower realized that if he had been an admiral or even a distinguished captain he would never have been allowed to leave with so little ceremony the innkeeper and his wife would certainly have risen and dressed to see him on his way they turned the corner and started on the steep slope down to the sally port and it was borne in anew on hornblower that he was about to start out for the wars his concern for maria had actually distracted him from this thought but now he found himself gulping with excitement dear said maria i have a little present for you she was bringing something out from the pocket of her cloak and pressing it into his hand its only gloves dear but my love comes with them she brunt on i could make nothing better for you in this little time i would have liked to have embroidered something for you i would have liked to give you something worthy of you but i have been stitching at these every moment since since she could not go on but once more she straightened her back and refused to break down ill be able to think of you every moment i wear them said hornblower he struggled into the gloves despite the handicap of the bag he was carrying they were splendid thick woollen gloves each with separate thumb and forefinger they fit me to perfection i thank you for the kind thought dear now they were at the head of the steep slope down the hard and this horrible ordeal would soon be over you have the seventeen pounds safely asked hornblower an unnecessary question yes thank you dearest i fear it is too much and youll be able to draw my monthly half pay went on hornblower harshly to keep the emotion from his voice and then realizing how harshly he continued it is time to say goodbye now darling he had forced himself to use that unaccustomed last word the water level was far up the hard that meant as he had known when he had given the orders that the tide was at the flood he would be able to take advantage of the ebb darling said maria turning to him and lifting up her face to him in its hood he kissed her down at the waters edge there was the familiar rattle of oars on thwarts and the sound of male voices as his boats crew perceived the two shadowy figures on the hard maria heard those sounds as clearly as hornblower did and she quickly snatched away from him the cold lips she had raised to his goodbye my angel there was nothing else to say now nothing else to do this was the end of this brief experience he turned his back on maria he turned his back on peace and on civilian married life and walked down towards war chapter slack water now sir announced bush first of the ebb in ten minutes and anchors hove short sir thank you mr bush there was enough grey light in the sky now to see bushs face as something more definite than a blur at bushs shoulder stood prowse the actingmaster senior masters mate with an actingwarrant he was competing unobtrusively with bush for hornblowers attention prowse was charged by admiralty instructions with navigating and conducting the ship from port to port under the direction of the captain but there was no reason at all why hornblower should not give his other officers every opportunity to exercise their skill on the contrary and it was possible even likely that prowse with thirty years of sea duty behind him would endeavour to take the direction of the ship out of the hands of a young and inexperienced captain mr bush said hornblower get the ship under way if you please set a course to weather the foreland aye aye sir hornblower watched bush keenly while doing his best not to appear to be doing so bush took a final glance round him gauging the gentle wind and the likely course of the ebb stand by there at the capstan he ordered loose the headsls hands aloft to loose the topsls hornblower could see in a flash that he could place implicit reliance on bushs seamanship he knew he should never have doubted it but his memories were two years old and might have been blurred by the passage of time bush gave his orders in a welltimed sequence with the anchor broken out hotspur gathered momentary sternway with the wheel hard over and the forecastle hands drawing at the headsail sheets she brought her head round bush sheeted home and ordered hands to the braces in the sweetest possible way hotspur caught the gentle wind lying over hardly more than a degree or two in a moment she was under way slipping forward through the water rudder balanced against sailpressure a living lovely thing there was no need to drop any word of commendation to bush regarding such a simple operation as getting under way hornblower could savour the pleasure of being afloat as the hands raced to set the topgallant sails and then the courses then suddenly he remembered let me have that glass please mr prowse he put the massive telescope to his eye and trained it out over the port quarter it was still not yet full daylight and there was the usual hint of haze and hotspur had left her anchorage half a mile or more astern yet he could just see it a solitary lonely speck of grey on the waters edge over there on the hard perhaps just possibly there was a flicker of white maria might be waving her handkerchief but he could not be sure in fact he thought not there was just the solitary grey speck hornblower looked again and then he made himself lower the telescope it was heavy and his hands were trembling a trifle so that the image was blurred it was the first time in all his life that he had put to sea leaving behind him someone who was interested in his fate thank you mr prowse he said harshly handing back the telescope he knew he had to think about something different that he must quickly find something else to occupy his thoughts fortunately as captain of a ship just setting sail there was no lack of subjects now mr prowse he said glancing at the wake and at the trim of the sails the winds holding steady at the moment i want a course for ushant ushant sir prowse had a long lugubrious face like a mules and he stood there digesting this piece of information without any change of expression you heard what i said snapped hornblower in sudden irritation yes sir answered prowse hastily ushant sir aye aye sir there was of course some excuse for his first reaction nobody in the ship save hornblower knew the content of the orders which were taking hotspur to sea nobody knew to what point in the whole world she was destined to sail the mention of ushant narrowed down the field to some extent at least the north sea and the baltic were ruled out so were ireland and the irish sea and the st lawrence across the atlantic but it still might be the west indies or the cape of good hope or the mediterranean ushant was a point of departure for all those mr bush said hornblower sir you may dismiss the watch below and send the hands to breakfast when you think proper aye aye sir whos the officer of the watch cargill sir he has charge of the deck then hornblower looked about him everything was in order and hotspur was standing out for the channel but there was something odd something different something unusual then it dawned upon him for the first time in his life he was going to sea in time of peace he had served ten years as a naval officer without this experience always before whenever his ship emerged from harbour she was in instant danger additional to the hazards of the sea in every previous voyage any moment might bring an enemy up over the horizon at an hours notice ship and ships company might be fighting for their lives and the most dangerous time of all was when first putting to sea with a raw crew with drill and organization incomplete it was a likely moment to meet an enemy as well as the most inconvenient one now here they were putting to sea without any of these worries it was an extraordinary sensation something new something new like leaving maria behind he tried to shake that thought from him as a buoy slithered past the starboard quarter he tried to leave the thought with it it was a relief to see prowse approaching again with a piece of paper in his hand as he glanced up to the commission pendant and then out to the horizon in an attempt to forecast the weather course is souwest by west half west sir he said when we tack we may just be able to make that good closehauled thank you mr prowse you may mark it on the board aye aye sir prowse was pleased at this mark of confidence he naturally had no idea that hornblower revolving in his mind yesterday afternoon all the responsibilities he would be carrying on the morrow had made the same calculation to reach the same result the green hills of the isle of wight were momentarily touched by a watery and level sun theres the buoy sir said prowse thank you mr cargill tack the ship if you please aye aye sir hornblower withdrew aft he wanted not merely to observe how cargill handled the ship but also how hotspur behaved when war should come it was not a mere possibility but a definite probability that success or failure freedom or captivity might hinge on how hotspur went about how handy she was in stays cargill was a man of thirty redfaced and corpulent in advance of his years he was obviously trying hard to forget that he was under the simultaneous scrutiny of the captain the first lieutenant and the sailing master as he applied himself to the manoeuvre he stood beside the wheel looking warily up at the sails and aft at the wake hornblower watched cargills right hand down by his thigh opening and shutting that might be a symptom of nervousness or a mere habitual gesture of calculation the watch on deck were all at their stations so far the men were all unknown faces to hornblower it would be profitable to devote some of his attention to the study of their reactions as well cargill obviously braced himself for action and then gave his preliminary order to the wheel helms alee he bellowed but not a very effective bellow for his voice cracked halfway headsail sheets that was hardly better it would not have served in a gale of wind although it carried forward in present conditions jib and foretopsail began to shiver raise up tacks and sheets hotspur was coming round into the wind rising to an even keel she was coming round coming round now was she going to hang in stays haul mainsl haul this was the crucial moment the hands knew their business the portside bowlines and braces were cast off smartly and the hands tailed on to the starboardside ones round came the yards but the hotspur refused to answer she baulked she hung right in the eye of the wind and then fell off again two points to port with every sail ashiver and every yard of way lost she was in irons helpless until further action should be taken a fine thing if we were on a lee shore sir growled bush wait said hornblower cargill was glancing round at him for orders and that was disappointing hornblower would have preferred an officer who went stolidly on to retrieve the situation carry on mr cargill the hands were behaving well there was no chatter and they were standing by for further orders cargill was drumming on his right thigh with his fingers but for his own sake he must find his way out of his troubles unaided hornblower saw the fingers clench saw cargill glance ahead and astern as he pulled himself together hotspur was slowly gathering sternway as the wind pushed directly back on the sails cargill took the plunge made the effort a sharp order put the wheel hardaport another order brought the yards ponderously round again hotspur hung reluctant for a moment and then sulkily turned back on the starboard tack and gathered way as cargill in the nick of time sent the wheel spinning back and took a pull on the braces there was no lack of sea room there was no dangerous lee shore to demand instant action and cargill could wait until every sail was drawing fully again and hotspur had plenty of way on her to enable the rudder to bite cargill even had the sense to allow her head to fall off another point so as to give plenty of momentum for his next attempt although hornblower noticed with a slight pang of regret that he hurried it a trifle more than he should have done he should have waited perhaps two more minutes headsail sheets ordered cargill again his fingers started drumming on his thigh once more with the strain of waiting but cargills head was clear enough to give his orders in the correct sequence round came hotspur into the wind again sheets and braces were handled smartly there was a paralysing moment as she baulked again hung as though she was determined once more to miss stays but this time she had a trifle more momentum and in the last possible second a fortunate combination of wind and wave pushed her bows round through the vital final degrees of swing round she came at last full and bye said cargill to the helmsman the relief very evident in his voice fore tack there sheets braces with the operation completed he turned to face the criticism of his superiors there was sweat trickling down his forehead hornblower could feel bush beside him ready to rate him thoroughly bush believed sincerely that everyone was the better for a severe dressingdown in any circumstance and he was usually right but hornblower had been watching hotspurs behaviour closely carry on mr cargill he said and cargill relieved turned away again and bush met hornblowers glance with some slight surprise the ships trimmed too much by the head said hornblower that makes her unhandy in stays it might do so agreed bush doubtfully if the bow gripped the water more firmly than the stern hotspur would act like a weathervane persisting in keeping her bow to the wind well have to try it said hornblower shell never do as she is well have to trim her so that she draws six inches more aft at least that now what is there we can shift aft well began bush in his minds eye he called up a picture of the interior of the hotspur with every cubic foot crammed with stores it had been a herculean feat to prepare her for sea to find room for everything necessary had called for the utmost ingenuity it seemed as if no other arrangement could be possible yet maybe perhaps went on bush and they were instantly deep in a highly technical discussion prowse came up and touched his hat to report that hotspur was just able to make good the course for ushant bush could hardly help but prick up his ears at the mention of the name prowse could hardly help but be drawn into the discussion regarding the alteration in the trim of the ship they had to move aside to make room for the hourly casting of the log the breeze flapped their coats round them here they were at sea the nightmare days and nights of fitting out were over and so were the what was the right word delirious perhaps the delirious days of marriage this was normal life creative life making a living organism out of hotspur working out improvements in material and in personnel bush and prowse were still discussing possible alteration in the ships trim as hornblower came back into his present world theres a vacant port right aft on each side said hornblower a simple solution had presented itself to his mind as so often happened when his thoughts had strayed to other subjects we can bring two of the forward guns aft prowse and bush paused while they considered the matter hornblowers rapid mind was already dealing with the mathematics of it the ships ninepounders weighed twentysix hundredweight each along with the gun carriages and the ready use shot which would have to be brought aft too there would be a total transfer of four tons hornblowers eye measured the distances forward and aft of the centre of flotation from forty feet before to thirty feet abaft no the leverage would be a little excessive even though hotspurs dead weight was over four hundred tons maybe shed gripe a little sir suggested prowse reaching the same conclusions two minutes later yes well take the no guns that should be exactly right and leave a gap sir asked bush in faint protest it certainly would as conspicuous as a missing front tooth it would break into the two ordered rows of cannon conveying a makeshift appearance to the ship id rather have an ugly ship afloat said hornblower than a goodlooking one on the rocks of a lee shore yes sir said bush swallowing this nearheresy as the stores are consumed we can put things to rights again added hornblower soothingly perhaps youll be good enough to attend to it now aye aye sir bush turned his mind to the practical aspects of the problem of shifting cannon in a moving ship ill hoist em out of the carriages with the stay tackle and lower them on to a mat quite right im sure you can deal with it mr bush no one in his senses would try to move a gun in its carriage along a heeling deck it would go surging about out of control in a moment but out of its carriage lying helpless on a mat with its trunnions prohibiting any roll it could be dragged about comparatively easily and hoisted up into its carriage again after that had been moved into its new position bush had already passed the word for mr wise the boatswain to have the staytackles rigged the quarterbill will have to be changed said hornblower incautiously as the thought struck him the guns crews would need to be reallotted aye aye sir said bush his sense of discipline was too acute to allow more than a hint of reproach to be apparent in his tone as first lieutenant it was his business to remember these things without being reminded by his captain hornblower made amends as best he could ill leave it all in your charge then mr bush report to me when the guns are moved aye aye sir hornblower crossed the quarterdeck to go to his cabin passing cargill as he went cargill was keeping an eye on the hands rigging the staytackles the ship will be more handy in stays when those guns are shifted mr cargill said hornblower then youll have another opportunity to show how you can handle her thank you sir replied cargill he had clearly been brooding over his recent failure hornblower walked along to his cabin the moving cogs in the complex machine that was a ship always needed lubrication and it was a captains duty to see that it was provided the sentry at his door came to attention as he passed in he glanced round at the bare necessities there his cot swung from the deckbeams there was a single chair a mirror on the bulkhead with a canvas basin on a frame below it on the opposite bulkhead was clamped his desk with his sea chest beneath it a strip of canvas hanging from the deckbeams served as a wardrobe to screen the clothes hanging within that was all there was no room for anything else but the fact that the cabin was so tiny was an advantage in one way there were no guns mounted in it it was right aft and there would be no necessity when the ship cleared for action to sweep all this away and this was luxury this was affluence this was the most superlative good fortune nine days ago no ten days now he had been a halfpay lieutenant under stoppage of pay because the peace of amiens had resulted in his promotion not being confirmed he had been doubtful where his next meal would be coming from a single night had changed all this he had won fortyfive pounds at a sitting of whist from a group of senior officers one of them a lord of admiralty the king had sent a message to parliament announcing the governments decision to set the navy on a war footing again and he had been appointed commander and given the hotspur to prepare for sea he could be sure now of his next meal even though it would be salt beef and biscuit and not so much as a coincidence but rather as a sequel to all this he had found himself betrothed to maria and committed to an early marriage the fabric of the ship transmitted the sound of one of the ninepounders being dragged aft bush was a fast worker bush had been a halfpay lieutenant too ten days ago and senior to hornblower it was with diffidence that hornblower had asked him if he would care to serve as first lieutenant as the only lieutenant allowed on the establishment of a sloop of war of the hotspur under hornblowers command it had been astonishing and extremely flattering to see the delight in bushs face at the invitation id been hoping youd ask me sir said bush i couldnt really think youd want me as a first lieutenant nobody id like better hornblower had replied at this moment he nearly lost his footing as hotspur heaved up her bows rolled and then cocked up her stern in the typical motion of a ship closehauled she was out now from the lee of the wight meeting the full force of the channel rollers fool that he was he had almost forgotten about this on the one or two occasions during the past ten days when the thought of seasickness had occurred to him he had blithely assumed that he had grown out of that weakness in eighteen months on land he had not thought about it all this morning being too busy now with his first moment of idleness here it came he had lost his sealegs a new roll sent him reeling and he was going to be sick he could feel a cold sweat on his skin and the first wave of nausea rising to his throat there was time for a bitter jest he had just been congratulating himself on knowing where his next meal was coming from but now he could be more certain still about where his last meal was going to then the sickness struck horribly now he lay face downward across his cot he heard the rumble of wheels and cleared his thoughts sufficiently to make the deduction that with the guns brought aft bush was bringing the guncarriages aft as well but he hardly cared his stomach heaved again and he cared even less he could think about nothing but his own misery now what was that someone pounding vigorously on the door and he realized that the pounding had grown up from an earlier gentle tapping that he had ignored what is it he called croaking message from the master sir said an unknown voice from mr prowse he had to hear what it was he dragged himself from his cot and staggered over and dumped himself into his chair hunching his shoulders over his desk so that his face could not be seen come in he called the opening of the door admitted considerably more of the noise that had been more and more insistently making itself heard what is it repeated hornblower hoping that his attitude indicated deep concentration upon the paperwork of the ship message from mr prowse sir said a voice that hornblower could hardly place winds freshening an hauling forward course will have to be altered sir very well ill come aye aye sir he certainly would have to come he stood up holding on to the desk with one hand while he adjusted his clothes with the other he braced himself and then he plunged out on to the quarterdeck he had forgotten all these things he had forgotten how fresh the wind blew at sea how the rigging shrieked in a gust how the deck heaved under unwary feet as the stern rose he was hurried forward struggling vainly to retain his dignity and just managed to fetch up without disaster against the hammock netting prowse came up at once course is souwest by south now sir he said i had to let her fall off a couple of points winds still backing westerly so i see said hornblower he looked at sky and sea making himself think hows the glass hardly fallen at all sir but its going to blow harder before nightfall sir perhaps youre right bush appeared at this moment touching the hat that was now pulled down hard on to his head the guns are shifted aft sir the lashings are bowsed up taut thank you hornblower kept his hands on the hammock netting and his gaze steadily forward so that by not turning either to bush on one side or to prowse on the other the whiteness of his landlubbers face might not be noticed he struggled to picture the chart of the channel that he had studied so carefully yesterday there was the twentyleague gap between the casquets and the start an incorrect decision now might keep them windbound for days inside it we might just weather the start on this course sir prompted prowse unexpected nausea suddenly welled up in hornblower and he moved restlessly as he fought with it he did not want prowse to prompt him and as he swung about he caught sight of cargill standing by the wheel it was still cargills watch that was one more factor to bring hornblower to a decision along with bushs report and prowses prompting no he said well put the ship about aye aye sir said prowse in reluctant agreement hornblower looked towards cargill summoning him with a glance he did not wish to leave the comforting support of the hammock netting mr cargill said hornblower lets see you tack the ship again now that weve altered her trim aye aye sir answered cargill that was the only thing the poor devil could say in any case in reply to a direct order but he was clearly nervous he went back to the wheel and took the speaking trumpet from its beckets the freshening wind made that necessary hands bout ship he called and the order was instantly underlined by the calls of the bosns mates and the bellowings of mr wise the hands ran to their stations cargill stared round at wind and sea hornblower saw him swallow as he nerved himself then he gave the order to the wheel this time it was the fingers of his left hand that drummed upon his thigh for his right was occupied by the speakingtrumpet hotspur rose to an even keel while sheets and braces were being handled she was turning she was turning let go and haul yelled cargill into the speakingtrumpet hornblower felt he would have waited three or four more seconds before giving that order but he knew that he might be wrong not only was seasickness dulling his judgement but standing as he did looking aft he did not have the feel of the ship events proved that cargill did or else was lucky for hotspur came on round without hesitation hardalee snapped cargill to the helmsman and the wheel spun round in a blur of spokes catching hotspur at the moment when she was beginning to fall off a straining group of men hauled out the foretack others tailed on to the bowlines hotspur was on the new tack having handled as sweetly apparently as anyone could ask hornblower walked up to the wheel does she gripe he asked the quartermaster the quartermaster eased off the wheel a couple of spokes squinting up at the leech of the maintopsail and then brought her up to the wind again cant say that she does sir he decided mebbe she does a trifle no sir i cant say that she gripes just a touch of weather helms all she needs now sir thats as it should be said hornblower bush and prowse had not spoken a word and there was no need even for a glance to underline the situation but a word to cargill would not be out of place you can go off watch feeling better pleased with yourself now mr cargill yes sir thank you sir said cargill cargills round red face split into a grin hotspur rose to a wave lay over and hornblower taken by surprise staggered down the deck on to cargills broad chest luckily gargill was a heavyweight and fast of footing he took the shock without staggering otherwise he and his captain might have gone reeling across the deck into the scuppers hornblower felt a burst of shame he had no more sealegs than the merest landlubber his envy of cargill and bush and prowse standing firm and swaying easily with the send of the ship amounted to positive dislike and his stomach was about to betray him again his dignity was in peril and he summoned up all that was left of it turning to bush stifflegged and stiffnecked see that i am called when any alteration of course is necessary if you please mr bush he said aye aye sir the deck was heaving but he knew it was not heaving as much as his distorted mind told him it was he forced himself somehow to walk aft to his cabin twice he had to stop and brace himself and when hotspur rose to a wave he was nearly made to run certainly he had to walk faster than a captain should past the sentry and he fetched up against the door with some little violence it was no comfort in fact it added to his distress to see that the sentry had a bucket on the deck beside him he wrenched open the door hung suspended for a moment as hotspur completed her pitch with her stern in the air and then crashed down groaning on to his cot his feet dragging on the deck as the cot swung chapter hornblower sat at his desk in his cabin holding a package in his hand five minutes earlier he had unlocked his chest and taken this out in five minutes more he would be entitled to open it at least that was what his dead reckoning indicated it was a remarkably heavy package it might be weighted with shot or scrap metal except that admiral cornwallis was hardly likely to send shot or scrap metal to one of his captains it was heavily sealed in four places and the seals were unbroken inked upon the canvas wrapper was the superscription instructions for horatio hornblower esq master and commander hm sloop hotspur to be opened on passing the sixth degree of longitude west of greenwich sealed orders hornblower had heard about such things all his professional life but this was his first contact with them they had been sent on board the hotspur on the afternoon of his wedding day and he had signed for them now the ship was about to cross the sixth meridian she had come downchannel with remarkable ease there had been only one single watch when she had not been able to make good her direct course putting her about in order to restore cargills selfconfidence had been extraordinarily fortunate the wind had hardly backed westerly at all and only momentarily even then hotspur had escaped being embayed in lyme bay she had neatly weathered the casquets and it all stemmed from that fortunate order hornblower was aware that prowse was feeling a new respect for him as a navigator and a weather prophet that was all to the good and hornblower had no intention of allowing prowse to guess that the excellent passage was the result of a fortunate fluke of a coincidence of circumstances hornblower looked at his watch and raised his voice in a shout to the sentry at the door pass the word for mr bush hornblower could hear the sentry shouting and the word being passed on along the quarterdeck hotspur rose in a long long pitch with hardly any roll about it she was meeting the long atlantic swell now changing her motion considerably and all for the better in hornblowers opinion and his seasickness was rapidly coming under control bush was taking a long time to respond to the call he obviously was not on the quarterdeck and the chances were he was taking a nap or was engaged in some other private business well it would do him no harm and cause him no surprise to be summoned from it for that was the way of the navy at last came the knock on the door and bush entered sir ah mr bush said hornblower pedantically bush was the closest friend he had but this was a formal matter to be carried through formally can you tell me the ships position at this moment no sir not exactly sir replied the puzzled bush ushant bears ten leagues to the eastard i believe sir at this moment said hornblower we are in longitude six degrees and some seconds west latitude ѓ but we do not have to devote any thought to our latitude at present oddly enough it is our longitude that matters would you be so kind as to examine this packet ah i see sir said bush having read the superscription you observe that the seals are unbroken yes sir then perhaps you will have the further kindness when you leave this cabin to make sure of the ships longitude so that should it become necessary you can bear witness that i have carried out my orders yes sir i will said bush and then after a pause long enough for him to realize that hornblower intended the inter view to be at an end aye aye sir the temptation to tease bush was a very strong one hornblower realized as bush left the cabin it was a temptation he must resist it might be indulged to the extent of causing resentment in any case bush was too easy a target he was a sitting bird and thinking along those lines had actually delayed for several seconds the exciting moment of opening the orders hornblower took out his penknife and cut the stitching now the weight of the packet was explained there were three rolls of coins golden coins hornblower split them out on to his desk there were fifty small ones about the size of sixpences twenty larger ones and ten larger still examination revealed that the mediumsized ones were french twentyfranc pieces exactly like one he had seen in lord parrys possession a week or two ago with napoleon first consul on one side and french republic on the other the small ones were ten franc pieces the larger ones forty francs altogether it made a considerable sum over fifty pounds without allowing for the premium on gold in an england plagued by a depreciating paper currency and here were his supplementary instructions explaining how he should employ the money you are therefore required said the instructions after the preliminary sentences hornblower had to make contact with the fishermen of brest he had to ascertain if any of them would accept bribes he had to glean from them all possible information regarding the french fleet in that port finally he was informed that in case of war information of any kind even newspapers would be acceptable hornblower read his instructions through twice he referred again to the unsealed orders he had received at the same time the ones that had sent him to sea there was need for thought and automatically he rose to his feet only to sit down again for there was no chance whatever of walking about in that cabin he must postpone his walk for a moment maria had stitched neat linen bags in which to put his hair brushes quite useless of course seeing that he always rolled his brushes in his housewife he reached for one and swept the money into it put the bag and the orders back into his chest and was about to lock it when a further thought struck him and he counted out ten tenfranc pieces and put them into his trouser pocket now with his chest locked he was free to go on deck prowse and bush were pacing the weather side of the quarterdeck in deep conversation no doubt the news that their captain had opened his sealed orders would spread rapidly through the ship and no one on board save hornblower could be really sure that hotspur was not about to set course for the cape and india it was a temptation to keep them all on tenterhooks but hornblower put the temptation aside besides it would be to no purpose after a day or two of hanging about outside brest everyone would be able to guess hotspurs mission prowse and bush were hurriedly moving over to the lee side leaving the weather side for their captain but hornblower halted them mr bush mr prowse we are going to look into brest and see what our friend boney is up to those few words told the whole story to men who had served in the last war and who had beaten about in the stormy waters off the brittany coast yes sir said bush simply together they looked into the binnacle out to the horizon up to the commission pendant simple enough to set a course bush and prowse could do that easily but it was not so simple to deal with problems of international relations problems of neutrality problems of espionage lets look at the chart mr prowse you can see that well have to keep well clear of les fillettes the islands of the little girls in the middle of the fairway into brest it was a queer name for rocks that would be sites for batteries of guns very well mr prowse you can square away and set course there were light airs from the northwestward today and it was the easiest matter in the world to stand down towards brest hotspur was hardly rolling at all and was pitching only moderately hornblower was fast recovering his sealegs and could trust himself to walk the deck and could almost trust his stomach to retain its contents there was a certain feeling of wellbeing that came with a remission from seasickness the april air was keen and fresh but not paralysingly cold hornblowers gloves and heavy coat were barely necessary in fact hornblower found it hard to concentrate on his problems he was willing to postpone their consideration and he halted his step and looked across at bush with a smile that brought the latter over with hurried steps i suppose you have plans for exercising the crew mr bush yes sir bush did not say of course sir for he was too good a subordinate but his eyes lit up for there was nothing bush enjoyed more than reefing topsails and unreeling them sending down topgallant yards and sending them up again rousting out cables and carrying them to a stern port in readiness to be used as a spring and in fact rehearsing all the dozens hundreds of manoeuvres that weather or war might make necessary two hours of that will do for today mr bush i can only remember one short exercise at the guns tortured by seasickness while running down the channel he could not be sure only one sir then after dinner well have an hour at the guns one of these days we might use them we might sir said bush bush could face with equanimity the prospects of a war that would engulf the whole world the pipes of the bosns mates called all hands and very soon the exercises were well under way the sweating sailors racing up and down the rigging tailing on to ropes under the urgings of the petty officers and amid a perfect cloud of profanity from mr wise it was as well to drill the men simply to keep them exercised but there were no serious deficiencies to make up hotspur had benefited by being the very first ship to be manned after the press had been put into force of her hundred and fifty hands no fewer than a hundred were prime seamen rated ab she had twenty ordinary seamen and only ten landsmen all told and no more than twenty boys it was an extraordinary proportion one that would never be seen again as the manning of the fleet continued not only than but more than half the men had seen service in men o war before the peace of amiens they were not only seamen but royal navy seamen who had hardly had time to make more than a single voyage in the merchant navy during the peace before being pressed again consequently most of them had had experience with ships guns twenty or thirty of them had actually seen action the result was that when the gun exercise was ordered they went to their stations in businesslike fashion bush turned to hornblower and touched his hat awaiting the next order thank you mr bush order silence if you please the whistles pealed round the deck and the ship fell deathly still i shall now inspect if you will be so kind as to accompany me mr bush aye aye sir hornblower began by glowering down at the starboardside quarterdeck carronade everything was in order there and he walked down into the waist to inspect the starboardside ninepounders at each he stopped to look over the equipment cartridge crowbar handspike sponge quoin he passed on from gun to gun whats your station if the larboard guns are being worked he had picked for questioning the youngest seaman visible who moved uneasily from one foot to another finding himself addressed by the captain stand to attention there bellowed bush whats your station repeated hornblower quietly o over there sir i handle the rammer sir im glad you know if you can remember your station when the captain and the first lieutenant are speaking to you i can trust you to remember it when roundshot are coming in through the side hornblower passed on a captain could always be sure of raising a laugh if he made a joke then he halted again whats this mr cheeseman sir you have an extra powderhorn here there should be only one for every two guns er yessir its because i know the reason a reasons no excuse though mr cheeseman mr orrock what powderhorns have you in your section yes i see shifting no gun aft had deprived orrocks section of a powderhorn and given an additional one to cheesemans its the business of you young gentlemen to see that the guns in your section are properly equipped you dont have to wait for orders cheeseman and orrock were two of the four young gentlemen sent on board from the naval college to be trained as midshipmen hornblower liked nothing he had seen as yet of any of them but they were what he had to use as petty officers and for his own sake he must train them into becoming useful lieutenants his needs corresponded with his duty he must make them and not break them im sure i wont have to speak to you young gentlemen again he said he was sure he would but a promise was better than a threat he walked on completing the inspection of the guns on the starboardside he went up to the forecastle to look at the two carronades there and then back down the maindeck guns of the port side he stopped at the marine stationed at the forehatchway what are your orders the marine stood stiffly at attention feet at an angle of fortyfive degrees musket close in at his side forefinger of the left hand along the seam of his trousers neck rigid in its stock so that as hornblower was not directly in front of him he stared over hornblowers shoulder to guard my post he began and continued in a monotonous singsong repeating by rote the sentrys formula which he had probably uttered a thousand times before the change in his tone was marked when he reached the final sentence added for this particular station to allow no one to go below unless he is carrying an empty cartridge bucket that was so that cowards could not take refuge below the waterline what about men carrying wounded the astonished marine found it hard to answer he found it hard to think after years of drill i have no orders about them sir he said at last actually allowing his eyes though not his neck to move hornblower glanced at bush ill speak to the sergeant of marines sir said bush whos on the quarterbill to attend to the wounded cooper and his mate sir sailmaker and his mate four altogether sir trust bush to have all those details at his fingers ends even though hornblower had found two small points to find fault with for which bush was ultimately responsible no need to stress chose matters with bush he was burning with silent shame down the hatchway to the magazine a candle glimmered faintly through the glass window of the lightroom throwing just enough light for powder boys to see what they were doing as they received loaded cartridges through the double serge curtains opening into the magazine inside the magazine the gunner and his mate wearing list slippers were ready to pass out and if necessary fill cartridges down the after hatchway to where the surgeon and his loblolly boy were ready to deal with the wounded hornblower knew that he himself might at some time be dragged in here with blood streaming from some shattered limb it was a relief to ascend to the maindeck again mr foreman foreman was another of the young gentlemen what are your orders regarding lanterns during a night action i am to wait until mr bush expressly orders them sir and who do you send if you receive those orders firth sir foreman indicated a likelylooking young seaman at his elbow but was there perhaps the slightest moment of hesitation about that reply hornblower turned on firth where do you go firths eyes flickered towards foreman for a moment that might be with embarrassment but foreman swayed a little on his feet as if he were pointing with his shoulder and one hand made a small sweeping gesture in front of his middle as if he might be indicating mr wises abdominal rotundity forard sir said firth the bosn issues them at the break of the focsle very well said hornblower he had no doubt that foreman had quite forgotten to pass on bushs orders regarding battle lanterns but foreman had been quickwitted enough to remedy the situation and firth had not merely been quickwitted but also loyal enough to back up his petty officer it would he well to keep an eye on both those two for various reasons the break of the forecastle had been an inspired guess as being adjacent to the bosns locker hornblower walked up on to the quarterdeck again bush following him and he cast a considering eye about him taking in the last uninspected gun the portside quarterdeck carronade he selected a position where the largest possible number of ears could catch his words mr bush he said we have a fine ship if we work hard well have a fine crew too if boney needs a lesson well give it to him you may continue with the exercises aye aye sir the six marines on the quarterdeck the helmsman the carronades crews mr prowse and the rest of the afterguard had all heard him he had felt it was not the time for a formal speech but he could be sure his words would be relayed round the ship during the next dog watch and he had chosen them carefully that we was meant as a rallying call meanwhile bush was continuing with the exercise cast loose your guns level your guns take out your tompions and all the rest of it well have them in shape soon enough sir said bush then well only have to get alongside the enemy not necessarily alongside mr bush when we come to burn powder at the next exercise i want the men schooled in firing at long range yes sir of course agreed bush but that was lipservice only on bushs part he had not really thought about the handling of hotspur in battle close action where the guns could not miss and only needed to be loaded and fired as rapidly as possible was bushs ideal very well for a ship of the line in a fleet action but perhaps not so suitable for hotspur she was only a sloop of war her timbers and her scantlings more fragile even than those of a frigate her twenty ninepounders that gave her rate the four carronades not being counted were long guns better adapted for work at a couple of cables lengths than for close action when the enemys guns stood no more chance of missing than hers did she was the smallest thing with three masts and quarterdeck and forecastle in the navy list the odds were heavy that any enemy she might meet would be her superior in size in weight of metal in number of men probably immeasurably her superior dash and courage might snatch a victory for her but skill and forethought and good handling might be more certain hornblower felt the tremor of action course through him accentuated by the vibrating rumble of the guns being run out land ho land ho yelled the lookout of the foretopmast head land one point on the lee bow that would be france ushant the scene of their future exploits perhaps where they would meet with disaster or death naturally there was a wave of excitement through the ship heads were raised and faces turned sponge your guns bellowed bush through his speakingtrumpet bush could be relied on to maintain discipline and good order through any distraction load it was hard for the men to go through the playacting of gun drill in these circumstances discipline on the one side resentment disillusionment on the other point your guns mr cheeseman the handspike man on no gun isnt attending to his duty i want his name prowse was training a telescope forward as the officer responsible for navigation that was his duty but it was also his privilege run your guns in hornblower itched to follow prowses example but he restrained himself prowse would keep him informed of anything vital he allowed the drill to go on through one more mock broadside before he spoke mr bush you may secure the guns now thank you aye aye sir prowse was offering his telescope thats the lighttower on ushant sir he said hornblower caught a wavering glimpse of the thing a gaunt framework topped by a cresset where the french government in time of peace maintained a light for the benefit of the ships half the worlds trade made a landfall off ushant that needed it thank you mr prowse hornblower visualized the chart again recalled the plans he had made in the intervals of commissioning his ship in the intervals of his honeymoon in the intervals of seasickness during the past crowded days winds drawing westerly but itll be dark before we can make cape matthew well stand to the suthard under easy sail until midnight i want to be a league off the black stones an hour before dawn aye aye sir bush joined them fresh from the business of securing the guns look at that sir theres a fortune passing us by a large ship was hullup to windward her canvas reflecting the weltering sun french indiaman commented hornblower turning his glass on her a quarter of a million pounds all told raved bush maybe a hundred thousand for you sir if only war were declared doesnt that tease you sir shell carry this wind all the way to havre and shell be safe therell be others replied hornblower soothingly not so many sir trust boney hell send warnings out the moment hes resolved on war and every french flagll take refuge in neutral ports madeira and the azores cadiz and ferrol while we could make our fortunes the possibilities of prize money bulked large in the thoughts of every naval officer maybe we will said hornblower he thought of maria and his allotment of pay even a few hundreds of pounds would make a huge difference maybe sir said bush clearly discounting the possibility and theres another side to the picture added hornblower pointing round the horizon there were half a dozen other sails all visible at this time all british they marked the enormous extent of british maritime commerce they bore the wealth that could support navies sustain allies maintain manufactories of arms to say nothing of the fact that they provided the basic training for seamen who later would man the ships of war which kept the seas open for them and closed them to englands enemies theyre only british sir said prowse wonderingly he had not the vision to see what hornblower saw bush had to look hard at his captain before it dawned upon him the heaving of the log with the changing of the watch relieved hornblower of the temptation to preach a sermon whats the speed mr young three knots and a half sir thank you hornblower turned back to prowse keep her on her present course aye aye sir hornblower was training his telescope out over the port bow there was a black dot rising and falling out there towards molene island he kept it under observation i think mr prowse he said his glass still at his eye we might edge in a little more inshore say two points id like to pass that fishingboat close aye aye sir she was one of the small craft employed in the pilchard fishery very similar to those seen off the cornish coast she was engaged at the moment in hauling in her seine as hotspur approached more closely the telescope made plain the rhythmical movements of the four men up with the helm a little more mr prowse if you please id like to pass her closer still now hornblower could make out a little area of water beside the fishingboat that was of a totally different colour it had a metallic sheen quite unlike the rest of the grey sea the fishingboat had found a shoal of pilchards and her seine was now closing in on it mr bush please try to read her name they were fast closing on her within a few moments bush could make out the bold white letters on her stern from brest sir dukes freers with that prompting hornblower could read the name for himself the deux frres brest back the maintopsl mr young bellowed hornblower to the officer of the watch and then turning back to bush and prowse i want fish for my supper tonight they looked at him in illconcealed surprise pilchards sir thats right the seine was close in alongside the deux frres and masses of silver fish were being heaved up into her so intent were the fishermen on securing their catch that they had no knowledge of the silent approach of the hotspur and looked up in ludicrous astonishment at the lovely vessel towering over them in the sunset they even displayed momentary panic until they obviously realized that in time of peace a british ship of war would do them less harm than a french one might a french one enforcing the inscription maritime hornblower took the speakingtrumpet from its beckets he was pulsing with excitement now and he had to be firm with himself to keep calm this might be the first step in the making of the history of the future besides he had not spoken french for a considerable time and he had to concentrate on what he was going to say good day captain he yelled and the fishermen reassured waved back to him in friendly fashion will you sell me some fish hurriedly they conferred and then one of them replied how much oh twenty pounds again they conferred very well captain went on hornblower searching in his mind not only for the necessary french words but also for an approach to bring about the situation he desired finish your work then come aboard we can drink a glass of rum to the friendship of nations the beginning of that sentence was clumsy he knew but he could not translate get in your catch but the prospect of british navy rum he knew would be alluring and he was a little proud of lamiti des nations what was the french for dinghy chaloupe he fancied he expanded on his invitations and someone in the fishingboat waved in assent before bending to the business of getting in the catch with the last of it on board two of the four men scrambled into the dinghy that lay alongside the deux frres it was nearly as big as the fishingboat itself as was to be expected when she had to lay out the seine two oars stoutly handled brought the dinghy rapidly towards hotspur ill entertain the captain in my cabin said hornblower mr bush see that the other man is taken forward and well looked after see he has a drink aye aye sir a line over the side brought up two big buckets of fish and these were followed by two bluejerseyed men who scrambled up easily enough despite their seaboots a great pleasure captain said hornblower in the waist to greet him please come with me the captain looked curiously about him as he was led up to the quarterdeck and aft to the cabin he sat down cautiously in the only chair while hornblower perched on the cot the blue jersey and trousers were spangled with fish scales the cabin would smell of fish for a week hewitt brought rum and water and hornblower poured two generous glasses the captain sipped appreciatively has your fishing been successful asked hornblower politely he listened while the captain told him in his almost unintelligible breton french about the smallness of the profits to be earned in the pilchard fishery the conversation drifted on it was an easy transition from the pleasure of peace to the possibilities of war two seamen could hardly meet without that prospect being discussed i suppose they make great efforts to man the ships of war the captain shrugged certainly the shrug told much more than the word it marches very slowly i imagine said hornblower and he captain nodded but of course the ships are ready to take the sea hornblower had no idea of how to say laidup in ordinary in french and so he had to ask the question in the opposite sense oh no said the captain he went on to express his contempt for the french naval authorities there was not a single ship of the line ready for service of course not let me refill your glass captain said hornblower i suppose the frigates receive the first supplies of men such supplies as there were perhaps the breton captain was not sure of course there was hornblower had more than a moments difficulty at this point then he understood the frigate loire had been made ready for sea last week for service in far eastern waters but with the usual idiocy of the naval command had now been stripped of most of her trained men to provide nuclei for the other ships the breton captain whose capacity for rum was quite startling did nothing to conceal either the smouldering breton resentment against the atheist regime now ruling france or the contempt of a professional user of the sea for the blundering policies of the republican navy hornblower had only to nurse his glass and listen his faculties at full stretch to catch all the implications of a conversation in a foreign language when at last the captain rose to say goodbye there was a good deal of truth in what hornblower said haltingly about his regrets at the termination of the visit yet perhaps even if war should come captain we may still meet again as i expect you know the royal navy of great britain does not make war on fishing vessels i shall always be glad to buy some of your catch the frenchman was looking at him keenly now perhaps because the subject of payment was arising this was a most important moment calling for accurate judgement how much what to say of course i must pay for todays supply said hornblower his hand in his pocket he took out two tenfranc pieces and dropped them into the horny palm and the captain could not restrain an expression of astonishment from appearing in his weatherbeaten face astonishment followed instantly by avarice and then by suspicion calculation and finally by decision as the hand clenched and hurried the money into a trouserpocket those emotions had played over the captains face like the colours of a dying dolphin twenty francs in gold for a couple of buckets of pilchards most likely the captain supported himself his wife and children for a week on twenty francs ten francs would be a weeks wage for his hands this was important money either the british captain did not know the value of gold or at least there was the indubitable fact that the french captain was twenty francs richer and there was at least the possibility of more gold where this came from i hope we shall meet again captain said hornblower as of course you understand out here at sea we are always glad to have news of what is happening on land the two bretons went over the side with their two empty buckets leaving bush ruefully contemplating the mess left on the deck that can be swabbed up mr bush said hornblower it will be a good ending to a good day chapter the cabin was quite dark when hornblower awoke there was not even the glimmering of light through the two stern windows he lay curled on his side only half conscious and then a single sharp note from the ships bell recalled him to the world and he turned over on his back and stretched himself half fretfully and half luxuriously trying to put his thoughts into order that must be one bell in the morning watch because one bell in the middle watch had sounded as he was getting back into bed after being roused when the ship was put about at midnight he had had six hours of sleep even after making allowance for that break there were great advantages about being in command of a ship the watch which had retired to bed at that time had been up on deck again for half an hour already the cot on which he lay was swaying easily and slowly hotspur must be under very easy sail indeed and as far as he could judge with a moderate wind on the starboard beam that was as it should be he would soon have to get up he turned on to his other side and went to sleep again two bells sir said grimes entering the cabin with a lighted lamp two bells sir bit of haze and mr prowse says hed like to go about on the other tack grimes was a weedy young seaman who affirmed that he had acted as captains steward in a west india packet get me my coat said hornblower it was cold in the misty dawn with only a greatcoat on over his nightshirt hornblower found marias gloves in a pocket and pulled them on gratefully twelve fathoms sir reported prowse as the ship steadied on her new course with the lead going in the forechains very well there was time to dress there was time to have breakfast there was time for hornblower felt a wave of temptation breaking round him he wanted a cup of coffee he wanted two or three cups of coffee strong and scalding hot yet he had on board no more than two pounds of coffee at seventeen shillings a pound that was all he had been able to afford to buy the miraculous fortyfive pounds had melted away which he had won at whist the night before the appearance of the kings message regarding the fleet there had been his seagoing clothing and his sword to get out of pawn his cabin furniture to buy and he had had to leave seventeen pounds with maria for her support until she could draw his allotment of pay so there had been little enough left over for captains stores he had not bought a sheep or a pig not a single chicken mrs mason had bought six dozen eggs for him they were packed in shavings in a tub lashed to the deck in the chart room and six pounds of heavily salted butter there was a loaf of sugar and some pots of jam and then the money had run out he had no bacon no potted meat he had dined yesterday on pilchards the fact that they had been bought with secret service money was some kind of sauce for them but pilchards were unattractive fish and of course there was the absurd prejudice of seamen regarding fish creatures from their own element they hated having their eternal round of salt beef and pork interrupted by a meal of fish allowance must be made of course for the fact that the cooking of fish left behind a lingering scent hard to eradicate from utensils sketchily washed in seawater at this very moment in the growing dawn one of the lambs netted down in the boat chocked in the waist emitted a lingering baaaaa as it woke the wardroom officers had invested in four of the creatures while the hotspur was commissioning and any day now they would be dining on roast lamb hornblower determined to get himself invited to dinner in the wardroom that day the thought reminded him that he was hungry but that was quite minor compared with his yearning for coffee wheres my servant he suddenly roared grimes grimes sir grimes put his head round the chartroom door im going to dress and ill want my breakfast ill have coffee coffee sir yes hornblower bit off the damn you he nearly added to swear at a man who could not swear back and whose only offence lay in being unoffending was not to his taste just as some men could not shoot foxes you dont know anything about coffee no sir get the oak box and bring it in to me hornblower explained about coffee to grimes while working up a lather with a quarter of a pint of freshwater count out twenty of those beans put them in an open jar get that from the cook then you toast em over the galley fire and be careful with em keep shaking em theyve got to be brown not black toasted not burnt understand well yes sir then you take em to the surgeon with my compliments the surgeon yes sir grimes seeing hornblowers brows come together like thunderclouds had the sense to suppress in the nick of time his astonishment at the entry of the surgeons name into this conversation he has a pestle and mortar to pound his jalap with you pound those beans in that mortar you break em up small small mark you but you dont make dust of em like large grain gunpowder not mealed gunpowder understand yes sir i suppose so sir next you oh go and get that done and then report to me again grimes was clearly not a man to do things quickly hornblower had shaved and dressed and was pacing the quarterdeck raging for his breakfast before grimes appeared again with a panful of dubious powder hornblower gave him brief instructions on how to make coffee with it and grimes listened doubtfully go and get it done oh and grimes sir ill have two eggs fried can you fry eggs er yes sir fry em so the yolks nearly hard but not quite and get out a crock of butter and a crock off jam hornblower was throwing discretion to the winds he was determined on a good breakfast and those winds to which he had thrown discretion suddenly asserted themselves with hardly a warning puff there was a sudden gust which almost took hotspur aback and with it while hotspur paid off and recovered herself there came driving rain an april shower icy cold hornblower shook off grimes the first time he appeared to report that breakfast was ready and only went off with him on his second appearance after hotspur was steady on her course again with the weather clearing and daylight growing there was little time he could spare ill be on deck again in ten minutes mr young he said the chartroom was a minute compartment beside his cabin cabin chartroom and the captains pantry and head occupied the whole space of the hotspurs tiny poop hornblower squeezed himself into the chair at the little table sir said grimes you didnt come when breakfast was ready here were the eggs the rim of the whites was black the yolks were obviously hard very well growled hornblower he could not blame grimes for that coffee sir said grimes with the chartroom door shut he was wedged against it hardly able to move he poured from a jug into a cup and hornblower sipped it was only just hot enough to drink which meant that it was not hot enough and it was muddy see that its hotter than this another time said hornblower and youll have to strain it better than this yes sir grimes voice seemed to come from a great distance the man could hardly whisper sir hornblower looked up at him grimes was cold with fright what is it i kept these to show you sir grimes produced a pan containing a bloody and stinking mess the first two eggs was bad sir i didnt want you to think very well grimes was afraid in case he should be accused of stealing them take the damned things away now was it not exactly like mrs mason to buy eggs for him of which half were bad hornblower ate his unpleasant eggs even these two although not exactly bad were flavoured while reconciling himself with the prospect of making up for it all with the jam he spread a biscuit with the precious butter and here was the jam blackcurrant of all the misguided purchases grimes squeezing back into the chartroom positively jumped as hornblower let out the oath that had been seeking an outlet for several minutes sir im not speaking to you damn you said hornblower his restraint at an end hornblower was fond of jam but of all the possible varieties he liked blackcurrant least it was a poor last best well it would have to do he bit at the ironhard biscuit dont knock at the door when youre serving a meal he said to grimes no sir i wont sir not any more sir grimess hand holding the coffeepot was shaking and when hornblower looked up he could see that his lips were trembling too he was about to ask sharply what was the matter but he suppressed the question as the answer became apparent to him it was physical fear that was affecting grimes a word from hornblower could have grimes bound to a grating at the gangway there to have the flesh flogged from the bones of his writhing body there were captains in the navy who would give just that order when served with such a breakfast there would never be a time when more things went wrong than this there was a knocking at the door come in grimes shrank against the bulkhead to avoid falling out through the door as it opened message from mr young sir said orrock winds veering again ill come said hornblower grimes cowered against the bulkhead as he pushed his way out hornblower emerged on to the quarterdeck six dozen eggs and half of them bad two pounds of coffee far less than a months supply if he drank coffee every day blackcurrant jam and not much even of that those were the thoughts coursing through his mind as he walked past the sentry and then they were expunged by the blessed air from the sea and the instant approach of professional problems prowse was peering out to port through his telescope it was almost full daylight and the haze had dissipated with the rain black stones broad on the portbeam sir reported prowse you can see the breakers sometimes excellent said hornblower at least his breakfast troubles had kept him from fretting during these final minutes before entering on to a decisive day in fact he had actually to pause for several seconds to collect his thoughts before issuing the orders that would develop the plans already matured in his fevered mind do you have good eyesight mr orrock well sir have you or havent you well yes sir then take a glass and get aloft see what you can see of the shipping as we pass the entrance to the roadstead consult with the lookout aye aye sir good morning mr bush call the hands aye aye sir not for the first time hornblower was reminded of the centurion in the new testament who illustrated his authority by saying i say to one come and he cometh and to another go and he goeth the royal navy and the roman army were identical in discipline now mr prowse how far is the horizon now two miles sir perhaps three miles answered prowse looking round and collecting his thoughts after being taken by surprise by the question four miles i should think said hornblower maybe sir admitted prowse suns rising airs clearing itll be ten miles soon winds north of west well go down to the parquette aye aye sir mr bush get the topgallants in if you please and the courses topsls and jibs all we need aye aye sir that way they would attract less notice also they would by moving more slowly have longer for observation as they crossed the passage that led into brest sunset on a clear day said hornblower to prowse would be a better moment then we could look in with the sun behind us yes sir youre right sir answered prowse there was a gleam of appreciation in his melancholy face as he said this he knew of course that the goulet lay almost east and west but he had not made any deductions or plans on that basis but were here we have this chance wind and weather serve us now it may be days before we have another opportunity yes sir said prowse course east by south mr prowse aye aye sir hotspur crept along the day was cloudy but clear and the horizon was extending every minute there was the mainland of france pointe st mathieu point matthew in plain view from there the land trended away out of sight again land on the lee bow yelled orrock from the foretopmasthead thatll he the other headland sir said prowse toulinguet agreed hornblower and then he corrected his pronunciation of toolingwette for months or years to come he might be beating about this coast and he wanted no chance of misunderstanding with any of his officers when he gave orders between those two headlands the atlantic broke in through the wild breton coast and reached deep inland to form the roadstead of brest can you make out the channel yet mr orrock yelled hornblower not yet sir at least not very well a ship of war a kings ship approaching a foreign coast was under a handicap on this sort of mission in peacetime she could not enter into foreign territorial waters without permission previously asked and obtained she certainly could not trespass within the limits of a foreign naval base without occasioning a series of angry notes between the respective governments we must keep out of long cannon shot of the shore said hornblower yes sir oh yes of course sir agreed prowse the second more hearty agreement was called forth when prowse realized the implications of what hornblower was saying nations asserted sovereignty over all the waters that could he dominated by their artillery even if there was no cannon mounted at any particular point in fact international law was hardening into a convention fixing an arbitrary limit of three miles deck yelled orrock i can see masts now can just see em count all you can see very carefully mr orrock orrock went on with his report he had an experienced sailor beside him at the masthead but hornblower listening had no intention of trusting entirely to their observation and bush was fuming with impatience mr bush said hornblower ill be wearing ship in fifteen minutes would you be so kind as to take a glass to the mizzen topmasthead youll have a good chance of seeing all that orrocks seeing please take notes aye aye sir said bush he was at the mizzen shrouds in a moment soon he was running up the ratlines at a speed that would have been a credit to any young seaman that makes twelve of the line sir yelled orrock no topmasts hoisted no yards crossed the seaman beside him interrupted his report breakers on the lee bow thats the parquette said hornblower the black stones on the one side the parquette on the other and farther up the little girls in the middle marked off the passage into brest on a clear day like this with a gentle wind they were no menace but lives by the hundred had been lost on them during storms prowse was pacing restlessly back and forward to the binnacle taking bearings hornblower was carefully gauging the direction of the wind if the french squadron had no ship of the line ready for sea there was no need to take risks a shift in the wind might soon find hotspur embayed on a lee shore he swept his glass round the wild coast that had grown up round his horizon very well mr prowse well wear ship now while we can still weather the parquette aye aye sir priowses relief was obvious his business was to keep the ship out of danger and he clearly preferred a wide margin of safety hornblower looked around at the officer of the watch mr poole wear the ship if you please the pipes shrilled and the orders were passed hands went to the braces as the helm was put up while hornblower scanned the shore warily steady as you go hotspur settled sweetly on her new course hornblower was growing intimate with her ways like a bridegroom learning about his bride no that was an unlucky simile to be discarded instantly he hoped that he and hotspur were better suited to each other than he and maria and he must think about something else mr bush mr orrock you will please come down when you are sure you will see nothing more useful the ship was alive with a new atmosphere hornblower was sensitively aware of it as the hands went about their duties everyone on board was conscious that they were bearding boney in his den that they were boldly looking into the principal naval base of france proclaiming the fact that england was ready to meet any challenge at sea high adventure was looming up in the near future hornblower had the gratifying feeling that during these past days he had tempered a weapon ready for his hand ship and ships company ready for any exploit like a swordsman knowing well the weight and balance of his sword before entering upon a duel orrock appeared touching his hat and hornblower listened to his report it was fortunate that bush in the mizzentop still had a view up the goulet and had not descended reports should be made independently each officer out of the hearing of the other but it would have been tactless to ask bush to stand aside bush did not descend for several more minutes he had methodically taken notes with paper and pencil but orrock could hardly be blamed for not having done so the thirteen or fourteen ships of the line at anchor in the roads were none of them ready for sea and three of them were missing at least one mast each there were six frigates three with their topmasts sent up and one with her yards crossed and sails furled that will be the loire commented hornblower to bush you know about her sir asked bush i know shes there answered hornblower he would gladly have explained further but bush was going on with his report and hornblower was content to have something more added to his reputation for omniscience on the other hand there was considerable activity in the roadstead bush had seen lighters and tenders moving about and believed he had identified a sheer hulk a vessel rigged solely for the purpose of putting new masts into large ships thank you mr bush said hornblower that is excellent we must look in like this every day if possible yes sir constant observations would increase their information in geometrical progression ships changing anchorage ships sending up topmasts ships setting up their rigging the changes would be more significant than anything that could be deduced from a single inspection now lets find some more fishing boats went on hornblower yes sir bush trained his glass out towards the parquette whose sullen black rocks crowned by a navigation beacon seemed to rise and fall as the atlantic swell surged round them theres one in the lee of the reef there sir said bush whats he doing there lobster pots sir reported bush getting in his catch i should say sir indeed twice in his life hornblower had eaten lobster both occasions being during those bleak bitter days when under the compulsion of hunger and cold he had acted as a professional gambler in the long rooms wealthy men there had called for supper and had tossed him an invitation it was a shock to realize that it was only a fortnight ago that that horrible period in his life had ended i think said hornblower slowly i should like lobster for my supper tonight mr poole let her edge down a little towards the reef mr bush i would be obliged if you would clear away the quarterboat ready for launching the contrast between these days and those was quite fantastic these were golden april days a strange limbo between peace and war they were busy days during which hornblower had friendly chats with fishing boats captains and dispensed gold pieces in exchange for a small portion of their catch he could drill his crew and he could take advantage of those exercises to learn all he could about the behaviour of the hotspur he could peep up the goulet and measure the preparation of the french fleet for sea he could study this gulf of iroise the approaches to brest in other words with its tides and its currents by observing the traffic there he could obtain an insight into the difficulties of the french naval authorities in brest brittany was a poor province neither productive nor wellpopulated at the extremity of france and by land the communications between brest and the rest of the country were most inferior there were no navigable rivers no canals the enormously ponderous materials to equip a fleet could never be brought to brest by road the artillery for a firstrate weighed two hundred tons guns and anchors and shot could only be brought by sea from the foundries in belgium round to the ships in brest the mainmast of a firstrate was a hundred feet long and three feet thick only ships could transport those in fact only ships specially equipped to man the fleet that lay idle in brest would call for twenty thousand men the seamen what seaman there were would have to march hundreds of miles from the merchant ports of le havre and marseille if they were not sent round by sea twenty thousand men needed food and clothing and highly specialized food and clothing moreover the flour to make biscuit the cattle and pigs and the salt to salt them down and the barrelstaves in which to store them where were they to come from and provisioning was no daytoday handtomouth operation either before going to sea the ships would need rations for a hundred days two million rations to be accumulated over and above daily consumption coasting vessels by the hundred were needed hornblower observed a constant trickle of them heading into brest rounding ushant from the north and the pointe du raz from the south if war should come when war should come it would be the business of the royal navy to cut off this traffic more particularly it would be the business of the light craft to do this it would be hotspurs business the more he knew about all these conditions the better these were the thoughts that occupied hornblowers mind as hotspur stood in once more past the parquette for a fresh look into brest the wind was southeasterly this afternoon and hotspur was running free creeping along under topsails with her lookouts posted at her mastheads in the fresh morning sunshine from foremast and mizzenmast came two successive hails deck theres a ship coming down the channel shes a frigate sir that was bush supplementing cheesemans report very well hailed hornblower in return maybe the appearance of the frigate had nothing to do with his own evolutions in the iroise but the contrary was much more likely he glanced round the ship the hands were engaged in the routine of holystoning the decks but he could effect a transformation in five minutes he could clear for action or he could set all sail at a moments notice steady as you go he growled at the quartermaster mr cargill well hoist our colours if you please there she is sir said prowse the glass showed a frigates topgallant sails she was reaching down the goulet with a fair wind on a course that would intersect hotspurs some miles ahead mr bush id like you on deck if you please as soon as you have completed your observations aye aye sir hotspur stole quietly along there was no purpose in hurriedly setting additional sail and pretending to be innocent the french fleet must have heard from a dozen sources about her continued presence in the approaches youre not going to trust em sir this was from bush back on the quarterdeck and in a state of some anxiety the anxiety was not displayed by any change in bushs imperturbable manner but by the very fact that he volunteered advice in this positive form hornblower did not want to run away he had the weather gauge and in a moment he could set all sail and come to the wind and stand out to sea but he did not want to he could be quite sure that if he were to do so the frigate would follow his example and chase him ignominiously out into the atlantic with his tail between his legs a bold move would stimulate his crew would impress the french and this was the point would subdue his own doubts about himself this was a test his instinct was to be cautious but he told himself that his caution was probably an excuse for cowardice his judgement told him that there was no need for caution his fears told him that the french frigate was planning to lure him within range of her guns and then overwhelm him he must act according to his judgement and he must abhor the counsel of his fears but he wished his heart would not beat so feverishly he wished his palms would not sweat nor his legs experience these pinsandneedles feelings he wished bush were not crowding him at the hammock netting so that he might take a few paces up and down the quarterdeck and then he told himself that he could not possibly at this moment pace up and down and reveal to the world that he was in a state of indecision today coasters had been swarming out of brest taking advantage of their fair wind if war had been declared they would have been doing nothing of the sort he had spoken to three different fishing boats and from none of them had he received a hint of war they might all have been taking part in a conspiracy to lull him into a sense of security but that was most unlikely if news of war had reached brest only an hour ago the frigate could never have prepared herself for sea and come down the goulet in this time and to support his judgement from the other direction was the thought that the french naval authorities even if war was not declared would act in just this way hearing of the audacious british sloop cruising outside they would find men enough for the frigate by stripping other ships of their skeleton crews and would send her out to scare the british ship away he must not be scared away this wind could easily persist for days and if he once ran down to leeward it would be a long time before he could beat back and resume his observation of brest the frigate was hullup now through his glass he could see her down to the waterline she was big there were her painted ports twenty of them a side besides the guns on quarterdeck and forecastle eighteen pounders probably she had not merely twice as many guns as hotspur but would discharge a weight of broadside four times as great but her guns were not run out and then hornblower raised his glass to study her yards he strained his eyes this time he must not only trust his judgement but his eyesight he was sure of what he saw foreyard and foretopsailyard mainyard and maintopsailyard they were not supported by chain slings if the frigate were ready for action they would never have omitted that precaution she could not be planning to fight this could not be an ambush any orders sir asked bush bush would have liked to clear for action to open the ports and run out the guns if anything could precipitate hostilities it would be that and hornblower remembered how his orders from cornwallis both written and oral had stressed the necessity to do nothing that would bring on england the odium of starting a war yes said hornblower in reply to bushs question but the relief that showed instantly in bushs expression changed back into concern as he noted the gleam in hornblowers eyes we must render passing honours mr bush said hornblower there was something madly stimulating in forcing himself to be coldly formal when internally he was boiling with excitement that must be what went on inside one of mr watts steam engines when the safety valve did not function aye aye sir said bush the disciplined answer the only answer when a superior officer spoke do you remember the procedure mr bush never in his life had hornblower rendered honours to a french ship of war through his whole professional career until now sighting had meant fighting yes sir then be so good as to give the orders aye aye sir all hands all hands man the side mr wise see that the men keep order sergeant of marines parade your men on the quarterdeck smartly now drummer on the right bosns mates stand by to pipe on the beat of the drum bush turned to hornblower weve no music sir except the drum and the pipes they wont expect more said hornblower his eye still at his glass one sergeant one corporal twelve privates and a drummer were all the marines allotted to a sloop of war but hornblower was not devoting any further thought to the marines his whole attention was concentrated on the french frigate no doubt on the frenchmans deck a dozen glasses were being trained on the hotspur as the bustle began on the hotspurs deck he could see a corresponding bustle on the frenchmans they were manning the side an enormous crowd of them carried by the water came the noise as four hundred excited frenchmen took up their stations silence ordered bush at that very moment there was a certain strangeness about his voice as he continued because he did not want his words to be overheard in the frenchman and so he was endeavouring to bellow sotto voce show the frogs how a british crew behaves heads up there and keep still blue coats and white breeches these were french soldiers forming up on the frigates quarterdeck hornblowers glass detected the flash of steel as bayonets were fixed and the gleam of brass from the musical instruments the ships were closing steadily on their converging courses with the frigate under her greater canvas drawing ahead of the sloop nearer and nearer hotspur was the visiting ship hornblower put away his telescope now he said drum ordered bush the drummer beat a long roll presentarrums ordered the sergeant of marines and in a much lower voice one two three the muskets of the marines and the halfpike of the sergeant came to the present in the beautiful movements of the prescribed drill the pipes of the bosns mates twittered long and agonizingly hornblower took off his hat and held it before his chest the offhand salute with hand to the brim was not for this occasion he could see the french captain on his quarterdeck now a bulky man holding his hat over his head in the french fashion on his breast gleamed a star which must be this newfangled legion of honour which boney had instituted hornblower came back to reality he had been the first to render the honours and he must be the first to terminate them he growled a word to bush drum ordered bush and the long roll ended with that the twittering of the pipes died away a little more raggedly than hornblower liked on the french quarterdeck someone the drum major perhaps raised a long staff hung with brass bells into the air and brought it down again with a thump instantly the drums rolled half a dozen of them a martial thrilling sound and then over the water came the sound of music that incomprehensible blend of noises which hornblower could never appreciate the drum majors staff rose and fell rhythmically at last the music stopped with a final roll of the drums hornblower put on his hat and the french captain did the same slooope arrums yelled the sergeant of marina all hands dismiss yelled bush and then reverting to his softer tone ouietly there silence the hands were excited and prone to chatter with the order to dismiss never in any of their lives either had they passed a french ship of war so close without guns firing but bush was determined to make the frenchman believe that hotspur was manned entirely by stoics wise with his rattan enforced the order and the crew dispersed in an orderly mob the good order only disturbed by a single quickly suppressed yelp as the rattan struck home on some rash posterior shes the loire surely enough sir said bush they could see the name entwined in gilded letters amid the scrollwork of the frigates stern hornblower remembered that bush still was in ignorance of his source of information it was amusing to be thought omniscient even without justification and you were right sir not to run away from them went on bush why was it so intolerable in this case to note the gleam of admiration in bushs eyes bush did not know of the quickening heartbeats and the sweaty palms its given our fellows a close look at a frenchman said hornblower uneasily it certainly did that sir agreed bush i never expected in all my life to hear that tune from a french frigate what tune asked hornblower unguardedly and was instantly furious with himself for this revelation of his weakness god save the king sir answered bush simply luckily it never occurred to him that anyone could possibly fail to recognize the national anthem if wed had any music on board wed have had to play their marseillaise so we would said hornblower it was desperately necessary to change the subject look hes getting in his topgallants quick time him well see what sort of seamen they are chapter now it was blowing a gale a tworeef gale from the westward the unbelievably fine weather of the past week had come to an end and now the atlantic was asserting itself in its usual fashion under her closereefed topsails hotspur was battling against it closehauled on the porttack she was presenting her port bow to the huge rollers that were advancing upon her unimpeded in their passage over three thousand miles of water from canada to france she would roll lift pitch and then roll again the tremendous pressure of the wind on her topsails steadied her to the extent that she hardly leaned over at all to windward she would heel over to starboard hang for a moment and then come back to the vertical but even with her roll restricted in this fashion she was pitching extravagantly and she was rising and falling bodily as each wave passed under her bottom so that a man standing on her deck would feel the pressure of his feet on her planking increasing and diminishing as she ascended and dropped away again the wind was shrieking in the rigging and her fabric groaned as the varying strains worked on her bending her lengthwise upward in the centre first and then upward at the ends next but that groaning was a reassuring sound there were no sharp cracks or disorderly noises and what could be heard was merely an indication that hotspur was being flexible and sensible instead of being rigid and brittle hornblower came out on to the quarterdeck he was pallid with seasickness because the change of motion had found him out but the attack had not been as severe as he had experienced during the run downchannel he was muffled in his coat and he had to support himself against the roll for his sealegs had not yet learned this advanced lesson bush appeared from the waist followed by the boatswain he touched his hat and then turned with wise beside him to survey the ship in searching fashion its not until the first gale that you know what can carry away sir said bush gear that seemed perfectly well secured would begin to show alarming tendencies to come adrift when submitted to the unpredictable strains of continued heavy weather and bush and wise had just completed a long tour of inspection anything amiss asked hornblower only trifles sir except for the stream anchor thats secure again now bush had a grin on his face and his eyes were dancing obviously he enjoyed this change of climate this bustling of the wind and the activity it called for he rubbed his hands and breathed deep of the gale hornblower could console himself with the memory that there had been times when he had enjoyed dirty weather and even the hope that there would be more but as he felt at present he bitterly told himself it was a hollow memory and an empty hope hornblower took his glass and looked about him momentarily the weather was fairly clear and the horizon at some distance far away on the starboard quarter the telescope picked up a flash of white steadying himself as best he could he managed to catch it in the field again that was the surf on ar men curious breton name that the most southerly and the most seaward of the rocks and reefs that littered the approaches to brest as he watched a fresh roller came in to catch the rock fully exposed the surf burst upon it in a towering pillar of white water reaching up as high as a firstrates maintopsails before the wind hurled it into nothingness again then a fresh squall hurtled down upon the ship bringing with it driving rain so that the horizon closed in around them and hotspur became the centre of a tiny area of tossing grey sea with the lowering clouds hardly clear of the mastheads she was as close in to that lee shore as hornblower dared risk a timid man would have gone out farther to sea at the first sign of bad weather but then a timid man would be likely next to find himself with a shift of wind far away to leeward of the post he was supposed to be watching then whole days might pass before he could be back at his post days when that wind would be fair for the french to do whatever they wanted unobserved it was as if there were a line drawn on the chart along with the parallels of longitude rashness on the one side boldness on the other and hornblower keeping to the very boundary of rashness now there was nothing further to do except as always in the navy to watch and wait to battle with the gale with a wary eye noting every shift in the wind to struggle northward on one tack and then to go about and struggle southward on the other beating up and down outside brest until he had a chance to risk a closer view again so he had done all day yesterday and so he would do for countless days to come should the threatening war break out he went back into his cabin to conceal another flurry of seasickness some time after the misery had in part subsided he was summoned by a thundering at the door what is it lookouts hailing from the masthead sir mr bush is calling him down ill come hornblower emerged just in time to see the lookout transfer himself to the backstay and come sliding all the way down the deck mr cargill said bush send another hand aloft to take his place bush turned to hornblower i couldnt hear what this man was saying sir thanks to the winds so i called him down well what dyou have to say the lookout stood cap in hand a little abashed at confronting the officers dont rightly know if its important sir but during that last clear spell i caught a glimpse of the french frigate where away demanded hornblower at the last moment before he spoke he had managed to modify his originally intended brusqueness there was nothing to be gained and something to be lost by bullying this man two points on the lee bow sir she was hulldown but i could see her topsls sir i know em since the incident of the passing honours hotspur had frequently sighted the loire at various points in the iroise channel it had been a little like a game of hideandseek what was her course she was closehauled sir under doublereefed topsls on the starboardtack sir you were quite right to report her get back to your post now keep that other man aloft with you aye aye sir the man turned away and hornblower gazed out to sea thick weather had closed round them again and the horizon was close in was there anything odd about the loires coming out and braving the gale she might well wish to drill her men in heavy weather no he had to be honest in his thinking and that was a rather unfrench notion there was a very marked tendency in the french navy to conserve material in a miserly fashion hornblower became aware that bush was standing beside him waiting for him to speak what do you think mr bush i expect she anchored last night in berthon bay sir i wouldnt be surprised bush was referring to bertheaume bay just on the seaward side of the goulet where it was just possible to ride to a long cable with the wind anywhere to the north of west and if she lay there she would be in touch with the shore she could receive news and orders sent overland from brest ten miles away she might have heard of a declaration of war she might be hoping to take hotspur by surprise and he must act on that assumption in that case the safest thing to do would be to put the ship about heading south on the starboardtack he would have plenty of sea room would be in no danger from a lee shore and would be so far ahead of the loire as to be able to laugh at pursuit but this was like hamlets soliloquy at the point where hamlet says theres the rub he would be far from his post when cornwallis should arrive absent perhaps for days no this was a case where he must risk his ship hotspur was only a trifle in the clash of two enormous navies she was important to him personally but the information she had gleaned was a hundred times more important than her fabric to cornwallis well hold our course mr bush said hornblower she was two points on our lee bow sir said bush we ought to be well to windward of her when we meet hornblower had already made that calculation if the result had been different he would have put hotspur about five minutes ago and would have been racing for safety clearing again a little sir commented bush looking about him and at that very moment the masthead yelled again there she is sir one point before the starboard beam very well with the moderation of the squall it was just possible to carry on a conversation with the masthead from the deck shes there all right sir said bush training his glass as hotspur lifted to a wave hornblower saw her topsails not very plainly they were braced sharp round presenting only their edge to his telescope hotspur was at least four miles to windward of her look shes going about sir the topsails we broadening into oblongs they wavered for a moment and then settled down they were braced round now parallel to the hotspurs topsails the two ships were now on the same tack she went about the moment she was sure who we were sir shes still playing hideandseek with us hideandseek mr bush i believe we are at war it was hard to make that momentous statement in the quiet conversational tone that a man of iron nerve would employ hornblower did his best bush had no such inhibitions he stared at hornblower and whistled but he could follow now the same lines of thought as hornblower had already traced i think youre right sir thank you mr bush hornblower said that spitefully to his instant regret it was not fair to make bush pay for the tensions his captain had been experiencing nor was it in accord with hornblowers ideal of imperturbability to reveal that such tensions had existed it was well that the next order to be given would most certainly distract bush from any hurt he might feel i think you had better send the hands to quarters mr bush clear for action but dont run out the guns aye aye sir bushs grin revealed his instant excitement now he was bellowing his orders the pipes were twittering through the ship the marine drummer came scrambling up from below he was a child of no more than twelve and his equipment was all higgledypiggledy he made not only a slapdash gesture of coming to attention on the quarterdeck he quite omitted the formal drill of raising the drumsticks high before he began to beat the long roll so anxious was he to begin prowse approached as actingmaster his station in battle was on the quarterdeck beside his captain shes broad on the starboard beam now sir he said looking over at the loire she took a long time to go about thats what youd expect one of the factors that had entered into hornblowers calculations was the fact that hotspur would be quicker in stays than the loire bush came up touching his hat ship cleared for action sir thank you mr bush now here was navy life epitomized in these few minutes a moment of decision of bustle and excitement and then settle down to a long wait again the two ships were thrashing along closehauled four miles apart hotspur almost dead to windward of the loire those four miles that direction of the wind conferred immunity upon hotspur as long as she could preserve that distance she was safe if she could not if some accident occurred then the loires forty eighteenpounders would make short work of her she could fight for honour but with no hope of victory clearing for action was hardly more than a gesture men would die men would be horribly mutilated but the result would be the same as if hotspur had tamely surrendered whos at the wheel asked prowse of nobody in particular and he walked over to supervise the steering perhaps his thoughts were running along those same lines the boatswain came rolling aft as the warrant officer charged with the general supervision of sails and rigging he had no particular station in action and was justified in moving about but he was being very formal at the moment he took off his hat to bush instead of merely touching it and stood holding it his pigtail thumping his shoulders in the gale he must be asking permission to speak sir said bush mr wise is asking on behalf of the hands sir are we at war yes or no the frogs know and we dont yet mr wise there was no harm in a captain admitting ignorance when the reason for it should be perfectly clear as soon as the hands had time to consider the matter as they would have this might be the time to make a resplendent speech but second thoughts assured hornblower it was not yet hornblowers instinct told him that the situation demanded something more than his last bald sentence any man in this ship who thinks theres a different way of doing his duty in peacetime is likely to have his back scratched mr wise say that to the hands that was sufficient for the occasion prowse was back again squinting up at the rigging and gauging the behaviour of the ship do you think she could carry the maintopmast staysl sir that was a question with many implications but there was only one answer no said hornblower that staysail might probably give hotspur a little more speed through the water but it would lay her over very considerably which along the additional area exposed to the wind would increase her leeway by an appreciable proportion hornblower had seen hotspur in dry dock knew the lines of the turn of her bilge and could estimate the maximum angle at which she could retain her grip on the water those two factors would balance out and there was a third one to turn the scale any increase in the amount of canvas exposed would increase the chances of something carrying away a disaster petty or great from the parting of a line to the loss of a topmast would thrust hotspur haplessly within range of the enemys guns if the wind moderates thats the first extra canvas ill set went on hornblower to modify the brusqueness of his refusal and he added take note of how that ships bears from us ive done that sir answered prowse a good mark to prowse mr bush you may dismiss the watch below aye aye sir this chase this race might continue for hours even for days and there was no purpose in fatiguing all hands prematurely the gale developed a new gust within itself hurling rain and spray across the deck the loire faded from sight again as he looked at her while the hotspur plunged and tossed like a toy boat as she battled against wind and wave i wonder how many hands are seasick over there said hornblower he uttered that distasteful word in the same way that a man might tease a sore tooth a good few i dare say sir answered bush in a completely neutral tone call me when shes in sight again said hornblower call me in any case of need of course he said these words with enormous dignity then it was an exhausting physical exercise to struggle aft again back into his cabin his dizziness exaggerated the leaping of the deck under his feet and the swing of his cot as he sank groaning across it it was bush himself who roused him later on weathers clearing sir came bushs voice through the cabin door over the clamour of the storm very well ill come a shadowy shape was already visible to starboard when he came out and soon the loire was revealed sharply as the air cleared there she was lying steeply over yards braced up her gun ports plain enough to be counted when she rose level again spray bursting in clouds over her weather bow and then as she lay over again a momentary glimpse pinkybrown of her copper bottom hornblowers eye told him something that prowse and bush put simultaneously into words shes headreaching on us said bush shes a full point forrard of the beam now said prowse the loire was going faster through the water than hotspur gaining in the race to that extent everyone knew that french ship designers were cleverer than english ones french ships were usually faster but in this particular case it might mean tragedy but there was worse news than this i think sir said bush slowly as if each word caused him pain shes weathering on us too bush meant that the loire was not yielding to the same extent as the hotspur to the thrust of the wind down to leeward relatively hotspur was drifting down upon the loire closer to her guns hornblower with a twinge of apprehension knew that he was right it would only be a question of time if the present weather conditions persisted before the loire could open her ports and commence fire so the simplest way of keeping out of trouble was denied him if hotspur had been the faster and the more weatherly of the two he could have maintained any distance he chose his first line of defence was broken through its not to be wondered at he said he tried to speak coldly or nonchalantly determined to maintain his dignity as captain shes twice our size size was important when clawing to windward the same waves battered against small ships as against big ones but they would push the small ships farther to leeward moreover the keels of big ships reached down farther below the surface farther below the turbulence and maintained a better hold in the more tranquil water the three telescopes as of one mind trained out towards the loire shes luffing up a little said bush hornblower could see the loires topsails shiver momentarily she was sacrificing some of her headway to gain a few yards to windward having superior speed through the water she could afford to do so yes weve drawn level with her again said prowse that french captain knew his business mathematically the best course to take when trying to close on a ship to windward was to keep the ship being chased right in the winds eye and that was where the hotspur now found herself again relative to the loire while the latter resuming her former course closehauled was twenty or thirty yards nearer to her in the direction of the wind a gain of twenty or thirty yards repeated often enough and added to the steady gain resulting from being the more weatherly ship would eventually close the gap the three telescopes came down from the three eyes and hornblower met the gaze of his two subordinates they were looking to him to make the next move in this crisis call all hands if you please mr bush i shall put the ship about aye aye sir here was a moment of danger if hotspur were mishandled she was lost if she missed stays as she once had done with cargill handling her she would lie dead in the water for minutes sagging down to leeward with the loire coming up fast upon her while in this gale the sails might thrash themselves to ribbons leaving her more helpless still even if nothing more vital carried away the operation must be carried out to perfection cargill by coincidence was officer of the watch he could be given the task so might bush or prowse but hornblower knew perfectly well that he could not tolerate the thought of anyone other than himself bearing the responsibility whether in his own eyes or in those of the ships company im going to put the ship about mr cargill he said and that fixed the responsibility irrevocably he walked over the wheel and stared round him he felt the tension he felt the beating of his heart and noticed with momentary astonishment that this was pleasurable that he was enjoying this moment of danger then he forced himself to forget everything except the handling of the ship the hands were at their stations every eye was on him the gale shrieked past his ears as he planted his feet firmly and watched the approaching seas this was the moment handsomely now he growled to the hands at the wheel put your wheel down there was a brief interval before hotspur answered now her bow was turning helms alee shouted hornblower headsail sheets and bowlines were handled with hornblower watching the behaviour of the ship like a tiger stalking its prey tacks and sheets and then turning back to the wheel now hard over she was coming rapidly into the wind mainsl haul the hands were keyed up with the excitement of the moment bowlines and braces were cast off and the yards came ponderously round at the exact moment that hotspur was pointing directly into the wind now meet her hard over snapped hornblower to the wheel hotspur was turning fast and still carrying so much way that the rudder could bite effectively checking the swing before she could turn too far haul off all the thing was done hotspur had gone from one tack to the other without the unnecessary loss of a second or a yard thrashing along now with her starboard bow butting into the waves but there was no time to feel relief or pleasure hornblower hurried to the port quarter to train his glass on the loire she was tacking naturally the mathematics of the theory of the pursuit to windward demanded that the pursuer should tack at the same moment as the pursued but she was bound to be a little late her first inkling that hotspur was about to tack would be when she saw her foretopsail shiver and even if loire had all hands at their stations for going about the hotspur would have two minutes grace and she was far slower in stays even now when hotspur was settled on the new tack with every inch of sail drawing the loires foretopsail was still shivering her bows were still turning the longer she took to go about the more distance she would lose in the race to windward weve weathered on her sir said prowse watching through his glass now were head reaching on her hotspur had won back some of her precious lead and hornblowers second line of defence was proving at least stronger than his first take the bearing again ordered hornblower once settled on the new tack the loires natural advantages asserted themselves once more she showed her extra speed and extra weatherliness she drew up again from hotspurs quarter to her beam then she could luff up briefly and gain a little more to windward on the hotspur the minutes passed like seconds an hour like a minute as the hotspur plunged along with every man braced on the heeling deck and the wind shrieking time to go about again sir asked bush tentatively and greatly daring but the theoretically correct moment was passing well wait a little longer said hornblower well wait for that squall it was hurtling down wind upon them and as it reached them the world was blotted out with driving rain hornblower turned from the hammock netting over which he was peering and climbed up the steep deck to the wheel he took the speakingtrumpet stand by to go about in the gusts that were blowing the crew could hardly hear what he said but every eye was on him everyone was alert and drilled as they were they could not mistake his orders it was a tricky business to tack while the squall prevailed because the gusts were liable to veer a point or two unpredictably but the hotspur was so handy as long as the manoeuvre was well timed that she had a good deal to spare for emergencies the slight change in the winds direction which threatened to take her aback was defeated because she still had sufficient steerage way and command to keep her swinging the gust died away and the blinding chilly rain ceased while the hands were trimming all sharp and the last of the squall drove off to leeward still hiding the loire from view thats done him said bush with satisfaction he was revelling in the mental picture of the loire still thrashing along on the one tack while the hotspur was comfortably on the other and the gap between the two ships widening rapidly they watched the squall travelling over the foamflecked grey water shrieking towards france then in the thickness they saw a more solid nucleus take shape they saw it grow sharper in outline god exclaimed bush he was too disconcerted too dumb founded to finish the oath for there was loire emerging from the squall comfortably on the same tack as hotspur plunging along in her relentless pursuit with the distance in no way diminished thats a trick we wont try a second time said hornblower he was forcing a smile tightlipped the french captain was no fool evidently he had observed the hotspur delaying past the best moment for tacking he had seen the squall engulfing her and had anticipated her action he must have tacked at the very same moment in consequence he had lost little while tacking and that little had been regained by the time the two ships were in sight of each other once more certainly he was a dangerous enemy he must be one of the more able captains that the french navy possessed there were several who had distinguished themselves in the last war true in consequence of the overpowering british naval strength most of them had ended the war as prisoners but the peace of amiens had set them free hornblower turned away from bush and prowse and tried to pace the heeling deck to think out all the implications this was a dangerous situation as dangerous as the worst he had envisaged inexorably wind and wave were forcing hotspur closer to the loire even as he tried to pace the deck he felt her shudder and lurch out of the rhythm of her usual pitch and roll that was the rogue wave generated by some unusual combination of wind and water thumping against hotspurs weather side like a battering ram every few seconds rogue waves made themselves felt checking hotspurs way and pushing her bodily to leeward loire was encountering exactly similar rogue waves but with her greater size she was not so susceptible to their influence they played their part along with the other forces of nature in closing the gap between the two ships supposing he were compelled to fight a close action no he had gone through that before he had a good ship and welltrained crew but on this tossing sea that advantage would be largely discounted by the fact that the loire provided a steadier gun platform odds of four to one in weight of metal were greater than it was advisable to risk momentarily hornblower saw himself appearing in the written history of the future he might have the distinction of being the first british captain in the present war to fall a victim of the french navy what a distinction then even in the cold gale blowing round him he could feel the blood hot under his skin as he pictured the action horrors presented themselves in endless succession to the crack of doom like the kings in macbeth he thought of death he thought of being a prisoner of war he had experienced that already in spain and only by a miracle he had achieved release the last war had gone on for ten years this one might do the same ten years in prison ten years during which his brother officers would be gaining fame distinguishing themselves making fortunes in prize money while he would fret himself to pieces in prison emerging at the end a cranky eccentric forgotten by all his world forgotten even by maria he fancied he would rather die just as he would rather die than be mutilated or so he thought until the choice should be more imminently presented to him then he might well flinch for he did not want to die he tried to tell himself that he was not afraid of death that he merely regretted the prospect of missing all the interesting and amusing things that life held in store for him and then he found himself sneering at himself for not facing the horrid truth that he was afraid then he shook himself out of this black mood he was in danger and this was no time for morbid introspection it was resolution and ingenuity that he demanded of himself he tried to make his face a mask to hide his recent feelings as he met the gaze of bush and prowse mr prowse he said bring your journal lets look at the chart the rough log recorded every change of course every hourly measurement of speed and by its aid they could calculate or guess at the present position of the ship starting from her last point of departure at ar men were making fully two points of leeway said prowse despondently his long face seemed to grow longer and longer as he looked down at hornblower seated at the charttable hornblower shook his head not more than a point and a half and the tides been making in our favour for the last two hours i hope youre right sir said prowse if im not said hornblower working the parallel rulers well have to make fresh plans despondency for the sake of despondency irritated hornblower when displayed by other people he knew too much about it in another two hours said prowse the frenchmanll have us under his guns hornblower looked fixedly at prowse and under that unwavering gaze prowse was at length reminded of his omission which he hastily remedied by belatedly adding the word sir hornblower was not going to allow any deviation from discipline not in any crisis whatever he knew well enough how these things might develop in the future even if there might be no future having made his point there was no need to labour it you can see well weather ushant he said looking down at the line he had pencilled on the chart maybe sir said prowse comfortably went on hornblower i wouldnt say exactly comfortably sir demurred prowse the closer the better said hornblower but we cant dictate that we darent make an inch more of leeway he had thought more than once about that possibility of weathering ushant so close that loire would not be able to hold her course then hotspur would free herself from pursuit like a whale scraping off a barnacle against a rock an amusing and ingenious idea but not practicable as long as the wind stayed steady but even if we weather ushant sir persisted prowse i dont see how it will help us well be within range by then sir hornblower put down his pencil he had been about to say perhaps youd advise saving trouble by hauling down our colours this minute mr prowse but he remembered in time that such a mention of the possibility of surrender even with a sarcastic intention was contrary to the articles of war instead he would penalize prowse by revealing nothing of the plan he had in mind and that would be just as well in case the plan should fail and he should have to fall back on yet another line of defence well see when the time comes he said curtly and rose from his chair were wanted on deck by now itll be time to go about again on deck there was the wind blowing as hard as ever there was the spray flying there was the loire dead to leeward and luffing up to narrow the gap by a further important trifle the hands were at work on the pumps in these weather conditions the pumps had to be employed for half an hour every two hours to free the ship from the sea water which made its way on board through the straining seams well tack the ship mr poole as soon as the pumps suck aye aye sir some way ahead lay ushant and his plan to shake off the loire but before that he had to tack twice more at least each time with its possibilities of making a mistake of handing hotspur and himself over to the enemy he must not stumble over an obstacle at his feet through keeping his eyes on the horizon he made himself perform the manoeuvre as neatly as ever and made himself ignore any feelings of relief when it was completed we gained a full cables length on him that time sir said bush after watching loire steady herself on the starboard tack on hotspurs beam we may not always be so lucky said hornblower but well make this leg a short one and see on the starboard tack he was heading away from his objective when they went about on the port tack again he must hold on for a considerably longer time but he must make it appear as though by inadvertence if he could deceive bush it would be an indication that he was deceiving the french captain the hands seemed to be actually enjoying this sailing contest they were lighthearted revelling in the business of cheating the wind and getting every inch of way out of the hotspur it must be quite obvious to them that loire was gaining in the race but they did not care they were laughing and joking as they looked across at her they had no conception of the danger of the situation or rather they made light of it the luck of the british navy would save them or the unhandiness of the french or the skill of their captain without faith in him they would be far more frightened time to go about again and beat towards ushant he resumed charge of the ship and turned her about it was only after the turn was completed that he noted with satisfaction that he had forgotten his nervousness in the interest he was taking in the situation were closing fast sir said prowse gloomy as ever he had his sextant in his hand and had just finished measuring the angle subtended between the loires masthead and her waterline i can see that for myself thank you mr prowse snapped hornblower for that matter the eye was as trustworthy as any instrumental observation on that heaving sea my duty sir said prowse im glad to see you executing your duty mr prowse said hornblower the tone he used was the equivalent of saying damn your duty which would have also been contrary to the articles of war northward the hotspur held her steady course a squall engulfed her blinding her while the quartermasters juggled desperately at the wheel allowing her perforce to pay off in the worst of the gusts and putting down the wheel to keep her to the wind when the wind backed a point the final gust went by flapping hornblowers coattails it whipped the trouserlegs of the quartermasters at the wheel so that a momentary glance would make a stranger believe that with their swaying arms and wavering legs they were dancing some strange ritual dance as ever when the squall passed on all eyes not dedicated to present duty turned to leeward to look for the loire look at that yelled bush look at that sir weve fooled him properly loire had gone about there she was just settling down on the starboard tack the french captain had been too clever he had decided that hotspur would go about when concealed by the squall and had moved to anticipate her hornblower watched the loire that french captain must be boiling with rage at having his toogreatcleverness revealed to his ships company in this fashion that might cloud his judgement later it might make him overanxious even so he showed little sign of it from here he had been about to haul his bowlines but he reached a rapid and sensible decision to tack again would necessitate standing on for some time on his present course while his ship regained speed and manoeuvrability so that instead he made use of the turning momentum she still possessed put up his helm and completed the circle wearing his ship round so that she momentarily presented her stern to the wind before arriving at last on her original tack again it was a coolheaded piece of work making the best of a bad job but the loire had lost a good deal of ground two full points abaft the beam said prowse and hes farther down to looard too supplemented bush the greatest gain hornblower decided watching her was that it made possible and plausible the long leg to the northward that his plan demanded he could make a long beat on the port tack without the french captain seeing anything unusual in that keep her going there he shouted to the wheel let her fall off a little steady as you go the race was resumed both ships plunging along battling with the unremitting gale hornblower could see the wide angle from the vertical described by the loires masts as she rolled he could see her yards dipping towards the sea and he could be sure that hotspur was acting in the same way rolling even a trifle more deeply perhaps so this very deck on which he stood was over at that fantastic angle too he was proud of the fact that he was regaining his sea legs so rapidly he could stand balance one knee straight and rigid the other considerably bent while he leaned over against the heel and then he could straighten with the roll almost as steadily as bush could and his seasickness was better as well no a pity he had let that subject return to his mind for he had to struggle with a qualm the moment it did so making a long leg like this gives him a chance sir grumbled prowse juggling with telescope and sextant hes drawing up on us fast were doing our best answered hornblower his glass could reveal many details of the loire now as he concentrated upon her to distract himself from his seasickness then as he was about to lower the glass to ease his eye he saw something new the gun ports along her weather side seemed to change their shape and as he continued to look he saw first from one gunport and then from another and finally from the whole line the muzzles of her guns come nosing their way out as the invisible crews strained at the tackles to drag the ponderous weights up against the slope of the deck shes running out her guns sir said bush a little unnecessarily yes there was no purpose in imitating her example yet it would be the lee side guns that hotspur would have to run out they would increase her heel and render her by that much less weatherly lying over as she was she would probably take in water over the portsills at the low point of her roll lastly even at extreme elevation they would nearly all the time be depressed by the heel below the horizontal and would be useless even with good timing on the part of the gun captains against a target at any distance the lookouts at the foretopmasthead were yelling something and then one of them launched himself into the rigging and came running aft to the quarterdeck why dont you use the backstay like a seaman demanded bush but hornblower checked him what is it land sir spluttered the seaman he was wet to the skin with water streaming from every angle whisked away by the wind as it dripped where away on the lee bow sir how many points he thought for a moment a good four sir hornblower looked across at prowse thatll be ushant sir we ought to weather it with plenty to spare i want to be sure of that youd better go aloft mr prowse make the best estimate you can aye aye sir it would not do prowse any harm to make the tiring and exacting journey to the masthead hell be opening fire soon sir said bush referring to the frenchman and not to prowses departing figure not much chance of replying as yet on the other tack maybe sir bush was ready for a fight against any odds and he was unaware that hornblower had no intention of tacking again well see when the time comes said hornblower hes opening fire now sir hornblower whipped round just in time to see a puff of smoke vanishing in the gale and then others all down the loires side enduring hardly for a second before the wind overcame the force of the powder that impelled them that was all no sound of the broadside reached them against the wind and there was not a sight of the fall of shot long range sir said bush a chance for him to exercise his guns crews said hornblower his glass showed him the loires gunmuzzles disappearing back into the ship as the guns were run in again for reloading there was a strange unreality about all this about the silence of that broadside about the fact that hotspur was under fire about the fact that he himself might be dead at any moment now as the result of a lucky hit hes hoping for a lucky hit i suppose sir said bush echoing the very words of hornblowers thoughts in a manner that made the situation all the more uncanny and unreal naturally hornblower forced himself to say that word and in this strange mood his voice pitched against the gale seemed to come from very far away if the frenchman had no objection to a prodigious waste of powder and shot he might as well open fire at this range at extreme cannonshot in the hope of inflicting enough damage on hotspurs rigging to slow her down hornblower could think clearly enough but it was as if he was looking on at someone elses adventure now prowse was returning to the quarterdeck well weather the land by a good four miles sir he said the spray tossed up by the weatherbow had wetted him just as thoroughly as the seamen he looked over at the loire not a chance of our paying off i suppose sir of course not said hornblower long before such a plan could bear fruit he would be engaged in close action were he to drop down to leeward in the hope of forcing the loire to go about to avoid running ashore how long before were up to the land less than an hour sir maybe half it ought to be in sight from the deck any minute yes said bush there it is sir over the lee bow hornblower could see the black bold shoreline of ushant now the three points of the triangle ushant hotspur and loire were all plain to him and he could time his next move he would have to hold on to his present course for some considerable time he would have to brave further broadsides whether he liked it or not insane words those last for no one could like being under fire he trained his glass on the land watching his ships movement relative to it and then as he looked away he saw something momentarily out of the corner of his eye it took him a couple of seconds to deduce what it was he had seen two splashes separated by a hundred feet in space and by a tenth of a second in time a cannonball had skipped from the top of one wave crest and plunged into the next theyre firing very deliberately sir said bush hornblowers attention was directed to the loire in time to see the next brief puff of smoke from her side they saw nothing of the ball then came the next puff i expect they have some marksman on board moving along from gun to gun said hornblower if that were the case the marksman must wait each time for the right conditions of roll a slow rate of firing but allowing for the length of time to reload and run up not impossibly slower than firing broadsides you can hear the guns now sir the sounds carried by the water it was an ugly flat brief clap following just after each puff of smoke mr bush said hornblower speaking slowly as he felt the excitement of the approaching crisis boiling up within him you know your watch and quarterbills off by heart im sure yes sir replied bush simply i want hornblower checked the position of loire again i want sufficient hands at the braces and bowlines to handle the ship properly but i want crews sufficient for the guns of one side too not very easy sir impossible nearly sir i can do it though then i want you to arrange it station crews at the portside guns if you please aye aye sir port side the repetition was in the usual navy style to ensure against misunderstanding there was only the faintest questioning note in bushs voice for the port side was that turned away from the enemy i want went on hornblower still slowly i want the portside guns run out when we go about mr bush ill give the order then i want them run in again like lightning and the ports closed ill give the order for that too aye aye sir run em in again then theyre to cross to the starboard side and run those guns out ready to open fire you understand mr bush yyes sir hornblower looked round at the loire and at ushant again very well mr bush mr cargill will need four hands for a special duty but you can start stationing the rest now he was committed if his calculations were incorrect he would appear a fool in the eyes of the whole ships company he would also be dead or a prisoner but now he was keyed up the fighting spirit boiling within him as it had done once when he boarded renown to effect her recapture there was a sudden shriek overhead so startling that even bush stopped short as he was moving forward a line mysteriously parted in midair the upper end blowing out horizontal in the wind the lower end flying out to trail overside a luckier shot than any so far had passed over the hotspur twenty feet above her deck mr wise yelled hornblower into the speakingtrumpet get that halliard rerove aye aye sir the spirit of mischief asserted itself in hornblowers mind along with his excitement and he raised the trumpet again and mr wise if you think proper you can tell the hands were at war that raised the laugh that hornblower anticipated all over the ship but there was no more time for frivolity pass the word for mr cargill cargill presented himself with a faint look of anxiety on his round face youre not in trouble mr cargill ive selected you for a responsible duty yes sir arrange with mr bush to give you four steady hands and take your station on the focsle at the jib halliard and jib sheets i shall be going about very shortly and then i shall change my mind and come back on my original tack so now you can see what you have to do the moment you get my signal run the jib up the stay and then flat it out to port i want to be quite sure you understand several seconds went by while cargill digested the plan before he answered yes sir im relying on you to keep us from being laid flat aback mr cargill youll have to use your own judgement after that the moment the ships turning and under command again run the jib down you can do that yes sir very well carry on prowse was standing close by straining to hear all this his long face was longer than ever it seemed is it the gale thats making your ears flap mr prowse snapped hornblower in no mood to spare anyone he regretted the words as soon as they were said but now there was no time to compensate for them loire was dead to leeward and beyond her was ushant they had opened up the bay of lampoul on ushants seaward side and now were beginning to close it again the moment had come no better to wait another minute the scream of a cannonball and a simultaneous crash there was a gaping hole in the weather side bulwark the shot had crossed the heeling deck and smashed its way through from within outwards a seaman at the gun there was looking stupidly at his left arm where the blood was beginning to flow from a splinter wound stand by to go about yelled hornblower now for it he had to fool the french captain who had already proved he was no fool keep your glass on the frenchman mr prowse tell me just what hes doing quartermaster a little lee helm just a little handsomely helms alee the foretopsail shivered now every moment was precious and yet he must delay so as to induce the frenchman to commit himself his helms alee sir hes coming round this would be the moment actually it was just past the moment when the frenchman would expect him to tack to avoid the gunfire and the frenchman would try to tack as nearly simultaneously as possible now quartermaster hard down tacks and sheets hotspur was coming to the wind despite the brief delay she was still well under command mr bush on the weather side they opened the gunports and the straining gun crews dragged the guns up the slope a rogue wave slapping against the side came in through the ports and flooded the deck knee deep in water but the frenchman must see those gun muzzles run out on the port side hes coming about sir reported prowse hes casting off the braces he must make quite sure mainsail haul this was the danger point hes past the winds eye sir his foretopsls coming round avaaast the surprised crew stopped dead as hornblower screamed into the speakingtrumpet brace all back again jump to it quartermaster hardaport mr cargill hornblower waved his hand and the jib rushed up the stay with its tremendous leverage on the bowsprit the jib given a chance would turn the ship back irresistibly cargill and his men were hauling it out to port by main force there was just enough of an angle for the wind to act upon it in the right direction was there yes hotspur was swinging back again gallantly ignoring her apparent mistreatment and the wave that she met bowson which burst over her forecastle she was swinging more and more rapidly cargill and his men hauling down the jib that had played so great a part in the operation braces there shes coming before the wind stand by quartermaster meet her as she swings mr bush the guns crews flung themselves on the tackles and ran the guns in again it was a pleasure to see bush restraining their excitement and making certain that they were secure the ports slammed shut and the crews raced over to the starboard side he could see the loire now that hotspur had completed her turn but prowse was still reporting as his order dictated shes in irons sir shes all aback that was the very thing hornblower had hoped for he had believed it likely that he would be able to effect his escape to leeward perhaps after an exchange of broadsides this present situation had appeared possible but too good to materialize the loire was hanging helpless in the wind her captain had noted hotspurs manoeuvre just too late instead of going round on the other tack getting his ship under command and then tacking once more in pursuit he had tried to follow hotspurs example and revert to his previous course but with an unskilled crew and without a carefully prepared plan the improvisation had failed disastrously while hornblower watched he saw loire yaw off the wind and then swing back again refusing obstinately like a frightened horse to do the sensible thing and hotspur dead before the wind was rushing down upon her hornblower measured the dwindling gap with a calculating eye all the keener for his excited condition well render passing honours mr bush he yelled no trumpet needed with the wind behind him you gunners hold your fire until her mainmast comes into your sights quartermaster starboard a little well pass her close pistol shot was the ideal range for firing a broadside according to old tradition or even half pistol shot twenty yards or ten yards hotspur was passing loire starboard side to starboard side but on the starboard side hotspur had her guns run out manned and ready while loire presented to his gaze a line of blank ports no wonder with the ship in her present state of confusion they were level with her no gun went off with a crash bush was standing beside it and gave the word and apparently he intended to walk along the battery firing each gun in turn but hotspur with the wind behind her was going far too fast for him the other guns went off in a straggling roll hornblower saw the splinters fly from the frenchmans side saw the holes battered in it with the wind behind her hotspur was hardly rolling at all she was pitching but any coolheaded gun captain could make sure of hitting his mark at fifteen yards hornblower saw a single gunport open in loires side they were trying to man the guns minutes too late then he was level with the loires quarterdeck he could see the bustling crowd there for a moment he thought he distinguished the figure of the french captain but at that moment the carronade beside him went off with a crash that took him by surprise so that he almost leaped from the deck canister on top of the roundshot sir said the gun captain turning to him with a grin thatll learn em a hundred and fifty musket bullets in a round of canister would sweep the loires quarterdeck like a broom the marines posted on the deck were all biting fresh cartridges and plying their ramrods they must have been firing too without hornblower perceiving it bush was back beside him every shot told he spluttered every single shot sir it was amazing and interesting to see bush so excited but there was still no time for trifles hornblower looked back at the loire she was still in irons that broadside must have thrown her crew into complete disorder again and over there was ushant grim and black port two points he said to the men at the wheel a sensible man would conserve all the sea room available shall we come to the wind and finish her off sir asked bush no that was the sensible decision reached in spite of his fighting madness despite the advantage gained by firing an unanswered broadside hotspur was far too weak to enter voluntarily into a duel with loire if loire had lost a mast if she had been disabled he would have tried it the ships were already a mile apart in the time necessary to beat back to his enemy she would recover and be ready to receive him there she was now she had swung she had come under control again it simply would not do the crew were chattering like monkeys and like monkeys they were dancing about the deck in their excitement hornblower took the speakingtrumpet to magnify his order silence at his bellow the ship instantly fell silent with every eye turned towards him he was impervious to that strangely he paced across the quarterdeck and back again judging the distance of ushant now receding over the starboard quarter and of the loire now before the wind he waited almost reached his decision and then waited again before he gave his orders helm aweather mr prowse back the maintopsl if you please they were in the very mouth of the english channel now with loire to windward and with an infinite avenue of escape available to leeward if loire came down upon him he would lure her upchannel in a stern chase and with night coming on he would be in little enough danger and the loire would be cutting herself off from safety with every prospect of encountering powerful units of the british navy so he waited hoveto on the faint chance that the frenchman might not resist temptation then he saw her yards swing saw her come about on to the starboard tack she was heading for home heading to keep brest under her lee she was acting conservatively and sensibly but to the world to everyone in hotspur and to everyone in the loire for that matter hotspur was challenging her to action and she was running for safety with her tail between her legs at the sight of her in flight the hotspurs crew raised an undisciplined cheer hornblower took the speakingtrumpet again silence the rasp in his voice came from fatigue and strain for reaction was closing in upon him in the moment of victory he had to stop and think he had to prod his mind into activity before he could give his next orders he hung the speakingtrumpet on its becket and turned to bush the two unplanned gestures took on a highly dramatic quality in the eyes of the ships company who were standing watching him and expecting some further speech mr bush you can dismiss the watch below if you would be so kind those last words were the result of a considerable effort aye aye sir secure the guns and dismiss the men from quarters aye aye sir mr prowse hornblower gauged by a glance at ushant the precious distance they had lost to leeward put the ship on the port tack closehauled if you please closehauled on the port tack aye aye sir strictly speaking that was the last order he need give at this moment he could abandon himself to his fatigue now this very second but a few words of explanation were at least desirable if not quite necessary we shall have to beat back call me when the watch is changed as he said those words he could form a mental picture of what they implied he would be able to fall across his cot take the weight off his weary legs let the tensions drain out of him abandon himself to his fatigue close his aching eyes revel in the thought that no further decisions would be demanded of him for an hour or two then he recalled himself in momentary surprise despite those visions he was still on the quarterdeck with all eyes on him he knew what he had to say he knew what was necessary he had to make an exit like some wretched actor leaving the stage as the curtain fell on these simple seamen it would have an effect that would compensate them for their fatigue that would be remembered and quoted months later and would this was the only reason for saying it help to reconcile them to the endless discomforts of the blockade of brest he set his tired legs in motion towards his cabin and paused at the spot where the greatest number of people could hear his words to repeat them later we are going back to watch brest again the melodramatic pause loire or no loire chapter hornblower was seated in the cramped chartroom eating his dinner this salt beef must have come from the new cask for there was an entirely different tang about it not unpleasant presumably it had been pickled at some other victualling yard with a different quality of salt he dipped the tip of his knife into the mustard pot that mustard was borrowed begged from the wardroom and he felt guilty about it the wardroom stores must be running short by now but on the other hand he himself had sailed with no mustard at all thanks to the distractions of getting married while commissioning his ship come in he growled in response to a knock it was cummings one of the young gentlemen first class volunteers kings letter boys with whom the ship was plagued in place of experienced midshipmen thanks again to the haste with which she had been commissioned mr poole sent me sir theres a new ship joining the inshore squadron very well ill come it was a lovely summer day a few cumulus clouds supplied relief to the blue sky hotspur was hardly rocking at all as she lay hoveto her mizzen topsail to the mast for she was so far up in the approaches to brest that the moderate easterly wind had little opportunity since leaving the land to raise a lop on the water hornblower swept his eye round as he emerged on the quarterdeck landward at first naturally they lay right in the mouth of the goulet with a view straight up into the outer roads on one side was the capuchins on the other the petit minou with hotspur carefully stationed as in the days of peace but for a more forceful reason so that she was just out of cannonshot of the batteries on those two points up the goulet lay the reefs of the little girls with their outlier pollux reef and beyond the little girls in the outer roadstead lay the french navy at anchor forced to tolerate this constant invigilation because of the superior might of the channel fleet waiting outside just over the horizon hornblower naturally turned his gaze in that direction next the main body was out of sight so as to conceal its strength even hornblower did not know its present numbers correctly some twelve ships of the line or so but well in sight only three miles out to sea lay the inshore squadron burly twodeckers lying placidly hoveto ready at any minute to support hotspur and the two frigates doris and naiad should the french decide to come out and drive off these insolent sentries there had been three of these ships of the line now as hornblower looked a fourth was creeping in closehauled to join them automatically hornblower looked over again at the petit minou as he expected the semaphore arms of the telegraph on the cliffs at the point there were swinging jerkily from vertical to horizontal and back again the watchers there were signalling to the french fleet the news of the arrival of this fourth ship to join the inshore squadron even the smallest activity was noted and reported so that in clear weather the french admiral was informed within minutes it was an intolerable nuisance it helped to smooth the path of the coasters perennially trying to sneak into brest through the passage of the raz some action should be taken about that semaphore station bush was rating foreman whom he was patiently impatiently training to be the signal officer of the hotspur cant you get that number yet he demanded foreman was training his telescope he had not acquired the trick of keeping the other eye open yet idle in any case it was not easy to read the flags with the wind blowing almost directly from one ship to the other seventynine sir said foreman at length youve read it right for once marvelled bush now lets see what you do next foreman snapped his fingers as he recalled his duties and hastened to the signal book on the binnacle the telescope slipped with a crash to the deck from under his arm as he tried to turn the pages but he picked it up and managed to find the reference he turned back to bush but a jerk of bushs thumb diverted him to hornblower tonnant sir he said now mr foreman you know better than that make your report in proper form and as fully as you can tonnant sir eightyfour guns captain pellew hornblowers stony face and steady silence spurred foreman into remembering the rest of what he should say joining the inshore squadron thank you mr foreman said hornblower with the utmost formality but bush was already addressing foreman again his voice pitched as loudly as if foreman were on the forecastle instead of three yards away mr foreman the tonnants signalling hurry up now foreman scuttled back and raised his telescope thats our number he said so i saw five minutes ago read the signal foreman peered through the telescope referring to the book and checked his reference before looking up at the raging bush send boat it says sir of course it does you ought to know all routine signals by heart mr foreman youve had long enough sir tonnant signals us to send a boat thank you mr bush acknowledge and clear away the quarter boat aye aye sir acknowledge a second later bush was blaring again not that halliard you careless you careless young gentleman tonnant cant see the signal through the mizzen topsl send it up to the main topsl yardarm bush looked over at hornblower and spread his hands in resignation partly he was indicating that he was resigned to this duty of training ignorant young subordinates but partly the dumb show conveyed some of the feelings aroused by having in view of hornblowers known preferences to call foreman a young gentleman instead of using some much more forcible expression then he turned away to supervise cummings as he hoisted out the quarter boat there was everything to be said in favour of these young men being harassed and bullied as they went about their duties although hornblower did not subscribe to the popular notion that young men were actually the better for harassment and bullying they would learn their duties all the quicker and one of these days foreman might easily find himself having to read and transmit signals amid the smoke and confusion and slaughter of a fleet action while cummings might be launching and manning a boat in desperate haste for a cutting out expedition hornblower remembered his unfinished dinner call me when the boat returns if you please mr bush this was the last of the blackcurrant jam hornblower ruefully contemplating the sinking level in the final pot admitted to himself that compulsorily he had actually acquired a taste for blackcurrant the butter was all gone the eggs used up after forty days at sea for the next seventyone days until the ships provisions were all consumed he was likely to be living on seamans fare unrelieved salt beef and pork dried peas biscuits cheese twice a week and suet pudding on sundays at any rate there was time for a nap before the boat returned he could go to sleep peacefully a precaution in case the exigencies of the service disturbed his night thanks to the naval might of britain although five miles away there were twenty thousand enemies any one of whom would kill him on sight boat coming alongside sir very well answered hornblower sleepily the boat was deeply laden right down to her gunwales the hands must have had a long stiff pull back to the hotspur it was the purest bad luck on them that they could run under sail to the tonnant when lightly laden and then have to row all the way back deeply laden in the teeth of the gentle wind from the boat as she approached there came a strange roaring noise a kind of bellow what the devils that asked bush of himself as he stood beside hornblower on the gangway the boat was heaped high with sacks theres fresh food anyway said hornblower reeve a whip at the main yardarm bellowed bush odd how his bellow was echoed from the boat foreman came up the side to report cabbages potatoes cheese sir and a bullock fresh meat by god said bush with half a dozen hands tailing on to the whip at the yardarm the sacks came rapidly up to the deck as the boat was cleared there lay revealed in the bottom a formless mass of rope netting still bellowing slings were passed beneath it and soon it lay on deck a miserable undersized bullock lowing faintly a terrified eye rolled at them through the netting that swathed it bush turned to hornblower as foreman completed his report tonnant brought twentyfour cattle out for the fleet from plymouth sir this ones our share if we butcher it tomorrow sir and let it hang for a day you can have steak on sunday sir yes said hornblower we can swab the blood off the deck while its still fresh sir no need to worry about that an therell be tripe sir ox tongue yes said hornblower he could still see that terrified eye he could wish that bush was not so enthusiastic because he felt quite the reverse as his vivid imagination pictured the butchering he felt no desire at all for meat provided by such a process he had to change the subject mr foreman were there no messages from the fleet foreman started guiltily and plunged his hand into his side pocket to produce a bulky packet he blanched as he saw the fury on hornblowers face dont you ever do that again mr foreman despatches before everything you need a lesson and this is the time for it shall i pass the word for mr wise sir asked bush the boatswains rattan could make vigorous play over foremans recumbent form bent over the breech of a gun hornblower saw the sick fright in foremans face the boy was as terrified as the bullock he must have the horror of corporal punishment that occasionally was evident in the navy it was a horror that hornblower himself shared he looked into the pleading desperate eyes for five long seconds to let the lesson sink in no he said at length mr foreman would only remember that for a day ill see he gets reminded every day for a week no spirits for mr foreman for seven days and anyone in the midshipmans berth who tries to help him out will lose his ration for fourteen days see to that if you please mr bush aye aye sir hornblower snatched the packet from foremans lifeless hand and turned away with contempt in the gesture no child of fifteen would be any the worse for being deprived of ardent spirits in the cabin he had to use his penknife to open the tarred canvas packet the first thing to tumble out was a grapeshot the navy had developed through the centuries a routine in these matters the tarred canvas preserved the contents from salt water if it had to be transported by boat in stormy weather and the grapeshot would sink it if there were danger of its falling into the hands of the enemy there were three official letters and a mass of private ones hornblower opened the official ones in haste the first was signed wm cornwallis vice ad it was in the usual form beginning with the statement of the new situation captain sir edward pellew kb in the tonnant had as senior officer received the command of the inshore squadron you are therefore requested and required to obey the orders of the said captain sir edward pellew and to pay him the strictest attention as issued with the authority of the commander in chief the next was signed ed pellew capt and was drily official in three lines confirming the fact that pellew now considered hornblower and hotspur as under his command the third abandoned the formal sir which began the others my dear hornblower it is with the greatest of pleasure that i hear that you are serving under me and what i have been told of your actions already in the present war confirms the opinion i formed when you were my best midshipman in the old indefatigable please consider yourself at liberty to make any suggestions that may occur to you for the confounding of the french and the confusion of bonaparte your sincere friend edward pellew now that was a really flattering letter warming and comforting warming indeed as hornblower sat with the letter in his hand he could feel the blood running faster through his veins for that matter he could almost feel a stirring within his skull as the ideas began to form as he thought about the signal station on petit minou as the germs of plans began to sprout they were taking shape they were growing fast in the hothouse temperature of his mind quite unconsciously he began to rise from his chair only by pacing briskly up and down the quarterdeck could he bring those plans to fruition and create an outlet for the pressure building up inside him but he remembered the other letters in the packet he must not fall into the same fault as foreman there were letters for him one two six letters all in the same handwriting it dawned upon him that they must be from maria odd that he did not recognize his own wifes handwriting he was about to open them when he checked himself again not one of the other letters was addressed to him but people in the ship were probably anxiously waiting for them pass the word for mr bush he bellowed bush when he arrived was handed the other letters without a word nor did he stay for one seeing that his captain was so deeply engaged in reading that he did not even look up hornblower read several times that he was marias dearest husband the first two letters told him how much she missed her angel how happy she had been during their two days of marriage and how anxious she was that her hero was not running into danger and how necessary it was to change his socks if they should get wet the third letter was dated from plymouth maria had ascertained that the channel fleet was based there and she had decided to move so as to be on the spot should the necessities of the service send hotspur back into port also as she admitted sentimentally she would be nearer her beloved she had made the journey in the coasting troy committing herself to the briny deep for the first time and as she gazed at the distant land she had reached a better understanding of the feelings of her valiant sailor husband now she was comfortably established in lodgings kept by a most respectable woman widow of a boatswain the fourth letter began precipitately with the most delightful the most momentous news for her darling maria hardly knew how to express this to her most loved her most adored idol their marriage already so blissful was now to be further blessed or at least she fancied so hornblower opened the fifth letter in haste passing over the hurried postscript which said that maria had just learned the news of her intrepid warrior adding to his laurels by engaging with the loire and that she hoped he had not exposed himself more than was necessary to his glory he found the news confirmed maria was more sure than ever that she was destined to be so vastly fortunate in the future as to be the mother of the child of her ideal and the sixth letter repeated the confirmation there might be a christmas baby or a new years child hornblower noted wryly that much more space in these later letters was devoted to the blessed increase than to her longedfor but distant jewel in any case maria was consumed with hope that the little cherub if a boy would be the image of his famous father or if a girl that she should display his sweetness of disposition so that was the news hornblower sat with the six letters littered before him his mind in just as much disorder perhaps to postpone realization he dwelt at first on the thought of the two letters he had written addressed to southsea they would be a long time before they caught up with maria and their comparatively formal and perhaps chilling content he would have to remedy that he would have to write a letter full of affection and full of delight at the news whether he were delighted or not and at that point he could reach no decision plunged as he was into professional problems the episode of his marriage was suffused in his memory with unreal quality the affair was so brief and even at the time it had been so overlain by the business of getting to sea that it had seemed strange to him that it should involve the lasting effects of marriage and this news was an indication of more lasting and permanent effects still he was going to be a father for the life of him he could not tell if he were pleased or not certainly he was sorry for the child if he or she were destined to inherit his accursed unhappy temperament the more the child should prove to be like him whether in looks or in morals the sorrier he would be yet was that quite true was there not something flattering something gratifying in the thought that his own characteristics might be perpetuated it was hard to be honest with himself he could remember with his mind now diverted from his present life more clearly the details of his honeymoon he could conjure up more exactly his memories of marias doting affection of the wholehearted way in which she gave herself to believe that she could not give so much love without its being as hotly reciprocated he must never let her guess at the quality of his feelings for her because that would be a cruelty that he could not contemplate he reached for pen and paper returning to the commonplace world with his routine annoyance at having a left wing pen pens from the left wing of the goose were cheaper than right wing ones because when held in position for writing they pointed towards the writers eye and not conveniently out over his elbow as right wing ones did but at least he had cut a good point and the ink had not yet grown muddy grimly he applied himself to his task partly it was a literary exercise an essay on unbounded affection and yet and yet he found himself smiling as he wrote he felt tenderness within him welling out perhaps along his arm and down his pen he was even on the verge of admitting to himself that he was not entirely the coldhearted and unscrupulous individual he believed himself to be towards the close of the letter as he searched for synonyms for wife and child his glance strayed back to the letters from pellew and he actually caught his breath his thoughts reverting to his duty to his plans for slaughter to the harsh realities of the world he was living in hotspur was riding easily over the placid sea but the very fact that she was lying hoveto meant that there was a fair wind out of brest and that at any moment a shout from the topmasthead would announce that the french navy was on its way out to contest in thunder and smoke the mastery of the sea and he had plans even as he reread the latest lines of his letter to maria his vision was blurred by the insistence on his attention of his visualization of the chart of the entrance to brest he had to take tight hold of himself to compel himself to finish the letter to maria in the same strain as he had begun it he made himself finish it he made himself reread it he made himself fold it a shout to the sentry brought in grimes with a lighted dip with which to seal it and when he had completed the tiresome process it was with eager relief that he laid the letter aside and reached for a fresh sheet of paper hm sloop hotspur at sea the petit minou bearing north one league may th sir this was an end of mellifluous phrasing of blundering attempts to deal with a totally unfamiliar situation no longer was he addressing the dear companion of our lives together in happy years to come now he was applying himself to a task that he felt competent and eager to do and for phrasing he had only to draw upon the harsh and unrelieved wording of a myriad official letters before this one he wrote rapidly and with little pause for consideration because fantastically his plans had reached complete maturity during his preoccupation with maria the sheet was covered turned and half covered again and the plan was sketched out in full detail he wrote the conclusion respectfully submitted by your obdt servant horatio hornblower he wrote the address captain sir e pellew k b hms tonnant when the second letter was sealed he held the two of them in his hand new life in the one and death and misery in the other that was a fanciful thought of far more importance was the question as to whether pellew would approve of his suggestions chapter hornblower lay stretched out on his cot waiting for the time to pass he would have preferred to be asleep but during the afternoon sleep had refused to come to him it was better to go on lying here in any case for he would need all his strength during the night to come and if he followed his inclinations and went on deck he would not only tire himself but he would reveal his anxieties and tensions to his subordinates so he lay as relaxed as he could manage flat on his back with his hands behind his head the sounds that he heard on deck told him of the progress of the ships routine just over his head the telltale compass which he had had fitted to the deckbeams was literally carrying out its functions and telling the tale of hotspurs small alterations of heading as she lay hoveto and these could be correlated with the play of the beams of sunshine that came in through the stern windows those were now curtained and the sunbeams came in around the curtains as they swayed gently with the ships motion most captains curtained and furnished their cabins with gay chintz or even if wealthy with damask but these curtains were of canvas they were of the finest no sailcloth to be found in the ship and had only hung there for the last two days hornblower thought about this pleasantly for they had been a present to him from the wardroom bush and prowse and the surgeon wallis and the purser huffnell had made the presentation after a mysterious request from bush that they should be allowed to enter his cabin for a moment in his absence hornblower had returned to the cabin to find the deputation there and the cabin transformed there were curtains and cushions stuffed with oakum and a coverlet all gay with red and blue roses and green leaves painted on with ships paint by some unknown artist in the ships company hornblower had looked round in astonishment that made it impossible to conceal his pleasure there was no time to glower or look stern as nine captains out of ten would have done at such an unwarrantable liberty on the part of the wardroom he could do no more than thank them in halting phrases and the greatest pleasure only came after later consideration when he faced the situation realistically they had not done this as a joke or in a silly attempt to win his favour he had to believe the unbelievable and accept the fact that they had done it because they liked him that showed their poor judgement gratification warred with guilt in his mind yet the fact that they had dared to do such a thing was a strange but undeniable confirmation that the hotspur was welding herself into a fighting entity grimes knocked at the door and entered theyre calling the watch sir he said thank you ill come the squeals of the pipes and the bellowings of the petty officers echoing through the ship made grimes words a little superfluous but hornblower had to act the part of a newly awakened man he retied his neckcloth and pulled on his coat slipped on his shoes and walked out on deck bush was there with paper and pencil in his hand the semaphores been signalling sir he reported two long messages at fifteen minutes past four and fourthirty two short ones at there they go again sir the long gaunt arms of the semaphore were jerkingly swinging out and up and back again thank you mr bush it was sufficient to know that the semaphore had been busy hornblower took the glass and trained it out to seaward the inshore squadron was sharply silhouetted against the clear sky the sun just down on the horizon was still so bright that he could not look towards it at all but the squadron was well to the northward of it tonnants signalling again sir but its a ninetyone signal reported foreman thank you it had been agreed that all flagsignals from tonnant preceded by the numerals ninetyone should be disregarded tonnant was only making them to deceive the french on petit minou into thinking some violent action was being planned by the inshore squadron there goes naiad sir said bush under easy sail the frigate was creeping northward from her station to the south where she had been watching over carnaret bay heading to join the big ships and the doris the sun was now touching the sea small variations in the water content of the nearly clear air were causing strange freaks of refraction so that the reddening disc was lightly out of shape as it sank theyre heaving the long boat up out of its chocks sir commented bush yes the sun was halfway down in the sea the remaining half pulled by refraction into twice its normal length there was still plenty of light for an observer with a good glass on petit minou and undoubtedly there was one to pick out the preparations going on on the doriss deck and in the big ships the sun had gone above where it had sunk a small sliver of cloud shone brilliantly gold and then turned to pink as he looked twilight was closing in on them send the hands to the braces if you please mr bush fill the maintopsl and lay her on the starboard tack starboard tack aye aye sir hotspur crept northward through the growing night following after doris heading towards the big ships and point matthew there goes the semaphore again sir thank you there was just light enough in the darkening sky to see the telegraphic arms silhouetted against it as they spun round signalling the latest move on the part of the british this concentration towards the north this relaxing of the hold of the british navy on the passages of the south only just keep her going said hornblower to the quartermasters at the helm dont let the frogs see what were up to aye aye sir hornblower was feeling nervous he did not want to leave the toulinguet passage too far behind him he turned his glass towards the inshore squadron now there was a strip of red sky along the horizon behind it the last light of day and against it the sails of the ships of the line stood out in startling black the red was fading rapidly and above it venus could be seen pellew over there was holding on to the last possible moment pellew was not only a man of iron nerve he was a man who never underestimated his enemy at last the rectangles of the silhouetted topsails shortened hesitated and lengthened again inshore squadrons hauled its wind sir thank you already the topsails were out of sight with the complete fading of the sky pellew had timed the move perfectly a frenchman on petit minou could not help but think that pellew looking towards the nightcovered east had thought that his ships were now invisible and had come to the wind without realizing that the move could still be seen by an observer looking towards the west hornblower stared round him his eyes were aching so that with his hands on the hammock netting he closed his eyes to rest them never had a minute seemed so long as that one then he opened them again the light was all gone venus was shining where once the sun had shone the figures about him were almost invisible now one or two of the brighter stars could be seen and hotspur must be lost to sight to that unknown observer on petit minou he gulped braced himself and plunged into action take in the topsls and topgallants hands rushed aloft in the gentle night the vibration of the shrouds as fifty men ran up the ratlines could be distinctly heard now mr bush wear the ship if you please course sou by west sou by west sir soon it was time for the next order send the topgallant masts down this was the time when drill and practice revealed their value in the dark night what had once been a mere toilsome exercise was performed without a hitch set the fore and main topmast staysls get the foresl in hornblower walked over to the binnacle how does she handle under this sail there was a pause while the almost invisible figure at the wheel spun it tentatively this way and that well enough sir very well hornblower had altered the silhouette of the hotspur as entirely as he could with only her fore and aft sails and her main course set and her topgallant masts sent down even an experienced seaman on this dark night would have to look twice or thrice to recognize what he saw hornblower peered at the chart in the faint light of the binnacle he concentrated on it to find the effort unnecessary for two days now he had been studying it and memorizing this particular section it was fixed in his mind and it seemed as if he would be able to visualize it to his dying day which might be today he looked up to find as he expected that exposure to that faint light had temporarily made his eyes quite blind in the darkness he would not do it again mr prowse you can keep your eye on the chart from now on when you think it necessary mr bush choose the best two hands you know with the lead and send them aft to me when the two dark figures reported hornblower gave them curt orders get into the main chains on each side i dont want you to make a sound more than you can help dont make a cast unless i order it haul your lines in and then let em out to four fathoms were making three knots through the water and when the flood starts well be making next to nothing over the ground keep your fingers on your lines and pass the word quietly about what you feel ill station hands to pass the word understand aye aye sir four bells struck to mark the end of the second dog watch mr bush thats the last time i want the bell to strike now you may clear for action no wait a moment if you please i want the guns loaded with two rounds of shot each and run out have the coigns in and the guns at extreme depression and as soon as the men are at their quarters i dont want to hear another sound not a word not a whisper the man who drops a handspike on the deck will get two dozen not the slightest sound aye aye sir very well mr bush carry on there was a roar and a rattle as the hands went to their quarters as the gunports opened and the guns were run out then silence closed in upon the ship everything was ready from the gunner down in the magazine to the lookout in the foretop as the hotspur reached silently down to the southward with the wind one point abaft the beam one bell in the first watch sir whispered prowse turning the sandglass by the binnacle an hour ago the flood tide had started to make in another halfhour the clustered coasters to the southward huddled under the shelter of the batteries at camaret would be casting off no they would be doing that at this moment for there should be just enough water for them they would be sweeping and hedging out to run with the flood up the dangerous toulinguet passage round the point and up the goulet they would hope to reach the little girls and safety as the tide carried them into brest roads where the provisions and the cordage and the canvas with which they were laden were so eagerly awaited by the french fleet to the north back at the petit minou hornblower could imagine the bustle and the excitement the movements of the inshore squadron must have been noted sharp eyes on the french shore had told anxious minds of the insufficiently concealed preparations for a concentration of force and a heavy blow four ships of the line and two big frigates could muster a landing force even without drawing on the main fleet of a thousand men or more there were probably twice as many french infantry and artillerymen along the coast there but spread out along five miles they were vulnerable to a sharp attack launched at an unexpected point on a dark night there was a large accumulation of coasting vessels there as well sheltering under the batteries on the far side of cape matthew they had crept from battery to battery for hundreds of miles spending weeks in doing so and now were huddled in the little creeks and bays waiting for a chance to complete the last and most dangerous run into brest the menacing approach of the inshore squadron would make them nervous in case the british meditated some new attack a cuttingout expedition or fireships or bombvessels or even these newfangled rockets but at least this concentration of the british strength to the north left the south unwatched as the signal station of petit minou would report the coasters round camaret chassemarees tidechasers would be able to take advantage of the tide run through the horribly dangerous toulinguet passage up into the goulet hornblower was hoping in fact he was confident that hotspur had not been seen to turn back to stop this bolt hole she drew six feet of water less than any frigate hardly more than the big chassemarees and were she boldly handled her arrival among the rocks and shoals of toulinguet would be totally unexpected two bells sir whispered prowse this was the moment when the tide would be running at its fastest a four knot tide rising a full thirty feet racing up through toulinguet passage and round the council rocks into the goulet the hands were behaving well only twice had restless individuals started skylarking in the darkness to be instantly suppressed by stern mutterings from the petty officers touching bottom to starboard sir came a whisper from the gangway and instantly afterwards touching bottom to port the hands at the leads had twentyfour feet of line out between the leads and the surface of the water but with the ship moving gently in this fashion even the heavy leads trailed behind to some extent there must be some sixteen feet only five feet to spare pass the word what bottom do you feel in ten seconds the answer came back sandy bottom sir that must be well off council rocks sir whispered prowse yes quartermaster one point to starboard hornblower stared through the nightglass there was the shadowy shoreline just visible yes and there was a gleam of white the gentlest of surfs breaking on council rocks a whisper from the gangway rocky bottom now sir shoaling a little very well on the starboard bow he could see faint whiteness too that was the surf on all the wild tangle of rocks and shoals outside the passage corbin trepieds and so on the tiny night breeze was still holding steady pass the word what bottom the question awaited an answer for some time as the chain of communication broke down and the answer had to be repeated at last it came rocky bottom sir but were hardly moving over the ground so hotspur was now stemming the rising tide hanging suspended in the darkness less than a yard of water under her keel the tide rushing past her the wind thrusting her into it hornblower worked out problems in his head quartermaster two points to port it called for nice calculation for now hotspur was braced sharp up twice the staysails had flapped in warning and there was leeway to be allowed for as hotspur crept crabwise across the tide mr bush go forard to the port side main chains and come back to report what a lovely night it was with this balmy air sighing through the rigging the stars shining and the gentle sound of the surf were moving over the ground sir whispered bush rocky bottom and the port side leads under the ship hotspurs crabwise motion would produce that effect three bells sir reported prowse there would be water enough now for the coasters to negotiate the shoals off rougaste and to have entered into the channel it could not be long now for the tide flowed for no more than four and a half hours and the coasters could not afford to waste time or so he had calculated when he had made his suggestion to pellew for this moonless night with the tide making at this particular moment but it might of course all end in a ridiculous fiasco even if hotspur did not touch on one of the menacing rocks that beset her course look sir look whispered bush urgently one point before the beam yes a shadowy shape a darker nucleus on the dark surface more than that the splash of a sweep at work more than that other dark shapes beyond there had been fifty coasters by the last intelligence at camaret and the chances were they would try the run all together get down to the starboard battery mr bush warn the guns crews wait for my order and then make every shot tell aye aye sir despite the precautions he had taken hotspur would be far more visible than the coasters she should have been observed from them by now except that the frenchmen would be preoccupied with their problems of navigation ah there was a yell from the nearest coaster a whole series of hails and shouts and warnings open fire mr bush a red glare in the darkness an earsplitting bang the smell of powder smoke another glare another bang hornblower fumbled for the speakingtrumpet ready to make himself heard through the firing but bush was behaving admirably and the gunners were keeping their heads with the guns going off singly as the captains made sure of their targets with the guns depressed the two roundshot hurtling from each would sweep the smooth surface of the sea hornblower thought he could hear shrieks from the stricken coasters but the guns were firing at only the briefest intervals the gentle wind swept the smoke along the ship clouds of it billowing in dark waves round hornblower he leaned out to keep clear of it the din was continuous now as guns fired as the carriagetrucks rumbled over the deck as guncaptains bellowed orders the flash of a gun illuminated something close overside a sinking coaster deck level with the water her frail side must have been beaten in by half a dozen roundshot a yell from the main chains cut through the din heres one of em coming aboard some desperate swimmer had reached the hotspur hornblower could leave bush to deal with prisoners of that sort there were more dark shapes to starboard more targets presenting themselves the mass of the coasters was being hurried along by the threeknot tide which hotspur was stemming by the aid of the wind tug at their sweeps as they might the french crews could not possibly counter the tide they could not turn back to turn aside was possible but on one side were the council rocks on the other were corbin and trepieds and the whole tangle of reefs roundabout them hotspur was having experiences like those of gulliver she was a giant compared with these lilliputian coasters after having been a dwarf in her encounter with the brobdingnagian loire fine on the port bow hornblower caught sight of half a dozen pinpoints of fire that would be the battery on toulinguet two thousand yards away at that range they were welcome to try their luck firing at hotspurs gun flashes hotspur still travelling slowly over the ground was a moving target and the french would be disturbed in their aim through fear of hitting the coasters nightfiring in those conditions was a waste of powder and shot foreman was yelling wild with excitement to the crew of the quarterdeck carronade shes aground drop it dead un hornblower swung round to look the coaster there was undoubtedly on the rocks and consequently not worth firing at he mentally gave a mark of approval to foreman who despite his youth and his excitement was keeping his head even though he made use of the vocabulary of the ratkilling pit four bells sir reported prowse amid the wild din that was an abrupt reminder to hornblower that he must keep his head too it was hard to think and to calculate harder still to recall his visualization of the chart and yet he had to do so he realized that hotspur could have nothing to spare over on the landward side wear the ship mr prowse he said he remembered just too late to use the formal address completely naturally get her over on the port tack aye aye sir prowse seized the speakingtrumpet and somewhere in the darkness disciplined men hurried to sheets and braces as hotspur swung about another dark shape came down at her from the channel je me rends je me rends a voice was shouting from it someone in that coaster was trying to surrender before hotspurs broadside could blow her out of the water she actually bumped against the side as the current took her round and then she was free her surrender had been premature for now she was past hotspur and vanishing in the farther darkness main chains there yelled hornblower take a cast of the lead two fathoms came the answering cry there was only six inches under hotspurs keel but now she was drawing away from the perils on one side and approaching those on the other man the portside guns keep the lead going on the starboard hotspur was steady on her new course as another unhappy coaster loomed up in the momentary stillness hornblower could hear bushs voice as he called the portside guns crews to attention and then came the crash of the firing the smoke billowed round and through the clouds came the cry of the leadsman by the mark three the smoke and the lead told conflicting stories and a half three wind must be backing mr prowse keep your eye on the binnacle aye aye sir and its five bells sir the tide was almost at its height another factor to be remembered at the portside quarterdeck carronade the crew were slewing their weapon round to the limit of its arc and hornblower looking over the quarter could see a coaster escaping past hotspurs stern two flashes from the dark shape and a simultaneous crash under hornblowers feet that coaster had guns mounted and was firing her popgun broadside and at least one shot had told a popgun broadside perhaps but even a fourpounder could smash a hole in hotspurs frail side the carronade roared out in reply luff a little said hornblower to the quartermasters his mind was simultaneously recording the cries of the men at the leads mr bush stand by with the portside guns as we luff hotspur came to the wind on the maindeck there were creakings and groanings as the guns crews laboured with handspike and crowbar to train their weapons round take your aim shouted bush and after some pregnant seconds fire the guns went off almost together and hornblower thought although he was sure he was wrong that he could hear instantly afterwards the crash of the shot upon the coasters hulls certainly after that he heard shouts and cries from that direction while the smoke blinded him but he had no time to spare for that there was only half an hour of floodtide left no more coasters could be coming along the channel for if they did they would not be able to round the council rocks before the ebb set in and it was full time to extricate hotspur from the reefs and shoals that surrounded her she needed what was left of the flood to carry her out and even at halftide she was likely to touch bottom and be left ignominiously stranded helpless in daylight under the fire of the toulinguet battery time to say goodbye he said to prowse he realized with a shock that he was on the edge of being lightheaded with strain and excitement for otherwise he would not have said such a ridiculous thing he must keep himself under control for a long while to come it would be far more dangerous to touch bottom on a falling tide than on a rising one he gulped and steadied himself regaining his selfcommand at the cost of one more fierce effort ill handle the ship mr prowse he raised the trumpet hands to the braces hands wear ship a further order to the wheel brought the ship round on the other tack with prowse at the binnacle calling her heading now he had to thread his way out through the perils that encompassed her the hands completely carefree were inclined to show their elation by noisy skylarking but one single savage reproof from bush silenced them and hotspur fell as quiet as a church as she crept out winds backed three points since sunset sir reported prowse thank you with the wind just abaft the beam hotspur handled easily but by this time instinct had to take the place of calculation hornblower had come in to the very limit of safety at high water over shallows hardly covered at high tide he had to feel his way out by the aid of the lead by what could be seen of the shore and the shoals the wheel spun over and back again as the ship nosed her way out for a few perilous seconds she was sailing by the lee but hornblower was able to order the helm over again in the nick of time slack water now sir reported prowse thank you slack water if any of the incalculable factors had not intervened the wind had been slight but steady for several days from the southeastward he had to bear that in mind along with all the other factors by the mark five called the leadsman thank god mustered prowse for the first time hotspur had nearly twenty feet of water under her keel but there were still some outlying pinnacles of rock to menace her starboard a point ordered hornblower deep six mr bush hornblower must stay steady and calm he must betray no relief no human feelings although within him the desire to laugh like an idiot welled up in combat with the frightful exhaustion he felt kindly secure the guns then you may dismiss the hands from general quarters aye aye sir i must thank you mr prowse for your very able assistance me sir prowse went on in incoherent selfdepreciation hornblower could imagine the lanternjaws working in surprise and he ignored the mumblings you may heave the ship to mr prowse we dont want dawn to find us under the guns of petit minou no sir of course not sir all was well hotspur had gone in and come out again the coasters from the south had received a lesson they would not forget for a long time and now it was apparent that the night was not so dark it was not a question of eyes becoming habituated to the darkness but something more definite than that faces were now a blur of white visible across the deck looking aft hornblower could see the low hills of quelern standing out in dark relief against a lighter sky and while he watched a grain of silver became visible over their summits he had actually forgotten until this moment that the moon was due to rise now that had been one of the factors he had pointed out in his letter to pellew the gibbous moon rose above the hilltops and shone serenely down upon the gulf the topgallant masts were being sent up topsails were being set staysails got in whats that noise asked hornblower referring to a dull thumping somewhere forward carpenter plugging a shot hole sir explained bush that last coaster holed us just above the waterline on the starboard side right forward anyone hurt no sir very well his questions and his formal termination of the conversation were the result of one more effort of will i can trust you not to lose your way now mr bush he said he could not help being jocular although he knew it sounded a false note the hands at the braces were backing the maintopsail and hotspur could lie hoveto in peace and quiet you may set the ordinary watches mr bush and see that i am called at eight bells in the middle watch aye aye sir there were four and a half hours of peace and quiet ahead of him he yearned with all his weary mind and body for rest for oblivion rather than rest an hour after dawn at the latest pellew could expect him to send in his report on the events of the evening and it would take an hour to compose it and he must take the opportunity to write to maria so that the letter could be sent to tonnant along with the report and so have a chance to reach the outside world it would take him longer to write to maria than to pellew that reminded him of something else he had to make one more effort oh mr bush sir ill be sending a boat to tonnant during the morning watch if any officer or if any of the men wish to send letters that will be their opportunity aye aye sir thank you sir in his cabin he faced one further effort to pull off his shoes but the arrival of grimes saved him the trouble grimes took off his shoes eased him out of his coat unfastened his neckcloth hornblower allowed him to do it he was too weary even to be selfconscious for one moment he luxuriated in allowing his weary feet free play in his stockings but then he fell spreadeagled on to his cot halfprone half on his side his head on his arms and grimes covered him up and left him that was not the most sensible attitude to adopt as he discovered when grimes shook him awake he ached in every joint it seemed while to dash cold sea water on his face did little enough to clear his head he had to struggle out of the aftereffects of a long period of strain as other men had to struggle out of the aftereffects of a drinking bout but he had recovered sufficiently to move his lefthanded pen when he sat down and began his report sir in obedience to your instructions dated the th instant i proceeded on the afternoon of the th he had to leave the last paragraph until the coming of daylight should reveal what he should write in it and he laid the letter aside and took another sheet he had to bite the end of his pen before he could even write the salutation in this second letter and when he had written my dear wife he had to bite it again before he could continue it was something of a relief to have grimes enter at last mr bushs compliments sir and its not far off daylight that made it possible to conclude the letter and now my dearest hornblower glanced at marias letter to select an endearment angel my duty calls me once more on deck so that i must end this letter with another reference fondest love to my dear wife the loved mother of the child to be your affectionate husband horatio daylight was coming up fast when he arrived on deck brace the maintopsl round if you please mr young well stand to the suthard a little good morning mr bush good morning sir bush was already trying to see to the southward through his telescope increasing light and diminishing distance brought rapid results there they are sir god sir one two three and there are two others over on the council rocks and that looks like a wreck right in the fairway thats one we sunk ill wager sir in the glittering dawn the halftide revealed wrecks littering the shoals and the shore black against the crystal light the coasters which had paid the penalty of trying to run the blockade theyre all holed and waterlogged sir said bush not a hope of salvage hornblower was already composing in his mind the final paragraph of his report i have reason to believe that not less than ten sail of coasters were sunk or forced to run aground during this encounter this happy result thats a fortune lost sir grumbled bush thats a tidy sum in prize money over on those rocks no doubt but in those decisive moments last night there could have been no question of capture hotspurs duty had been to destroy everything possible and not to fill her captains empty purse by sending boats to take possession at the cost of allowing half the quarry to escape hornblowers reply was cut off short as the smooth water on the starboard beam suddenly erupted in three successive jets of water a cannonball had come skipping towards them over the surface to make its final plunge a cables length away the sound of gunfire reached their ears at the same moment and their instantly elevated telescopes revealed a cloud of smoke engulfing the toulinguet battery fire away monseer le frog said bush the damage is done we may as well make sure were out of range said hornblower put the ship about if you please he was trying as best he could to reproduce bushs complete indifference under fire he told himself that he was only being sensible and not cowardly in making certain that there was no chance of hotspurs being hit by a salvo of twentyfourpounders but he was inclined to sneer at himself all the same yet there was one source of selfcongratulation he had held his tongue when the subject of prize money had come up in the conversation he had been about to burst out condemning the whole system as pernicious but he had managed to refrain bush thought him a queer character in any case and if he had divulged his opinion of prize money of the system by which it was earned and paid bush would have thought him more than merely eccentric bush would think him actually insane and liberalminded revolutionary subversive and dangerous as well chapter hornblower stood ready to go down the side into the waiting boat he made the formal legal speech mr bush you will take command aye aye sir hornblower remembered to look about him as he prepared to make the descent he glowered round at the sideboys in the white gloves that bush had had made for this ceremonial purpose out of white twine by some seaman adept with a hook crochet was the french name for this process he ran his eyes up and down the bosns mates as they piped his departing salute then he went over the side the piping stopped at the same moment as his foot reached for the thwart that was a measure of the height of hotspurs freeboard for by the rules of ceremonial the honours ceased the moment the departing officers head was at the level of the deck hornblower scrambled into the stern sheets embarrassed by hat and gloves and sword and boat cloak and he barked an order to hewitt the boathook released its hold and there was a moment of apparent disorder as the boat left the ships side and four brawny arms at the halliards sent the balancelug up the mast there was a decided strangeness at sitting here on a level with the water with the green waves close at hand it was over eight weeks since hornblower had last set foot outside the ship the boat settled on her course running free because the wind had backed southerly several points and hornblower looked back at hotspur lying hoveto he ran a professional eye over her lines noting as an observer from the outside again the relative heights of her masts the distances at which they were stepped the rake of the bowsprit he knew a great deal now about the behaviour of the ship under sail but there was always more to learn not at this moment though for a stronger puff of wind laid the boat over and hornblower felt suddenly uncertain both of his surroundings and himself the little waves of which hotspur took no notice were monstrous when encountered in a small boat which besides lying over was now rising and swooping in a most unpleasant fashion after the reassuring solidity of hotspurs deck after painfully accustoming himself to her motion these new surroundings and these new antics were most unsettling especially as hornblower was excited and tense at the prospect before him he swallowed hard battling against the seasickness which had leaped out of ambush for him to divert his mind he concentrated his attention upon the tonnant growing slowly nearer much too slowly at her main topgallant masthead she sported the coveted broad pendant in place of the narrow one worn by other ships in commission it was the sign of a captain with executive powers over other ships besides his own pellew was not only high up in the captains list but clearly destined for important command as soon as he reached flag rank there must be rear admirals in the channel fleet bitterly jealous of pellews tenure of the inshore command a boat came along her starboard side painted white picked out with red and of a design unlike that of the workaday boats supplied by the navy office hornblower could see the matching red and white uniforms of the boats crew this must be some very dandy captain at least paying a call or more likely a flag officer hornblower saw a ribboned and epauletted figure go up the side and across the water came the sound of the squealing of the pipes and the boompbump noise that to his ears indicated a band playing next moment the white ensign broke out at the foretopmasthead a vice admiral of the white that could be no other than cornwallis himself hornblower realized that this meeting to which he had been summoned by the curt signal all captains was something more than a sociable gathering he looked down in distress at his shabby clothing reminded as he did so to open his boat cloak and reveal the epaulette on his left shoulder a shabby brassy thing dating back to the time of his earlier disallowed appointment as commander two years ago hornblower distinctly saw the officer of the watch in attendance at the gangway turn from his telescope and give an order which sent four of the eight whitegloved sideboys there scurrying out of sight so that a mere commander should not share the honours given a vice admiral the admirals barge had sheered off and the hotspurs boat took its place with hornblower not too seasick and nervous to worry about the way it was handled in case it did not reflect credit on his ship the worry however was instantly overlaid by the necessity for concentration on the process of going up the side this was a lofty twodecker and although the considerable tumblehome was of help it was a tricky business for the gangling hornblower to mount with dignity encumbered as he was somehow he reached the deck and somehow despite his shyness and embarrassment he remembered to touch his hat in salute to the guard that presented arms to him captain hornblower inquired the officer of the watch he knew him by the single epaulette on his left shoulder the only commander in the inshore squadron perhaps the only one in the channel fleet this young gentleman will act as your guide the deck of the tonnant seemed incredibly spacious after the cramped deck of the hotspur for the tonnant was no mere seventyfour she was an eightyfour with dimensions and scantlings worthy of a threedecker she was a reminder of the era when the french built big ships in the hope of overpowering the british seventyfours by brute force instead of by skill and discipline how the venture had turned out was proved by the fact that tonnant now flew the flag of england the great poopcabins had been thrown into a single suite for pellew in the absence of a flagofficer permanently on board it was incredibly luxurious once past the sentry the decks were actually carpeted wilton carpets in which the foot sank noiselessly there was an anteroom with a steward in dazzling white ducks to take hornblowers hat and gloves and cloak captain hornblower sir announced the young gentleman throwing open the door the deckbeams above were six feet clear over the carpet and pellew had grown so used to this that he advanced to shake hands with no stoop at all in contrast with hornblower who instinctively crouched with his fivefooteleven delighted to see you hornblower said pellew genuinely delighted there is much to say to you for letters are always inadequate but i must make the introductions the admiral has already made your acquaintance i think hornblower shook hands with cornwallis mumbling the same politenesses as he had already addressed to pellew other introductions followed names known to everyone who had read in the gazette the accounts of naval victories grindall of the prince marsfield of the minotaur lord henry paulet of the terrible and half a dozen others hornblower felt dazzled although he had just come in from the bright outer world in all this array there was one other officer with a single epaulette but he wore it on his right shoulder proof that he too had attained the glorious rank of post captain and had only to go on living to mount a second epaulette on attaining three years seniority and if long life was granted him eventually to attain the unspeakable heights of flag rank he was far higher above a commander than a commander was above a lowly lieutenant hornblower sat in the chair offered him instinctively edging it backward so as to make himself the most junior the infinitely junior officer as inconspicuous as possible the cabin was finished in some rich material damask hornblower guessed with a colour scheme of nutmeg and blue unobtrusive and yet incredibly satisfying to the eye daylight poured in through a vast stern window to glint upon the swaying silver lamps there was a shelf of books some in good leather bindings but hornblowers sharp eye detected tattered copies of the mariners guide and the admiralty publications for the coasts of france on the far side were two large masses so draped as to be shapely and in keeping so that no uninitiated person could guess that inside were two eighteenpounder carronades this must take you a full five minutes to clear for action sir edward said cornwallis four minutes and ten seconds by stopwatch sir answered pellew to strike everything below including the bulkheads another steward also in dazzling white ducks entered at this moment and spoke a few words in a low tone to pellew like a welltrained butler in a ducal house and pellew rose to his feet dinner gentlemen he announced permit me to lead the way a door thrown open in the midships bulkhead revealed a diningroom an oblong table with white damask glittering silver sparkling glasses while more stewards in white ducks were ranged against the bulkhead there could be little doubt about precedence when every captain in the royal navy had naturally studied his place in the captains list ever since his promotion hornblower and the singleepauletted captain were headed for the foot of the table when pellew halted the general sortingout at the admirals suggestion he announced we are dispensing with precedence today you will find your names on cards at your places so now every one began a feverish hunt for their names hornblower found himself seated between lord henry paulet and hosier of the fame and opposite him was cornwallis himself i made the suggestion to sir edward cornwallis was saying as he leisurely took his seat because otherwise we always find ourselves sitting next to our neighbours in the captains list in blockade service especially variety is much to be sought after he lowered himself into his chair and when he had done so his juniors followed his example hornblower cautiously on guard about his manners still could not restrain his mischievous inner self from mentally adding a passage to the rules of naval ceremonial to the lines of the rule about the officers head reaching the level of the maindeck when the admirals backside shall touch the seat of his chair pellew provides good dinners said lord henry eagerly scanning the dishes with which the stewards were now crowding the table the largest dish was placed in front of him and when the immense silver dish cover was whipped away a magnificent pie was revealed the pastry top was built up into a castle from the turret of which flew a paper union jack prodigious exclaimed cornwallis sir edward what lies below the dungeons here pellew shook his head sadly only beef and kidneys sir beef stewed to rags our ships bullock this time as ever was too tough for ordinary mortals and only stewing would reduce his steaks to digestibility so i called in the aid of his kidneys for a beefsteak and kidney pie but what about the flour the victualling officer sent me a sack sir unfortunately it had rested in bilge water as could only be expected but there was just enough at the top unspoiled for the piecrust pellews gesture indicating the silver bread barges filled with ships biscuit hinted that in more fortunate circumstances they might have been filled with fresh rolls im sure its delicious said cornwallis lord henry might i trouble you to serve me if you can find it in your heart to destroy those magnificent battlements paulet set to work with carving knife and fork on the pie while hornblower pondered the phenomenon of the son of a marquis helping the son of an earl to a steak and kidney pie made from a ration bullock and spoiled flour thats a ragout of pork beside you captain hosier said pellew or so my chef would call it you may find it even saltier than usual because of the bitter tears he shed into it captain durham has the only live pig left in the channel fleet and no gold of mine would coax it from him so that my poor fellow had to make do with the contents of the brine tub he has succeeded perfectly with the pie at least commented cornwallis he must be an artist i engaged him during the peace said pellew and brought him with me on the outbreak of war at quarters he points a gun on the starboard side lowerdeck if his aim is as good as his cooking said cornwallis reaching for his glass which a steward had filled then confusion to the french the toast was drunk with murmured acclaim fresh vegetables said lord henry ecstatically cauliflower your quota is on the way to your ship at this moment hornblower said cornwallis we try not to forget you hotspurs like uriah the hittite said a saturnine captain at the end of the table whose name appeared to be collins in the forefront of the battle hornblower was grateful to collins for that speech because it brought home to him a truth like a bright light that he had not realized before he would rather be on short commons in the forefront of the battle than back in the main body with plenty of vegetables young carrots went on lord henry peering into each vegetable dish in turn and whats this i cant believe it spring greens lord henry said pellew we still have to wait for peas and beans wonderful how do you get these chickens so fat sir edward asked grindall a matter of feeding merely another secret of my chef in the public interest you should disclose it said cornwallis the life of a seasick chicken rarely conduces to putting on flesh well sir since you ask this ship has a complement of six hundred and fifty men every day thirteen fiftypound bread bags are emptied the secret lies in the treatment of those bags but how asked several voices tap them shake them before emptying not enough to make wasteful crumbs but sharply enough then take out the biscuits quickly and behold at the bottom of each bag is a mass of weevils and maggots scared out of their natural habitat and with no time allowed to seek shelter again believe me gentlemen there is nothing that fattens a chicken so well as a diet of rich biscuitfed weevils hornblower your plates still empty help yourself man hornblower had thought of helping himself to chicken but somehow and he grinned at himself internally this last speech diverted him from doing so the beefsteak pie was in great demand and had almost disappeared and as a junior officer he knew better than to anticipate his seniors second helpings the ragout of pork rich in onions was at the far end of the table ill make a start on this sir he said indicating an untouched dish before him hornblower has a judgement that puts us all to shame said pellew thats a kickshaw in which my chef takes particular pride to go with it youll need these pure potatoes hornblower it was a dish of brawn from which hornblower cut himself moderately generous slices and it had dark flakes in it there was no doubt that it was utterly delicious hornblower diving down into his general knowledge came up with the conclusion that the black flakes must be truffle of which he had heard but which he had never tasted the pure potatoes which he would have called mashed were like no mashed potatoes he had ever sampled either on shipboard or in a sixpenny ordinary in england they were seasoned subtly and yet to perfection if angels ever ate mashed potatoes they would call on pellews chef to prepare them with spring greens and carrots for both of which he hungered inexpressibly they made a plateful along with the brawn of sheer delight he found himself eating like a wolf and pulled himself up short but the glance that he stole round the table reassured him for the others were eating like wolves too to the detriment of conversation with only a few murmured words to mingle with the clash of cutlery wine with you sir your health admiral would you give the onions a fair wind grindall and so on wont you try the galantine lord henry asked pellew steward a fresh plate for lord henry that was how hornblower learned the real name of the brawn he was eating the ragout of pork drifted his way and he helped himself generously the steward behind him changed his plate in the nick of time he savoured the exquisite boiled onions that wallowed in the beatific sauce then like magic the table was cleared and fresh dishes made their appearance a pudding rich with raisins and currants jellies of two colours much labour must have gone into boiling down the bullocks feet and into subsequent straining to make that brilliant gelatine no flour for that duff said pellew apologetically the galley staff has done its best with biscuit crumbs that best was as near perfection as mind could conceive there was a sweet sauce with it hinting of ginger that made the most of the richness of the fruit hornblower found himself thinking that if ever he became a post captain wealthy with prize money he would have to devote endless thought to the organization of his cabin stores and maria would not be of much help he thought ruefully he was still drifting along with thoughts of maria when the table was swept clear again caerphilly sir murmured a steward in his ear wensleydale red cheshire these were cheeses that were being offered him he helped himself at random one name meant no more to him than mother and went on to make an epochmaking discovery that wensleydale cheese and vintage port were a pair of heavenly twins castor and pollux riding triumphantly as the climax of a glorious procession full of food and with two glasses of wine inside him all he allowed himself he felt vastly pleased with the discovery rivalling those of columbus and cook almost simultaneously he made another discovery which amused him the chased silver fingerbowls which were put on the table were very elegant the last time he had seen anything like them was as a midshipman at a dinner at government house in gibraltar in each floated a fragment of lemon peel but the water in which the peel floated as hornblower discovered by a furtive taste as he dabbed his lips was plain sea water there was something comforting in that fact cornwalliss blue eyes were fixed on him mr vice the king said cornwallis hornblower came back from pink hazes of beatitude he had to take a grip of himself as when he had tacked hotspur with the loire in pursuit he had to await the right moment for the attention of the company then he rose to his feet and lifted his glass carrying out the ages old ritual of the junior officer present gentlemen the king he said the king echoed everyone present and some added phrases like god bless him and long may he reign before they sat down again his royal highness the duke of clarence said lord henry in conversational tone told me that during his time at sea he had knocked his head hes a tall man as you know so often on so many deck beams while drinking his fathers health that he seriously was considering requesting his majestys permission as a special privilege for the royal navy to drink the royal health while sitting down at the other corner of the table andrews captain of the flora was going on with an interrupted conversation fifteen pounds a man he was saying thats what my jacks were paid on account of prize money and we were in cawsand bay ready to sail the women had left the ship not a bumboat within call and so my men the ordinary seamen mind you still have fifteen pounds apiece in their pockets all the better when they get a chance to spend it said marsfield hornblower was making a rapid calculation the flora would have a crew of some three hundred men who divided a quarter of the prize money between them the captain had one quarter to himself so that andrews would have been paid on account not necessarily in full some four thousand five hundred pounds as a result of some lucky cruise probably without risk probably without a life being lost money for seizing french merchant ships intercepted at sea hornblower thought ruefully about marias latest letter and about the uses to which he could put four thousand five hundred pounds therell be lively times in plymouth when the channel fleet comes in said andrews that is something which i wish to explain to you gentlemen said cornwallis breaking in on the conversation there was something flat and expressionless about his voice and there was a kind of masklike expression on his goodtempered face so that all eyes turned on him the channel fleet will not be coming in to plymouth said cornwallis this is the time to make that plain a silence ensued during which cornwallis was clearly waiting for a cue the saturnine collins supplied it what about water sir provisions they are going to be sent out to us water sir yes i have had four waterhoys constructed they will bring us water victualling ships will bring us our food each new ship which joins us will bring us fresh food vegetables and live cattle all they can carry on deck that will help against scurvy im sending no ship back to replenish so well have to wait for the winter gales before we see plymouth again sir nor even then said cornwallis no ship no captain is to enter plymouth without my express orders do i have to explain why to experienced officers like you the reasons were as obvious to hornblower as to the others the channel fleet might well have to run for shelter when southwesterly gales blew and with a gale at southwest the french fleet could not escape from brest but plymouth sound was difficult a wind from the eastward would delay the british fleets exits prolong it over several days perhaps during which time the wind would be fair for the french fleet to escape there were plenty of other reasons too there was disease every captain knew that ships grew healthier the longer they were at sea there was desertion there was the fact that discipline could be badly shaken by debauches on shore but in a gale sir asked someone we could get blown right upchannel no answered cornwallis decisively if were blown off this station our rendezvous is tor bay there we anchor confused murmurings showed how this information was being digested tor bay was an exposed uncomfortable anchorage barely sheltered from the west but it had the obvious advantage that at the first shift of wind the fleet could put to sea could be off ushant again before the unwieldy french fleet could file out down the goulet so none of us will set foot on english soil again until the end of the war sir said collins cornwalliss face was transfigured by a smile we need never say that all of you any one of you can go ashore the smile broadened as he paused the moment i set foot ashore myself that caused a laugh perhaps a grudging laugh but with an admiring echo hornblower watching the scene keenly suddenly came to a fresh realization collinss questions and remarks had been very apt very much to the point hornblower suspected that he had been listening to a prepared piece of dialogue and his suspicions were strengthened by the recollection that collins was first captain under cornwallis somebody whom the french would call a chief of staff hornblower looked about him again he could not help feeling admiration for cornwallis whose guileless behaviour concealed such unsuspected depths of subtlety and it was a matter for selfcongratulation that he had guessed the secret he the junior officer present surrounded by all these captains of vast seniority of distinguished records and of noble descent he felt positively smug a most unusual and gratifying feeling smugness and vintage port combined to dull his awareness of all the implications at first and then suddenly everything changed the new thought sent him sliding down an avernus of depression it brought about an actual physical sensation in the pit of his stomach like the one he felt when hotspur close hauled topped a wave and went slithering and rolling down the farther side maria he had written so cheerfully saying he would be seeing her soon there were only fifty days provisions and water left in hotspur fresh food would eke out the provisions but little enough could be done regarding water he had been confident that hotspur would be making periodic calls at plymouth for food and water and firewood now maria would never have the comfort of his presence during her pregnancy nor would he himself have the pleasure of seeing her during her pregnancy and one more thing he would have to write to her and tell her that he would not be keeping his promises that there was no chance of their meeting he would be causing her terrible pain not only because her idol would be revealed to her as a man who could not or perhaps even would not keep his word he was recalled suddenly from these thoughts from these mental pictures of maria by hearing his name spoken during the conversation round the table nearly everyone present was looking at him and he had to ferret hurriedly through his unconscious memory to recapture what had been said someone it must have been cornwallis himself had said that the information he had gathered from the french coast had been satisfactory and illuminating but for the life of him hornblower could not recall what had next been said and now here he was with every eye on him gazing round the table with a bewilderment that he tried to conceal behind an impassive countenance we are all interested in your sources of information hornblower prompted cornwallis apparently repeating something already said hornblower shook his head in decisive negation that was his instant reaction before he could analyse the situation and before he could wrap up a blunt refusal in pretty words no he said to back up the shaking of his head there were all these people present nothing would remain a secret if known to so large a group the pilchard fishermen and lobsterpot men with whom he had been having furtive dealings and on whom he had been lavishing british gold french gold to be exact would meet with short shrift if their activities became known to the french authorities not only would they die but they would never be able to supply him with any further news he was passionately anxious for his secrets to remain secrets yet he was surrounded by all these senior officers any one of whom might have an influence on his career luckily he was already committed by the curt negative that had been surprised out of him nothing could commit him more deeply than that and that was thanks to maria he must not think about maria yet he must find some way of softening his abrupt refusal its more important than a formula for fattening chickens sir he said and then with a bright further inspiration he shifted the responsibility i would not like to disclose my operations without a direct order his sensibilities keyed to the highest pitch detected sympathy in cornwalliss reaction im sure theres no need hornblower said cornwallis turning back to the others now before he turned was it true that the eyelid of his left eye nearest to hornblower flickered a trifle was it hornblower could not be sure as the conversation reverted to a discussion of future operations hornblowers sense almost telepathic became aware of something else in the past atmosphere which called up hot resentment in his mind these fighting officers these captains of ships of the line were content to leave the dirty details of the gathering of intelligence to a junior to someone hardly worthy of their lofty notice they would not sully their aristocratic white hands if the insignificant commander of an insignificant sloop chose to do the work they would leave it to him in tolerant contempt now the contempt was in no way onesided fighting captains had their place in the scheme of things but only an insignificant place and anyone could be a fighting captain even if he had to learn to swallow down the heart from his mouth and master the tensions that set his limbs atremble hornblower was experiencing symptoms not unlike these at this moment when he was in no danger at all vintage port and a good dinner thoughts of maria and resentment against the captains combined within him in a witches brew that threatened to boil over luckily the bubbling mixture happened to distil off a succession of ideas first one and then another they linked themselves in a logical chain hornblower along with his agitation could feel the flush of blood under his skin that foretold the development of a plan in the same way that the witch in macbeth could tell the approach of something wicked by the pricking in her thumbs soon the plan was mature complete and hornblower was left calm and clearheaded after his spiritual convulsion it was like the clearness of head that follows the crisis of an attack of fever possibly that was exactly what it was the plan called for a dark night and for halfflood an hour before dawn nature would supply those sooner or later following her immutable laws it called for some good fortune and it would call for resolution and promptitude of action but those were accessory ingredients in every plan it included possibilities of disaster but was there ever a plan that did not it also called for the services of a man who spoke perfect french and hornblower measuring his abilities with a cold eye knew that he was not that man the penniless noble french refugee who in hornblowers boyhood had instructed him with fair success in french and deportment had never managed to confer a good accent upon his tonedeaf pupil his grammar and his construction were excellent but no one would ever mistake him for a frenchman hornblower had reached every necessary decision by the time the party began to break up and he made it his business to take his stand casually beside collins at the moment the admirals barge was called is there anyone in the channel fleet who speaks perfect french sir he asked you speak french yourself replied collins not well enough for what i have in mind sir said hornblower more struck by the extent of collins knowledge than flattered i might find a use for a man who speaks french exactly like a frenchman theres ctard said collins meditatively rubbing his chin lieutenant in the marlborough hes a guernseyman speaks french like a native always spoke it as a child i believe what do you want him to do admirals barge coming alongside sir reported a breathless messenger to pellew hardly time to tell you now sir said hornblower i can submit a plan to sir edward but itll be no use without someone speaking perfect french the assembled company was now filing to the gangway collins in accordance with naval etiquette would have to go down the side into the barge ahead of cornwallis ill detail ctard from his ship on special service said collins hastily ill send him over to you and you can look him over thank you sir cornwallis was now thanking his host and saying goodbye to the other captains collins unobtrusively yet with remarkable rapidity contrived to do the same and disappeared over the side cornwallis followed with all the time honoured ceremonial of guard of honour and band and sideboys while his flag was hauled down from the foretopmast head after his departure barge after barge came alongside each gaudy with new paint with every crew tricked out in neat clothing paid for out of their captains pockets and captain after captain went down into them in order of seniority and shoved off to their respective ships lastly came hotspurs drab little quarterboat its crew dressed in the clothes issued to them in the slopship the day they were sent on board goodbye sir said hornblower holding out his hand to pellew pellew had shaken so many hands and had said so many goodbyes that hornblower was anxious to cut this farewell as short as possible goodbye hornblower said pellew and hornblower quickly stepped back touching his hat the pipes squealed until his head was below the level of the maindeck and then he dropped perilously into the boat hat gloves sword and all all of them shabby chapter ill take this opportunity mr bush said hornblower of repeating what i said before im sorry youre not being given your chance it cant be helped sir its the way of the service replied the shadowy figure confronting hornblower on the dark quarterdeck the words were philosophical but the tone was bitter it was all part of the general logical madness of war that bush should feel bitter at not being allowed to risk his life and that hornblower about to be doing so should commiserate with bush speaking in flat formal tones as if he were not in the least excited as if he were feeling no apprehension at all hornblower knew himself well enough to be sure that if some miracle were to happen if orders were to arrive forbidding him to take personal part in the coming raid he would feel a wave of relief delight as well as relief but it was quite impossible for the orders had definitely stated that the landing party will be under the command of captain horatio hornblower of the hotspur that sentence had been explained in advance in the preceding one because lieut ctard is senior to lieut bush ctard could not possibly have been transferred from one ship and given command of a landing party largely provided by another nor could he be expected to serve under an officer junior to him and the only way round the difficulty had been that hornblower should command pellew writing out those orders in the quiet of his magnificent cabin had been like a valkyrie in the norse legends now attaining a strange popularity in england he had been a chooser of the slain those scratches of his pen could well mean that bush would live and hornblower would die but there was another side to the picture hornblower had grudgingly to admit to himself that he would have been no more happy if bush had been in command the operation planned could only be successful if carried through with a certain verve and with an exactness of timing that bush possibly could not provide absurdly hornblower was glad he was to command and that was one demonstration in his mind of the defects of his temperament you are sure about your orders until i return mr bush he said and in case i dont return yes sir hornblower had felt a cold wave up his spine while he spoke so casually about the possibility of his death an hour from now he might be a disfigured stiffening corpse then ill get myself ready he said turning away with every appearance of nonchalance he had hardly reached his cabin when grimes entered sir said grimes and hornblower swung round and looked at him grimes was in his early twenties skinny highly strung and excitable now his face was white his duties as steward meant that he spent little time on deck in the sun and his lips were working horribly whats the matter demanded hornblower curtly dont make me come with you sir spluttered grimes you dont want me with you sir do you sir it was an astonishing moment in all his years of service hornblower had never met with any experience in the least similar and he was taken aback this was cowardice it might even be construed as mutiny grimes had in the last five seconds made himself liable not merely to the cat but to the noose hornblower could only stand and stare wordless ill be no use sir said grimes i i might scream now that was a very definite point hornblower giving his orders for the raid had nominated grimes as his messenger and aidedecamp he had given no thought to the selection he had been a very casual chooser of the slain now he was learning a lesson a frightened man at his elbow a man made clumsy by fear could imperil the whole expedition yet the first words he could say echoed his earlier thoughts i could hang you by god he exclaimed no sir no sir please sir grimes was on the point of collapse in another moment he would be down on his knees oh for gods sake said hornblower he was conscious of contempt not for the coward but for the man who allowed his cowardice to show and then he asked himself by what right he felt this contempt and then he thought about the good of the service and then he had no time to waste in these trivial analyses very well he snapped you can stay on board shut your mouth you fool grimes was about to show gratitude but hornblowers words cut it off short ill take hewitt out of the second boat he can come with me pass the word for him the minutes were fleeting by as they always did with the final touches to put on to a planned scheme hornblower passed his belt through the loop on a cutlass sheath and buckled it round him a sword hanging on slings could be a hindrance would strike against obstructions and the cutlass was a handier weapon for what he contemplated he gave a final thought to taking a pistol and again rejected the idea a pistol might be useful in certain circumstances but it was a bulky encumbrance here was something more silent a long sausage of stout canvas filled with sand with a loop for the wrist hornblower settled it conveniently in his right hand pocket hewitt reported and had to be briefly told what was expected of him the sidelong glance he gave to grimes revealed much of what hewitt thought but there was no time for discussion that matter would have to be sorted out later hewitt was shown the contents of the bundle originally allotted to grimes the flint and steel for use if the dark lantern were extinguished the oily rags the slow match the quick match the blue lights for instant intense combustion hewitt took solemn note of each item and weighed his sandbag in his hand very well come along said hornblower sir said grimes at that moment in a pleading tone but hornblower would not indeed could not spare time to hear any more on deck it was pitch dark and hornblowers eyes took long to adjust themselves officer after officer reported all ready youre sure of what you have to say mr ctard yes sir there was no hint of the excitable frenchman about ctard he was as phlegmatic as any commanding officer could desire fiftyone rank and file present sir reported the captain of marines those marines brought on board the night before had lain huddled below decks all day concealed from the telescopes on petit minou thank you captain jones youve made sure no musket is loaded yes sir until the alarm was given not a shot was to be fired the work was to be done with the bayonet and the butt and the sandbag but the only way to be certain of that was to keep the muskets unloaded first landing party all down in the fishing boat sir reported bush thank you mr bush very well mr ctard we may as well start the lobsterboat seized earlier in the night to the surprise of its crew lay alongside the crew were prisoners down below their surprise was due to the breach of the traditional neutrality enjoyed during the long wars by fishingboats these men were all acquainted with hornblower had often sold him part of their catch in exchange for gold yet they had hardly been reassured when they were told that their boat would be returned to them later now it lay alongside and ctard followed hewitt and hornblower followed ctard down into it eight men were squatting in the bottom where the lobsterpots used to lie sanderson hewitt black downes take the oars the rest of you get down below the gunners mr ctard sit here against my knees if you please hornblower waited until they had settled themselves the black silhouette of the boat must appear no different in the dark night now came the moment shove off said hornblower the oars dragged through the water bit more effectively at the next stroke pulled smoothly at the third and they were leaving hotspur behind them they were setting off on an adventure and hornblower was only too conscious that it was his own fault if he had not been bitten with this idea they might all be peacefully asleep on board tomorrow men would be dead who but for him would still be alive he put the morbid thought to one side and then immediately he had to do the same with thoughts about grimes grimes could wait perfectly well until his return and hornblower would not trouble his mind about him until then yet even so as hornblower concentrated on steering the lobsterboat there was a continual undercurrent of thought like ships noises during a discussion of plans regarding how the crew on board would be treating grimes for hewitt before leaving the ship would have certainly told the story to his cronies hornblower with his hand on the tiller steered a steady course northward towards petit minou a mile and a quarter to go and it would never do if he missed the little jetty so that the expedition would end in a miserable fiasco he had the faint outline of the steep hills on the northern shore of the goulet to guide him he knew them well enough now after all these weeks of gazing at them and the abrupt shoulder where a little stream came down to the sea a quarter of a mile west of the semaphore was his principal guide he had to keep that notch open as the boat advanced but after a few minutes he could actually make out the towering height of the semaphore itself just visible against the dark sky and then it was easy the oars groaned in the rowlocks the blades splashing occasionally in the water the gentle waves which raised them and lowered them seemed to be made of black glass there was no need for a silent or invisible approach on the contrary the lobsterboat had to appear as if she were approaching on her lawful occasions at the foot of the abrupt shore was a tiny halftide jetty and it was the habit of the lobsterboats to land there and put ashore a couple of men with the pick of the catch then each with a basket on his head containing a dozen live lobsters they would run along the track over the hills into brest so as to be ready for the opening of the market regardless of whether the boat was delayed by wind and tide or not hornblower scouting at a safe distance in the jolly boat had ascertained during a succession of nights such of the routine as he had not been able to pick up in conversation with the fishermen there it was there was the jetty hornblower found his grip tightening on the tiller now came the loud voice of the sentry at the end of the jetty qui va la hornblower nudged ctard with his knee unnecessarily for ctard was ready with the answer camille he hailed and continued in french lobsterboat captain quillien they were already alongside the crucial moment on which everything depended black the burly captain of the forecastle knew what he had to do the moment opportunity offered ctard spoke from the depths of the boat i have the lobster for your officer hornblower standing up and reaching for the jetty could just see the dark of the sentry looking down but black had already leaped up from the bows like a panther downs and sanderson following him hornblower saw a swift movement of shadow but there was not a sound not a sound all right sir said black hornblower with a line in his hand managed to propel himself up the slippery side arriving on the top on his hands and knees black was standing holding the inanimated body of the sentry in his arms sandbags were silent a vicious blow from behind at the exposed back of the neck a quick grab and it was finished the sentry had not even dropped his musket he and it were safe in blacks monstrous arms black lowered the body senseless or dead it did not matter which on to the slimy stone flags of the jetty if he makes a sound cut his throat said hornblower this was all orderly and yet unreal like a nightmare hornblower turning to drop a clovehitch with his line over a bollard found his upper lip was still drawn up in a snarl like a wild beasts ctard was already beside him sanderson had already made the boat fast forward come on the jetty was only a few yards long at the far end where the paths diverged up to the batteries they would find the second sentry from the boat they passed up a couple of empty baskets and black and ctard had them on their heads and set off ctard in the middle hornblower on the left and black on the right where his right arm would be free to swing his sandbag there was the sentry he made no formal challenge greeting them in jocular fashion while ctard spoke again about the lobster which was the recognized though unofficial toll paid to the officer commanding the guard for the use of the jetty it was a perfectly ordinary encounter until black dropped his basket and swung with his sandbag and they all three leaped on the sentry ctard with his hands on the sentrys throat hornblower striking madly with his sandbag as well desperately anxious to make sure it was over in an instant and hornblower looked round at the dark and silent night with the sentrys body lying at his feet he and black and ctard were the thin point of the wedge that had pierced the ring of the french defences it was time for the wedge to be driven home behind them were the halfdozen others who had crouched in the lobsterboat and following them up were the seventy marines and seamen in the boats of the hotspur they dragged the second sentry back to the jetty and left him with the two boatkeepers now hornblower had eight men at his back as he set his face to the steep climb up the path the path he had only seen through a telescope from hotspurs deck hewitt was behind him the smell of hot metal and fat in the still night air told him that the dark lantern was still alight the path was stony and slippery and hornblower had to exert his selfcontrol as he struggled up it there was no need for desperate haste and although they were inside the ring of sentries in an area where civilians apparently passed fairly freely there was no need to scramble noisily and attract too much attention now the path became less steep now it was level and here it intersected another path at right angles halt grunted hornblower to hewitt but he took another two paces forward while hewitt passed the word back a sudden stop would mean that the people behind would be cannoning into each other this was indeed the summit owing to the levellingoff of the top this was an area unsearched by telescopes from the hotspur even from the main topgallant masthead with the ship far out in the iroise they had not been able to view the ground here the towering telegraph had been plainly in view and at its foot just a hint of a roof but they had not been able to see what was at ground level here nor had hornblower been able to obtain any hint in his conversations with fishermen wait he whispered back and stepped cautiously forward his hands extended in front of him instantly they came into contact with a wooden paling quite an ordinary fence and by no means a military obstacle and this was a gate an ordinary gate with a wooden latch obviously the semaphore station was not closely guarded fence and gate were only polite warnings to unauthorized intruders and of course there was no reason why they should be here among the french coastal batteries hewitt ctard they came up to him and all three strained their eyes in the darkness do you see anything looks like a house whispered ctard something in two storeys windows in the lower one and above that a sort of platform the crew who worked the telegraph must live here hornblower cautiously fumbled with the latch of the gate and it opened without resistance then a sudden noise almost in his ear tensed him rigid to relax again it was a cock crowing and he could hear a fluttering of wings the semaphore crew must keep chickens in coops here and the cock was giving premature warning of day no reason for further delay hornblower whispered his orders to his band whom he called up to the gate now was the time and this was the moment when the parties of marines must be halfway up the climb to the battery he was on the point of giving the final word when he saw something else which stopped him dead and ctard grabbed his shoulder at the same moment two of the windows before him were showing a light a tiny glimmer which nevertheless to their dilated pupils made the whole cottage plain to their view come on they dashed forward hornblower ctard hewitt and the two men with axes in one group the other four musket men scattering to surround the place the path led straight to a door again with a wooden latch which hornblower feverishly tried to work but the door resisted it was bolted on the inside and at the rattling of the latch a startled cry made itself heard inside a womans voice it was harsh and loud but a womans voice undoubtedly the axeman at hornblowers shoulder heaved up his axe to beat in the door but at the same moment the other axeman shattered a window and went leaping through followed by ctard the womans voice rose to a scream the bolt was drawn and the door swung open and hornblower burst in a tallow dip lit the odd scene and hewitt opened the shutter of the dark lantern to illuminate it further sweeping its beam in a semicircle there were large baulks of timber each set at an angle of fortyfive degrees to act as struts for the mast where floor space remained stood cottage furniture a table and chairs a rush mat on the floor a stove ctard stood in the centre with sword and pistol and at the far side stood a screaming woman she was hugely fat with a tangle of black hair and all she wore was a nightshirt that hardly came to her knees there was an inner door from which emerged a bearded man with hairy legs showing below his shirttails the woman still screamed but ctard spoke loudly in french waving his pistol empty presumably and the noise ceased not perhaps because of ctards threats but because of the womans sheer curiosity regarding these dawn intruders she stood goggling at them making only the most perfunctory gestures to conceal her nakedness but decisions had to be made those screams might have given the alarm and probably had done so against the thick bulk of the semaphore mast a ladder led up to a trap door overhead must be the apparatus for working the semaphore arms the bearded man in his shirt must be the telegraphist a civilian perhaps and he and his wife presumably lived beside their work it must have been convenient for them that the construction of the working platform overhead made it easy to build these cottage rooms underneath hornblower had come to burn the semaphore and burn it he would even if a civilian dwelling were involved the rest of his party were crowding into the livingroom two of the musket men appearing from the bedroom into which they must have made their way by another window hornblower had to stop and think for a perceptible space he had expected that at this moment he would be fighting french soldiers but here he was already in complete possession and with a woman on his hands but his wits returned to him and he was able to put his thoughts in order get out you musket men he said get out to the fence and keep watch ctard up that ladder bring down all the signal books you can find any papers there are quick ill give you two minutes heres the lantern black get something for this woman the clothes from the bedll do and then take these two out and guard em are you ready to burn this place hewitt it flashed through his mind that the moniteur in paris could make a great deal of noise about illtreatment of a woman by the licentious british sailors but it would do that however careful he might be black hung a ragged quilt over the womans shoulders and then hustled his charges out of the front door hewitt had to stop and think he had never set about burning a house before and clearly he did not adapt himself readily to new situations thats the place snapped hornblower pointing to the foot of the telegraph mast there were the great baulks of timber round the mast hornblower joined with hewitt in pushing the furniture under them and then hurried into the bedroom to do the same bring some rags here he called ctard came scrambling down the ladder with one arm full of books now lets start the fire said hornblower it was a strange thing to do in cold blood try the stove suggested ctard hewitt unlatched the door of the stove but it was too hot to touch after that he set his back to the wall and braced his feet against the stove and shoved the stove fell and rolled scattering a few embers over the floor but hornblower had snatched up a handful of blue lights from hewitts bundle the tallow dip was still burning and available to light the fuses the first fuse spluttered and then the firework spouted flames sulphur and saltpetre with a sprinkling of gunpowder blue lights were ideal for this purpose he tossed the blazing thing on to the oily rags lit another and threw it lit another still this was like some scene in hell the uncanny blue gleam lit the room but soon the haze of smoke made everything dim and the fumes of the burning sulphur offended their nostrils as the fireworks hissed and roared while hornblower went on lighting fuses and thrusting the blue lights where they would he most effective in livingroom and bedroom hewitt in an inspired moment tore the rush mat up from the floor and flung it over the rising flames of the rags already the timber was crackling and throwing out showers of yellow sparks to compete with the blue glare and the thickening smoke thatll burn said ctard the flames from the blazing mat were playing on one of the sloping timbers and engendering new flames which licked up the rough wooden surface they stood and watched fascinated on this rocky summit there could be no well no spring and it would be impossible to extinguish this fire once it was thoroughly started the laths of the partition wall were alight in two places where hornblower had thrust blue lights into the crannies he saw the flames at one point suddenly leap two feet up the partition with a volley of loud reports and fresh showers of sparks come on he said outside the air was keen and clear and they blinked their dazzled eyes and stumbled over inequalities at their feet but there was a faint tiny light suffusing the air the first glimmer of daylight hornblower saw the vague shape of the fat woman standing huddled in her quilt she was sobbing in a strange way making a loud gulping noise regularly at intervals of a couple of seconds or so somebody must have kicked over the chicken coop because there seemed to be clucking chickens everywhere in the halflight the interior of the cottage was all ablaze and now there was light enough in the sky for hornblower to see the immense mast of the telegraph against it oddly shaped with its semaphore arms dangling eight stout cables radiated out from it attached to pillars sunk in the rock the cables braced the unwieldy mast against the rude winds of the atlantic and the pillars served also to support the tottering picket fence that surrounded the place there was a pathetic attempt at a garden on small patches of soil that might well have been carried up by hand from the valley below a few pansies a patch of lavender and two unhappy geraniums trodden down by some blunderer yet the light was still only just apparent the flames that were devouring the cottage were brighter he saw illuminated smoke pouring from the side of the upper storey and directly after that flames shot out from between the warping timbers the devil of a collection of ropes and blocks and levers up there said ctard not much of it left by this time no onell put that out now and weve heard nothing from the marines said hornblower come along you men he had been prepared to fight a delaying action with his musket men if the enemy had appeared before the place was well alight now it was unnecessary so well had everything gone so well indeed that it called for a moment or twos delay to collect the men these leisurely minutes had made all haste appear unnecessary as they filed out through the gate there was a slight haze lying over the surface of the summer sea the topsails of the hotspur maintopsail aback were far more visible than her hull a grey pearl in the pearly mist the fat woman stood at the gate all modesty gone with the quilt that had fallen from her shoulders waving her arms and shrieking curses at them from the misty valley on their right as they faced the descent came the notes of a musical instrument some trumpet or bugle thats their reveille commented ctard sliding down the path on hornblowers heels he had hardly spoken when the call was taken up by other bugles a second or two later came the sound of a musket shot and then more musket shots and along with them the echoing roll of a drum and then more drums beating the alarm thats the marines said ctard yes snapped hornblower come on musketry meant a bad mark against the landing party that had gone up against the battery very likely there was a sentry there and he should have been disposed of silently but somehow the alarm had been given the guard had turned out say twenty men armed and equipped and now the main body was being roused that would be the artillery unit in their hutments below the ridge not too effective perhaps fighting with musket and bayonet but over the other side there was a battalion of infantry at this very moment being roused from sleep hornblower had given his order and broken into a run along the righthand path towards the battery before these thoughts had formulated themselves quite so clearly he was ready with his new plan before they topped the ridge halt they assembled behind him load cartridges were bitten open pans were primed and charges poured down the barrels of muskets and pistols the wadded cartridge papers were thrust into the muzzles the bullets were spat in on top and then the ramrods were plied to drive all home ctard take the musket men out to the flank you others come with me there was the great battery with its four thirtytwo pounders looking through the embrasures of its curving parapet beyond it a skirmish line of marines their uniforms showing scarlet in the growing light were holding at bay a french force only outlined by musket flashes and puffs of smoke the sudden arrival of ctard and his men an unknown force on their flank caused the momentary withdrawal of this french force in the centre of the inner face of the parapet captain jones in his red coat with four other men were struggling with a door beside him was laid out a bundle similar to the one hewitt carried blue lights reels of slow match and quick match beyond him lay two dead marines one of them shot hideously in the face jones looked up as hornblower arrived but hornblower wasted no time in discussion stand aside axemen the door was of solid wood and reinforced with iron but it was only intended to keep out thieving civilians a sentry was supposed to guard it and under the thundering of the axes it gave way rapidly the guns are all spiked said jones that was only the smallest part of the business an iron spike driven into the touchhole of a gun would render it useless in the heat of the moment but an armourer working with a drill would clear it in an hours work hornblower was on the step of the parapet looking over the top the french were rallying for a new attack but an axehandle was working as a lever through a gap driven in the door black had hold of the edge of a panel and with a wild effort tore it free a dozen more blows another wrench and there was a way open through the door a crouching man could make his way into the blackness inside ill go said hornblower he could not trust jones or the marines he could trust no one but himself he seized the reel of quick match and squeezed through the shattered door there were timbered steps under his feet but he expected that and so did not fall down them he crouched under the roof and felt his way down there was a landing and a turn and then more steps much darker and then his outstretched hands touched a hanging curtain of serge he thrust this aside and stepped cautiously beyond it here it was utterly black he was in the magazine he was in the area where the ammunition party would wear list slippers because nailed shoes might cause a spark to ignite the gunpowder he felt cautiously about him one hand touched a wall of cartridges serge cylinders ready filled and the other hand touched the harsh outline of a cask those were the powderbarrels his hand involuntarily withdrew itself as though it had touched a snake no time for that sort of idiocy he was surrounded by violent death he drew his cutlass snarling in the darkness with the intensity of his emotion twice he stabbed into the wall of cartridge and his ears were rewarded by the whispering sound of a cascade of powdergrains pouring out through the gashes he had made he must have a firm anchorage for the fuse and he stooped and sank the blade of the cutlass into another cartridge he unravelled a length of quick match and wound a bight firmly round the hilt and he buried the end in the pile of powdergrains on the floor an unnecessarily careful measure perhaps when a single spark would set off the explosion unreeling the quick match behind him carefully very carefully lest he jerk the cutlass loose he made his way out past the curtain again and up the steps up into the growing light round the corner the light through the broken door was dazzling and he blinked as he came out crouching through it still unreeling the quick match cut this he snapped and black whipped out his knife and sawed through the quick match at the point indicated by hornblowers hand quick match burned faster than the eye could follow the fifty feet or so that extended down to the magazine would burn in less than a second cut me a yard off that said hornblower pointing to the slow match slow match was carefully tested it burned in still air at exactly thirty inches in one hour one inch in two minutes hornblower had no intention whatever of allowing an hour or more for the combustion of this yard however he could hear the muskets banging he could hear drums echoing in the hills he must keep calm cut off another foot and light it while black was executing this order hornblower was tying quick match to slow match making sure they were closely joined yet he still had to think of the general situation in addition to these vital details hewitt he snapped looking up from his work listen carefully run to the lieutenants party of marines over the ridge there tell him were going to fall back now and he is to cover our retreat at the last slope above the boats understand aye aye sir then run just as well that it was not grimes who had to be entrusted with the mission the fuses were knotted together now and hornblower looked round him bring that dead man over here black asked no questions but dragged the corpse to the foot of the door hornblower had looked first for a stone but a corpse would be better in every way it was not yet stiff and the arm lay limply across the quick match just above the knot after hornblower had passed all excess slack back through the shattered door the dead man served to conceal the existence of the fuse if the french arrived too early he would gain valuable seconds for the plan the moment the fire reached the quick match it would flash under the dead mans arm and shoot on down to the powder if to investigate the magazine they dragged the corpse out of the way the weight of a fuse inside the door would whisk the knot inside and so gain seconds too perhaps the burning end would tumble down the steps perhaps right into the magazine captain jones warn everybody to be ready to retreat at once please give me that burning fuse black let me do that sir shut your mouth hornblower took the smouldering slow match and blew on it to quicken its life then he looked down at the length of slow match knotted to the quick match he took special note of a point an inch and a half from the knot there was a black spot there which served to mark the place an inch and a half three minutes get up on the parapet black now yell for them to run yell as black began to bellow hornblower pressed the smouldering end down upon the black spot after two seconds he withdrew it the slow match was alight and burning in two directions in one harmlessly towards the inoperative excess and in the other towards the knot the quick match an inch and a half away hornblower made sure it was burning and then he scrambled to his feet and leaped up on the parapet the marines were trooping past him with ctard and his seamen bringing up the rear a minute and a half a minute now and the french were following them up just out of musket range better hurry ctard come on they broke into a jogtrot steady there yelled jones he was concerned about panic among these men if they ran from the enemy instead of retreating steadily but there was a time for everything the marines began to run with jones yelling ineffectually and waving his sword come on jones said hornblower as he passed him but jones was filled with fighting madness and went on shouting defiance at the french standing alone with his face to the enemy then it happened the earth moved back and forth under their feet so that they tripped and staggered while a smashing overwhelming explosion burst on their ears and the sky went dark hornblower looked back a column of smoke was still shooting upwards higher and higher and dark fragments were visible in it then the column spread out mushrooming at the top something fell with a crash ten yards away throwing up chips of stone which rattled round hornblowers feet something came whistling through the air something huge curving down as it twirled selectively inevitably it fell half a ton of rock blown from where it roofed the magazine right on to jones in his red coat sliding along as if bestially determined to wipe out completely the pitiful thing it dragged beneath it hornblower and ctard gazed at it in mesmerized horror as it came to rest six feet from their left hands it was the most difficult moment of all for hornblower to keep his senses or to regain them he had to shake himself out of a daze come on he still had to think clearly they were at the final slope above the boats the lieutenants party of marines sent out as a flank guard had fallen back to this point and were drawn up here firing at a threatening crowd of frenchmen the french wore white facings on their blue uniforms infantry men not the artillery men who had opposed them round the battery and beyond them was a long column of infantry hurrying along with a score of drums beating an exhilarating rhythm the pas de charge you men get down into the boats said hornblower addressing the rallying group of seamen and marines from the battery and then he turned to the lieutenant captain jones is dead make ready to run for it the moment those others reach the jetty yes sir behind hornblowers back turned as it was to the enemy they heard a sharp sudden noise like the impact of a carpenters axe against wood hornblower swung round again ctard was staggering his sword and the books and papers he had carried all this time fallen to the ground at his feet then hornblower noticed his left arm which was swaying in the air as if hanging by a thread then came the blood a musket bullet had crashed into ctards upper armbone shattering it one of the axemen who had not left caught him as he was about to fall ah ah ah gasped ctard with the jarring of his shattered arm he stared at hornblower with bewildered eyes sorry youve been hit said hornblower and to the axeman get him down to the boat ctard was gesticulating towards the ground with his right hand and hornblower spoke to the other axeman pick those papers up and go down to the boat too but ctard was not satisfied my sword my sword ill look after your sword said hornblower these absurd notions of honour were so deeply ingrained that even in these conditions ctard could not bear the thought of leaving his sword on the field of battle hornblower realized he had no cutlass as he picked up ctards sword the axeman had gathered up the books and papers help mr ctard down said hornblower and added as another thought struck him put a scarf round his arm above the wound and strain it tight understand ctard supported by the other axeman was already tottering down the path movement meant agony that heartrending ah ah ah came back to hornblowers ears at every step ctard took here they come said the marine lieutenant the skirmishing frenchmen emboldened by the near approach of their main body were charging forward a hurried glance told hornblower that the others were all down on the jetty the lobsterboat was actually pushing off full of men tell your men to run for it he said and the moment after they started he followed them it was a wild dash slipping and sliding down the path to the jetty with the french yelling in pursuit but here was the covering party as hornblower had ordered so carefully the day before hotspurs own thirteen marines under their own sergeant they had built a breastwork across the jetty again as hornblower had ordered when he had visualized this hurried retreat it was lower than waisthigh hurriedly put together with rocks and fishbarrels full of stones the hurrying mob poured over it hornblower last of all gathered himself together and leaping over it arms and legs flying to stumble on the far side and regain his footing by a miracle hotspurs marines line the barricade get into the boats you others twelve marines knelt at the barricade twelve muskets levelled themselves over it at the sight of them the pursuing french hesitated tried to halt aim low shouted the marine lieutenant hoarsely go back and get the men into the boats mr whatsyourname snapped hornblower have the launch ready to cast off while you shove off in the yawl and get away the french were coming forward again hornblower looked back and saw the lieutenant drop off the jetty on the heels of the last marine now sergeant let em have it fire said the sergeant that was a good volley but there was not a moment to admire it come on yelled hornblower over to the launch with the weight of hotspurs marines leaping into it the launch was drifting away by the time he was at the edge there was a yard of black water for hornblower to leap over but his feet reached the gunnel and he pitched forward among the men clustered there he luckily remembered to drop ctards sword so that he fell harmlessly into the bottom of the boat without wounding anyone oars and boatbooks thrust against the jetty and the launch surged away while hornblower scrambled into the stern sheets he almost stepped on ctards face ctard was lying apparently unconscious on the bottom boards now the oars were grinding in the rowlocks they were twenty yards away thirty yards away before the first frenchmen came yelling along the jetty to stand dancing with rage and excitement on the very edge of the masonry for an invaluable second or two they even forgot the muskets in their hands in the launch the huddled men raised their voices in a yell of derision that excited hornblowers cold rage silence silence all of you the stillness that fell on the launch was more unpleasant than the noise one or two muskets banged off on the jetty and hornblower looking over his shoulder saw a french soldier drop on one knee and take deliberate aim saw him choose a target saw the musket barrel foreshorten until the muzzle was pointed directly at him he was wildly contemplating throwing himself down into the bottom of the boat when the musket went off he felt a violent jar through his body and realized with relief that the bullet had burried itself in the solid oak transom of the launch against which he was sitting he recovered his wits looking forward he saw hewitt trying to force his way aft to his side and he spoke to him as calmly as his excitement permitted hewitt get forard to the gun its loaded with grape fire when it bears then he spoke to the oarsmen and to cargill at the tiller hardaport starboardside oars back water port side back water the launch ceased to turn she was pointed straight at the jetty and hewitt having shoved the other men aside was coldbloodedly looking along the sights of the fourpounder carronade mounted in the bows fiddling with the elevating coign then he leaned over to one side and pulled the lanyard the whole boat jerked sternwards abruptly with the recoil as though when underway she had struck a rock and the smoke came back round them in a sullen pall give way starboard side pull hardastarboard the boat turned ponderously give way port side nine quarter pound grapeshotballs had swept through the group on the jetty there were struggling figures quiescent figures lying there bonaparte had a quarter of a million soldiers under arms but he had now lost some of them it could not be called a drop out of the bucketful but perhaps a molecule now they were out of musket shot and hornblower turned to cargill in the stern sheets beside him you managed your part of the business well enough mr cargill thank you sir cargill had been appointed by hornblower to land with the marines and to take charge of the boats and prepare them for the evacuation but it might have been better if youd sent the launch away first and kept the yawl back until the last then the launch could have lain off and covered the others with her gun i thought of that sir but i couldnt be sure until the last moment how many men would be coming down in the last group i had to keep the launch for that maybe youre right said hornblower grudgingly and then his sense of justice prevailing in fact im sure youre right thank you sir said cargill again and after a pause i wish you had let me come with you sir some people had queer tastes thought hornblower bitterly to himself having regard to ctard lying unconscious with a shattered arm at their feet but he had to smooth down ruffled feelings in these touchy young men thirsting for honour and for the promotion that honour might bring use your wits man he said bracing himself once more to think logically someone had to be in charge on the jetty and you were the best man for the job thank you sir said cargill all over again but still wistfully and therefore still idiotically a sudden thought struck hornblower and he turned and stared back over his shoulder he actually had to look twice although he knew what he was looking for the silhouette of the hills had changed then he saw a wisp of black smoke still rising from the summit the semaphore was gone the towering thing that had spied on their movements and had reported every disposition of the inshore squadron was no more trained british seamen and riggers and carpenters could not replace it if they had such a job to do in less than a weeks work probably the french would take two weeks at least his own estimate would be three and there was hotspur waiting for them maintopsail aback as he had seen her half an hour ago half an hour that seemed like a week the lobsterboat and the yawl were already going round to her port side and cargill steered for her starboard side in these calm waters and with such a gentle wind there was no need for the boats to be offered a lee oars said cargill and the launch ran alongside and there was bush looking down on them from close overhead hornblower seized the enteringropes and swung himself up it was his right as captain to go first and it was also his duty he cut bushs congratulations short get the wounded out as quick as you can mr bush send a stretcher down for mr ctard is he wounded sir yes hornblower had no desire to enter into unnecessary explanations youll have to lash him to it and then sway the stretcher up with a whip from the yardarm his arms in splinters aye aye sir bush by now had realized that hornblower was in no conversational mood the surgeons ready hes started work sir a wave of bushs hand indicated a couple of wounded men who had come on board from the yawl and were being supported below very well hornblower headed for his cabin no need to explain that he had his report to write no need to make excuses but as always after action he yearned for the solitude of his cabin even more than he yearned to sink down and forget his weariness but at the second step he pulled up short this was not a neat clean end to the venture no peace for him at the moment and he swore to himself under this final strain using filthy black blasphemies such as he rarely employed he would have to deal with grimes and instantly he must make up his mind about what he should do punish him punish a man for being a coward that would be like punishing a man for having red hair hornblower stood first on one foot and then on the other unable to pace yet striving to goad his weary mind to further action punish grimes for showing cowardice that was more to the point not that it would do grimes any good but it would deter other men from showing cowardice there were officers who would punish not in the interests of discipline but because they thought punishment should be inflicted in payment for crime as sinners had to go to hell hornblower would not credit himself with the divine authority some officers thought natural but he would have to act he thought of the court martial he would be the sole witness but the court would know he was speaking the truth his word would decide grimes fate and then the hangmans noose or at the very least five hundred lashes with grimes screaming in pain until he should fall unconscious to be nursed round for another day of torture and another after that until he was a gibbering idiot with neither mind nor strength left hornblower hated the thought but he remembered that the crew must have already guessed grimes must have already started his punishment and yet the discipline of the hotspur must be preserved hornblower would have to do his duty he must pay one of the penalties for being a naval officer just as he suffered seasickness just as he risked his life he would have grimes put under arrest at once and while grimes was spending twentyfour hours in irons he could make up his mind to the final decision he strode aft to his cabin with all relief gone from the thought of relaxation then he opened the door and there was no problem left only horror further horror grimes hung there from a rope threaded through the hook that supported the lamp he was swaying with the gentle motion of the ship his feet dragging on the deck so that even his knees were almost on the deck too there was a blackened face and protruding tongue actually there was no likeness to grimes at all in the horrible thing hanging there grimes had not the courage to face the landing operation but when the realization had come to him when the crew had displayed their feelings he had yet had the determination to do this thing to submit himself to this slow strangulation falling with a small preliminary jerk from a cramped position crouching on the cot in all the crew of the hotspur grimes had been the one man who as captains steward could find the necessary privacy to do this thing he had foreseen the flogging or the hanging he had suffered the scorn of his shipmates there was bitter irony in the thought that the semaphore station which he had feared to attack had turned out to be defended by a helpless civilian and his wife hotspur rolled gently on the swell and as she rolled the lolling head and the dangling arms swayed in unison and the feet scraped over the deck hornblower shook off the horror that had seized him drove himself to be clearheaded once more despite his fatigue and his disgust he went to the door of the cabin it was excusable that no sentry had yet been reposted there seeing that the hotspurs marines had only just come on board pass the word for mr bush he said within a minute bush hurried in to pull up short as soon as he saw the thing ill have that removed at once if you please mr bush put it over the side give it a burial christian burial if you like aye aye sir bush shut his mouth after his formal statement of compliance he could see that hornblower was in even less a conversational mood in this cabin than he had been when on deck hornblower passed into the chartroom and squeezed himself into the chair and sat still his hands motionless on the table almost immediately he heard the arrival of the working party bush had sent he heard loud amazed voices and something like a laugh all instantly repressed when they realized that he was next door the voices died to hoarse whispers there was a clump or two and then a dragging noise and he knew the thing was gone then he got to his feet to carry out the resolution formed during his recent clarity of mind he walked firmly into the cabin a little like someone unwillingly going into a duel he did not want to he hated this place but in a tiny ship like hotspur he had nowhere else to go he would have to grow used to it he put aside the weak thought that he could move himself into one of the screenedoff cabins in the tween decks and send for instance the warrant officers up here that would occasion endless inconvenience and even more important endless comment as well he had to use this place and the longer he contemplated the prospect the less inviting it would be and he was so tired he could hardly stand he approached the cot a mental picture developed in his minds eye of grimes kneeling on it rope round his neck to pitch himself off he forced himself coldly to accept that picture as something in the past this was the present and he dropped on to the cot shoes on his feet cutlasssheath at his side sandbag in his pocket grimes was not present to help him with those chapter hornblower had written the address the date and the word sir before he realized that the report would not be so easy to write he was quite sure that this letter would appear in the gazette but he had been sure of that from the moment he had faced the writing of it it would be a gazette letter one of the few out of the many hundreds of reports coming into the admiralty selected for publication and it would be his first appearance in print he had told himself that he would simply write a standard straightforward report along the timehonoured lines yet now he had to stop and think although stage fright had nothing to do with it the publication of this letter meant that it would be read by the whole world it would be read by the whole navy which meant that his subordinates would read it and he knew only too well how every careless word would be scanned and weighed by touchy individuals much more important still it would be read by all england and that meant that maria would read it it would open a peephole into his life that so far she had never been able to look through from the point of view of his standing with the navy it might be desirable to let the dangers he had undergone he apparent in a modest sort of way but that would be in direct contradiction of the breezy lighthearted letter he intended to write to maria maria was a shrewd little person and he could not deceive her to read the gazette letter after his letter would excite her mistrust and apprehension at a moment when she was carrying what might well be the heir to the hornblower name with possibly the worst effects both on maria and on the child he faced the choice and it had to be in favour of maria he would make light of his difficulties and dangers and even then he could still hope that the navy would read between the lines that which maria in her ignorance would not guess at he redipped his pen and bit the end in a momentary mental debate as to whether all the gazette letters he had read had been written in the face of similar difficulties and decided that was probably true of the majority well it had to be written there was no avoiding it for that matter there was no postponing it the necessary preliminary words in accordance with your orders set him off started the flow he had to remember all that he had to put in mr william bush my first lieutenant very handsomely volunteered his services but i directed him to remain in command of the ship later on it was no effort to write lieut charles ctard of hms marlborough who had volunteered for the expedition gave invaluable assistance as a result of his knowledge of the french language i regret very much to have to inform you that he received a wound which necessitated amputation and his life is still in danger then there was something else he had to put in mr what was his first name mr alexander cargill masters mate was allotted by me the duty of superintending the reembarkation which he carried out very much to my satisfaction the next passage would satisfy maria the telegraph station was seized by the party under my personal command without the slightest opposition and was set on fire and completely destroyed after the confidential papers had been secured intelligent naval officers would have a higher opinion of an operation carried through without loss of life than of one which cost a monstrous butchers bill now for the battery he had to be careful about this captain jones of the royal marines having gallantly secured the battery was unfortunately involved in the explosion of the magazine and i much regret to have to report his death while several other royal marines of his party are dead or missing one of them had been as useful dead as alive hornblower checked himself he still could not bear to remember those minutes by the magazine door he went on with his letter lieutenant reid of the royal marines guarded the flank and covered the retreat with small loss his conduct calls for my unreserved approbation that was very true and pleasant to write so was the next passage it is with much gratification that i can inform you that the battery is completely wrecked the parapet is thrown down along with the guns and the guncarriages destroyed as will be understood because not less than one ton of gunpowder was exploded in the battery there were four thirtytwo pounders in that battery a single charge for one of these guns was ten pounds of powder and the magazine sunk deep below the parapets must have contained charges for fifty rounds per gun as a minimum a crater had been left where once the parapet stood not much more to write now the retreat was effected in good order i append the list of killed wounded and missing the rough list lay in front of him and he proceeded to copy it out carefully there were widows and bereaved parents who might derive consolation from the sight of those names in the gazette one seaman had been killed and several slightly wounded he recorded their names and began a fresh paragraph royal marines killed captain henry jones privates a thought struck him at this moment and he paused with his pen in the air there was not only consolation in seeing a name in the gazette parents and widows could receive the back pay of the deceased and some small gratuity he was still thinking when bush came hurrying in the door capn sir id like to show you something from the deck very well ill come he paused for only a short while there was a single name in the paragraph headed seamen killed james johnson ordinary seaman he added another name john grimes captains steward and then he put down the pen and came out on deck look over there sir said bush pointing eagerly ashore and proffering his telescope the landscape was still unfamiliar with the semaphore gone and the battery easily visible previously replaced now by a mound of earth but that was not what bush was referring to there was a considerable body of men on horseback riding along the slopes through the telescope hornblower could fancy he could detect plumes and gold lace those must be generals sir said bush excitedly come out to see the damage the commandant and the governor an the chief engineer an all the rest of em were nearly in range now sir we could drop down without their noticing run out the guns smartly full elevation and we ought to hit a target that size with one shot in a broadside at least sir i think we could agreed hornblower he looked up at the windvane and over at the shore we could wear ship and bush waited for hornblower to complete his speech but the end never came shall i give the order sir there was another pause no said hornblower at last better not bush was too good a subordinate to protest but his disappointment showed plainly enough and it was necessary to soften the refusal with an explanation they might kill a general although the odds were that it would merely be an orderly dragoon on the other hand they would be drawing most forcible attention to the present weakness of this portion of coast then theyll be bringing field batteries went on hornblower only ninepounders but yes sir they might be a nuisance said bush in reluctant agreement do you have anything in mind sir not me him said hornblower all operations of the inshore squadron were pellews responsibility and should be to pellets credit he pointed towards the inshore squadron where pellews broad pendant flew but the broad pendant was to fly there no longer the boat that took hornblowers report to the tonnant returned not only with stores but with official dispatches sir said orrock after handing them over the commodore sent a man with me from the tonnant who carries a letter for you where is he he seemed a very ordinary sort of seaman dressed in the standard clothes of the slop chest his thick blond pigtail as he stood hat in hand indicated that he had long been a seaman hornblower took the letter and broke the seal my dear hornblower it is with infinite pain to myself that i have to confirm the news conveyed to you in the official despatches that your latest report will also be the last that i shall have the pleasure of reading my flag has come and i shall hoist it as rearadmiral commanding the squadron assembling for the blockade of rochefort rear admiral wm parker will take over the command of the inshore squadron and i have recommended you to him in the strongest terms although your actions speak even more strongly for you but commanding officers are likely to have their favourites men with whom they are personally acquainted we can hardly quarrel on this score seeing that i have indulged myself in a favourite whose initials are hh now let us leave this subject for another even more personal i noted in your report that you have had the misfortune to lose your steward and i take the liberty to send you james doughty as a substitute he was steward of the late captain stevens of the magnificent and he has been persuaded to volunteer for the hotspur i understand that he has had much practical experience in attending to gentlemens needs and i hope you will find him suitable and that he will look after you for many years if during that time you are reminded of me by his presence i shall be well satisfied your sincere friend ed pellew even with all his quickness of mind it took hornblower a little while to digest the manifold contents of this letter after reading it it was all bad news bad news about the change of command and just as bad although in a different way that he was being saddled with a gentlemans gentleman who would sneer at his domestic arrangements yet if there was anything that a naval career taught anybody it was to be philosophic about drastic changes doughty said hornblower sir doughty looked respectful but there might be something quizzical in his glance youre going to be my servant do your duty and you have nothing to fear yes sir no sir youve brought your dunnage aye aye sir the first lieutenant will detail someone to show you where to sling your hammock youll share a berth with my clerk the captains steward was the only ordinary seaman in the ship who did not have to sleep in the tiers aye aye sir then you can take up your duties aye aye sir it was only a few minutes later that hornblower in his cabin looked up to find a silent figure slipping in through the door doughty knew that as a personal servant he did not knock if the sentry told him the captain was alone have you had your dinner sir it took a moment to answer that question at the end of a broken day following an entirely sleepless night during that moment doughty looked respectfully over hornblowers left shoulder his eyes were a startling blue no i havent youd better see about something for me replied hornblower yes sir the blue eyes looked round the cabin and found nothing no there are no cabin stores youll have to go to the galley mr simmonds will find something for me the ships cook as a warrant officer rated the mr in front of his name no wait there are two lobsters somewhere in this ship youll find em in a barrel of seawater somewhere on the booms and that reminds me your predecessor has been dead for nearly twentyfour hours and that water hasnt been changed you must do that go to the officer of the watch with my compliments and ask him to put the washdeck pump to work on it thatll keep one lobster alive while i have the other yes sir or you could have this one hot tonight and the other one cold tomorrow if i boil them both now sir i could agreed hornblower without committing himself mayonnaise said doughty are there any eggs in this ship sir any salad oil no there are not rasped hornblower there are no cabin stores whatever in this ship except those two damned lobsters yes sir then ill serve this one with drawn butter and ill see what i can do tomorrow sir do whatever you damned well like and dont trouble me said hornblower he was working into a worse and worse temper he not only had to storm batteries but he also had to remember about keeping lobsters alive and pellew was leaving the brest fleet the official orders he had just read gave details about salutes to the new flags tomorrow and tomorrow this damned doughty and his damned mayonnaise whatever that was would be pawing over his patched shirts yes sir said doughty and disappeared as quietly as he had entered hornblower went out on deck to pace off his bad temper the first breath of the delightful evening air helped to soothe him so too did the hurried movement of everyone on the quarterdeck over to the lee side so as to leave the weather side to him for him there was as much space as heart could desire five long strides forward and aft but all the other officers had now to take the air under crowded conditions let em he had to write out his report to pellew three times the original draught the fair copy and the copy in his confidential letter book some captains gave that work to their clerks but hornblower would not do so captains clerks made a practice of exploiting their confidential position there were officers in the ship who would be glad to hear what their captain said about them and what the future plans might be martin would never have the chance he could confine himself to musterrolls and returns of stores and the other nuisances that plagued a captains life now pellew was leaving them and that was a disaster earlier today hornblower had actually allowed his mind to dally with the notion that some day he might know the inexpressible joy of being made post of being promoted to captain that called for the strongest influence in the fleet and in the admiralty with pellews transfer he had lost a friend in the fleet with parrys retirement he had lost a friend in the admiralty he did not know a single soul there his promotion to commander had been a fantastic stroke of luck when hotspur should be paid off there were three hundred ambitious young commanders all with uncles and cousins and all anxious to take his place he could find himself rotting on the beach on halfpay with maria with maria and the child the reverse side of the penny was no more attractive than the front this was not the way to work off the gloom that threatened to engulf him he had written maria a letter to be proud of reassuring cheerful and as loving as he had found it possible to make it over there was venus shining out in the evening sky this sea air was stimulating refreshing delightful surely this was a better world than his drained nervous condition allowed him to believe it took a full hour of pacing to convince him fully of this at the end of that time the comfortably monotonous exercise had slowed down his overactive mind he was healthily tired now and the moment he thought about it he knew he was ravenously hungry he had seen doughty flitting about the deck more than once for however lost in distraction hornblower might be he nevertheless took instant note consciously or subconsciously of everything that went on in the ship he was growing desperately impatient and night had entirely closed in when his pacing was intercepted your dinners ready sir doughty stood respectfully in front of him very well ill come hornblower sat himself down at the chartroom table doughty standing at his chair in the cramped space one moment sir while i bring your dinner from the galley may i pour you some cider sir pour me some but doughty was already pouring from jug to cup and then he vanished hornblower tasted gingerly there was no doubt about it it was excellent cider rough and yet refined fruity and yet in no way sweet after water months in cask it was heavenly he only took two preliminary sips before his head went back and the whole cupful shot delightfully down his throat he had not begun to debate this curious phenomenon when doughty slipped into the chartroom again the plate is hot sir he said what the devils this asked hornblower lobster cutlets sir said doughty pouring more cider and then with a gesture not quite imperceptible he indicated the wooden saucer he had laid on the table at the same time butter sauce sir extraordinary there were neat brown cutlets on his plate that bore no outward resemblance to lobster but when hornblower cautiously added sauce and tasted the result was excellent minced lobster and when doughty took the cover off the cracked vegetable dish there was a dream of delight revealed new potatoes golden and lovely he helped himself hurriedly and very nearly burned his mouth on them nothing could be quite as nice as the first new potatoes of the year these came with the ships vegetables sir explained doughty i was in time to save them hornblower did not need to ask from what those new potatoes had been saved he knew a good deal about huffnell the purser and he could guess at the appetite of the wardroom mess lobster cutlets and new potatoes and this pleasant butter sauce he was enjoying his dinner resolutely putting aside the knowledge that the ships biscuit in the bread barge was weevily he was used to weevils which always showed up after the first month at sea or earlier if the biscuit had been long in store he told himself as he took another mouthful of lobster cutlet that he would not allow a weevil in his biscuit to be a fly in his ointment he took another pull at the cider before he remembered to ask where it came from i pledged your credit for it sir said doughty i took the liberty of doing so to the extent of a quarter of a pound of tobacco who had it sir said doughty i promised not to say oh very well said hornblower there was only one source for cider the camilla the lobsterboat he had seized last night of course the breton fishermen who manned it would have a keg on board and somebody had looted it martin his clerk most likely i hope you bought the whole keg said hornblower only some of it i am afraid sir all that remained out of a twogallon keg of cider hornblower hoped it might be more martin could hardly have downed more than a gallon in twentyfour hours and doughty must have noted the presence of a keg in the berth he shared with martin hornblower was quite sure that more pressure than the offer of a mere quarter of a pound of tobacco had been applied to make martin part with the keg but he did not care cheese sir said doughty hornblower had eaten everything else in sight and the cheese the ration cheese supplied for the ships company was reasonably good and the butter was fresh a new firkin must have come in the boat and doughty must somehow have got at it although the rancid previous assignment had not been used up the cider jug was empty and hornblower felt more comfortable than he had felt for days ill go to bed now he announced yes sir doughty opened the chartroom door and hornblower passed into his cabin the lamp swayed from the deck beam the patched nightshirt was laid out on the cot perhaps it was because he was full of cider that hornblower did not resent doughtys presence as he brushed his teeth and made ready for bed doughty was at hand to take his coat as he pulled it off doughty retrieved his trousers when he let them fall doughty hovered by as he dropped into bed and pulled the blankets over him ill brush this coat sir heres your bed gown if youre called in the night sir shall i put out the lamp sir yes good night sir it was not until next morning that hornblower remembered again that grimes had hanged himself in this cabin it was not until next morning that he remembered those minutes down in the magazine with the gunpowder doughty had already proved his worth chapter the salutes had been fired pellews flag had been hoisted and then the tonnant had sailed away to initiate the blockade of rochefort the dreadnought had hoisted admiral parkers flag and each flag had received thirteen guns from every ship the french on their hillsides must have seen the smoke and heard the firing and the naval officers among them must have deduced that one more rear admiral had joined the channel fleet and must have shaken their heads a little sadly at this further proof that the british navy was increasing its lead over the french in the race to build up maritime strength hornblower peering up the goulet over the black shapes of the little girls could count the vessels of war swinging to their anchors in brest roads eighteen ships of the line now and seven frigates but with subminimum crews and incomplete stores no match for the fifteen superb ships of the line under cornwallis who waited for them outside growing daily in efficiency and in moral ascendancy nelson off toulon and now pellew off rochefort similarly challenged inferior french squadrons and under their protection the merchant fleets of britain sailed the seas unmolested except by privateers and the merchant fleet themselves bunched in vast convoys received constant close cover from further british squadrons of a total strength even exceeding that of the blockading fleets cordage and hemp timber and iron and copper turpentine and salt cotton and nitre could all flow freely to the british isles and be as freely distributed round them maintaining the ship yards in constant activity whilst the french yards were doomed to idleness to the gangrene that follows the cutting off of the circulation but the situation was nevertheless not without peril along the channel coast bonaparte had two hundred thousand soldiers the most formidable army in the world and collecting in the channel ports from st malo to ostend and beyond was a flotilla of seven thousand flatbottomed boats admiral keith with his frigates backed by a few ships of the line had the channel secure against bonapartes threat there was no chance of invasion as long as england held naval command of the channel yet in a sense that command was precarious if the eighteen ships of the line in brest roads could escape could round ushant and come upchannel with cornwallis distracted in some fashion keith might be driven away might be destroyed three days would be sufficient to put bonapartes army into the boats and across the channel and bonaparte would be issuing decrees from windsor castle as he had already done from milan and brussels cornwallis and his squadron hotspur and her mightier colleagues were what made this impossible a moment of carelessness a misjudged movement and the tricolour might fly over the tower of london hornblower counted the ships in brest roads and as he did so he was very conscious that this morning routine was the ultimate most insolent expression of the power of england at sea england had a heart a brain an arm and he and hotspur were the final sensitive fingertip of that long arm nineteen ships of the line at anchor two of them threedeckers seven frigates they were the ones he had observed yesterday nothing had contrived to slip out unnoticed during the night by the passage of the four or the raz mr foreman signal to the flag if you please enemy at anchor situation unchanged foreman had made that signal several times before but while hornblower watched him unobtrusively he checked the numbers in the signal book it was foremans business to know all the thousand arbitrary signals off by heart but it was best when time allowed that he should corroborate what his memory told him an error of a digit might send the warning that the enemy was coming out flag acknowledges sir reported foreman very well poole as officer of the watch made note of the incident in the rough log the hands were washing down the deck the sun was lifting over the horizon it was a beautiful day with every promise of being a day like any other seven bells sir reported prowse only half an hour more of the ebb time to withdraw from this lee shore before the flood set in mr poole wear the ship if you please course west by north good morning sir good morning mr bush bush knew better than to indulge in further conversation besides he could devote his attention to watching how smartly the hands braced the maintopsail round and how poole handled the ship when the topsails filled hornblower swept the northern shore seeking as ever for any signs of change his attention was concentrated on the ridge beyond which captain jones had met his death when poole reported again winds come westerly sir cant make west by north make it west norwest replied hornblower his eye still to the telescope aye aye sir west norwest full and bye there was a hint of relief in pooles voice an officer is likely to be apprehensive when he has to tell his captain that the last order was impossible to execute hornblower was aware that bush had taken his stand beside him with his telescope trained in the same direction a column of troops sir said bush yes hornblower had detected the head of the column crossing the ridge he was watching now to see to what length the column would stretch it continued interminably over the ridge appearing through his glass like some caterpillar hurrying over the even rougher hillside ah there was the explanation beside the caterpillar appeared a string of ants hurrying even faster along the path field artillery six guns and limbers with a wagon bringing up the rear the head of the caterpillar was already over the farther ridge before the tail appeared over the nearer one that was a column of infantry more than a mile long five thousand men or more a division of infantry with its attendant battery it might be merely a portion of the garrison of brest turning out for exercises and manoeuvres on the hillside but its movements were somewhat more hurried and purposeful than would be expected in that case he swept his glass farther round the coast and then checked it with a start and a gulp of excitement there were the unmistakable lugsails of a french coaster coming round the bold headland of point matthew there was another pair a whole cluster could it possibly be that a group of coasters was trying to run the blockade into brest in broad daylight in the teeth of hotspur hardly likely now there was a bang bang bang of guns presumably from the field battery invisible over the farther ridge behind the coasters appeared a british frigate and then another showing up at the moment when the coasters began to go about as the coasters tacked they revealed that they had no colours flying prizes sir and thats naiad an doris said bush the two british frigates must have swooped down during the night by the passage of the four inshore of ushant and cut out these coasters from the creeks of le conquet where they had been huddled for shelter a neat piece of work undoubtedly but bringing them out had only been made possible by the destruction of the battery on the petit minou the frigates tacked in the wake of the coasters like shepherd dogs following a flock of sheep they were escorting their prizes in triumph back to the inshore squadron whence presumably they would be dispatched to england for sale bush had taken his telescope from his eye and had turned his gaze full on hornblower while prowse came up to join them six prizes sir said bush a thousand pound each those coasters run sir said prowse more if its naval stores and i expect it is six thousand pound seven thousand an no trouble selling em sir by the terms of the royal proclamation issued on the declaration of war prizes taken by the royal navy became as was traditional by now the absolute property of the captors and we werent in sight sir said bush the proclamation also laid down the proviso that the value of the prizes after a deduction for flag officers should be shared among those ships in sight at the moment the colours came down or possession was secured we couldnt expect to be said hornblower he was honestly implying that hotspur was too preoccupied with her duty of watching the goulet but the others misinterpreted the speech no sir not with bush broke off what he was saying before he became guilty of mutiny he had been about to continue not with admiral parker in command but he had more sense than to say it after hornblowers meaning had become clear to him one eighthd be nigh on a thousand pounds said prowse an eighth of the value of the prizes was by the proclamation to be divided among the lieutenants and masters taking part in the capture of the ships hornblower was making a different calculation the share of the captains was twoeighths if hotspur had been associated in the venture with naiad and doris he would have been richer by five hundred pounds and it was us that opened the way for em sir went on prowse it was you sir who bush broke off his speech for the second time thats the fortune of war said hornblower lightly or the misfortune of war hornblower was quite convinced that the whole system of prize money was vicious and tended towards making the navy less effective in war he told himself that this was sour grapes that he would think differently if he had won great amounts of prize money but that did not soften his present conviction forard there yelled poole from beside the binnacle get the lead going in the main chains the three senior officers beside the hammock nettings came back to the present world with a general start hornblower felt a chill wave of horror over his ribs as he realized his inexcusable carelessness he had forgotten all about the course he had set hotspur was sailing tranquilly into peril was in danger of running aground and it was his fault the result of his own inattentionhe had no time for selfreproach at the present moment all the same he lifted his voice trying to pitch it steadily thank you mr poole he called belay that order put the ship on the other tack if you please bush and prowse were wearing guilty hangdog looks it had been their duty it had been prowses particular duty to warn him when hotspur was running into navigational dangers they would not meet his eye they tried to assume a pose of exaggerated interest in pooles handling of the ship as she went about the yards creaked as she came round the sails flapped and then drew again the wind blew on their faces from a different angle hardalee ordered poole completing the manoeuvre foretack haul the bowlines hotspur settled down on her new course away from the dangerous shore to which she had approached too close and all danger was averted you see gentlemen said hornblower coldly and he waited until he had the full attention of bush and prowse you see there are many disadvantages about the system of prize money i am aware now of a new one and i hope you are too thank you that will do he remained by the hammock netting as they slunk away he was taking himself to task it was his first moment of carelessness in a professional career of ten years he had made mistakes through ignorance through recklessness but never carelessness before if there had been a fool as officer of the watch just now utter ruin would have been possible if hotspur had gone aground in clear weather and a gentle breeze it would have been the end of everything for him court martial and dismissal from the service and then in his bitter selfcontempt he told himself that he would not be capable even of begging his bread to say nothing of marias he might perhaps ship before the mast and with his clumsiness and abstraction he would be the victim of the cat of the boatswains rattan death would be better he shuddered with cold now he turned his attention to poole standing impassive by the binnacle what had been the motives that had impelled him to order the lead into use had it been mere precaution or had it been a tactful way of calling his captains attention to the situation of the ship his present manner and bearing gave no hint of the answer hornblower had studied his officers carefully since hotspur was commissioned he was not aware of any depths of ingenuity or tact in poole but he freely admitted to himself that they might exist unobserved in any case he must allow for them he sauntered down the quarterdeck thank you mr poole he said slowly and very distinctly poole touched his hat in reply but his homely face did not change its expression hornblower walked on nettled amused that his questions remained unanswered it was a momentary relief from the torments of conscience which still plagued him the lesson he had learned remained with him during that summer to trouble his conscience otherwise during those golden months the blockade of brest might have been for hotspur and hornblower a yachting holiday a holiday with a certain macabre quality just as some lay theologians advanced the theory that in hell sinners would be punished by being forced to repeat in unutterable tedium and surfeit the sins they had committed during life so hornblower spent those delightful months doing delightful things until he felt he could not do them any longer day after day and night after night through the finest summer in human memory hotspur cruised in the approaches to brest she pressed up to the goulet with the last of the flood and cannily withdrew in to safety with the last of the ebb she counted the french fleet she reported the result of her observations to admiral parker she drifted hoveto over calm seas amid gentle breezes with westerly winds she worked her way out to give the lee shore a wide berth with easterly winds she beat back again to beard the impotent french in their safe harbour they were months of frightful peril for england with the grande arme two hundred thousand strong poised within thirty miles of the kentish beaches but they were months of tranquillity for hotspur even with a score of hostile battleships in sight there were occasional flurries when the coasters tried too boldly to enter or leave there were occasional busy moments when squalls came down and topsails had to be reefed there were encounters after dark with fishing vessels conversations over a glass of rum with the breton captains purchases of crabs and lobsters and pilchards and of the latest decree of the inscription maritime or of a weekold copy of the moniteur hornblowers telescope revealed antlike hordes of workmen rebuilding the blownup batteries and for a couple of weeks he watched the building of scaffolding and the erection of sheers on the petit minou and for three continuous days as a result the slow elevation to the vertical of the new mast of the semaphore station the subsequent days added horizontal and vertical arms before the summer was over those arms were whirling about reporting once more the movements of the blockading squadron much good might that do the french huddled in their anchored ships in the roads inertia and a sense of inferiority would work their will on the unfortunate crews the ships ready for sea might slowly increase in number men might slowly be found for them but every day the balance of fighting quality of naval power swung faster and faster over in favour of the british constantly exercising at sea and constantly reinforced by the seaborne tribute of the world there was a price to be paid the dominion of the seas was not given freely by destiny the channel fleet paid in blood in lives as well as in the sacrifice of the freedom and leisure of every officer and man on board there was a constant petty drain ordinary sickness took only small toll among men in the prime of life isolated from the rest of the world illnesses were few although it was noticeable that after the arrival of victualling ships from england epidemics of colds would sweep through the fleet while rheumatism the sailors disease was always present the losses were mainly due to other causes there were men who in a moment of carelessness or inattention fell from the yard there were the men who ruptured themselves and they were many for despite the ingenuity of blocks and tackles there were heavy weights to haul about by sheer manpower there were crushed fingers and crushed feet when ponderous casks of salted provisions were lowered into boats from the storeships and hauled up on to the decks of the fighting ships and frequently a lacerated limb would end despite all the care of the surgeons in gangrene in amputation and death there were the careless men who during target practice with the cannon lost their arms by ramming a cartridge into an improperly sponged gun or who did not remove themselves from the line of recoil three times that year there were men who died in quarrels when boredom changed to hysteria and knives were drawn and on each of those occasions another life was lost a life for a life a hanging with the other ships clustered round and the crews lining the sides to learn what happened when a man lost his temper and once the crews manned the sides to see what happened when a wretched young seaman paid the price for a crime worse even than murder for raising his fist to his superior officer incidents of that sort were inevitable as the ships beat back and forth monotonously over the eternal grey inhospitable sea it was well for the hotspur that she was under the command of a man to whom any form of idleness or monotony was supremely distasteful the charts of the iroise were notoriously inaccurate hotspur set herself to run line after line of soundings to take series after series of careful triangulations from the headlands and hilltops when the fleet ran short of silver sand so necessary to keep the decks spotless white it was hotspur who supplied the deficiency finding tiny lost beaches round the coast where a park could land trespassing upon bonapartes vaunted dominion over europe to fill sacks with the precious commodity there were fishing competitions whereby the lowerdecks rooted objection to fish as an item of diet was almost overcome a prize of a pound of tobacco for the biggest catch by an individual mess set all the messes to work on devising more novel fishhooks and baits there were experiments in shiphandling when obsolescent and novel methods were tested when by careful and accurate measurement with the log the effect of goosewinging the topsails was ascertained or it being assumed that the rudder was lost the watch keeping officers tried their hands at manoeuvring the ship by the sails alone hornblower himself found mental exercise in working out navigational problems conditions were ideal for taking lunar observations and by their aid it was possible to arrive at an accurate determination of longitude a subject of debate since the days of the carthaginians at the cost of endless calculations hornblower was determined to perfect himself in this method and his officers and young gentlemen bewailed the decision for they too had to make lunar observations and work out the resulting sums the longitude of the little girls was calculated on board the hotspur a hundred times that summer with nearly a hundred different results to hornblower it was a satisfactory occupation the more satisfactory as it became obvious that he was acquiring the necessary knack he tried to acquire the same facility in another direction without the same satisfaction as he wrote his weekly letters to maria there was only a limited number of endearments only a limited number of ways of saying that he missed her that he hoped her pregnancy was progressing favourably there was only the one way of excusing himself for not returning to england as he had promised to do and maria was inclined to be a little peevish in her letters regarding the exigencies of the service when the waterhoys arrived periodically and the enormous labour had to be undertaken of transferring the already stale liquid into the hotspur hornblower always found himself thinking that getting those eighteen tons of water on board meant another month of writing letters to maria chapter hotspurs bell struck two double strokes it was six oclock in the evening and the first dog watch had come to an end in the gathering darkness sunset sir said bush yes agreed hornblower six oclock exactly the equinox sir yes agreed hornblower again he knew perfectly well what was coming well have a westerly gale sir or my names not william bush very likely said hornblower who had been sniffing the air all day long hornblower was a heretic in this matter he did not believe that the mere changing from a day a minute longer than twelve hours to one a minute shorter made gales blow from out of the west gales happened to blow at this time because winter was setting in but ninetynine men out of a hundred firmly believed in a more direct although more mysterious causation winds freshening and seas getting up a bit sir went on bush inexorably yes hornblower fought down the temptation to declare that it was not because the sun happened to set at six oclock for he knew that if he expressed such an opinion it would be received with the tolerant and concealed disagreement accorded to the opinions of children and eccentrics and captains weve water for twentyeight days sir twentyfour allowing for spillage and ullage thirtysix on short allowance corrected hornblower yes sir said bush with a world of significance in those two syllables ill give the order within a week said hornblower no gale could be expected to blow for a month continuously but a second gale might follow the first before the waterhoys could beat down from plymouth to refill the casks it was a tribute to the organization set up by cornwallis that during nearly six continuous months at sea hotspur had not yet had to go on short allowance for water should it become necessary it would be one more irksome worry brought about by the passage of time thank you sir said bush touching his hat and going off about his business along the darkened reeling deck there were worries of all sorts yesterday morning doughty had pointed out to hornblower that there were holes appearing in the elbows of his uniform coat and he only had two coats apart from full dress doughty had done a neat job of patching but a search through the ship had not revealed any material of exactly the right weatherbeaten shade furthermore the seats of nearly all his trousers were paperthin and hornblower did not fancy himself in the baggy slopchest trousers issued to the lowerdeck yet as that store was fast running out he had had to secure a pair for himself before they should all go he was wearing his thick winter underclothing three sets had appeared ample last april but now he faced the prospect in a gale of frequent wettings to the skin with small chance of drying anything he cursed himself and went off to try to make sure of some sleep in anticipation of a disturbed night at least he had a good dinner inside him doughty had braised an oxtail the most despised and rejected of all the portions of the weekly ration bullock and had made of it a dish fit for a king it might be his last good dinner for a long time if the gale lasted winter affected land as well as sea so that he could expect no other vegetables than potatoes and boiled cabbage until next spring his anticipation of a disturbed night proved correct he had been awake for some time feeling the lively motion of the hotspur and trying to make up his mind to rise and dress or to shout for a light and try to reads when they came thundering on his door signal from the flag sir ill come doughty was really the best of servants he arrived at the same moments with a storm lantern youll need your pea jacket sir and oilskins over it your souwester sir better have your scarf sir to keep your pea jacket dry a scarf round his neck absorbed spray that might otherwise drive in between souwester and oilskin coat and soak the pea jacket doughty tucked hornblower into his clothes like a mother preparing her son for school while they reeled and staggered on the leaping deck then hornblower went out into the roaring darkness a white rocket and two blue lights from the flag sir reported young that means take offshore stations thank you what sail have we set hornblower could guess the answer by the feel of the ship but he wanted to be sure it was too dark for his dazzled eyes to see as yet double reefed topsls and main course sir get that course in and lay her on the port tack port tack aye aye sir the signal for offshore stations meant a general withdrawal of the channel fleet the main body took stations seventy miles to seaward off brest safe from that frightful lee shore and with a clear run open to them for tor bay avoiding ushant on the one hand and the start on the other should the storm prove so bad as to make it impossible to keep the sea the inshore squadron was to be thirty miles closer in they were the most weatherly ships and could afford the additional risk in order to be close up to brest should a sudden shift of wind enable the french to get out but there was not merely the question of the french coming out but of other french ships coming in out in the atlantic there were more than one small french squadron bonapartes own brother was on board one of them with his american wife seeking urgently to regain a french port before food and water should be completely exhausted so naiad and doris and hotspur had to stay close in to intercept and report they could best encounter the dangers of the situation and they could best be spared if they could not so hotspur had to take her station only twenty miles to the west of ushant where french ships running before the gale could be best expected to make their landfall bush loomed up in the darkness shouting over the gale the equinox just as i said sir yes itll be worse before its better sir no doubt hotspur was closehauled now soaring pitching and rolling over the vast invisible waves that the gale was driving in upon her port bow hornblower felt resentfully that bush was experiencing pleasure at this change of scene a brisk gale and a struggle to windward was stimulating to bush after long days of fair weather while hornblower struggled to keep his footing and felt a trifle doubtful about the behaviour of his stomach as a result of this sudden change the wind howled round them and the spray burst over the deck so that the black night was filled with noise hornblower held on to the hammock netting the circus riders he had seen in his childhood riding round the ring standing upright on two horses with one foot on each had no more difficult task than he had at present and the circus riders were not smacked periodically in the face with bucketfuls of spray there were small variations in the violence of the wind they could hardly be called gusts hornblower took note that they were increases in force without any corresponding decreases through the soles of his feet through the palms of his hands he was aware of a steady increase in hotspurs heel and a steady stiffening in her reaction she was showing too much canvas with his mouth a yard from youngs ear he yelled his order four reefs in the topsls aye aye sir the exaggerated noises of the night were complicated now with the shrilling of the pipes of the bosns mates down in the waist the orders were bellowed at hurrying staggering men all hands reef topsls the hands clawed their way to their stations this was the moment when a thousand drills bore fruit when men carried out in darkness and turmoil the duties that had been ingrained into them in easier conditions hornblower felt hotspurs momentary relief as young set the topsails ashiver to ease the tension on them now the men were going aloft to perform circus feats compared with which his maintenance of his foothold was a trifle no trapeze artist ever had to do his work in utter darkness on something as unpredictable as a footrope in a gale or had to exhibit the trained strength of the seaman passing the earring while hanging fifty feet above an implacable sea even the lion tamer keeping a wary eye on his treacherous brutes did not have to encounter the ferocious enmity of the soulless canvas that tried to tear the topmost men from their precarious footing a touch of the helm set the sails drawing again and hotspur lay over in her fierce struggle with the wind surely there was no better example of the triumph of mans ingenuity over the blind forces of nature than this whereby a ship could wring advantage out of the actual attempt of the gale to push her to destruction hornblower clawed his way to the binnacle and studied the heading of the ship working out mental problems of drift and leeway against the background of his mental picture of the trend of the land prowse was there apparently doing the same thing i should think weve made our offing sir prowse had to shout each syllable separately hornblower had to do the same when he replied well hold on a little longer while we can extraordinary how rapidly time went by in these circumstances it could not be long now until daylight and this storm was still working up it was nearly twentyfour hours since hornblower had detected the premonitory symptoms and it had not yet reached its full strength it was likely to blow hard for a considerable time as much as three days more possibly even longer than that even when it should abate the wind might stay westerly for some considerable further time delaying the waterhoys and the victuallers in their passage from plymouth and when eventually they should come hotspur might well be up in her station off the goulet mr bush hornblower had to reach out and touch bushs shoulder to attract his attention in the wind well reduce the water allowance from today two between three aye aye sir just as well i think sir bush gave little thought to hardship either for the lowerdeck or for himself it was no question of giving up a luxury to reduce the water ration meant an increase in hardship the standard issue of a gallon a day a head was hardship even though a usual one a man could just manage to survive on it two thirds of a gallon a day was a horrible deprivation after a few days thirst began to colour every thought as if in mockery the pumps were going at this moment the elasticity and springiness that kept hotspur from breaking up under these strains meant also that the sea had greater opportunities of penetrating her fabric working its way in through the straining seams both above and below the water line it would accumulate in the bilge one two three feet deep while the storm blew most of the crew would have six hours hard physical work a day an hour each watch pumping the water out here was the grey dawn coming and the wind was still increasing and hotspur could not battle against it any longer mr cargill cargill was now officer of the watch well heave to put her under maintopmast staysl hornblower had to shout the order at the top of his lungs before cargill nodded that he understood all hands all hands some minutes of hard work effected a transformation without the immense leverage of the topsails hotspur ceased to lie over quite so steeply the more gentle influence of the maintopmast staysail kept her reasonably steady and now the rudder desisted from its hitherto constant effort to force the little ship to battle into the wind now she rose and swooped more freely more extravagantly yet with less strain she was leaping wildly enough and still shipping water over her weather bow but her behaviour was quite different as she yielded to the wind instead of defying it at the risk of being torn apart bush was offering him a telescope and pointing to windward where there was now a grey horizon dimly to be seen a serrated horizon jagged with the waves hurrying towards them hornblower braced himself to put two hands to the telescope sea and then sky raced past the object glass as hotspur tossed over successive waves it was hard to sweep the area indicated by bush that had to be done in fits and starts but after a moment something flashed across the field was recaptured many hours of using a telescope had developed hornblowers reflex skills and soon could be submitted to intermittent yet close observation naiad sir shouted bush into his ear the frigate was several miles to windward hoveto like hotspur she had one of those new stormtopsails spread very shallow and without reefs it might be of considerable advantage when lyingto for even the reduction in height alone would be considerable but when hornblower turned his attention back to the hotspur and observed her behaviour under her maintopmast staysail he felt no dissatisfaction politeness would have led him to comment on it when he handed back the glass but politeness stood no chance against the labour of making conversation in the wind and he contented himself with a nod but the sight of naiad out there to westward was confirmation that hotspur was on her station and beyond her hornblower had glimpses of the doris reeling and tossing on the horizon he had done all there was to be done at present a sensible man would get his breakfast while he might and a sensible man would resolutely ignore the slight question of stomach occasioned by this new and different motion of the ship all he had to do now was to endure it there was a pleasant moment when he reached his cabin and huffnell the purser came in to make his morning report for then it appeared that at the first indication of trouble bush and huffnell between them had routed out simmonds the cook and had set him to work cooking food thats excellent mr huffnell it was laid down in your standing orders sir so it was hornblower remembered he had added that paragraph after reading cornwalliss orders regarding stations to be assumed in westerly gales simmonds had boiled three hundred pounds of salt pork in hotspurs cauldrons as well as three hundred pounds of dried peas before the weather had compelled the galley fires to be extinguished pretty nigh on cooked anyway sir said huffnell so that for the next three days four at a pinch the hands would have something more to eat than dry biscuit they would have cold parboiled pork and cold pease porridge the latter was what the man in the moon burned his mouth on according to the nursery rhyme thank you mr huffnell its unlikely that this gale will last more than four days that was actually the length of time that gale lasted the gale that ushered in the worst winter in human memory following the best summer for those four days hotspur lay hoveto pounded by the sea flogged by the wind while hornblower made anxious calculations regarding leeway and drift as the wind backed northerly his attention was diverted from ushant to the north to the isle de sein to the south of the approaches to brest it was not until the fifth day that hotspur was able to set threereefed topsails and thrash her way back to station while simmonds managed to start his galley fires again and to provide the crew and hornblower with hot boiled beef as a change from cold boiled pork even then that threereefed gale maintained the long atlantic rollers in all their original vastness so that hotspur soared over them and slithered unhappily down the far side adding her own corkscrew motion as her weatherbow met the swells her own special stagger when a rogue wave crashed into her and the worse lurch when infrequently a higher wave than usual blanketed her sails so that she reeled over her decks but an hours work at the pumps every watch kept the bilges dear and by tacking every two hours hotspur was able to beat painfully out to sea again not more than half a miles gain to windward on each tack and recover the comparative safety of her original station before the next storm it was as if in payment for that fair weather summer that these gales blew and perhaps that was not an altogether fanciful thought to hornblowers mind there might be some substance to the theory that prolonged local high pressure during the summer now meant that the pentup dirty weather to the westward could exert more than its usual force however that might be the mere fresh gale that endured for four days after the first storm then worked up again into a tempest blowing eternally from the westward with almost hurricane force grey dreary days of lowering cloud and wild black nights with the wind howling unceasingly in the rigging until the ear was sated with the noise until no price seemed too great to pay for five minutes of peace and yet no price however great could buy even a second of peace the creaking and the groaning of hotspurs fabric blended with the noise of the wind and the actual woodwork of the ship vibrated with the vibration of the rigging until it seemed as if body and mind exhausted with the din and with the fatigues of mere movement could not endure for another minute and yet went on to endure for days the tempest died down to a fresh gale to a point when the topsails needed only a single reef and then unbelievably worked up into a tempest again the third in a month during which all on board renewed the bruises that covered them as a result of being flung about by the motion of the ship and it was during that tempest that hornblower went through a spiritual crisis it was not a mere question of calculation it went far deeper than that even though he did his best to appear quite imperturbable as bush and huffnell and wallis the surgeon made their daily reports he might have called them into a formal council of war he might have covered himself by asking for their opinions in writing to be produced in evidence should there be a court of inquiry but that was not in his nature responsibility was the air he breathed he could no more bring himself to evade it than he could hold his breath indefinitely it was the first day that reefed topsails could be set that he reached his decision mr prowse id be obliged if you would set a course to close naiad so that she can read our signals aye aye sir hornblower standing on the quarterdeck in the eternal infernal wind hated prowse for darting that inquiring glance at him of course the wardroom had discussed his problem of course they knew of the shortage of drinking water of course they knew that wallis had discovered three cases of sore gums the earliest symptoms of scurvy in a navy that had overcome scurvy except in special conditions of course they had wondered about when their captain would yield to circumstances perhaps they had made bets on the date the problem the decision had been his and not theirs hotspur clawed her way over the tossing sea to the point on naiads lee bow when the signal flags would blow out at right angles to the line of sight mr foreman signal to naiad if you please request permission to return to port request permission to return to port aye aye sir naiad was the only ship of the inshore squadron of the channel fleet in sight and her captain was therefore senior officer on the station every captain was senior to the captain of the hotspur naiad acknowledges sir reported foreman and then after ten seconds wait naiad to hotspur sir interrogative somehow it might have been more politely put chambers of the naiad might have signalled kindly give reasons for request or something like that but the single interrogative hoist was convenient and rapid hornblower framed his next signal equally tersely hotspur to naiad eight days water hornblower watched the reply soar up naiads signal halliards it was not the affirmative if it was permission it was a qualified permission naiad to hotspur sir remain four more days thank you mr foreman hornblower tried to keep all expression out of his voice and his face ill wager he has two months water on board sir said bush angrily i hope he has mr bush they were seventy leagues from tor bay two days sailing with a fair wind there was no margin for misfortune if at the end of four days the wind should shift easterly as was perfectly possible they could not reach tor bay in a week or even more the waterhoys might come downchannel but might easily not find them at once and then it was not unlikely that the sea would be too rough for boat work there was an actual possibility that the crew of the hotspur might die of thirst it had not been easy for hornblower to make his request he had no desire to be thought one of those captains whose sole desire was to return to port and he had waited to the last sensible moment chambers saw the problem differently as a man well might do as regards the possible misfortune of other people this was an easy way of demonstrating his resolution and firmness an easy way a comfortable way a cheap way send this signal if you please mr foreman thank you am returning to station goodbye mr prowse we can bear away when that signal is acknowledged mr bush from today the water ration is reduced one between two two quarts of water a day for all purposes and such water to men living on salted food was far below the minimum for health it meant sickness as well as discomfort but the reduction also meant that the last drop of water would not be drunk until sixteen days had passed captain chambers had not foreseen the future weather and perhaps he could not be blamed for that seeing that on the fourth day after the exchange of signals the westerly wind worked up again unbelievably into the fourth tempest of that galeridden autumn it was towards the end of the afternoon watch that hornblower was called on deck again to give his permission for the reefed topsails to be got in and the storm staysail set once more significantly it was growing dark already the days of the equinox when the sun set at six oclock were long past and equally significantly that roaring westerly gale now had a chilling quality about it it was cold not freezing not icy but cold searchingly cold hornblower tried to pace the unstable deck in an endeavour to keep his circulation going he grew warm not because of his walking but because the physical labour of keeping his feet was great enough for the purpose hotspur was leaping like a deer beneath him and from down below too came the dreary sound of the pumps at work six days water on board now twelve at halfrations the gloom of the night was no more gloomy than his thoughts it was five weeks since he had last been able to send a letter to maria and it was six weeks since he had last heard from her six weeks of westerly gales and westerly tempests anything might have happened to her or to the child and she would be thinking that anything might have happened to the hotspur or to him a more irregular wave than usual roaring out of the darkness burst upon hotspurs weather bow hornblower felt her sudden sluggishness her inertia beneath his feet that wave must have flooded the waist to a depth of a yard or more fifty or sixty tons of water piled up on her deck she lay like something dead for a moment then she rolled slightly at first and then more freely the sound of the cataracts of water pouring across could be clearly heard despite the gale she freed herself as the water cascaded out through the overworked scuppers and she came sluggishly back to life to leap once more in her mad career from wave crest to trough a blow like that could well be her death some time she might not rise to it some time her deck might be burst in another wave beat on her bow like the hammer of a mad giant and another after that next day was worse the worst day that hotspur had experienced in all these wild weeks some slight shift in the wind or the increase in its strength had worked up the waves to a pitch that was particularly unsuited to hotspurs idiosyncrasies the waist was flooded most of the time now so that she laboured heavily without relief each wave catching her before she could free herself that meant that the pumps were at work three hours out of every four so that even with petty officers and idlers and waisters and marines all doing their share every hand was engaged on the toilsome labour for twelve hours a day bushs glance was more direct even than usual when he came to make his report were still sighting naiad now and then sir but not a chance of signals being read this was the day when by captain chamberss orders they were free to run for harbour yes i dont think we can bear away in this wind and sea bushs expression revealed a mental struggle hotspurs powers of resistance to the present battering were not unlimited but on the other hand to turn tail and run would be an operation of extreme danger has huffnell reported to you yet sir yes said hornblower there were nine hundredgallon casks of freshwater left down below which had been standing in the bottom tier for a hundred days and now one of them had proved to be contaminated with seawater and was hardly drinkable the others might perhaps be even less so thank you mr bush said hornblower terminating the interview well remain hoveto for today at least surely a wind of this force must moderate soon even though hornblower had a premonition that it would not nor did it the slow dawn of the new day found hotspur still labouring under the dark clouds the waves still as wild the wind still as insane the time had come for the final decision as hornblower well knew as he came out on deck in his clammy clothes he knew the dangers and he had spent a large part of the night preparing his mind to deal with them mr bush well get her before the wind aye aye sir before she could come before the wind she would have to present her vulnerable side to the waves there would be seconds during which she could be rolled over on to her beam ends beaten down under the waves pounded into a wreck mr cargill this was going to be a moment far more dangerous than being chased by the loire and cargill would have to be trusted to carry out a similar duty as on a tense occasion then face close to face hornblower shouted his instructions get forard make ready to show a bit of the foretopmast staysl haul it up when i wave my arm aye aye sir get it in the moment i wave a second time aye aye sir mr bush we shall need the foretopsl aye aye sir goosewing it aye aye sir stand by the sheets wait for me to wave my arm the second time the second time aye aye sir hotspurs stern was nearly as vulnerable as her side if she presented it to the waves while stationary she would be pooped a wave would burst over her and sweep her from stern to stem a blow she would probably not survive the foretopsail would give her the necessary way but spreading it before she was before the wind would lay her over on her beam ends goosewinging it pulling down the lower corners while leaving the centre portion still furled would expose less canvas than the reefed sail enough in that gale to carry her forward at the necessary speed hornblower took his station beside the wheel where he could be clearly seen from forward he ran his eyes aloft to make sure that the preparations for goosewinging the foretopsail were complete and his gaze lingered for a while longer as he observed the motion of the spars relative to the wild sky then he transferred his attention to the sea on the weather side to the immense rollers hurrying towards the ship he watched the roll and the pitch he gauged the strength of the howling wind which was trying to tear him from his footing that wind was trying to stupefy him to paralyse him too he had to keep the hard central core of himself alert and clear thinking while his outer body was numbed by the wind a rogue wave burst against the weather bow in a huge but fleeting pillar of spray the green mass pounding aft along the waist and hornblower swallowed nervously while it seemed as if hotspur would never recover but she did slowly and wearily rolling off the load from her deck as she cleared herself the moment came a moment of regularity in the oncoming waves with her bow just lifting to the nearest one he waved his arm and saw the slender head of the foretopmast staysail rising up the stay and the ship lay over wildly to the pressure hardaport he yelled to the hands at the wheel the enormous leverage of the staysail applied to the bowsprit began to swing the hotspur round like a weather vane as she turned the wind thrusting more and more from aft gave her steerage way so that the rudder could bite and accelerate the turn she was down in the trough of the wave but turning still turning he waved his arm again the clews of the foretopsail showed themselves as the hands hauled on the sheets and hotspur surged forward with the impact of the wind upon the canvas the wave was almost upon them but it disappeared out of the tail of hornblowers eye as hotspur presented first her quarter and then her stern to it meet her midships the tug of the sail on the foremast would put hotspur right before the wind without the use of the rudder indeed the rudder would only delay her acquiring all the way she could time enough to put the rudder to work again when she was going at her fastest hornblower braced himself for the impact of the wave now following them up the seconds passed and then it came but the stern had begun to lift and the blow was deprived of its force only a minor mass of water burst over the taffrail to surge aft again as hotspur lifted her bows now they were racing along with the waves now they were travelling through the water ever so little faster that was the most desirable point of speed there was no need to increase or decrease even minutely the area of canvas exposed to the goosewinged foretopsail the situation was safe and yet unutterably precarious balanced on a knife edge the slightest yawing and hotspur was lost keep her from falling off hornblower yelled to the men at the wheel and the grizzled senior quartermaster his wet grey ringlets flapping over his cheeks from out of his souwester nodded without taking his eyes from the foretopsail hornblower knew with his vivid imagination he could feel the actual sensation up his arms how uncertain and unsatisfactory was the feel of wheel and rudder when running before a following sea the momentary lack of response to the turning spokes the hesitation of the ship as a mounting wave astern deprived the foretopsail of some of the wind that filled it the uncontrolled slithering sensation as the ship went down a slope a moments inattention a moments bad luck could bring ruin yet here they were momentarily safe before the wind and running for the channel prowse was already staring into the binnacle and noting the new course on the traverse board and at a word from him orrock and a seaman struggled aft to cast the log and determine the speed and here came bush ascending to the quarterdeck grinning over the success of the manoeuvre and with the exhilaration of the new state of affairs course noreast by east sir reported prowse speed better than seven knots now there was a new set of problems to deal with they were entering the channel there were shoals and headlands ahead of them there were tides the tricky tidal streams of the channel to be reckoned with the very nature of the waves would change soon with the effect upon the atlantic rollers of the shallowing water and the narrowing channel and the varying tides there was the general problem of avoiding being blown all the way up channel and the particular one of trying to get into tor bay all this called for serious calculation and reference to tide tables especially in face of the fact that running before the wind like this it would be impossible to take soundings we ought to get a sight of ushant on this course sir yelled prowse that would be a decided help a solid base for future calculations a new departure a shouted word sent orrock up to the foretopmasthead with a telescope to supplement the lookout there while hornblower faced the first stage of the new series of problems the question of whether he could bring himself to leave the deck and the second stage the question of whether he should invite prowse to share his calculations the answer to both was necessarily in the affirmative bush was a good seaman and could be trusted to keep a vigilant eye on the wheel and on the canvas prowse was a fair navigator and was by law coresponsible with hornblower for the course to be set and so would have just cause for grievance if he was not consulted however much hornblower wished to be free of his company so it came about that prowse was with hornblower in the chartroom struggling with the tide tables when foreman opened the door his knocking not having been heard in the general din and admitted all the noise of the ship in full volume message from mr bush sir ushant in sight on the starboard beam seven or eight miles sir thank you mr foreman that was a stroke of good fortune the first they had had now they could plan the next struggle to bend the forces of nature to their will it was a struggle indeed for the men at the wheel a prolonged physical ordeal which made it necessary to relieve them every halfhour and for hornblower a mental ordeal which was to keep him at fullstrain for the next thirty hours there was the tentative trying of the wheel to see if it were possible to bring the wind a couple of points on her port quarter three times they made the attempt to abandon it hastily as wind and wave rendered the ship unmanageable but at the fourth try it became possible with the shortening of the waves in their advance upchannel and the turn of the tide over on the french coast now they tore through the water speed undiminished despite the drag of the rudder as the helmsmen battled with the wheel that kicked and struggled as if it were alive and malignant under their hands and while the whole strength of the crew handled the braces to trim the yard exactly to make certain there was no danger of sailing by the lee at least the danger of running hotspur bodily under water was now eliminated there was no chance of her putting her bows into the slack back of a dilatory wave and never lifting them again to balance the leverage of the foretopsail they hauled up the mizzen staysail which brought relief to the helmsmen even though it laid hotspur over until her starboard gunports were level with the water it lasted for a frantic hour and it seemed to hornblower that he was holding his breath during all that time and until it burst in the centre with a report like a twelve pounder splitting into flying pendants of canvas that cracked in the wind like coachwhips as the helmsmen fought against the renewed tendency of hotspur to turn away from the wind yet the temporary success justified replacing the sail with the mizzen topmast staysail just a corner of it showing and the head and the tack still secured by gaskets it was a brand new sail and it managed to endure the strain to compensate for the labour and difficulty of setting it the short dark day drew to an end and now everything had to be done in roaring night while lack of sleep intensified the numbness and fatigue and the stupidity induced by the unremitting wind with his dulled sensitivity hornblowers reaction was slow to the changed behaviour of hotspur under his feet the transition was gradual in any case but at last it became marked enough for him to notice it his sense of touch substituting for his sense of sight to tell him that the waves were becoming shorter and steeper this was the choppiness of the channel and not the steady sweep of the atlantic rollers hotspurs motion was more rapid and in a sense more violent the waves broke over her bow more frequently though in smaller volume although still far below the surface the floor of the channel was rising from a hundred fathoms deep to forty fathoms and there was the turn of the tide to be considered even though this westerly tempest must have piled up the waters of the channel far above mean level and the channel was narrower now the rollers that had found ample passage between ushant and scilly were feeling the squeeze and all these factors were evident in their behaviour hotspur was wet all the time now and only continuous working of the pumps kept the water down below within bounds pumps worked by weary men thirsty men hungry men sleepy men throwing their weight on the long handles each time with the feeling that they could not repeat the effort even once more at four in the morning hornblower was conscious of a shift in the wind and for a precious hour he was able to order a change of course until a sudden veering of the wind forced them back on the original course again but he had gained so his calculations told him considerably to the northward there was so much satisfaction in that that he put his forehead down on his forearms on the chartroom table and was surprised into sleep for several valuable minutes before a more extravagant leaping of the ship banged his head upon his arms and awakened him to make his way wearily out upon the quarterdeck again wish we could take a sounding sir shouted prowse yes yet now even in the darkness hornblower could feel that the recent gain and the change in the character of the sea made it justifiable to heave to for a space he could goad his mind to deal with the problem of drift and leeway he could harden his heart to face the necessity of calling upon the exhausted topmen to make the effort to furl the goosewinged foretopsail while he stood by alert to bring the ship to under the mizzen staysail bring the helm over at the right moment so that she met the steep waves with her bow riding to the wind her motion was wilder and more extravagant than ever but they managed to cast the deep sea lead with the crew lined up round the ship calling watch watch as each man let his portion of line loose thirtyeight thirtyseven thirtyeight fathoms again the three casts consumed an hour with everyone wet to the skin and exhausted it was a fragment more of the data necessary while heavingto eased the labour of the wornout quartermasters and actually imposed so much less strain on the seams that the pumps steadily gained on the water below at the first watery light of dawn they set the goosewinged foretopsail again while hornblower faced the problem of getting hotspur round with the wind over her quarter without laying her over on her beam ends then they were thrashing along in the old way decks continually under water rolling until every timber groaned with orrock freezing at the foretopmasthead with his glass it was noon before he sighted the land half an hour later bush returned to the quarterdeck from the ascent he made to confirm orrocks findings bush was more weary than he would ever admit his dirty hollow cheeks overgrown with a stubble of beard but he could still show surprise and pleasure bolt head sir he yelled fine on the port bow and i could just make out the start thank you even though it meant shouting bush wanted to express his feelings about this feat of navigation but hornblower had no time for that nor the patience nor for that matter the strength there was the question of not being blown too far to leeward at this eleventh hour of making preparations to come to an anchor in conditions that would certainly be difficult there was the tide rip off the start to be borne in mind the necessity of rounding to as close under berry head as possible there was the sudden inexpressible change in wind and sea as they came under the lee of the start the steep choppiness here seemed nothing compared with what hotspur had been enduring five minutes before and the land took the edge off the hurricane wind to reduce it to the mere force of a full gale that still kept hotspur flying before it there was the newstone and the blackstones here as well as in the iroise and the final tricky moment of the approach to berry head ships of war at anchor sir reported bush sweeping tor bay with his glass as they opened it up thats dreadnought thats temeraire its the channel fleet my god theres one aground in torquay roads twodecker she must have dragged her anchors yes well back the best bower anchor before we let go mr bush well have to use the launchs carronade youve time to see about that aye aye sir even in tor bay there was a full gale blowing where a twodecker had dragged her anchors every precaution must be taken at whatever further cost in effort the seven hundredweight of the boat carronade attached to the anchorcable fifty feet back from the one ton of the best bower might just save that anchor from lifting and dragging and so hotspur came in under goosewinged foretopsail and storm mizzen staysail round berry head under the eyes of the channel fleet to claw her way in towards brixham pier and to roundto with her weary men furling the foretopsail and to drop her anchors while with a last effort they sent down the topmasts and prowse and hornblower took careful bearings to make sure she was not dragging it was only then that there was leisure to spare to make her number to the flagship flag acknowledges sir croaked foreman very well it was still possible to do something more without collapsing mr foreman kindly make this signal need drinking water chapter tor bay was a tossing expanse of white horses the land lessened the effect of the wind to some extent the channel waves were hampered in their entry to berry head but all the same the wind blew violently and the waves racing up the channel managed to wheel leftwards much weakened but now running across the wind and with the tide to confuse the issue tor bay boiled like a cauldron for forty hours after hotspurs arrival the hibernia cornwalliss big threedecker flew the signal with a negative beside it and with a negative meant that boats were not to be employed not even the brixham fishermen renowned for their small boat work could venture out into tor bay while it was in that mood so that until the second morning at anchor the crew of the hotspur supported an unhappy existence on two quarts of tainted water a day and hornblower was the unhappiest man on board from causes both physical and mental the little ship almost empty of stores was the plaything of wind and wave and tide she surged about at her anchors like a restive horse she swung and she snubbed herself steady with a jerk she plunged and snubbed herself again with her topmasts sent down she developed a shallow and rapid roll it was a mixture of motions that would test the strongest stomach and hornblowers stomach was by no means the strongest while there was the depressing association in his memory of his very first day in a ship of war when he had made himself a laughing stock by being seasick in the old justinian at anchor in spithead he spent those forty hours vomiting his heart out while to the black depression of seasickness was added the depression resulting from the knowledge that maria was only thirty miles away in plymouth and by a good road cornwalliss representations had caused the government to cut that road over the tail end of dartmoor so that the channel fleet in its rendezvous could readily be supplied from the great naval base half a day on a good horse and hornblower could be holding maria in his arms he could be hearing news firsthand about the progress of the child on whom his thoughts were beginning to dwell increasingly the hands spent their free moments on the forecastle round the knightheads gazing at brixham and brixham pier even in that wind with its deluges of rain there were women to be seen occasionally women in skirts at whom the crew stared like so many tantaluses after one good nights sleep and with pumping only necessary now for half an hour in each watch those men had time and energy so that their imaginations had free play they could think about women and they could think about liquor most of them dreamed dreams of swilling themselves into swinish unconsciousness on brixhams smuggled brandy while hornblower could only vomit and fret but he slept during the second half of the second night when the wind not only moderated but backed two points northerly altering the conditions in tor bay like magic so that after he had assured himself at midnight that the anchors were still holding his fatigue took charge and he could sleep without moving for seven hours he was still only half awake when doughty came bursting in on him signal from the flag sir there were strings of bunting flying from the halliards of the hibernia with the shift of wind they could be read easily enough from the quarterdeck of the hotspur theres our number there sir said foreman glass at eye it comes first cornwallis was giving orders for the victualling and rewatering of the fleet establishing the order in which the ships were to be replenished and that signal gave hotspur priority over all the rest acknowledge ordered hornblower were lucky sir commented bush possibly agreed hornblower no doubt cornwallis had been informed about hotspurs appeal for drinking water but he might have further plans too look at that sir said bush they waste no time two lighters each propelled by eight sweeps and with a sixoared yawl standing by were creeping out round the end of brixham pier ill see about the fendoffs sir said bush departing hastily these were the water lighters marvels of construction each of them containing a series of vast castiron tanks hornblower had heard about them they were of fiftytons burthen each of them and each of them carried ten thousand gallons of drinking water while hotspur with every cask and hogshead brim full could not quite store fifteen thousand so now began an orgy of freshwater clear springwater which had not lain in the castiron tanks for more than a few days with the lighters chafing uneasily alongside a party from hotspur went down to work the beautiful modern pumps which the lighters carried forcing the water up through four superb canvas hoses passed in through the ports and then down below the deck scuttle butt so long empty was swilled out and filled to be instantly emptied by the crew and filled again just possibly at that moment the hands would rather have freshwater than brandy it was glorious waste down below the casks were swilled and scrubbed out with freshwater and the swillings drained into the bilge whence the ships pumps would later have to force it overboard at some cost of labour every man drank his fill and more hornblower gulped down glass after glass until he was full yet half an hour later found him drinking again he could feel himself expanding like a desert plant after rain look at this sir said bush telescope in hand and gesturing towards brixham the telescope revealed a busy crowd at work there and there were cattle visible slaughtering said bush fresh meat soon another lighter was creeping out to them hanging from a frame down the midship line were sides of beef carcasses of sheep and pigs i wont mind a roast of mutton sir said bush bullocks and sheep and swine had been driven over the moors to brixham and slaughtered and dressed on the waterfront immediately before shipping so that the meat would last fresh as long as possible four days rations there sir said bush making a practiced estimate an theres a live bullock an four sheep an four pigs excuse me sir and ill post a guard at the side most of the hands had money in their pockets and would spend it freely on liquor if they were given the chance and the men in the victualling barges would sell to them unless the closest supervision were exercised the waterlighters had finished their task and were casting off it had been a brief orgy from the moment that the hoses were taken in ships routine would be reestablished one gallon of water per man per day for all purposes from now on the place of the watering barges was taken by the dry victualling barge with bags of biscuit sacks of dried peas kegs of butter cases of cheese sacks of oatmeal but conspicuous on top of all this were half a dozen nets full of fresh bread two hundred fourpound loaves hornblower could taste the crustiness of them in his watering mouth when he merely looked at them a beneficent government under the firm guidance of cornwallis was sending these luxuries aboard the hardships of a life at sea were the result of natural circumstances quite as much as of ministerial ineptitude there was never a quiet moment all through that day here was bush touching his hat again with a final demand on his attention youve given no order about wives sir wives wives sir there was an interrogative lift in hornblowers voice as he said the word there was a flat complete absence of expression in bushs it was usual in his majestys ships when they lay in harbour for women to be allowed on board and one or two of them might well be wives it was some small compensation for the system that forbade a man to set foot on shore lest he desert but the women inevitably smuggled liquor on board and the scenes of debauchery that ensued on the lowerdeck were as shameless as in neros court disease and indiscipline were the natural result it took days or weeks to shake the crew down again into an efficient team hornblower did not want his fine ship ruined but if hotspur were to stay long at anchor in tor bay he could not deny what was traditionally a reasonable request he simply could not deny it ill give my orders later this morning he said it was not difficult some minutes later to intercept bush at a moment when a dozen of the hands were within earshot oh mr bush hornblower hoped his voice did not sound as stilted and theatrical as he feared youve plenty of work to be done about the ship yes sir theres a good deal of standing rigging id like set up again and theres running rigging to be rerove and theres the paintwork very well mr bush when the ships complete in all respects well allow the wives on board but not until then not until then mr bush and if we have to sail before then it will be the fortune of war aye aye sir next came the letters word must have reached the post office in plymouth of the arrival of hotspur in tor bay and the letters had been sent across overland seven letters from maria hornblower tore open the last first to find that maria was well and her pregnancy progressing favourably and then he skimmed through the others to find as he expected that she had rejoiced to read her valiant heros gazette letter although she was perturbed by the risks run by her maritime alexander and although she was consumed with sorrow because the needs of the service had denied from her eyes the light of his countenance hornblower was halfway through writing a reply when a midshipman came escorted to his cabin door with a note hms hibernia tor bay dear captain hornblower if you can be tempted out of your ship at three oclock this afternoon to dine in the flagship it would give great pleasure to your obt servant wm cornwallis vice ad ps an affirmative signal hung out in the hotspur is all the acknowledgement necessary hornblower went out on to the quarterdeck mr foreman signal hotspur to flag affirmative just affirmative sir you heard me an invitation from the commander in chief was as much a royal command as if it had been signed george r even if the postcript did not dictate the reply then there was the powder to be put on board with all the care and precautions that operation demanded hotspur had fired away one ton of the five tons of gunpowder that her magazine could hold the operation was completed when prowse brought up one of the hands who manned the powderbarge this fellow says he has a message for you sir this was a swarthy gypsyfaced fellow who met hornblowers eye boldly with all the assurance to be expected of a man who carried in his pocket a protection against impressment what is it message for you from a lady sir and i was to have a shilling for delivering it to you hornblower looked him over keenly there was only one lady who could be sending a message nonsense that lady promised sixpence now didnt she hornblower knew that much about maria despite his brief married life well yes sir heres the shilling whats the message the lady said look for her on brixham pier sir very well hornblower took the glass from its becket and walked forward busy though the ship was there were nevertheless a few idlers round the knightheads who shrank away in panic at the remarkable sight of their captain here he trained the glass brixham pier as might be expected was crowded with people and he searched for a long time without result training the glass first on one woman and then on another was that maria she was the only woman wearing a bonnet and not a shawl of course it was maria momentarily he had forgotten that this was the end of the seventh month she stood in the front row of the crowd as hornblower watched she raised an arm and fluttered a scarf she could not see him or at least she certainly could not recognize him at that distance without a telescope she must have heard along with the rest of plymouth of the arrival of hotspur in tor bay presumably she had made her way here via totnes in the carriers cart a long and tedious journey she fluttered her scarf again in the pathetic hope that he was looking at her in that part of his mind which never ceased attending to the ship hornblower became conscious of the pipes of the bosns mate the pipes had been shrilling one call or another all day long quarterboat awayayay hornblower had never been so conscious of the slavery of the kings service here he was due to leave the ship to dine with the commanderinchief and the navy had a tradition of punctuality that he could not flout and there was foreman breathless from his run forward message from mr bush sir the boats waiting what was he to do ask bush to write maria a note and send it by a shore boat no he would have to risk being late maria could not bear to receive second hand messages at this time of all times a hurried scribble with the lefthanded quill my own darling so much pleasure in seeing you but not a moment to spare yet i will write to you at length your devoted husband h he used that initial in all his letters to her he did not like his first name and he could not bring himself to sign harry damn it all here was the halffinished letter interrupted earlier that day and never completed he thrust it aside and struggled to apply a wafer to the finished note seven months at sea had destroyed every vestige of gum and the wafer would not adhere doughty was hovering over him with sword and hat and cloak doughty was just as aware of the necessity for punctuality as he was hornblower gave the open note to bush seal this if you please mr bush and send it by shore boat to mrs hornblower on the pier yes shes on the pier by a shore boat mr bush no one from the ships to set foot on land down the side and into the boat hornblower could imagine the explanatory murmur through the crowd on the pier as maria would learn from better informed bystanders what was going on thats the captain going down into the boat she would feel a surge of excitement and happiness the boat shoved off the conditions of wind and current dictating that her bow was pointing right at the pier that would be marias moment of highest hope then the boat swung round while the hands hauled at the halliards and the balancelug rose up the mast next moment she was flying towards the flagship flying away from maria without a word or a sign and hornblower felt a great welling of pity and remorse within his breast hewitt responded to the flagships hail turned the boat neatly into the wind dropped the sail promptly and with the last vestige of the boats way ran her close enough to the starboard mainchains for the bowman to hook on hornblower judged his moment and went up the ships side as his head reached the level of the maindeck the pipes began to shrill in welcome and through that noise hornblower heard the three sharp double strokes of the ships bell six bells in the afternoon watch three oclock the time stated in his invitation the great stern cabin in the hibernia was furnished in a more subdued fashion than pellew had affected in the tonnant more spartan and less lavish but comfortable enough somewhat to hornblowers surprise there were no other visitors present in the cabin were only cornwallis and collins the sardonic captain of the fleet and the flag lieutenant whose name hornblower vaguely heard as one of these newfangled double barrelled names with a hyphen hornblower was conscious of cornwalliss blue eyes fixed upon him examining him closely in a considering appraising way that might have unsettled him in other conditions but he was still a little preoccupied with his thoughts about maria on the one hand while on the other seven months at sea seven weeks of continuous storms provided all necessary excuse for his shabby coat and his seamans trousers he could meet cornwalliss glance without shyness indeed the effect of cornwalliss kindly but unsmiling expression was much modified because his wig was slightly awry cornwallis still affected a horsehair bobwig of the sort that was now being relegated by fashion to noblemens coachmen and today it had a rakish cant that dissipated all appearance of dignity yet wig or no wig there was something in the air some restraint some tension even though cornwallis was a perfect host who did the honours of his table with an easy grace the quality of the atmosphere was such that hornblower hardly noticed the food that covered the table and he felt acutely that the polite conversation was guarded and cautious they discussed the recent weather hibernia had been in tor bay for several days having run for shelter just in time to escape the last hurricane how were your stores when you came in captain asked collins now here was another sort of atmosphere something artificial there was an odd quality about collins tone accentuated by the formal captain particularly when addressed to a lowly commander then hornblower identified it this was a stilted and prepared speech exactly of the same nature as his recent speech to bush regarding the admission of women to the ship he could identity the tone but he still could not account for it but he had a commonplace answer so commonplace that he made it in a commonplace way i still had plenty sir beef and pork for a month at least there was a pause a shade longer than natural as if the information was being digested before cornwallis asked the next question in a single word water that was different sir id never been able to fill my casks completely from the hoys we were pretty low when we got in that was why we ran for it how much did you have two days at halfrations sir wed been on halfrations for a week and twothirds rations for four weeks before that oh said collins and in that instant the atmosphere changed you left very little margin for error hornblower said cornwallis and now he was smiling and now hornblower in his innocence realized what had been going on he had been suspected of coming in unnecessarily early of being one of those captains who wearied of combating tempests those were the captains cornwallis was anxious to weed out from the channel fleet and hornblower had been under consideration for weeding out you should have come in at least four days earlier said cornwallis well sir hornblower could have covered himself by quoting the orders of chambers of the naiad but he saw no reason to and he changed what he was going to say it worked out all right in the end youll be sending in your journals of course sir asked the flag lieutenant of course said hornblower the ships log would be documentary proof of his assertions but the question was a tactless almost an insulting one impugning of his veracity and cornwallis instantly displayed a hottempered impatience at this awkwardness on the part of his flag lieutenant captain hornblower can do that all in his own good time he said now wine with you sir it was extraordinary how pleasant the meeting had become the change in the atmosphere was as noticeable as the change in the lighting at this moment when the stewards brought in candles the four of them were laughing and joking when newton captain of the ship came in to make his report and for hornblower to be presented to him winds steady at west norwest sir said newton thank you captain cornwallis rolled his blue eyes on hornblower are you ready for sea yes sir there could be no other reply the winds bound to come easterly soon meditated cornwallis the downs spithead plymouth sound all of them jammed with ships outward bound and waiting for a fair wind but one points all you need with hotspur i could fetch ushant with two tacks now sir said hornblower there was maria huddled in some lodging in brixham at this moment but he had to say it mm said cornwallis still in debate with himself im not comfortable without you watching the goulet hornblower but i can let you have one more day at anchor thank you sir that is if the wind doesnt back any further cornwallis reached a decision here are your orders you sail at nightfall tomorrow but if the wind backs one more point you hoist anchor instantly that is with the wind at norwest by west aye aye sir hornblower knew how he liked his own officers to respond to his orders and he matched his deportment with that mental model cornwallis went on his eye still considering him we took some reasonable claret out of a prize a month ago i wonder if you would honour me by accepting a dozen hornblower with the greatest of pleasure sir ill have it put in your boat cornwallis turned to give the order to his steward who apparently had something to say in return in a low voice hornblower heard cornwallis reply yes yes of course before he turned back perhaps your steward would pass the word for my boat at the same time sir said hornblower who was in no doubt that his visit had lasted long enough by cornwalliss standards it was quite dark when hornblower went down the side into the boat to find at his feet the case that held the wine and by now the wind was almost moderate the dark surface of tor bay was spangled with the lights of ships and there were the lights of torquay and of paignton and brixham visible as well maria was somewhere there probably uncomfortable for these little places were probably full of naval officers wives call me the moment the wind comes norwest by west said hornblower to bush as soon as he reached the deck norwest by west aye aye sir the hands managed to get liquor on board sir did you expect anything else the british sailor would find liquor somehow at any contact with the shore if he had no money he would give his clothes his shoes even his earrings in exchange i had trouble with some of em sir especially after the beer issue beer was issued instead of rum whenever it could be supplied you dealt with em yes sir very well mr bush a couple of hands were bringing the case of wine in from the boat under the supervision of doughty and when hornblower entered his cabin he found the case lashed to the bulkhead occupying practically the whole of the spare deck space and doughty bending over it having prized it open with a handspike the only place to put it sir explained doughty apologetically that was probably true in two senses with the ship crammed with stores even with raw meat hung in every place convenient and inconvenient there could hardly be any space to spare and in addition wine would hardly be safe from the hands unless it were here where a sentry constantly stood guard doughty had a large parcel in his arms which he had removed from the case whats that demanded hornblower he had already observed that doughty was a little disconcerted so that when his servant hesitated he repeated the question more sharply still its just a parcel from the admirals steward sir show me hornblower expected to see bottles of brandy or some other smuggled goods its only cabin stores sir show me just cabin stores sir as i said doughty examined the contents while exhibiting them in a manner which proved he had not been certain of what he would find this is sweet oil sir olive oil and here are dried herbs marjoram thyme sage and heres coffee only half a pound by the look of it and pepper and vinegar and how the devil did you get these i wrote a note sir to the admirals steward and sent it by your coxsn it isnt right that you shouldnt have these things sir now i can cook for you properly does the admiral know id be surprised if he did sir there was an assured superior expression on doughtys face as he said this which suddenly revealed to hornblower a world of which he had been ignorant until then there might be flag officers and captains but under that glittering surface was an unseen circle of stewards with its own secret rites and passwords managing the private lives of their officers without reference to them sir this was bush entering the cabin with hurried step winds norwest by west sir looks as if itll back further still it took a moment for hornblower to reorient his thoughts to switch from stewards and dried herbs to ships and sailing orders then he was himself again rapping his commands call all hands sway the topmasts up get the yards crossed i want to be under way in twenty minutes fifteen minutes aye aye sir the quiet of the ship was broken by the pipes and the curses of the petty officers as they drove the hands to work heads bemused by beer and brandy cleared themselves with violent exercise and the fresh air of the chilly night breeze clumsy fingers clutched hoists and halliards men tripped and stumbled in the darkness and were kicked to their feet by petty officers goaded on by the masters mates goaded on in turn by bush and prowse the vast cumbersome sausages that were the sails were dragged out from where they had been laid away on the booms ready to set sail sir reported bush very well send the hands to the capstan mr foreman whats the night signal for am getting under way one moment sir foreman had not learned the night signal book as thoroughly as he should have done in seven months one blue light and one bengal fire shown together sir very well make that ready mr prowse a course from the start to ushant if you please that would let the hands know what fate awaited them if they did not guess already maria would know nothing at all until she looked out at tor bay tomorrow to find hotspurs place empty and all she had to comfort her was the curt note he had sent before dinner cold comfort that he must not think of maria or of the child the capstan was clanking as they hove the ship up towards the best bower they would have to deal with the extra weight of the boat carronade that backed that anchor the additional labour was the price to be paid for the security of the past days it was a clumsy as well as a laborious operation shall i heave short on the small bower sir yes if you please mr bush and you can get under way as soon as is convenient to you aye aye sir make that signal mr foreman the quarterdeck was suddenly illuminated the sinister blue light blending with the equally sinister crimson of the bengal fire the last splutterings had hardly died away before the answer came from the flagship a blue light that winked three times as it was momentarily screened flagship acknowledges sir very well and this was the end of his stay in harbour of his visit to england he had seen the last of maria for months to come she would be a mother when he saw her next sheet home hotspur was gathering way turning on her heel with a fair wind to weather berry head hornblowers mind played with a score of inconsequential thoughts as he struggled to put aside his overwhelming melancholy he remembered the brief private conversation that he had witnessed between cornwallis and the steward he was quite sure that the latter had been telling his admiral about the parcel prepared for transmission to hotspur doughty was not nearly as clever as he thought he was that conclusion called up a weak smile as hotspur breasted the waters of the channel with berry head looming up on her starboard beam chapter now it was cold horribly cold the days were short and the nights were very very long along with the cold weather came easterly winds the one involved the other and a reversal of the tactical situation for although with the wind in the east hotspur was relieved of the anxiety of being on a lee shore her responsibilities were proportionately increased there was nothing academic now about noting the direction of the wind each hour it was no mere navigational routine should the wind blow from any one of ten points of the compass out of thirtytwo it would be possible even for the lubberly french to make their exit down the goulet and enter the atlantic should they make the attempt it was hotspurs duty to pass an instant warning for the channel fleet to form line of battle if the french were rash enough to challenge action and to cover every exit by the raz by the iroise by the four if as would be more likely they attempted merely to escape today the last of the flood did not make until two oclock in the afternoon a most inconvenient time for it was not until then that hotspur could venture in to make her daily reconnaissance at closest range to do so earlier would be to risk that a failure of the wind leaving her at the mercy of the tide would sweep her helplessly up within range of the batteries on petit minou and the capuchins the toulinguet battery and more assuredly fatal than the batteries would be the reefs pollux and the little girls hornblower came out on deck with the earliest light not very early on this almost the shortest day of the year to check the position of the ship while prowse took the bearings of the petit minou and the grand gouin merry christmas sir said bush it was typical of a military service that bush should have to touch his hat while saying those words thank you the same to you mr bush it was typical also that hornblower should have been acutely aware that it was december th and yet should have forgotten that it was christmas day tide tables made no reference to the festivals of the church any news of your good lady sir asked bush not yet answered hornblower with a smile that was only halfforced the letter i had yesterday was dated the eighteenth but theres nothing as yet it was one more indication of the way the wind had been blowing that he should have received a letter from maria in six days a victualler had brought it out with a fair wind that also implied that it might be six weeks before his reply reached maria and in six weeks in one week everything would be changed and the child would be born a naval officer writing to his wife had to keep one eye on the windvane just as the lords of the admiralty had to do when drafting their orders for the movements of fleets new years day was the date maria and the midwife had decided upon at that time maria would be reading the letters he wrote a month ago he wished he had written more sympathetically but nothing he could do could recall alter or supplement those letters all he could do would be to spend some of this morning composing a letter that might belatedly compensate for the deficiencies of its predecessors while it would be even more difficult than usual because it would have to be composed with on eye to all eventualities all eventualities hornblower felt in that moment the misgivings of every prospective father he spent until eleven oclock on these unsatisfactory literary exercises and it was with guilty relief that he returned to the quarterdeck to take hotspur up with the last of the tide with the wellremembered coasts closing in upon her on both sides the weather was reasonably clear not a sparkling christmas day but with little enough haze at noon when hornblower gave the orders to hove hotspur to as close to pollux reef as he dared the dull thud of a gun from petit minou coincided with his orders the rebuilt battery there was firing its usual rangetesting shot in the hope that this time he had come in too far did they recognize the ship chat had done them so much damage presumably their morning salute sir said bush yes hornblower took the telescope into his gloved yet frozen hands and trained it up the goulet as he always did often there was something new to observe today there was much four new ships at anchor sir said bush i make it five isnt that a new one the frigate in line with the church steeple dont think so sir shes shifted anchorage only four near ones by my count youre right mr bush yards crossed sir and sir would you look at those topsl yards hornblower was already looking i cant be sure i think those are topsls furled overall sir its possible a sail furled overall was much thinner and less noticeable with the loose part gathered into the bunt about the mast than one furled in the usual fashion ill go up to the masthead myself sir and young foreman has good eyes ill take him with me very well no wait a moment mr bush ill go myself take charge of the ship if you please but you can send foreman up hornblowers decision to go aloft was proof of the importance he attached to observation of the new ships he was uncomfortably aware of his slowness and awkwardness and it was only reluctantly that he exhibited them to his lightfooted and lighthearted subordinates but there was something about chose ships he was breathing heavily by the time he reached the foretopmasthead and it took several seconds to steady himself sufficiently to fix the ships in the field of the telescope but he was much warmer foreman was there already and the regular lookout shrank away out of the notice of his betters neither foreman nor the lookout could be sure about those furled top sails they thought it likely yet they would not commit themselves dyou make out anything else about those ships mr foreman well no sir i cant say that i do dyou think theyre riding high maybe yes sir two of the new arrivals were small twodeckers sixtyfours probably and the lower tier of gunports in each case might be farther above the water line than one might expect it was not a matter of measurement all the same it was more a matter of intuition of good taste those hulls were just not quite right although foreman willing enough to oblige clearly did not share his feelings hornblowers glass swept the shores round the anchorage questing for any further data there were the rows of hutments that housed the troops french soldiers were notoriously well able to look after themselves to build themselves adequate shelter the smoke of their cooking fires was clearly visible today of course they would be cooking their christmas dinners it was from here that had come the battalion that had chased him back to the boats the day he blew up the battery hornblowers glass checked itself moved along and returned again with the breeze that was blowing he could not be certain but it seemed to him that from two rows of huts there was no smoke to be seen it was all a little vague he could not even estimate the number of troops those huts would house two thousand men five thousand men and he was still doubtful about the absence of cooking smoke captain sir bush was hailing from the deck the tides turned very well ill come down he was abstracted and thoughtful when he reached the deck mr bush ill be wanting fish for my dinner soon keep a special lookout for the dukes freers he had to pronounce it that way to make sure bush under stood him two days later he found himself in his cabin drinking rum pretending to drink rum with the captain of the deux frres he had bought himself half a dozen unidentifiable fish which the captain strongly recommended as good eating carrelets the captain called them hornblower had a vague idea that they might be flounders at any rate he paid for them with a gold piece which the captain slipped without comment into the pockets of his scalecovered serge trousers inevitably the conversation shifted to the sights to be seen up the goulet and from the general to the particular centring on the new arrivals in the anchorage the captain dismissed them with a gesture as unimportant armes en flute he said casually en flute that told the story that locked into place the pieces of the puzzle hornblower took an unguarded gulp at his glass of rum and water and fought down the consequent cough so as to display no special interest a ship of war with her guns taken out was like a flute when her ports were opened she had a row of empty holes down her side not to fight explained the captain only for stores or troops or what you will for troops especially stores could best be carried in merchant ships designed for cargo but ships of war were constructed to carry large numbers of men their cooking arrangements and water storage facilities had been built in with that in mind with only as many seamen on board as were necessary to work the ship there was room to spare for soldiers then the guns would be unnecessary and at brest they could be immediately employed in arming new ships removing the guns meant a vast increase in available deck space into which more troops could be crammed the more there were the more strain on the cooking and watering arrangements but on a short voyage they would not have long to suffer a short voyage not the west indies nor good hope and certainly not india a fortygun frigate armed en flute might have as many as a thousand soldiers packed into her three thousand men plus a few hundred more in the armed escorts the smallness of the number ruled out england not even bonaparte so improvident with human life would throw away a force that size in an invasion of england where there was at least a small army and a large militia there was only one possible target ireland where a disaffected population meant a weak militia they are no danger to me then said hornblower hoping that the interval during which he had been making these deductions had not been so long as to be obvious not even to this little ship agreed the breton captain with a smile it called for the exertion of all hornblowers moral strength to continue the interview without allowing his agitation to show he wanted to get instantly into action but he dared not appear impatient the breton captain wanted another threefinger glass of rum and was unaware of any need for haste luckily hornblower remembered an admonition from doughty who had impressed on him the desirability of buying cider as well as fish and hornblower introduced the new subject yes agreed the captain there was a keg of cider on board the deux frres but he could not say how much was left as they had tapped it already during the day he would sell what was left hornblower forced himself to bargain he did not want the breton captain to know that his recent piece of information was worth further gold he suggested that the cider of an unknown quantity should be given him for nothing extra and the captain with an avaricious gleam in his peasants eye indignantly refused for some minutes the argument proceeded while the rum sank lower in the captains glass one franc then offered hornblower at last twenty sous twenty sous and a glass of rum said the captain and hornblower had to reconcile himself to that much further delay but it was worth it to retain the captains respect and to allay the captains suspicions so that it was with his head swimming with rum a sensation he detested that hornblower sat down at last to write his urgent despatch having seen his guest down the side no mere signal could convey all that he wanted to say and no signal would be secret enough either he had to choose his words as carefully as the rum would permit as he stated his suspicions that the french might be planning an invasion of ireland and as he gave his reasons for those suspicions he was satisfied at last and wrote h hornblower commander at the foot of the letter then he turned over the sheet and wrote the address rear admiral william parker commanding the inshore squadron on the other side and folded and sealed the letter parker was one of the extensive parker clan there were and had been admirals and captains innumerable with that name none of them specially distinguished perhaps this letter would alter that tradition he sent it off a long and arduous trip for the boat and waited impatiently for the acknowledgement sir your letter of this date has been received and will be given my full attention your obd servt wm parker hornblower read the few words in a flash he had opened the letter on the quarterdeck without waiting to retire with it to his cabin and he put it in his pocket hoping that his expression betrayed no disappointment mr bush he said we shall have to maintain a closer watch than ever over the goulet particularly at night and in thick weather aye aye sir probably parker needed time to digest the information and would later produce a plan until that time it was hornblowers duty to act without orders i shall take the ship up to the little girls whenever i can do so unobserved the little girls aye aye sir it was a very sharp glance that bush directed at him no one in his senses at least no one except under the strongest compulsion would risk his ship near those navigational dangers in conditions of bad visibility true but the compulsions existed three thousand welltrained french soldiers landing in ireland would set that distressful country in a flame from end to end a wilder flame than had burned in well try it tonight said hornblower aye aye sir the little girls lay squarely in the middle of the channel of the goulet on either side lay a fairway a scant quarter of a mile wide and up and down those fairways raced the tide it would only be during the ebb that the french would be likely to come down no that was not strictly true for the french could stem the flood tide with a fair wind with this chill easterly wind blowing the goulet had to be watched in all conditions of bad visibility and hotspur had to do the watching chapter i beg your pardon sir said bush lingering after delivering his afternoon report and hesitating before taking the next step he had clearly decided upon yes mr bush you know sir youre not looking as well as you should indeed youve been doing too much sir day and night thats a strange thing for a seaman to say mr bush and a kings officer its true all the same sir you havent had an hours sleep at a time for days youre thinner than ive ever known you sir im afraid ill have to endure it nevertheless mr bush i can only say i wish you didnt have to sir thank you mr bush im going to turn in now as a matter of fact im glad of that sir see that im called the moment the weather shows signs of thickening aye aye sir can i trust you mr bush that brought a smile into what was too serious a conversation you can sir thank you mr bush it was interesting after bushs departure to look into the speckled chipped mirror and observe his thinness the cheeks and temples fallen in the sharp nose and the pointed chin but this was not the real hornblower the real one was inside unaffected as yet at least by privation or strain the real hornblower looked out at him from the hollow eyes in the mirror with a twinkle of recognition a twinkle that brightened not with malice but with something akin to that a kind of cynical amusement at the sight of hornblower seeking proof of the weaknesses of the flesh but time was too precious to waste the weary body that the real hornblower had to drag about demanded repose and as regards the weaknesses of the flesh how delightful how comforting it was to clasp to his stomach the hotwater bottle that doughty had put into his cot to feel warm and relaxed despite the clamminess of the bedclothes and the searching cold that pervaded the cabin sir said doughty coming into the cabin after what seemed to be one minutes interval but which his watch told him was two hours mr prowse sent me its snowing sir very well ill come how often had he said those words every time the weather had thickened he had taken hotspur up the goulet enduring the strain of advancing blind up into frightful danger watching wind and tide making the most elaborate calculations alert for any change in conditions ready to dash out again at the first hint of improvement not only to evade the fire of the batteries but also to prevent the french from discovering the close watch that was being maintained over them its only just started to snow sir doughty was saying but mr prowse says its set in for the night with doughtys assistance hornblower had bundled himself automatically into his deck clothing without noticing what he was doing he went out into a changed world where his feet trod a thin carpet of snow on the deck and where prowse loomed up in the darkness shimmering in the white coating of snow on his oilskins winds nor by east sir moderate an hour of flood still to go thank you turn the hands up and send them to quarters if you please they can sleep at the guns aye aye sir five minutes from now i dont want to hear a sound aye aye sir this was only regular routine the less the distance one could see the readier the ship had to be to open fire should an enemy loom up close alongside but there was no routine about his own duties every time he took the ship up conditions were different the wind blowing from a different compass point and the tide of a different age this was the first time the wind had been so far round to the north tonight he would have to shave the shallows off petit minou as close as he dared and then closehauled with the last of the flood behind him hotspur could just ascend the northern channel with the little girls to starboard there was spirit left in the crew there were jokes and cries of surprise when they emerged into the snow from the stinking warmth of the tween deck but sharp orders suppressed every sound hotspur was deadly quiet like a ghost ship when the yards had been trimmed and the helm orders given and she began to make her way through the impenetrable night night more impenetrable than ever with the air full of snowflakes silently dropping down upon them a shuttered lantern at the taffrail for reading the log although the logs indications were of minor importance when speed over the ground could be so different instinct and experience were more important two hands in the portside mainchains with the lead hornblower on the weather side of the quarterdeck could hear quite a quiet call even though there was a hand stationed to relay it if necessary five fathoms four fathoms if his navigation were faulty they would strike before the next cast aground under the guns of petit minou ruined and destroyed hornblower could not restrain himself from clenching his gloved hands and tightening his muscles six and a half fathoms that was what he had calculated upon but it was a relief nevertheless hornblower felt a small contempt for himself at feeling relieved at his lack of faith in his own judgement full and bye he ordered they were as close under petit minou as possible a quarter of a mile from those wellknown hills but there was nothing visible at all there might be a solid black wall a yard from hornblowers eyes whichever way he turned them eleven fathoms they were on the edge of the fairway now the last of the flood two days after the lowest neaps and wind north by east the current should be less than a knot and the eddy off mengam nonexistent no bottom more than twenty fathoms that was right a good night this for the frogs sir muttered bush beside him he had been waiting for this moment certainly it was a good night for the french if they were determined to escape they knew the times of ebb and flood as well as he did they would see the snow comfortable time for them to up anchor and get under weigh and make the passage of the goulet with a fair wind and ebb tide impossible for them to escape by the four with this wind the iroise was guarded he hoped by the inshore squadron but on a night as black as this they might try it in preference to the difficult raz du sein nineteen fathoms he was above the little girls and he could be confident of weathering mengam nineteen fathoms should be slack water now sir muttered prowse who had just looked at his watch in the light of the shaded binnacle they were above mengam now the lead should record a fairly steady nineteen fathoms for the next few minutes and it was time that he should plan out the next move the next move but one rather he conjured up the chart before his mental eye listen bushs elbow dug into hornblowers ribs with the urgency of the moment avast there at the lead said hornblower he spoke in a normal tone to make sure he was understood with the wind blowing that way his voice would not carry far in the direction he was peering into there was the sound again there were other noises a long drawn monosyllable borne by the wind and hornblowers straining senses picked it up it was a frenchman calling seize sixteen french pilots still used the oldfashioned toise to measure depths and the toise was slightly greater than the english fathom lights muttered bush his elbow at hornblowers ribs again there was a gleam here and there the frenchman had not darkened his ship nearly as effectively as the hotspur there was enough light to give some sort of indication a ghost ship sweeping by within biscuit toss the topsails were suddenly visible there must be a thin coating of snow on the after surfaces whose gleaming white could reflect any light there was and then three red lights in a row on the mizzen topsl yard whispered bush visible enough now shaded in front presumably with the light directed aft to guide following ships hornblower felt a surge of inspiration of instant decision plans for the moment plans for the next five minutes plans for the more distant future run he snapped at bush get three lights hoisted the same way keep em shaded ready to show bush was off at the last word but the thoughts had to come more rapidly like lightning hotspur dared not tack she must wear wear ship he snapped at prowse no time for the politenesses he usually employed as hotspur swung round he saw the three separated red lights join together almost into one and at the same moment he saw a blue glare the french ship was altering course to proceed down the goulet and was burning a blue light as an indication to the ships following to up helm in succession now he could see the second french ship a second faint ghost the blue light helped to reveal it pellew in the old indefatigable when hornblower was a prisoner in ferrol had once confused a french squadron escaping from brest by imitating the french signals but that had been in the comparatively open waters of the iroise it had been in hornblowers mind to try similar tactics but here in the narrow goulet there was a possibility of more decisive action bring her to the wind on the starboard tack he snapped at prowse and hotspur swung round further still the invisible hands hauling at the invisible braces there was the second ship in the french line just completing her turn with hotspurs bows pointing almost straight at her starboard a little hotspurs bows swung away meet her he wanted to be as close alongside as he possibly could be without running foul of her ive sent a good hand up with the lights sir this was bush reporting another two minutes and theyll be ready get down to the guns snapped hornblower and then with the need for silence at an end he reached for the speakingtrumpet maindeck man the starboard guns run em out how would the french squadron be composed it would have an armed escort not to fight its way through the channel fleet but to protect the transports after the escape from stray british cruising frigates there would be two big frigates one in the van and one bringing up the rear while the intermediate ships would be defenceless transports frigates armed en flute starboard steady yard arm to yard arm with the second ship in the line going down the goulet alongside her ghost ships side by side in the falling snow the rumble of guntrucks had ceased fire at ten guns ten hands jerked at the lanyards and hotspurs side burst into flame illuminating the sails and hull of the frenchman with a bright glare in the instantaneous glare snowflakes were visible as if stationary in mid air fire away you men there were cries and shouts to be heard from the french ship and then a french voice speaking almost in his ear the french captain hailing him from thirty yards away with his speakingtrumpet pointed straight at him it would be an expostulation the french captain wondering why a french ship should be firing into him here where no british ship could possibly be the words were cut off abruptly by the bang and the flash of the first gun of the second broadside the others following as the men loaded and fired as fast as they could each flash brought a momentary revelation of the french ship a flickering intermittent picture those ninepounder balls were crashing into a ship crammed with men at this very moment as he stood there rigid on the deck men were dying in agony by the score just over there for no more reason than that they had been forced into the service of a continental tyrant surely the french would not be able to bear it surely they would flinch under this unexpected and unexplainable attack ah she was turning away although she had nowhere to turn to except the cliffs and shoals of the shore close overside there were the three red lights on her mizzen topsail yard by accident or design she had put her helm down he must make sure of her port a little hotspur swung to starboard her guns blazing enough starboard a little steady as you go now the speakingtrumpet cease fire the silence that followed was broken by the crash as the frenchman struck the shore the clatter of falling spars the yells of despair and in this darkness after the glare of the guns he was blinder than ever and yet he must act as if he could see he must waste no moment back the main topsl stay by the braces the rest of the french line must be coming down willynilly with the wind over their quarter and the ebb under their keels and rocks on either side of them they could do nothing else he must think quicker than they he still had the advantage of surprise the french captain in the following ship would not yet have had time to collect his thoughts the little girls were under their lee he must not delay another moment braces there here she came looming up close close yells of panic from her forecastle hardastarboard hotspur had just enough way through the water to respond to her rudder the two bows swung from each other collision averted by a hairs breadth fire the frenchmans sails were all ashiver she was not under proper control and with those ninepounder balls sweeping her deck she would not recover quickly hotspur must not pass ahead of her he still had a little time and a little room to spare main topsl aback this was a welldrilled crew the ship was working like a machine even the powderboys climbing and descending the ladders in pitch darkness were carrying out their duties with exactitude keeping the guns supplied with powder for the guns never ceased from firing bellowing in deafening fashion and bathing the frenchman with orange light while the smoke blew heavily away on the disengaged side he could not spare another moment with the main topsail aback he must fill and draw ahead even if it meant disengagement braces there he had not noticed until now the infernal din of the quarterdeck carronades beside him they were firing rapidly sweeping the transports deck with grape in their flashes he saw the frenchmans masts drawing aft as hotspur regained her way then in the next flash he saw something else another momentary picture a ships bowsprit crossing the frenchmans deck from the disengaged side and he heard a crash and the screams the next frenchman astern had run bows on into her colleague the first rending crash was followed by others he strode aft to try to see but already the darkness had closed like a wall round his blinded eyes he could only listen but what he heard told him the story the ship that rammed was swinging with the wind her bowsprit tearing through shrouds and halliards until it snapped against the mainmast then the foretopmast would fall yards would fall the two ships were locked together and helpless with the little girls under their lee now he saw blue lights burning as they tried to deal with the hopeless situation with the ships swinging the blue lights and the red lights on the yards were revolving round each other like some planetary system there was no chance of escape for them as wind and current carried him away he thought he heard the crash as they struck upon the little girls but he could not be sure and there was no time of course there was no time to think about it at this stage of the ebb there was an eddy that set in upon pollux reef and he must allow for that then he would be out in the iroise whose waters he used to think so dangerous before he had ventured up the goulet and an unknown number of ships was coming down from brest forewarned now by all the firing and the tumult that an enemy was in their midst he took a hash glance into the binnacle gauged the force of the wind on his cheeks the enemy what there was left of them would certainly with this wind run for the raz du sein and would certainly give the trepieds shoal a wide berth he must post himself to intercept them the next ship in the line must be close at hand in any case but in a few seconds she would no longer be confined to the narrow channel of the goulet and what would the first frigate be doing the one he had allowed to pass without attacking her main chains there get the lead going he must keep up to windward as best he could no bottom no bottom with this line he was clear of pollux then avast there with the lead they stood on steadily on the starboardtack in the impenetrable darkness he could hear profuse breathing heavily at his side and all else was silence round him he would have to take another cast of the lead soon enough what was that wind and water had brought a distinctive sound to his ears a solemn noise of a solid body falling into the water it was the sound of a lead being cast and then followed at the appropriate interval the high pitched cry of the leadsman there was a ship just up there to windward and now with the distance lessening and with his hearing concentrated in that direction he could hear other sounds voices the working of yards he leaned over the rail and spoke quietly down into the waist stand by your guns there she was looming faintly on the starboard bow starboard two points meet her they saw hotspur at that same moment from out of the darkness came the hail of a speakingtrumpet but in the middle of a word hornblower spoke down into the waist again fire the guns went off so nearly together that he felt hotspurs light fabric heed a little with the force of the recoil and there again was the shape of a ship lit up by the glare of the broadside he could not hope to force her on the shoals there were too much searoom for that he took the speakingtrumpet elevate your guns aim for her spars he could cripple her the first gun of the new broadside went off immediately after he said the words some fool had not paid attention but the other guns fired after the interval necessary to withdraw the coigns flash after flash bang after bang again and again and again suddenly a flash revealed a change in the shape of the illuminated mizzen topsail and at the same moment that mizzen topsail moved slowly back abaft the beam the frenchman had thrown all aback in a desperate attempt to escape this tormentor risking being raked in the hope of passing under hotspurs stern to get before the wind he would wear the hotspur round and bring her under the fire of the port broadside and chase her on to the trepieds the speakingtrumpet was at his lips when the darkness ahead erupted into a volcano of fire chaos out of the black snowfilled night had come a broadside raking the hotspur from bow to stern along with the sound and the flash came the rending crash of splintered woodwork the loud ringing noise as a cannonball hit the breech of a gun the shriek of the flying splinters and following on that came the screaming of a wounded man cutting through the sudden new stillness one of the armed frigates of the escort the leader of the line most likely had seen the firing and had been close enough to intervene she had crossed hotspurs bows to fire in a raking broadside hardastarboard he could not tack even if he were prepared to take the chance of missing stays with the rigging as much cut up as it must be for he was not clear of the transport yet he must wear even though it meant being raked once more wear the ship hotspur was turning even as her last guns fired into the transport then came the second broadside from ahead flaring out of the darkness a fraction of a second between each successive shot crashing into hotspurs battered bows while hornblower stood trying not to wince thinking what he must do next was that the last shot now there was a new and rending crash forward a succession of snapping noises another thundering crash and cries and shrieks from forward that must be the foremast fallen that must be the foretopsail yard crashing on the deck helm doesnt answer sir called the quartermaster at the wheel with the foremast down hotspur would tend to fly up in the wind even if the wreckage were not dragging alongside to act as a seaanchor he could feel the wind shifting on his cheek now hotspur was helpless now she could be battered to destruction by an enemy twice her size with four times her weight of metal with scantlings twice as thick to keep out hotspurs feeble shot he would have to fight despairingly to the death unless the enemy would be putting his helm astarboard to rake hotspur from astern or he would be doing so as soon as he could make out in the darkness what had happened time would pass very fast and the wind was still blowing thank god and there was the transport close on his starboard side still he spoke loudly into the speakingtrumpet silence silence the bustle and clatter forward where the hands had been struggling with the fallen spars died away even the groaning wounded fell silent that was discipline and not the discipline of the cat o nine tails he could just hear the rumble of the french frigates gun trucks as they ran out the guns for the next broadside and he could hear shouted orders the french frigate was turning to deliver the coup de grace as soon as she made certain of her target hornblower pointed the speakingtrumpet straight upwards as if addressing the sky and he tried to keep his voice steady and quiet he did not want the french frigate to hear mizzen topsail yard unmask those lights that was a bad moment the lights might have gone out the lad stationed on the yard might be dead he had to speak again show those lights discipline kept the hand up there from hailing back but there they were one two three red lights along the mizzen topsail yard even against the wind he heard a wild order being shouted from the french frigate excitement even panic in the voice the french captain was ordering his guns not to fire perhaps he was thinking that some horrible mistake had already been made perhaps in the bewildering darkness he was confusing hotspur with her recent victim not so far off at least he was holding fire at least he was going off to leeward and a hundred yards to leeward in that darkness was the equivalent of a mile in ordinary conditions mask those lights again no need to give the frenchman a mark for gunfire or an objective to which to beat back when he should clear up the situation now a voice spoke out of the darkness close to him bush reporting sir ive left the guns for the moment if you give me leave sir foretopsls all across the starboard battery cant fire those guns in any case yet very well mr bush whats the damage foremasts gone six feet above the deck sir everything went over the starboard side most of the shrouds must have held its all trailing alongside then well get to work in silence mr bush i want every stitch of canvas got in first and then well deal with the wreckage aye aye sir stripping the ship of her canvas would make her far less visible to the enemys eyes and would reduce hotspurs leeway while she rode to her strange sea anchor next moment it was the carpenter up from below were making water very fast sir two feet in the hold my men are plugging one shot hole aft by the magazine but there must be another one forard in the cable tier well need hands at the pumps sir an id like half a dozen more in the cable tier very well so much to be done in a nightmare atmosphere of unreality and then came an explanation of some of the unreality six inches of snow lay on the decks piled in deeper drifts against the vertical surfaces silencing as well as impeding every movement but most of the sense of unreality stemmed from simple exhaustion nervous and physical and the exhaustion had to be ignored while the work went on trying to think clearly in the numbing darkness with the knowledge that the trepieds shoal lay close under their lee on a falling tide getting up sail when the wreckage had been cleared away and discovering by sheer seamans instinct how to handle hotspur under sail without her foremast with only the feel of the wind on his cheeks and the wavering compass in the binnacle to guide him and the shoals waiting for him if he miscalculated id like you to set the spritsail mr bush if you please aye aye sir a dangerous job for the hands that had to spread the spritsail under the bowsprit in the dark with all the accustomed stays swept away by the loss of the foremast but it had to be done to supply the necessary leverage forward to keep hotspur from turning into the wind setting the ponderous maincourse because the maintopmast could not be trusted to carry sail then creeping westward with the pumps clanking lugubriously and the blackness turning slowly to dark grey and the dark grey turning slowly to light grey with the coming of the dawn and the cessation of the snowfall then it was light enough to see the disorder of the decks and the trampled snow snow stained pink here and there in wide areas then at last came the sight of the doris and help at hand it might almost be called safety except that later they would have to beat back against contrary winds and with a jury foremast and in a leaky ship to plymouth and refitting it was when they saw doris hoisting out her boats despatching additional manpower that bush could turn to hornblower with a conventional remark bush was not aware of his own appearance his powderblackened face his hollow cheeks and his sprouting beard but even without that knowledge the setting was bizarre enough to appeal to bushs crude sense of humour a happy new year to you sir said bush with a deaths head grin it was new years day then to the two men the same thought occurred simultaneously and bushs grin was replaced by something more serious i hope your good lady he was taken unawares and could not find the formal words thank you mr bush it was on new years day that the child was expected maria might be in labour at this moment while they stood there talking chapter will you be having dinner on board sir asked doughty no replied hornblower he hesitated before he launched into the next speech that had occurred to him but he decided to continue tonight horatio hornblower dines with horatio hornblower yes sir no joke ever fell as flat as that one perhaps certainly it was too much to expect doughty to catch the classical allusion but he might at least have smiled because it was obvious that his captain had condescended so far as to be facetious youll need your oilskins sir its raining heavily still said doughty of the almost immovable countenance thank you it seemed to have rained every single day since hotspur had crawled into plymouth sound hornblower walked out from the dockyard with the rain rattling on his oilskins as if it were hail and not rain and it continued all the time it took him to make his way to drivers alley the landladys little daughter opened the door to his knock and as he walked up the stairs to his lodgings he heard the voice of the other horatio hornblower loudly proclaiming his sorrows he opened the door and entered the small hot stuffy room where maria was standing with the baby over her shoulder its long clothes hanging below her waist her face lit with pleasure when she saw him and she could hardly wait for him to peel off his dripping oilskins before she came to his arms hornblower kissed her hot cheek and tried to look round the corner at little horatio but the baby only put his face into his mothers shoulder and wailed hes been fractious today dear said maria apologetically poor little fellow and what about you my dear hornblower was careful to make maria the centre of his thoughts whenever he was with her im well enough now dear i can go up and down the stairs like a bird excellent maria patted the babys back i wish he would be good i want him to smile for his father perhaps i could try oh no maria was quite shocked at the notion that a man should hold a crying baby even his own but it was a delightful kind of shock all the same and she yielded the baby to his proffered arms hornblower held his child it was always a slight surprise to find how light that bundle of clothes was and looked down at the rather amorphous features and the wet nose there said hornblower the act of transfer had quieted little horatio for a moment at least maria stood bathed in happiness at the sight of her husband holding her son and hornblowers emotions were strangely mixed one emotion was astonishment at finding pleasure in holding his child for he found it hard to believe that he was capable of such sentiment maria held the back of the fireside armchair so that he could sit down in it and then greatly daring kissed his hair and how is the ship she asked leaning over him shes nearly ready for sea said hornblower hotspur had been in and out of dock her bottom cleaned her seams recaulked her shot holes patched her new foremast had been put in and the riggers had set up the standing rigging she only had to renew her stores oh dear said maria winds steady in the west said hornblower not that that would deter him from beating down channel if he could once work hotspur down the sound he could not think why he had held out this shred of hope to maria little horatio began to wail again poor darling said maria let me take him i can deal with him no it it isnt right it was all wrong in marias mind that a father should be afflicted by his childs tantrums she thought of something else you wished to see this dear mother brought it in this afternoon from lockharts library she brought a magazine from the side table and gave it in exchange for the baby whom she clasped once more to her breast the magazine was the new number of the naval chronicle and maria with her free hand helped hornblower to turn the pages there maria pointed to the relevant passage on almost the last page on january st last it began it was the announcement of little horatios birth the lady of captain horatio hornblower of the royal navy of a son read maria thats me and little horatio im im more grateful to you dear than i can ever tell you nonsense replied hornblower that was just what he thought it was but he made himself look up with a smile that took out any sting from what he said they call you captain went on maria with an interrogative in the remark yes agreed hornblower thats because he embarked once more on the explanation of the profound difference between a commander by rank and a post captain he had said it all before more than once i dont think its right maria very few things are right my dear said hornblower a little absently he was leafing through the other pages of the naval chronicle working forward from the back page where he had started here was the plymouth report and here was one of the things he was looking for came in hm sloop hotspur under jury rig from the channel fleet she proceeded at once into dock captain horatio hornblower landed at once with dispatches then came the law intelligence and the naval courts martial and the monthly register of naval events and the naval debates in the imperial parliament and then between the debates and the poetry came the gazette letters and there it was first in italics came the introduction copy of a letter from vice admiral sir william cornwallis to sir evan nepean bart dated on board of hms hibernia the nd instant next came cornwalliss letter sir i herewith transmit for their lordships information copies of letters i have received from captains chambers of hms naiad and hornblower of hm sloop hotspur acquainting me of the capture of the french national frigate clorinde and of the defeat of an attempt by the french to escape from brest with a large body of troops the conduct of both these officers appears to me to be highly commendable i enclose also a copy of a letter i have received from captain smith of hms doris i have the honour to be with deepest respect your obdt servt wm cornwallis chambers report came next naiad had caught clorinde near molene and had fought her to a standstill capturing her in forty minutes apparently the other french frigate which had come out with the transports had escaped by the raz du sein and had still not been caught then at last came his own report hornblower felt the flush of excitement he had known before on reading his own words in print he studied them afresh at this interval and was grudgingly satisfied they told without elaboration the bare facts of how three transports had been run ashore in the goulet and of how hotspur while attacking a fourth had been in action with a french frigate and had lost her foremast not a word about saving ireland from invasion the merest halfsentence about the darkness and the snow and the navigational perils but men who could understand would understand smiths letter from the doris was brief too after meeting hotspur he had pushed in towards brest and had found a french frigate armed en flute aground on the trepieds with shore boats taking off her troops under the fire of the french coastal batteries doris had sent in her boats and had burned her theres something more in the chronicle that might interest you dear said hornblower he proffered the magazine with his finger indicating his letter another letter from you dear said maria how pleased you must be she read the letter quickly i havent had time to read this before she said looking up little horatio was so fractious and and i never understand all these letters dear i hope you are proud of what you did im sure you are of course luckily little horatio set up a wail at that moment to save hornblower from a specific answer to that speech maria pacified the baby and went on the shopkeepers will know about this tomorrow and theyll all speak to me about it the door opened to admit mrs mason her pattens clattering on her feet raindrops sparkling on her shawl she and hornblower exchanged good evenings while she took off her outer clothing let me take that child said mrs mason to her daughter horry has another letter in the chronicle countered maria indeed mrs mason sat down across the fire from hornblower and studied the page with more care than maria had done but perhaps with no more understanding the admiral says your conduct was very commendable she said looking up yes why doesnt he make you a real captain post as you call it the decision doesnt lie with him said hornblower and i doubt if he would in any case cant admirals make captains not in home waters the godlike power of promotion freely exercised on distant stations was denied to commandersinchief where speedy reference to the admiralty was possible and what about prize money theres none for the hotspur but this this clorinde was captured yes but we werent in sight but you were fighting werent you yes mrs mason but only ships in sight share in prize money except for the flag officers and arent you a flag officer no flag officer means admiral mrs mason mrs mason sniffed it all seems very strange so you do not profit at all by this letter no mrs mason at least not in the way mrs mason meant its about time you made some prize money i hear all the time about the ships that have made thousands eight pounds a month for maria and her with a child mrs mason looked round at her daughter threepence a pound for neck of mutton the cost of things is more than i can understand yes mother horry gives me all he can im sure as captain of a ship below the sixth rate hornblowers pay was twelve pounds a month and he still needed those new uniforms prices were rising with wartime demand and the admiralty despite many promises had not yet succeeded in obtaining an increase in pay for naval officers some captains make plenty said mrs mason it was prize money and the possibility of gaining it that kept the navy quiet under the otherwise intolerable conditions the great mutinies at spithead and the nore were less than ten years old but hornblower felt he would be drawn into a defence of the prize money system shortly if mrs mason persisted in talking as she did luckily the entrance of the landlady to lay the table for supper changed the subject of conversation with another person in the room neither mrs mason nor maria would discuss such a low subject as money and they talked about indifferent matters instead they sat down to dinner when the landlady brought in a steaming tureen the pearl barleys at the bottom horatio said mrs mason supervising him as he served the food yes mrs mason and youd better give maria that other chop that ones meant for you yes mrs mason hornblower had learned to keep a still tongue in his head under the goadings of tyranny when he was a lieutenant in the old renown under captain sawyers command but he had wellnigh forgotten those lessons by now and was having painfully to relearn them he had married of his own free will he could have said no at the altar he remembered and now he had to make the best of a bad business quarrelling with his motherinlaw would not help it was a pity that hotspur had come in for docking at the moment when mrs mason had arrived to see her daughter through her confinement but he need hardly fear a repetition of the coincidence during the days the endless days to come stewed mutton and pearl barley and potatoes and cabbage it might have been a very pleasant dinner except that the atmosphere was unfavourable in two senses the room with its seacoal fire was unbearably hot thanks to the rain no washing could be hung out of doors and hornblower doubted if in the vicinity of drivers alley washing could be hung out of doors unwatched in any case so that on a clotheshorse on the other side of the room hung little horatios clothing and somehow nature arranged it that every stitch little horatio wore had to be washed as often as several times a day hanging on the horse were the long embroidered gowns and the long flannel gowns with their scalloped borders and the flannel shirts and the binders as well as the innumerable napkins that might have been expected to sacrifice themselves like a rearguard in the defence of the main body hornblowers wet oilskins and mrs masons wet shawl added variant notes to the smells in the room and hornblower suspected that little horatio now in the cradle beside marias chair added yet another hornblower thought of the keen clean air of the atlantic and felt his lungs would burst he did his best with his dinner but it was a poor best youre not making a very good dinner horatio said mrs mason peering suspiciously at his plate i suppose im not very hungry too much of doughtys cooking i expect said mrs mason hornblower knew already without a word spoken that the women were jealous of doughty and ill at ease in his presence doughty had served the rich and the great doughty knew of fancy ways of cooking doughty wanted money to bring the cabin stores of the hotspur up to his own fastidious standards doughty was probably supercilious about drivers alley and the family his captain had married into i cant abide that doughty said maria the word spoken now hes harmless enough my dear said hornblower harmless mrs mason said only that one word but demosthenes could not have put more vituperation into a whole philippic and yet when the landlady came in to clear the table mrs mason contrived to be at her loftiest as the landlady left the room hornblowers instincts guided him into an action of which he was actually unconscious he threw up the window and drew the icy evening air deep into his lungs youll give him his death said marias voice and hornblower swung round surprised maria had snatched up little horatio from his cradle and stood clasping him to her bosom a lioness defending her cub from the manifest and wellknown perils of the night air i beg your pardon dear said hornblower i cant imagine what i was thinking of he knew perfectly well that little babies should be kept in stuffy heated rooms and he was full of genuine contrition regarding little horatio but as he turned back and pulled the window shut again his mind was dwelling on the blackstones and the little girls on bleak harsh days and dangerous nights on a deck that he could call his own he was ready to go to sea again chapter with the coming of spring a new liveliness developed in the blockade of brest in every french port during the winter there had been much building of flatbottomed boats the french army two hundred thousand strong was still poised on the channel coast waiting for its chance to invade and it needed gunboats by the thousand to ferry it over when that chance should come but the invasion coast from boulogne to ostend could not supply onetenth onehundredth of the vessels needed these had to be built whenever there were facilities and then had to be moved along the coast to the assembling area to hornblowers mind bonaparte the emperor napoleon as he was beginning to call himself was displaying a certain confusion of ideas in adopting this course of action seamen and shipbuilding materials were scarce enough in france it was absurd to waste them on invasion craft when invasion was impossible without a covering fleet and when the french navy was too small to provide such a fleet lord st vincent had raised an appreciative smile throughout the royal navy when he had said in the house of lords regarding the french army i do not say they cannot come i only say they cannot come by sea the jest had called up a ludicrous picture in everyones mind of bonaparte trying to transport an invading army by montgolfier balloons and the impossibility of such an attempt underlined the impossibility of the french building up a fleet strong enough to command the channel even long enough for the gunboats to row across it was only by the time summer was far advanced that hornblower fully understood bonapartes quandary bonaparte had to persist in this ridiculous venture wasting the substance of his empire on ships and landingcraft even though a sensible man might well write off the whole project and devote his resources to some more profitable scheme but to do so would be an admission that england was impregnable could never be conquered and such an admission would not only hearten his potential continental enemies but would have a most unsettling effect on the french people themselves he was simply compelled to continue along this road to go on building his ships and his gunboats to make the world believe there was a likelihood that england would soon be overthrown leaving him dominant everywhere on earth lord of the whole human race and there was always chance even if it were not one chance in ten or one chance in a hundred but one in a million some extraordinary unpredictable combination of good fortune of british mismanagement of weather and of political circumstances might give him the week he needed to get his army across if the odds were enormous at least the stakes were fantastic in itself that might appeal to a gambler like bonaparte even without the force of circumstance to drive him on so the flatbottomed boats were built at every little fishingvillage along the coast of france and they crept from their pieces of origin towards the great military camp of boulogne keeping to the shallows moving by oar more than by sail sheltering when necessary under the coastal batteries each boat manned by fifty soldiers and a couple of seamen and because bonaparte was moving these craft the royal navy felt bound to interfere with the movement as far as possible that was how it came about that hotspur found herself momentarily detached from the channel fleet and forming a part of a small squadron under the orders of chambers of the naiad operating to the northward of ushant which was doing its best to prevent the passage of half a dozen gunboats along the wild and rocky shore of northern brittany signal from the commodore sir reported foreman chambers spent a great deal of time signalling to his little squadron well asked hornblower foreman was referring to his signal book take station within sight bearing east noreast sir thank you mr foreman acknowledge mr bush well square away a pleasant day with gentle winds from the south east and occasional white clouds coursing over a blue sky overside the sea was green and clear and two miles off on the beam was the coast with its white breakers the chart showed strange names aber wrack and aber benoit which told of the relationship between the breton tongue and welsh hornblower divided his attention between the naiad and the coast as hotspur ran down before the wind and he experienced something of the misers feeling at some depletion of his gold it might be necessary to go off like this to leeward but every hour so spent might call for a day of beating back to windward the decisive strategical point was outside brest where lay the french ships of the line not here where the little gunboats were making their perilous passage you may bringto again mr bush aye aye sir they were now so far from naiad that it would calf for a sharp eye and a good glass to read her signals were the terrier at the rat hole sir said bush coming back to hornblower as soon as hotspur had lainto with her maintopsail to the mast exactly agreed hornblower boats are cleared away ready to launch sir thank you they might have to dash in to attack the gunboats when they came creeping along just outside the surf commodores signalling sir reported foreman about oh its for the lugger sir there she goes said bush the small armed lugger was moving in towards the shore thats the ferret going down the hole mr bush said hornblower unwontedly conversational yes sir theres a gun theres another they could hear the reports borne on the wind and could see the gusts of smoke is there a battery there sir maybe maybe the gunboats are using their own cannon each gunboat mounted one or two heavy guns in the bows but they laboured under the disadvantage that half a dozen discharges racked the little vessels to pieces by the recoil the theory behind those guns was that they were to be used for clearing the beaches of defending troops where the invasion should take place and the gunboats should be safely beached cant make out whats happening fumed bush a low headland cut off their view firings heavy said hornblower must be a battery there he felt irritated the navy was expending lives and material on an objective quite valueless in his opinion he beat his gloved hands together in an effort to restore their warmth for there was an appreciable chilliness in the wind whats that exclaimed bush excitedly training his telescope look at that sir dismasted by god just visible round the point now was a shape that could not instantly be recognized it was the lugger drifting disabled and helpless everything about the situation indicated that she had run into a wellplanned ambush theyre still firing at her sir remarked prowse the telescope just revealed the splashes round her as cannonball plunged into the sea well have to save her said hornblower trying to keep the annoyance out of his voice square away if you please mr prowse and well run down it was extremely irritating to have to go into danger like this to redeem someone elses mismanagement of an expedition unjustified from the start mr bush get a cable out aft ready to tow aye eye sir commodores signalling sir this was foreman speaking our number assist damaged vessel acknowledge chambers had ordered that signal before he could see that hotspur was already on the move hornblower scanned the shore on this side of the headland there was no gunsmoke on this side no sign of any battery with luck all he would have to do was to haul the lugger round the corner down in the waist the voices of bush and wise were urging a working party to their utmost efforts as they took the ponderous cable aft things were happening fast as they always did at crises a shot screamed overhead as hornblower reached for the speakingtrumpet grasshopper stand by to take a line somebody in the disabled lugger waved a handkerchief in acknowledgement back the maintopsl mr prowse and well go down to her that was when the grasshopper disintegrated blew apart in two loud explosions and a cloud of smoke it happened right under hornblowers eyes as he leaned over with his speakingtrumpet one second there was the intact hull of the lugger with living men working on the wreckage and the next the smoking explosions the flying fragments the billowing smoke it must have been a shell from the shore there were howitzers or mortars mounted there most likely a field howitzer battery light and easily moved across country which had been brought up to protect the gunboats a shell must have dropped into the lugger and burst in the magazine hornblower had seen it all and when the cloud of smoke dispersed the bow and stern did not disappear from sight they were floating waterlogged on the surface and hornblower could see a few living figures as well clinging to the wreckage among the fragments lower the quarterboat mr young go and pick up those men this was worse than ever shell fire was a horrible menace to a wooden ship that could so easily be set into an inextinguishable blaze it was utterly infuriating to be exposed to these perils for no profit the quarterboat was on its way back when the next shell screamed overhead hornblower recognized the difference in the sound from that of a roundshot he should have done so earlier a shell from a howitzer had a belt about it a thickening in the centre which gave its flight as it arched across the sky the peculiarly malevolent note he had already heard it was the french army that was firing at them to fight the french navy was the essence of hotspurs duty and of his own but to expose precious ships and seamen to the attack of soldiers who cost almost nothing to a government that enforced conscription was bad business and to expose them without a chance of firing back was sheer folly hornblower drummed on the hammock cloths over the netting in front of him with his gloved hands in a fury of bad temper while young rowed about the wreckage picking up the survivors a glance ashore coincided with the appearance of a puff of white smoke that was one of the howitzers at least before the wind dispersed it he could clearly see the initial upward direction of the puff howitzers found their best range at an angle of fifty degrees and at the end of their trajectory the shellsdropped at sixty degrees this one was behind a low bank or in some sort of ditch his glass revealed an officer standing above it directing the operation of the gun at his feet now came the shriek of the shell not so far overhead even the fountain of water that it threw up when it plunged into the sea was different in shape and duration from those flung up by roundshot from a cannon young brought the quarterboat under the falls and hooked on bush had his men ready to tail away at the tackles while hornblower watched the operation and fumed at every second of delay most of the survivors picked up were wounded some of them dreadfully he would have to go and see they were properly attended to he would have to pay a visit of courtesy but not until hotspur were safely out of this unnecessary peril very well mr prowse bring her before the wind the yards creaked round the quartermaster spun the wheel round into firm resistance and hotspur slowly gathered way to leave this hateful coast behind her next came a sudden succession of noises all loud all different distinguishable even though not two seconds elapsed between the first and the last the shriek of a shell a crash of timber aloft a deep note as the maintopmast backstay parted a thud against the hammock nettings beside hornblower and then a thump three yards from his feet and there on the deck death sizzling death was rolling towards him and as the ship heaved death changed its course with the canting of the deck in a blundering curve as the belt round the shell deflected its roll hornblower saw the tiny thread of smoke the burning fuse oneeighth of an inch long no time to think he sprang at it as it wobbled on its belt and with his gloved hand he extinguished the fuse rubbing at it to make sure the spark was out rubbing at it again unnecessarily before he straightened up a marine was standing by and hornblower gestured to him throw the damned thing overboard he ordered the fact that he swore indicated his bad temper then he looked round every soul on that crowded little quarterdeck was rigid posed in unnatural attitudes as if some gorgons head had turned them all into stone and then with his voice and his gesture they all came back to life again to move and relax it was as if time had momentarily stood still for everyone except himself his bad temper was fanned by the delay and he lashed out with his tongue indiscriminately what are you all thinking about quartermaster put your helm over mr bush just look at that mizzen topsl yard send the hands aloft this minute splice that backstay you there havent you coiled those falls yet move damn you aye aye sir aye aye sir the automatic chorus of acknowledgements had a strange note and in the midst of the bustle hornblower saw first bush from one angle and then prowse from another both looking at him with strange expressions on their faces whats the matter with you he blazed out and with the last word understanding came to him that extinguishing of the fuse appeared to them in monstrous disproportion as something heroic even perhaps as something magnificent they did not see it in its true light as the obvious thing to do indeed the only thing to do nor did they know of the instinctive flash of action that had followed his observation of that remaining oneeighth of an inch of fuse all there was to his credit was that he had seen and acted quicker than they he had not been brave and most certainly not heroic he returned the glance of his subordinates and with all his senses still keyed up to the highest pitch he realized that this was the moment of the conception of a legend that the wildest tales would be told later about this incident and he was suddenly hideously embarrassed he laughed and before the laugh was finished he knew it was a selfconscious laugh the motiveless laugh of an idiot and he was angrier than ever with himself and with chambers of the naiad and with the whole world he wanted to be away from all this back in the approaches to brest doing his proper work and not engaged in these harebrained actions that did not forward the defeat of bonaparte an iota then another thought struck him occasioned by the discovery that the fuse had burned a hole in his right hand glove those were the gloves maria had given him on that dark morning when he had walked with her from the george to take hotspur to sea chapter in the iroise comfortably sheltered with the wind to the east of south hotspur was completing her stores again this was the second time since her refitting in plymouth that she had gone through this laborious process refilling her casks from the waterhoys replacing the empty beef and pork barrels from the victuallers and coaxing all the small stores she could from the itinerant slopship that cornwallis had put into commission she had been six months continuously at sea and was now ready for three more hornblower watched with something of relief the slopship bearing away that six months at sea had barely been sufficient to get his ship clear of all the plagues that had come on board at plymouth disease bed bugs fleas and lice the bed bugs had been the worst they had been hunted from one hiding place in the woodwork to another scorched with smouldering oakum walled in with the paint time after time and each time that he had thought he had extirpated the pests some unfortunate seaman would approach his division officer and with a knuckling of his forehead would report please sir i think ive got em this time he had seven letters from maria to read he had opened the last one already to make sure that she and little horatio were well and he had already completed this task when bush came knocking at his door sitting at the charttable hornblower listened to what bush had to report trifles only and hornblower wondered at bush disturbing his captain about them then bush produced something from his side pocket and hornblower with a sigh knew what had been the real object of this visit it was the latest number of the naval chronicle come on board with the mail the wardroom mess subscribed to it jointly bush thumbed through the pages and then laid the open magazine before him a gnarled finger indicating the passage he had found it only took hornblower a couple of minutes to read it chambers report to cornwallis on the affray off aber wrack which apparently had been published in the gazette to inform the public regarding the circumstances in which grasshopper had been lost bushs finger pointed again to the last four lines captain hornblower informs me that hotspur suffered no casualties although she was struck by a fiveinch shell which did considerable damage aloft but which fortunately failed to explode well mr bush hornblower put a stern lack of sympathy in his voice to warn bush as much as he could it isnt right sir this routine of serving so close to home had serious disadvantages it meant that in only two or three months the fleet would be reading what had appeared in the gazette and the newspapers and it was extraordinary how touchy men were about what was written about them it could well be subversive of discipline and hornblower meant to deal with that possibility from the start would you kindly explain mr bush bush was not to be deterred he blunderingly repeated himself it isnt right sir not right do you mean that it wasnt a fiveinch shell no sir it do you imply that it didnt do considerable damage aloft of course it did sir but perhaps youre implying that the shell really did explode oh no sir i then i fail to see what you are taking exception to mr bush it was highly unpleasant to be cutting and sarcastic with mr bush but it had to be done yet bush was being unusually obstinate tisnt right sir tisnt fair tisnt fair to you sir or the ship nonsense mr bush what dyou think we are actresses politicians were kings officers mr bush with a duty to do and no thought to spare for anything else never speak to me again like this if you please mr bush and there was bush looking at him with bewildered eyes and still stubborn tisnt fair sir he repeated didnt you hear my order mr bush i want to hear no more about this please leave this cabin at once it was horrible to see bush shamble out of the cabin hurt and depressed the trouble with bush was that he had no imagination he could not envisage the other side hornblower could he could see before his eyes at that moment the words he would have written if bush had had his way the shell fell on the deck and with my own hands i extinguished the fuse when it was about to explode he could never have written such a sentence he could never have sought for public esteem by writing it moreover and more important he would scorn the esteem of a public who could tolerate a man who would write such words if by some chance his deeds did not speak for themselves he would never speak for them the very possibility revolted him and he told himself that this was not a matter of personal taste but a wellweighed decision based on the good of the service and in that respect he was displaying no more imagination than bush then he caught himself up short this was all lies all selfdeception refusal to face the truth he had just flattered himself that he had more imagination than bush more imagination perhaps but far less courage bush knew nothing of the sick horror the terrible moment of fear which hornblower had experienced when that shell dropped bush did not know how his admired captain had had a moments vivid mental picture of being blown into bloody rags by the explosion how his heart had almost ceased to beat the heart of a coward bush did not know the meaning of fear and he could not credit his captain with that knowledge either and so bush would never know why hornblower had made so light of the incident of the shell and why he had been so irascible when it was discussed but hornblower knew and would know whenever he could bring himself to face facts there were orders being bellowed on the quarterdeck a rush of bare feet over the planking a clatter of ropes against woodwork and hotspur was beginning to lean over on a new course hornblower was at the cabin door bent on finding out what was the meaning of this activity which he had not ordered when he found himself face to face with young signal from the flag sir hotspur report to commanderinchief thank you on the quarterdeck bush touched his hat i put the ship about as soon as we read the signal sir he explained very good mr bush when a commanderinchief demanded the presence of a ship no time was to be wasted even to inform the captain i acknowledged the signal sir very good mr bush hotspur was turning her stern to brest with the wind comfortably over her quarter she was running out to sea away from france for the commanderinchief to demand the attendance of his farthest outpost must be of significance he had summoned the ship not merely the captain there must be something more in the wind than this gentle breeze bush called the crew to attention to render passing honours to parkers flagship the flagship of the inshore squadron hope he has as good a ship as us to replace us sir said bush who evidently had the same feeling as hornblower to the effect that the departure was only the beginning of a long absence from the iroise no doubt said hornblower he was glad that bush was bearing no malice for his recent dressingdown of course this sudden break in routine was a stimulant in itself but hornblower in a moment of insight realized that bush after a lifetime of being subject to the vagaries of wind and weather could manage to be fatalistic about the unpredictable vagaries of his captain this was the open sea this was the wide atlantic and there on the horizon was a long line of topsails in rigid order the channel fleet whose men and whose guns prevented bonaparte from hoisting the tricolor over windsor castle our number from the commanderinchief sir pass within hail acknowledge mr prowse take a bearing if you please a pleasant little problem to set a course wasting as little time as possible with hibernia closehauled under easy sail and hotspur running free under all plain sail it was a small sop to prowses pride to consult him for hornblower had every intention of carrying out the manoeuvre by eye alone his orders to the wheel laid hotspur on a steadily converging course mr bush stand by to bring the ship to the wind aye aye sir a big frigate was foaming along in hibernias wake hornblower looked and looked again that was the indefatigable once pellews famous frigate the ship in which he had served during those exciting years as midshipman he had no idea she had joined the channel fleet the three frigates astern of indefatigable he knew at once medusa lively amphion all veterans of the channel fleet bunting soared up hibernias halliards all captains sir clear away the quarterboat mr bush it was another example of how good a servant doughty was that he appeared on the quarterdeck with sword and boat cloak within seconds of that signal being read it was highly desirable to shove off in the boat at least as quickly as the boats from the frigates even though it meant that hornblower had to spend longer pitching and tossing in the boat while his betters went up hibernias side before him but the thought that all this presaged some new and urgent action sustained hornblower in the ordeal in the cabin of the hibernia there was only one introduction to be made of hornblower to captain graham moore of the indefatigable moore was a strikingly handsome burly scotsman hornblower had heard somewhere that he was the brother of sir john moore the most promising general in the army the others he knew gore of the medusa hammond of the lively sutton of the amphion cornwallis sat with his back to the great stern window with collins on his left and the five captains seated facing him no need to waste time gentlemen said cornwallis abruptly captain moore has brought me despatches from london and we must act on them promptly even though he began with these words he spent a second or two rolling his kindly blue eyes along the row of captains before he plunged into his explanations our ambassador at madrid he went on and that name made them all stir in their seats ever since the outbreak of war the navy had been expecting spain to resume her old role of ally to france cornwallis spoke lucidly although rapidly british agents in madrid had discovered the content of the secret clauses of the treaty of san ildefonso between france and spain the discovery had confirmed long cherished suspicions by those clauses spain was bound to declare war on england whenever requested by france and until that request was made she was bound to pay a million francs a month into the french treasury a million francs a month in gold and silver gentlemen said cornwallis bonaparte was in constant need of cash for his war expenses spain could supply it thanks to her mines in mexico and peru every month waggonloads of bullion climbed the pyrenean passes to enter france every year a spanish squadron bore the products of the mines from america to cadiz the next flota is expected this autumn gentlemen said cornwallis usually it brings about four millions of dollars for the crown and about the same amount on private account eight millions of dollars and the spanish silver dollar was worth in an england cursed by paper currency a full seven shillings nearly three million pounds the treasure that is not sent to bonaparte said cornwallis will largely go towards reequipping the spanish navy which can be employed against england whenever bonaparte chooses so you can understand why it is desirable that the flota shall not reach cadiz this year so its war sir asked moore but cornwallis shook his head no i am sending a squadron to intercept the flota and i expect youve already guessed that it is your ships that im sending gentlemen but it is not war captain moore the senior officer will be instructed to request the spaniards to alter course and enter an english port there the treasure will be removed and the ships set free the treasure will not be seized it will be retained by his majestys government as a pledge to be returned to his most catholic majesty on the conclusion of a general peace what ships are they sir frigates ships of war three frigates sometimes four commanded by spanish naval officers sir yes theyll never agree sir theyll never violate their orders just because we tell em to cornwallis rolled his eyes up to the deckbeams above and then down again you will have written orders to compel them then well have to fight them sir if they are so foolish as to resist and that will be war sir yes his majestys government is of the opinion that spain without eight million dollars is less dangerous as an open enemy than she would be as a secret enemy with that money available is the situation perfectly clear now gentlemen it was instantly obvious it could be grasped even more quickly than the problem in simple mental arithmetic could be solved prize money onequarter of three million pounds for the captains something approaching eight hundred thousand pounds each an enormous fortune with that sum a captain could buy a landed estate and still have sufficient left over to provide an income on which to live in dignity when invested in the funds hornblower could see that every one of the four other captains was working out that problem too i see you all understand gentlemen captain moore will issue his orders to you to take effect in case of separation and he will make his own plans to effect the interception captain hornblower every eye came round will proceed immediately in hotspur to cadiz to obtain the latest information from his britannic majestys consul there before joining you at the position selected by captain moore captain hornblower will you be kind enough to stay behind after these gentlemen have left it was an extremely polite dismissal of the other four whom collins led away to receive their orders leaving hornblower face to face with cornwallis cornwalliss blue eyes as far as hornblower knew were always kindly but apart from that they were generally remarkably expressionless as an exception this time they had an amused twinkle youve never made a penny of prize money in your life have you hornblower asked cornwallis no sir it seems likely enough that you will make several pennies now you expect the dons to fight sir dont you yes sir only a fool would think otherwise and youre no fool hornblower an ingratiating man would say thank you sir to that speech but hornblower would do nothing to ingratiate himself can we fight spain as well as france sir i think we can are you more interested in the war than in prize money hornblower of course sir collins was back in the cabin again listening to the conversation youve done well in the war so far hornblower said cornwallis youre on the way towards making a name for yourself thank you sir he could say that this time because a name was nothing you have no interest at court i understand no friends in the cabinet or in the admiralty no sir its a long long step from commander to captain hornblower yes sir youve no young gentlemen with you in hotspur either no sir practically every captain in the navy had several boys of good family on board rated as volunteers or as servants learning to be sea officers most families had a younger son to be disposed of and this was as good a way as any accepting such a charge was profitable to the captain in many ways but particularly because by conferring such a favour he could expect some reciprocal favour from the family a captain could even make a monetary profit and frequently did by appropriating the volunteers meagre pay and doling out pocket money instead why not asked cornwallis when we were commissioned i was sent four volunteers from the naval academy sir and since then i have not had time the main reason why young gentlemen from the naval academy kings letter boys were detested by captains was because of this very matter their presence cut down on the number of volunteers by whom the captain could benefit you were unfortunate said cornwallis yes sir excuse me sir said collins breaking in on the conversation here are your orders captain regarding your conduct in cadiz you will of course receive additional orders from captain moore thank you sir cornwallis still had time for a moment more of gossip you were fortunate the day grasshopper was lost that that shell did not explode were you not hornblower yes sir it is quite unbelievable said collins adding his contribution to the conversation what a hot bed of gossip a fleet can be the wildest tales are circulating regarding that shell he was looking narrowly at hornblower and hornblower looked straight back at him in defiance you cant hold me responsible for that sir he said of course not interposed cornwallis soothingly well may good fortune always go with you hornblower chapter hornblower came back on board hotspur in a positively cheerful state of mind there was the imminent prospect of a hundred and fifty thousand pounds in prize money that ought to satisfy mrs mason and hornblower found it possible not to dwell too long on the picture of maria as chatelaine of a country estate he could avoid that subject by thinking about the immediate future a visit to cadiz a diplomatic contact and then the adventure of intercepting a spanish treasure fleet in the broad atlantic and if that were not sufficiently ample food for pleasant day dreams he could recall his conversation with cornwallis a commanderinchief in home waters had small power of promotion but surely his recommendations might have weight perhaps bush with his hand to his hat welcoming him aboard again was not smiling he was wearing a worried anxious look what is it mr bush asked hornblower something you wont like sir were his dreams to prove baseless had hotspur sprung some incurable leak what is it hornblower bit back at the damn you that he nearly said your servants under arrest for mutiny sir hornblower could only stare as bush went on he struck his superior officer hornblower could not show his astonishment or his distress he kept his face set like stone signal from the commodore sir this was foreman breaking in our number send boat acknowledge mr orrock take the boat over at once moore in the indefatigable had already hoisted the broad pendant that marked him as officer commanding a squadron the frigates were still hoveto clustered together there were enough captains there to constitute a general court martial with power to hang doughty that very afternoon now mr bush come and tell me what you know about this the starboard side of the quarterdeck was instantly vacated as hornblower and bush walked towards it private conversation was as possible there as anywhere in the little ship as far as i can tell sir said bush it was like this taking stores on board at sea was a job for all hands and even when they were on board there was still work for all hands distributing the stores through the ship doughty in the workingparty in the waist had demurred on being given an order by a bosns mate mayne by name mayne had swung his starter his length of knotted line that petty officers used on every necessary occasion too frequently in hornblowers judgement and then doughty had struck him there were twenty witnesses and if that were not enough maynes lip was cut against his teeth and blood poured down maynes always been something of a bully sir said bush but this yes said hornblower he knew the twentysecond article of war by heart the first half dealt with striking a superior officer the second half with quarrelling and disobedience and the first half ended with the words shall suffer death there were no mitigating words like or such less punishment blood had been drawn and witnesses had seen it even so some petty officers in the give and take of heavy labour on board ship might have dealt with the situation unofficially but not mayne wheres doughty now he asked in irons sir that was the only possible answer orders from the commodore sir orrock was hastening along the deck towards them waving a sealed letter which hornblower accepted doughty could wait orders could not hornblower thought of returning to his cabin to read them at leisure but a captain had no leisure as he broke the seal bush and orrock withdrew to give him what little privacy was possible when every idle eye in the ship was turned on him the opening sentence was plain enough and definite enough sir you are requested and required to proceed immediately in hm sloop hotspur under your command to the port of cadiz the second paragraph required him to execute at cadiz the orders he had received from the commanderinchief the third and last paragraph named a rendezvous a latitude and longitude as well as a distance and bearing from cape st vincent and required him to proceed there with the utmost expedition as soon as he carried out his orders for cadiz he reread unnecessarily the opening paragraph there was the word immediately mr bush set all plain sail mr prowse a course to weather finisterre as quickly as possible if you please mr foreman signal to the commodore hotspur to indefatigable request permission to proceed only time for one pacing of the quarterdeck up and down and then commodore to hotspur affirmative thank you mr foreman up helm mr bush course souwest by south souwest by south aye aye sir hotspur came round and as every sail began to fill she gathered way rapidly course souwest by south sir said prowse breathlessly returning thank you mr prowse the wind was just abaft the beam and hotspur foamed along as sweating hands at the braces trimmed the yards to an angle that exactly satisfied bushs careful eye set the royals mr bush and well have the stunsl booms rigged out if you please aye aye sir hotspur lay over to the wind not in any spineless fashion but in the way in which a good swordblade bends under pressure a squadron of ships of the line lay just down to leeward and hotspur tore past them rendering passing honours as she did so hornblower could imagine the feelings of envy in the breasts of the hands over there at the sight of this dashing little sloop racing off towards adventure but in that case they did not allow for a year and half spent among the rocks and shoals of the iroise set the stunsls sir asked bush yes if you please mr bush mr young what dyou get from the log nine sir a little more perhaps nine an a quarter nine knots and the studding sails not yet set this was exhilarating marvellous after months of confinement the old lady hasnt forgotten how to run sir said bush grinning all over his face with the same emotions and bush did not know yet that they were going to seek eight million dollars nor and at that moment all hornblowers pleasure suddenly evaporated he fell from the heights to the depths like a man falling from the main royal yard he had forgotten until then all about doughty that word immediately in moores orders had prolonged doughtys life with all those captains available and the commanderinchief at hand to confirm the sentence doughty could have been courtmartialled and condemned within the hour he could be dead by now certainly he would have died tomorrow morning the captains in the channel fleet would be unmerciful to a mutineer now he had to handle the matter himself there was no desperate emergency there was no question of a conspiracy to be quelled he did not have to use his emergency powers to hang doughty but he could foresee a dreary future of doughty in irons and all the ships company aware they had a man in their midst destined for the rope that would unsettle everyone and hornblower would be more unsettled than anyone else except perhaps doughty hornblower sickened at the thought of hanging doughty he knew at once that he had grown fond of him he felt an actual respect for doughtys devotion and attention to duty along with his tireless attention doughty had developed skills in making his captain comfortable comparable with those of a tarryfingered salt making long splices hornblower battled with his misery for the thousandth time in his life he decided that the kings service was like a vampire as hateful as it was seductive he could not think what to do but first he had to know more about the business mr bush would you be kind enough to order the masteratarms to bring doughty to me in my cabin aye aye sir the clank of iron that was what heralded doughtys arrival at the cabin door with gyves upon his wrists very well masteratarms you can wait outside doughtys hard blue eyes looked straight into his well im sorry sir im sorry to put you out like this what the hell did you do it for there had always been a current of feeling as hornblower had guessed between mayne and doughty mayne had ordered doughty to do some specially dirty work at this moment when doughty wished to preserve his hands clean to serve his captains dinner doughtys protest had been the instant occasion for mayne to wind his starter i i couldnt take a blow sir i suppose ive been too long with gentlemen among gentlemen a blow could only be wiped out in blood among the lower orders a blow was something to be received without even a word hornblower was captain of his ship with powers almost unlimited he could tell mayne to shut his mouth he could order doughtys irons to be struck off and the whole incident forgotten forgotten allow the crew to think that petty officers could be struck back with impunity allow the crew to think that their captain had favourites damn it all raved hornblower pounding on the chartroom table i could train someone to take my place sir said doughty before before even doughty could not say those words no no no it was utterly impossible to have doughty circulating about the ship with every morbid eye upon him you might try bailey sir the gunroom steward hes the best of a bad lot yes it made matters no easier to find doughty still so cooperative and then there was a glimmer of light the faintest hint of a possibility of a solution less unsatisfactory than the others they were three hundred leagues and more from cadiz but they had a fair wind youll have to await your trial masteratarms take this man away you neednt keep him in irons and ill give orders about his exercise goodbye sir it was horrible to see doughty retaining the unmoved countenance so carefully cultivated as a servant and yet to know that it concealed a dreadful anxiety hornblower had to forget about it somehow he had to come on deck with hotspur flying along with every inch of canvas spread racing over the sea like a thoroughbred horse at last given his head after long restraint the dark shadow might not be forgotten but at least it could be lightened under this blue sky with the flying white clouds and by the rainbows of spray thrown up by the bows as they tore across the bay of biscay on a mission all the more exciting to the ships company in that they could not guess what it might be there was the distraction the counter irritation of submitting to the clumsy ministrations of bailey brought up from the gunroom mess there was the satisfaction of making a neat landfall off cape ortegal and flying along the biscay coast just within sight of the harbour of ferrol where hornblower had spent weary months in captivity he tried vainly to make out the dientes del diablo where he had earned his freedom and then rounding the far corner of europe and setting a fresh course with the wind miraculously still serving as they plunged along closehauled now to weather cape roca there was a night when the wind backed round and blew foul but gently with hornblower out of bed a dozen times fuming with impatience when hotspur had to go on the port tack and head directly out from the land but then came the wonderful dawn with the wind coming from the south west in gentle puffs and then from the westward in a strong breeze that just allowed studding sails to be spread as hotspur reached southward to make a noon position with cape roca just out of sight to leeward that meant another broken night for hornblower to make the vital chance of course off cape st vincent so as to head with the wind comfortably over hotspurs port quarter and every stitch of canvas still spread direct for cadiz in the afternoon with hotspur still flying along at a speed often reaching eleven knots the lookout reported a blur of land lowlying fine on the port bow as the coastwise shipping hastily raising neutral portuguese and spanish colours at sight of this british ship of war grew thicker ten minutes later another hail from the masthead told that the landfall was perfect and ten minutes after that hornblowers telescope trained fine on the starboard bow could pick up the gleaming white of the city of cadiz hornblower should have been pleased at his achievement but as ever there was no time for selfcongratulation there were the preparations to be made to ask permission of the spanish authorities to enter the port there was the excitement of the prospect of getting into touch with the british representative and now or never there was the decision to be reached regarding his plan for doughty the thought of doughty had nagged at him during these glorious days of spread canvas coming to distract him from his daydreams of wealth and promotion to divert him from his plans regarding his behaviour in cadiz it was like the byeplots in shakespeares plays rising continually from the depths to assume momentarily equal importance with the development of the main plot yet as hornblower had already admitted to himself it was now or never he had to decide and to act at this very minute earlier would have been premature and later would be too late he had risked death often enough in the kings service perhaps the service owed him a life in return a threadbare justification and he forced himself to admit to mere selfindulgence as he finally made up his mind he shut up his telescope with the same fierce decision that he had closed with the enemy in the goulet pass the word for my steward he said no one could guess that the man who spoke such empty words was contemplating a grave dereliction from duty bailey all knees and elbows with the figure of a youth despite his years put his hand to his forehead in salute to his captain within sight and within earshot of a dozen individuals on the quarterdeck i expect his majestys consul to sup with me tonight said hornblower i want something special to offer him well sir said bailey which was exactly what and all hornblower had expected him to say speak up now rasped hornblower i dont exactly know sir said bailey he had suffered already from hornblowers irascibility unplanned during these last days but lucky now damn it man lets have some ideas theres a cut of cold beef sir cold beef for his majestys consul nonsense hornblower took a turn up the deck in deep thought and then wheeled back again mr bush ill have to have doughty released from confinement this evening this ninnys no use to me see that he reports to me in my cabin the moment i have time to spare aye aye sir very well bailey get below now mr bush kindly clear away number one carronade starboard side for the salutes and isnt that the guarda costa lugger lyingto for us there the sun declining towards the west bathed the white buildings of cadiz to a romantic pink as hotspur headed in and as health officers and naval officers and military officers came on board to see that cadiz was guarded against infection and violations of her neutrality hornblower put his spanish to use rusty now as he had not spoken spanish since the last war and more awkward still because of his recent use of french but despite its rustiness very helpful during the formalities while hotspur under topsails glided in towards the entrance to the bay so well remembered despite the years that had passed since his last visit in the indefatigable the evening breeze carried the sound of the salutes round the bay as hotspurs carronade spoke out and santa catalina replied and while the spanish pilot guided hotspur between the pigs and the sows hornblower had a suspicion that the pigs were sea pigs porpoises in spanish and the hands stood by to take in sail and drop anchor there were ships of war lying at anchor already in the bay and not the spanish navy whose masts and yards hornblower could just make out in the inner harbours estados unidos said the spanish naval officer with a gesture towards the nearer frigate hornblower saw the stars and stripes and the broad pendant at the maintopmasthead mr bush stand by to render passing honours constitution commodore preble added a spanish officer the americans were fighting a war of their own at tripoli far up the mediterranean and presumably this preble hornblower could not be sure of the exact name as he heard it was the latest of a series of american commandersinchief drums beat and men lined the side and hats were lifted in salute as hotspur wept by french frigate flicit went on the spanish officer indicating the other ship of war twentytwo ports on a side one of the big french frigates but there was no need to pay her further attention as enemies in a neutral harbour they would ignore each other cut each other dead as gentlemen would do if by unlucky chance they met in the interval between the challenge and the duel lucky that he did not have to give her further thought too seeing that the sight of the constitution was causing modification in his other plans the bye plot was intruding on the main plot again you can anchor here captain said the spanish officer helmalee mr bush hotspur roundedto her topsails were taken in with commendable rapidity and the anchor cable roared out through the hawse it was as well that the operation went through faultlessly seeing that it was carried out under the eyes of the navies of three other nations a flat report echoed round the bay sunset gun take in the colours mr bush the spanish officers were standing formally in line hats in hand as they bowed their farewells hornblower put on his politest manner and took off his hat with his politest bow as he thanked them and escorted them to the side here comes your consul already said the naval officer just before he went down in the gathering darkness a rowing skiff was heading out to them from the town and hornblower almost cut his final farewell short as he tried to recall what honours should be paid to a consul coming on board after sunset the western sky was blood red and the breeze dropped and here in a bay it seemed breathless and stifling after the airy delights of the atlantic and now he had to deal with secrets of state and with doughty recapitulating his worries to himself revived another one there would now be a break in his letters to maria it might be months before she heard from him again and she would fear the worst but there was no time to waste in thinking he had to act instantly chapter with the wind dropping hotspur had swung to her anchors and now from the stern window of the chartroom uss constitution was visible revealed by her lights as she rode idly in slack water if you please sir asked doughty as respectful as ever what is this place cadiz replied hornblower his surprise was only momentary at the ignorance of a prisoner immured below it was possible that some even of the crew still did not know he pointed through the cabin window and thats an american frigate the constitution yes sir until hornblower had seen the constitution at anchor he had been visualizing a drab future for doughty as a penniless refugee on the waterfront at cadiz not daring to ship as a hand before the mast in some merchant ship for fear of being pressed and recognized starving at worst as a beggar at best as a soldier enlisted in the ragged spanish army a better future than the rope all the same now there was a better one still ships of war never had enough men even if preble did not need a good steward bailey came in from the cabin with the last bottle of claret doughty will decant that said hornblower and doughty see that those glasses are properly clean i want them to sparkle yes sir bailey get forard to the galley see that theres a clear fire ready for the marrow bones aye aye sir it was as simple as that as long as each move was welltimed doughty applied himself to decanting the claret while bailey bustled out by the way doughy can you swim doughty did not raise his head yes sir his voice was hardly more than a whisper thank you sir now the expected knock on the door boats coming alongside sir very well ill come hornblower hurried out on to the quarterdeck and down the gangway to greet the visitor darkness had fallen and cadiz bay was quite placid like a dark mirror mr carron wasted no time he hurried aft ahead of hornblower with strides that equalled hornblowers at his hastiest when he sat in a chair in the chartroom he seemed to fill the little place completely for he was a big heavily built man he mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and then readjusted his wig a glass of claret sir thank you mr carron still wasted no time plunging into business while hornblower filled the glasses youre from the channel fleet yes sir under orders from admiral cornwallis you know about the situation then you know about the flota carron dropped his voice at the last words yes sir im here to take back the latest news to the frigate squadron theyll have to act madrid shows no sign of yielding very well sir godoys terrified of boney the country doesnt want to fight england but godoy would rather fight than offend him yes sir im sure theyre only waiting for the flota to arrive and then spain will declare war boney wants to use the spanish navy to help out his scheme for invading england yes sir not that the dons will be much help to him there isnt a ship here ready for sea but theres the flicit here fortyfour guns you saw her of course yes sir shell warn the flota if she gets an inkling of whats in the wind of course sir my last news is less than three days old the courier had a good journey from madrid godoy doesnt know yet that weve found out about the secret clauses in the treaty of san ildefonso but hell guess soon enough by the stiffening of our attitude yes sir so the sooner you get away the better heres the despatch for the officer commanding the intercepting squadron i prepared it as soon as i saw you coming into the bay thank you sir hes captain graham moore in the indefatigable hornblower put the despatch into his pocket he had been aware for some time of sounds and subdued voices from the cabin next door and he guessed the reason now there was a knock and bushs face appeared round the door one moment please mr bush you ought to know im busy yes mr carron bush was the only man in the ship who would dare to intrude at that moment and he only if he thought the matter urgent you had better leave within the hour yes sir i was hoping you might sup with me this evening duty before pleasure although i thank you ill cross the bay now and make the arrangements with the spanish authorities the land breeze will start to make before long and that will take you out yes sir make every preparation for weighing anchor you know of the twentyfour hour rule yes sir under the rules of neutrality a ship of one contending nation could not leave a neutral harbour until one whole day after the exit of a ship of another contending nation the dons may not enforce it on the flicit but theyll certainly enforce it on you if you give them the opportunity twothirds of felicits crew are in the taverns of cadiz at this moment so you must take your chance now ill be here to remind the dons about the twentyfour hour rule if she tries to follow you i might delay her at least the dons dont want to offend us while the flotas still at sea yes sir i understand thank you sir carron was already rising to his feet with hornblower following his example call the consuls boat said hornblower as they emerged on to the quarterdeck bush still had something to say but hornblower still ignored him and even when carron had left there was still an order for bush with which to distract him i want the small bower hove in mr bush and heave short on the best bower aye aye sir if you please sir i want this done in silence mr bush no pipes no orders that flicit can hear station two safe men at the capstan with old canvas to muffle the capstan pawls i dont want a sound aye aye sir but go and attend to that yourself personally if you please mr bush no one else dare intrude on the captain as he strode the quarterdeck in the warm night nor was it long before the pilot came on board carron had certainly succeeded in hastening the slow process of the spanish official mind topsails sheeted home anchor broken out hotspur glided slowly down the bay again before the first gentle puffs of the nightly land breeze with hornblower narrowly watching the pilot it might be a solution of the spaniards problem if hotspur were to take the ground as she went to sea and hornblower determined that should not happen it was only after the pilot had left them and hotspur was standing out to the south westward that he had a moment to spare for bush sir doughtys gone gone it was too dark on the quarterdeck for hornblowers face to be seen and he tried his best to make his voice sound natural yes sir he must have nipped out of the stern window of your cabin sir then he could have lowered himself into the water by the rudderpintles right under the counter where noone could see him and then he must have swum for it sir im extremely angry about this mr bush somebody will smart for it well sir well mr bush it seems you left him alone in the cabin when the consul came on board sir thats when he took his chance you mean its my fault mr bush well yes sir if you want to put it that way mm maybe youre right even if i do say it hornblower paused still trying to be natural god thats an infuriating thing to happen im angry with myself i cant think how i came to be so foolish i expect you had a lot on your mind sir it was distasteful to hear bush standing up for his captain in the face of his captains selfcondemnation theres just no excuse for me ill never forgive myself ill mark him as r on the ships muster sir yes youd better do that cryptic initials in the ships muster rolls told various stories d for discharged d d for dead and r for run deserted but theres some good news too mr bush in accordance with my orders i must tell you mr bush in case of something happening to me but none of what im going to say is to leak out to the ships company of course sir treasure prize money doubloons and dollars a spanish treasure fleet if there were anything that could take bushs mind off the subject of doughtys escape from justice it was this itll be millions sir said bush yes millions the seamen in the five ships would share one quarter of the prize money the same sum as would be divided between five captains and that would mean six hundred pounds a man lieutenants and masters and captains of marines would divide one eighth fifteen thousand pounds for bush at a rough estimate a fortune sir hornblowers share would be ten of those fortunes do you remember sir the last time we captured a flota back in i think it was sir some our jacks when they got their prize money bought gold watches an fried em on gosport hard just to show how rich they were well you can sleep on it mr bush as im going to try to do but remember not a word to a soul no sir of course not sir the project might still fail the flota might evade capture and escape into cadiz it might have turned back it might never have sailed then it would be best if the spanish government and the world at large did not know that such an attempt had ever been contemplated these thoughts and these figures should have been stimulating exciting pleasant but tonight to hornblower they were nothing of the sort they were dead sea fruit turning to ashes in the mouth hornblower snapped at bailey and dismissed him then he sat on his cot too low spirited even to be cheered by the swaying of the cot under his seat to tell him that hotspur was at sea again bound on a mission of excitement and profit he sat with drooping head deep in depression he had lost his integrity and that meant he had lost his selfrespect in his life he had made mistakes whose memory could still make him writhe but this time he had done far more he had committed a breach of duty he had connived at he had actually contrived the escape of a deserter of a criminal he had violated his sworn oath and he had done so from mere personal reasons out of sheer selfindulgence not for the good of the service not for his countrys cause but because he was a softhearted sentimentalist he was ashamed of himself and the shame was all the more acute when his pitiless selfanalysis brought up the conviction that if he could relive those past hours he would do the same again there were no excuses the one he had used that the service owed him a life after all the perils he had run was nonsense the mitigating circumstance that discipline would not suffer thanks to the new exciting mission was of no weight he was a selfcondemned traitor worse still he was a plausible one who had carried through his scheme with deft neatness that marked the born conspirator that first word he had thought of was the correct one integrity and he had lost it hornblower mourned over his lost integrity like niobe over her dead children chapter captain graham moores orders for the disposition of the frigate squadron so as to intercept the flota were so apt that they received even hornblowers grudging approval the five ships were strung out on a line north and south to the limit of visibility with fifteen miles between ships and with the northernmost and southernmost ships looking out to their respective horizons a stretch of sea ninety miles wide could be covered during daylight they beat or ran towards america during the night they retraced their course towards europe so that if by misfortune the flota should reach the line in darkness the interval during which it could be detected would be by that much prolonged the dawn position was to be in the longitude of cape st vincent ѓ west and the sunset position was to be as far to the west of that as circumstances should indicate as desirable for this business of detecting the needle of the flota in the haystack of the atlantic was a little more simple than might appear at first sight the first point was that by the cumbrous law of spain the flota had to discharge its cargo at cadiz and nowhere else the second point was that the direction of the wind was a strong indication of the point of the compass from which the flota might appear the third point was that the flota after a long sea passage was likely to be uncertain of its longitude by sextant it could be reasonably sure of its latitude and could be counted on to run the final stages of its course along the latitude of cadiz ѓ ѓl north so as to make sure of avoiding the portuguese coast on the one hand and the african coast on the other so that in the centre of the british line squarely on latitude ѓ ѓl north lay the commodore in the indefatigable with the other ships lying due north and due south of him a flag signal by day or a rocket by night would warn every ship in the line of the approach of the flota and it should not be difficult for the squadron to concentrate rapidly upon the signalling ship a hundred and fifty miles out from cadiz with plenty of time and space available to enforce their demands an hour before dawn hornblower came out on deck as he had done every two hours during the night and every two hours during all the preceding nights as well it had been a clear night and it was still clear now wind noreast by north sir reported prowse st vincent bearing due north about five leagues a moderate breeze all sail to the royals could be carried although the hotspur was under topsails stealing along closehauled on the port tack hornblower trained his telescope over the starboard beam due south in the direction where medusa should be next in line hotspur as befitted her small importance was the northernmost ship at the point where it was least likely for the flota to appear it was not quite light enough yet for medusa to be visible mr foreman get aloft if you please with your signal book of course every officer and man in hotspur must be puzzled about this daily routine this constant surveillance of a single stretch of water ingenious minds might even guess the true objective of the squadron that could not be helped there she is sir said prowse beating sou by west were a little ahead of station back the mizzen topsl if you please they might be as much as a couple of miles ahead of station not too unsatisfactory after a long night it was easy enough to drop back to regain the exact bearing due north from medusa deck there foreman was hailing from the maintopmasthead medusas signalling commodore to all ships medusa was relaying the signal from indefatigable out of sight to the southward wear ship went on foreman course west topsails mr cheeseman kindly acknowledge cheeseman was the second signal officer learning his trade as foremans deputy send the hands to the braces mr prowse it must be a gratifying experience for moore to manoeuvre a line of ships sixty miles long by sending up and hauling down flags deck there was a different tone in foremans voice not the tone of matter of fact routine sail in sight on the port bow nearly to windward sir coming down before the wind fast hotspur was still waiting for medusas signal to come down to indicate the exact moment to wear what do you make of her mr foreman shes a ship of war sir shes a frigate she looks french to me sir she might be the flicit sir she might well be the flicit coming out from cadiz by now word could easily have reached cadiz regarding the british cordon out at sea flicit would come out she could warn and divert the flota if she could get past the british line or she could hang about on the horizon until the flota should appear and then interfere with the negotiations bonaparte could make great play in the moniteur regarding the heroic french navy coming to the aid of an oppressed neutral fleet and flicits presence might have great weight in the scale should it come to a fight a large french frigate and four large spanish ones against one large british frigate three small ones and a sloop ill get aloft and have a look at her myself sir this was bush in the right place at the right time as usual he ran up the ratlines with the agility of any seaman signals down sir yelled foreman hotspur should put up her helm at this moment for all five ships to wear together no mr prowse well wait on the horizon medusa wore round now she was before the wind increasing her distance rapidly from hotspur on the opposite course thats flicit for certain sir called bush thank you mr bush kindly come down at once drummer beat to quarters clear for action mr cheeseman send this signal have sighted french frigate to windward aye aye sir medusas going out of sight fast hoist it anyway bush had descended like lightning to exchange glances for one moment with hornblower before hurrying off to supervise clearing for action for that moment there was an inquiring look in his eye he alone in the ship beside hornblower knew the objective of the british squadron if hotspur was parted from the other ships when the flota should be sighted she would lose her share of the prize money but prize money was only one factor the flota was a primary objective hotspur would disregard medusas signals and turn aside from the objective at her peril at hornblowers peril and bush knew too the disparity of force between hotspur and flicit a battle broadside to broadside could only end with half hotspurs crew dead and the other half prisoners of war medusas out of sight sir she hasnt acknowledged this was foreman still aloft very well mr foreman you can come down you can see her from the deck sir said prowse yes right on the horizon the frenchmans topsails and topgallants were plainly in view hornblower found it a little difficult to keep them steady in the field of the telescope he was pulsing with excitement he could only hope that his face did not reveal him to be as anxious and worried as he felt cleared for action sir reported bush the guns were run out the excited guns crews at their stations shes hauled her wind exclaimed prowse ah flicit had come round on the starboard tack heading to allow hotspur to pass far astern of her she was declining battle isnt he going to fight exclaimed bush hornblowers tensions were easing a little with this proof of the accuracy of his judgement he had headed for flicit with the intention of engaging in a scrambling long range duel he had hoped to shoot away enough of the flicits spars to cripple her so that she would be delayed in her mission of warning the flota and the frenchman had paralleled his thoughts he did not want to risk injury with his mission not accomplished put the ship about if you please mr prowse hotspur tacked like a machine full and bye now she headed to cross flicits bows on a sharply converging course the frenchman in declining battle had it in mind to slip round the flank of the british line so as to escape in the open sea and join the spaniards ahead of the british and hornblower was heading him off hornblower watched the topsails on the horizon and saw them swing hes turning away much good that would do him far far beyond the topsails was a faint blue line on the horizon the bold coast of southern portugal he wont weather st vincent on that course said prowse lagos st vincent sagres all great names in the history of the sea and that jutting headland would just baulk flicit in her attempt to evade action she would have to fight soon and hornblower was visualizing the kind of battle it would be mr bush sir i want two guns to bear directly astern youll have to cut away the transoms aft get to work at once aye aye sir thank you mr bush sailing ships were always hampered in the matter of firing directly ahead or astern no satisfactory solution of the difficult had ever been found guns were generally so useful on the broadside that they were wasted on the ends of the ship and ship construction had acknowledged the fact now the cry for the carpenters crew presaged abandoning all the advantages that had been wrung from these circumstances by shipbuilders through the centuries hotspur was weakening herself in exchange for a momentary advantage in a rare situation under his feet hornblower felt the crack of timber and the vibration of saws at work send the gunner aft hell have to rig tackles and breechings before the guns are moved the blue line of the coast was now much more sharply defined the towering headland of st vincent was in plain view and flicit was hullup now the long long line of guns along her side clearly visible run out and ready for action her maintopsail was ashiver and she was roundingto now she was challenging action offering battle up helm mr prowse back the maintopsl every minute gained was of value hotspur roundedto as well hornblower had no intention of fighting a hopeless battle if the frenchman could wait he could wait as well with this gentle breeze and moderate sea hotspur held an advantage over the bigger french ship which was not lightly to be thrown away hotspur and flicit eyed each other like two pugilists just stepping into the ring it was such a beautiful day of blue sky and blue sea it was a lovely world which he might be leaving soon the rumble of gun trucks told him that one guncarriage at least was being moved into position and yet at this minute somehow he thought of maria and of little horatio madness he put that thought instantly out of his mind the seconds crept by perhaps the french captain was holding a council of war on his quarterdeck perhaps he was merely hesitating unable to reach a decision at this moment when the fate of nations hung in the balance message from mr bush sir one gun run out ready for action sir the other one in five minutes thank you mr orrock tell mr bush to station the two best gunlayers there flicits maintopsail was filling again hands to the braces hotspur stood in towards her enemy hornblower would not yield an inch of sea room unnecessarily helm aweather that was very long cannon shot as hotspur wore round flicits bow was pointing straight at her hotspurs stern was turned squarely to her enemy the ships exactly in line tell mr bush to open fire even before the message could have reached him bush down below had acted there was the bangbang of the guns the smoke bursting out under the counter eddying up over the quarterdeck with the following wind nothing visible to hornblowers straining eye at the telescope only the beautiful lines of flicits bows her sharplysteeved bowsprit her gleaming canvas the rumble of the guntrucks underfoot as the guns were run out again bang hornblower saw it standing right above the gun looking straight along the line of flight he saw the projectile a lazy pencil mark against the white and blue up and then down before the smoke blew forward surely that was a hit the smoke prevented his seeing the second shot the long british ninepounder was the best gun in the service as far as precision went the bore was notoriously true and the shot could be more accurately cast than the larger projectiles and even a ninepounder shot flying at a thousand feet a second could deal lusty blows bang the frenchman would he unhappy at receiving this sort of punishment without hitting back look at that said prowse flicits forestaysail was out of shape flapping in the wind it was hard to see at first glance what had happened his forestays parted sir decided prowse that prowse was correct was shown a moment later when flicit took in the forestaysail the loss of the sail itself made little difference but the forestay was a most important item in the elaborate system of checks and balances which kept a ships masts in position under the pressure of the sails mr orrock run below and say well done to mr bush bang as the smoke eddied hornblower saw flicit roundto and as her broadside presented itself to his sight it vanished in a great bank of leaping smoke there was the horrid howl of a passing cannonball somewhere near there were two jets of water from the surface of the sea one on each quarter and that was all hornblower saw or heard of the broadside an excited crew firing from a wheeling ship could not be expected to do better than that even with twentytwo guns a ragged cheer went up from hotspurs crew and hornblower turning saw that every idle hand was craning out of the gunports peering aft at the frenchman he could hardly object to that but when he turned back to look at flicit again he saw enough to set the men hurriedly at work the frenchman had not yawed merely to fire her broadside she was hoveto mizzen topsail to the mast in order to splice the forestay lying like that her guns would not bear but not a second was to be lost with hotspur before the wind and the range increasing almost irretrievably stand by your guns to port hands to the braces hardastarboard hotspur wore sweetly round on to the porttack she was on flicits port quarter where not a french gun would bear bush came running from aft to keep his eye on the portside guns he strode along from gun to gun making sure by eye that elevation and training were correct as hotspur fired her broadside into her hapless enemy very long range but some of those shots must have caused damage hornblower watched the bearing of flicit altering as hotspur drew astern of her standby to go about after the next broadside the nine guns roared out and the smoke was still eddying in the waist as hotspur tacked starboard side guns excited men raced across the deck to aim and train another broadside but flicits mizzen topsail was wheeling round helm aweather by the time the harassed frenchman had come before the wind again hotspur had anticipated her both ships were again in line and bush was racing aft to supervise the fire of the stern chasers once more this was revenge for the action with the loire so long ago in this moderate breeze and smooth sea the handy sloop held every advantage over the big frigate what had gone on up to now was only a sample of what was to continue all through that hungry weary day of golden sun and blue sea and billowing powder smoke the leeward position that hotspur held was a most decided advantage to leeward over the horizon lay the british squadron the frenchman dared not chase her for long in that direction lest he find himself trapped between the wind and overwhelming hostile strength moreover the frenchman had a mission to perform he was anxious to find and warn the spanish squadron yet when he had won for himself enough sea room to weather st vincent and to turn away his teasing little enemy hung on to him firing into his battered stern shooting holes in his sails cutting away his running rigging during that long day flicit fired many broadsides all at long range and generally badly aimed as hotspur wheeled away out of the line of fire and during all that long day hornblower stood on his quarterdeck watching the shifts of the wind rapping out his orders handling his little ship with unremitting care and inexhaustible ingenuity occasionally a shot from flicit struck home under hornblowers very eyes an eighteenpounder ball came in through a gunport and struck down five men into a bloody heaving mass yet until long after noon hotspur evaded major damage while the wind backed round southerly and the sun crept slowly round to the west with the shifting of the wind his position was growing more precarious and with the passage of time fatigue was numbing his mind at a long threequarters of a mile flicit at last scored an important hit one hit out of the broadside she fired as she yawed widely off her course there was a crash aloft and hornblower looked up to see the main yard sagging in two halves shot clean through close to the centre each half hanging in the slings at its own drunken angle threatening each of them to come falling like an arrow down through the deck it was a novel and cogent problem to deal with to study the dangling menaces and to give the correct helm order that set the sails ashiver and relieved the strain mr wise take all the men you need and secure that wreckage then he could put his glass again to his aching eye to see what flicit intended to do she could force a close action if she took instant advantage of the opportunity he would have to fight now to the last gasp but the glass revealed something different something he had to look at a second time before he could trust his swimming brain and his weary eye flicit had filled away with every sail drawing she was reaching towards the sunset she had turned tail and was flying for the horizon away from the pest which had plagued all the spirit out of her in nine continuous hours of battle the hands saw it they saw her go and someone raised a cheer which ran raggedly along the deck there were grins and smiles which revealed teeth strangely white against the powder blackened faces bush came up from the waist powder blackened like the others sir he said i dont know how to congratulate you thank you mr bush you can keep your eye on wise theres the two spare stunsl booms fish the main yard with those aye aye sir despite the blackening of his features despite the fatigue that even bush could not conceal there was that curious expression in bushs face again inquiring admiring surprised he was bursting with things that he wanted to say it called for an obvious effort of will on bushs part to turn away without saying them hornblower fired a parting shot at bushs receding back i want the ship ready for action again before sunset mr bush gurney the gunner was reporting weve fired away all the top tier of powder sir an were well into the second tier thats a ton an a half of powder five tons of shot sir we used every cartridge my mates are sewing new ones now the carpenter next and then huffnell the purser and wallis the surgeon arrangements to feed the living and arrangements to bury the dead the dead whom he had known so well there was a bitter regret and a deep sense of personal loss as wallis read the names good seamen and bad seamen alive this morning and now gone from this world because he had done his duty he must not think along those lines at all it was a hard service to which he belonged hard and pitiless like steel like flying cannonshot at nine oclock at night hornblower sat down to the first food he had eaten since the night before and as he submitted to baileys clumsy ministrations he thought once more about doughty and from doughty he went on the step was perfectly natural to think about eight million spanish dollars in prize money his weary mind was purged of the thought of sin he did not have to class himself with the cheating captains he had heard about with the peculating officers he had known he could grant himself absolution grudging absolution chapter with her battered sides and her fished main yard hotspur beat her way back towards the rendezvous appointed in case of separation even in this pleasant latitude of southern europe winter was asserting itself the nights were cold and the wind blew chill and hotspur had to ride out a gale for twentyfour hours as she tossed about st vincent bearing north fifteen leagues was the place of rendezvous but there was no sign of the frigate squadron hornblower paced the deck as he tried to reach a decision as he calculated how far off to leeward the recent gale might have blown indefatigable and her colleagues and as he debated what his duty demanded he should do next bush eyed him from a distance as he paced even though he was in the secret regarding the flota he knew better than to intrude then at last came the hail from the masthead sail ho sail to windward deck there theres another looks like a fleet sir now bush could join hornblower i expect thats the frigates sir maybe hornblower hailed the maintopmasthead how many sail now eight sir sir they look like ships of the line some of them sir yes sir a threedecker an some twodeckers a squadron of ships of the line heading for cadiz they might possibly be french fragments of bonapartes navy sometimes evaded blockade in that case it was his duty to identify them risking capture most likely they were british and hornblower had a momentary misgiving as to what their presence would imply in that case well stand towards them mr bush mr foreman hoist the private signal there were the topsails showing now six ships of the line ploughing along in line ahead a frigate out on either flank leading ship answers sir thats the private signal for this week very well make our number todays grey sea and grey sky seemed to reflect the depression that was settling over hornblowers spirits dreadnought sir admiral parker his flags flying so parker had been detached from the fleet off ushant hornblowers unpleasant conviction was growing flag to hotspur sir captain come on board thank you mr foreman mr bush call away the quarter boat parker gave an impression of greyness like the weather when hornblower was led aft to dreadnoughts quarterdeck his eyes and his hair and even his face were of a neutral grey but he was smartly dressed so that hornblower felt something of a ragamuffin in his presence wishing too that this mornings shave had been more effective what are you doing here captain hornblower i am on the rendezvous appointed for captain moores squadron sir captain moores in england by this time the news left hornblower unmoved for it was what he was expecting to hear but he had to make an answer indeed sir you havent heard the news ive heard nothing for a week sir moore captured the spanish treasure fleet where were you i had an encounter with a french frigate sir a glance at hotspur lying hoveto on the dreadnoughts beam could take in the fished mainyard and the raw patches on her sides you missed a fortune in prize money so i should think sir six million dollars the dons fought and one of their frigates blew up with all hands before the others surrendered in a ship in action drill and discipline had to be perfect a moments carelessness on the part of a powder boy or a gun loader could lead to disaster hornblowers thoughts on this subject prevented him this time from making even a conversational reply and parker went on without waiting for one so its war with spain the dons will declare war as soon as they hear the news they probably have done so already this squadron is detached from the channel fleet to begin the blockade of cadiz yes sir you had better return north after moore report to the channel fleet off ushant for further orders aye aye sir the cold grey eyes betrayed not the least flicker of humanity a farmer would look at a cow with far more interest than this admiral looked at a commander a good journey to you captain thank you sir the wind was well to the north of west hotspur would have to stand far out to weather st vincent and farther out still to make sure of weathering cape roca parker and his ships had a fair wind for cadiz and although hornblower gave his orders the moment he reached the deck they were over the horizon almost as soon as hotspur had hoisted in her boat and had settled down on the starboard tack closehauled to begin the voyage back to ushant and as she plunged to the seas that met her starboard bow there was something additional to be heard and felt about her motion as each wave crest reached her and she began to put her bows down there was a sudden dull noise and momentary little shock through the fabric of the ship to be repeated when she had completed her descent and began to rise again twice for every wave this happened so that ear and mind came to expect it at each rise and fall it was the fished mainyard splinted between the two spare studding sail booms however tightly the trapping was strained that held the joint together a little play remained and the ponderous yardarms settled backward and forward with a thump twice with every wave until mind and ear grew weary of its ceaseless monotony it was on the second day that bailey provided a moments distraction for hornblower while hotspur still reached out into the atlantic to gain her offing this was in the pocket of your nightshirt sir i found it when i was going to wash it it was a folded piece of paper with a note written on it and that note must have been written the evening that hotspur lay in cadiz bay bailey clearly did not believe in too frequent washing of nightshirts sir the cabin stores are short of capers and cayenne thank you sir thank you sir your humble obedient servant j doughty hornblower crumpled the paper in his hand it was painful to be reminded of the doughty incident this must be the very last of it did you read this bailey no sir im no scholar sir that was the standard reply of an illiterate in the royal navy but hornblower was not satisfied until he had taken a glance at the ships muster rolls and seen the x against baileys name most scotsmen could read and write it was fortunate that bailey was an exception so hotspur continued closehauled first on the starboard tack and then on the port carrying sail very tenderly on her wounded mainyard while she made her way northward over the grey atlantic until at last she weathered finisterre and could run two points free straight for ushant along the hypotenuse of the bay of biscay it snowed on new years eve just as it had snowed last new years eve when hotspur had baulked bonapartes attempted invasion of ireland it was raining and bleak and thick weather closely limited the horizon when hotspur attained the latitude of ushant and groped her way slowly forward in search of the channel fleet the thunderer loomed up in the mist and passed her on to the majestic and the majestic passed her on until the welcome word hibernia came back in reply to bushs hail there was only a small delay while the news of hotspurs arrival was conveyed below to the admiral before the next hail came collinss voice clearly recognizable despite the speakingtrumpet captain hornblower yes sir would you kindly come aboard hornblower was ready this time so closely shaved that his cheeks were raw his best coat on two copies of his report in his pocket cornwallis was shivering huddled in a chair in his cabin a thick shawl over his shoulders and another over his knees and presumably with a hot bottle under his feet with his shawls and his wig he looked like some old woman until he looked up with his china blue eyes now what in the world have you been up to this time hornblower i have my report here sir give it to collins now tell me hornblower gave the facts as briefly as he could moore was furious at your parting company but i think hell excuse you when he hears about this medusa never acknowledged your signal no sir you did quite right in hanging on to flicit ill endorse your report to that effect moore ought to be glad that there was one ship fewer to share his prize money im sure he didnt give that a thought sir i expect youre right but you hornblower you could have turned a blind eye to the flicit theres a precedent in the navy for turning a blind eye then you could have stayed with moore and shared the prize money if flicit had escaped round cape st vincent there might not have been any prize money sir i see i quite understand the blue eyes had a twinkle i put you in the way of wealth and you disdain it hardly that sir it was a sudden revelation to hornblower that cornwallis had deliberately selected him and hotspur to accompany moore and share the prize money every ship must have been eager to go conceivably this was a reward for months of vigilance in the goulet now collins entered the conversation how are your stores ive plenty sir food and water for sixty more days on full rations what about your powder and shot collin tapped his finger on hornblowers report which he had been reading ive enough for another engagement sir and your ship weve plugged the shot holes sir we can carry sail on the mainyard as long as it doesnt blow too strong cornwallis spoke again would it break your heart if you went back to plymouth of course not sir thats as well for im sending you in to refit aye aye sir when shall i sail youre too restless even to stay to dinner no sir cornwallis laughed outright i wouldnt like to put you to the test he glanced up at the telltale windvane in the deck beams above men who had spent their whole lives combating the vagaries of the wind all felt alike in that respect when a fair wind blew it was sheer folly to waste even an hour on a frivolous pretext youd better sail now went on cornwallis you know ive a new second in command no sir lord gardner now that i have to fight the dons as well as boney i need a viceadmiral im not surprised sir if you sail in this thick weather you wont have to salute him that will save the king some of his powder that youre so anxious to burn collins give captain hornblower his orders so he would be returning once more to plymouth once more to maria chapter it really was a magnificent spectacle said maria the naval chronicle at which hornblower was glancing while conversing with her used those identical words magnificent spectacle im sure it must have been dear under his eyes was a description of the landing of the spanish treasure at plymouth from the frigates captured by moores squadron military precautions had of course been necessary when millions of pounds in gold and silver had to be piled into wagons and dragged through the streets up to the citadel but the fanfare had exceeded military necessity the second dragoon guards had provided a mounted escort the seventyfirst foot had marched with the wagons the local militia had lined the streets and every military band for miles round had played patriotic airs and when the treasure was moved on to london troops had marched with it and their bands had marched with them so that every town through which the convoy passed had been treated to the same magnificent spectacle hornblower suspected that the government was not averse to calling the attention of as many people as possible to this increase in the wealth of the country at a moment when spain had been added to the list of englands enemies they say the captains will receive hundreds of thousands of pounds each said maria i suppose it will never be our good fortune to win anything like that dear it is always possible said hornblower it was astonishing but most convenient that maria was quite unaware of any connexion between hotspurs recent action with flicit and moores capture of the flota maria was shrewd and sharp but she was content to leave naval details to her husband and it never occurred to her to inquire how it had come about that hotspur although attached to the channel fleet off ushant had found herself off cape st vincent mrs mason might have been more inquisitive but she thank god had returned to southsea what happened to that doughty asked maria he deserted answered hornblower luckily again maria was not interested in the mechanics of desertion and did not inquire into the process im not sorry dear she said i never liked him but im afraid you miss him i can manage well enough without him said hornblower it was useless to buy capers and cayenne during this stay in plymouth bailey would not know what to do with them perhaps one of these days ill be able to look after you instead of these servants said maria there was the tender note in her voice again and she was drawing nearer no one could do that better than you my darling answered hornblower he had to say it he could not hurt her he had entered into this marriage voluntarily and he had to go on playing the part he put his arm round the waist that had come within reach you are the kindest husband darling said maria ive been so happy with you not as happy as i am when you say that said hornblower that was the base intriguer speaking again the subtle villain the man who had plotted doughtys escape from justice no he must remember that his conscience was clear now in that respect that selfindulgence had been washed away by the blood that had poured over the decks of flicit i often wonder why it should be went on maria with a new note in her voice i wonder why you should be so kind to me when i think about you darling and me nonsense said hornblower as bluffly as he could manage you must always be sure of my feelings for you dear never doubt me my very dearest said maria her voice changing again the note of inquiry dying out and the tenderness returning she melted into his arms im fortunate that you have been able to stay so long in plymouth this time that was my good fortune dear replacing the transoms which bush had so blithely cut away in hotspurs stern for the fight with flicit had proved to be a laborious piece of work hotspurs stern had had to be almost rebuilt and the little one has been sleeping like a lamb all the evening went on maria hornblower could only hope that this did not involve his crying all night a knock at the door made maria tear herself away from hornblowers embracing arm gentleman to see you said the landladys voice it was bush in peajacket and scarf standing hesitating on the threshold good evening sir your servant maam i hope i dont intrude of course not said hornblower wondering what shift of wind or politics could possibly have brought bush here and very conscious that bushs manner was a little odd come in man come in let me take your coat unless your news is urgent hardly urgent sir said bush rather ponderously allowing himself with embarrassment to be relieved of his coat but i felt you would like to hear it he stood looking at them both his eyes not quite in focus yet sensitive to the possibility that marias silence might be a sign that to her he was unwelcome but maria made amends wont you take this chair mr bush thank you maam seated he looked from one to the other again it was quite apparent to hornblower by now that bush was a little drunk well what is it he asked bushs face split into an ecstatic grin droits of admiralty sir he said what do you mean moore and the frigates i mean captain moore of course begging your pardon sir what about them i was in the coffeeroom of the lord hawke sir i often go there of an evening and last wednesdays newspapers came down from london and there it was sir droits of admiralty wrecks stranded whales flotsam and jetsam droits of admiralty dealt with things of this sort appropriating them for the crown and despite the name they were of no concern to their lordships bushs grin expanded into a laugh serves em right doesnt it sir he said youll have to explain a little further all that treasure they captured in the flota sir its not prize money at all it goes to the government as droits of admiralty the frigates dont get a penny you see sir it was time of peace now hornblower understood in the event of war breaking out with another country the ships of that country which happened to be in british ports were seized by the government as droits of admiralty prize money came under a different category for prizes taken at sea in time of war were droits of the crown and were specifically granted to the captors by an order in council which waived the rights of the crown the government was perfectly justified legally in its action and however much that action would infuriate the ships companies of the frigates it would make the rest of the navy laugh outright just as it had made bush laugh so we didnt lose anything sir on account of your noble action noble ive always wanted to tell you it was noble sir but how could you lose anything asked maria dont you know about that maam asked bush turning his wavering gaze upon her wavering or not and whether he was drunk or not bush could still see that maria had been left in ignorance of the opportunity that hotspur had declined and he still was sober enough to make the deduction that it would be inadvisable to enter into explanations what was it that captain hornblower did that was so noble asked maria least said soonest mended maam said bush he thrust his hand into his side pocket and laboriously fished out a small bottle i took the liberty of bringing this with me maam so that we could drink to the health of captain moore an the indefatigable an the droits of admiralty its rum maam with hot water an lemon an sugar maam it makes a suitable drink for this time o day hornblower caught marias glance its too late tonight mr bush he said well drink that health tomorrow ill help you with your coat after bush had left hornblower turned back to maria hell find his way back to the ship all right he said so you did something noble darling said maria bush was drunk replied hornblower he was talking nonsense i wonder said maria her eyes were shining i always think of you as noble my darling nonsense said hornblower maria came forward to him putting her hand up to his shoulders coming close so that he could resume the interrupted embrace of course you must have secrets from me she said i understand youre a kings officer as well as my darling husband now that she was in his arms she had put her head far back to look up at him its no secret she went on that i love you my dear noble love more than life itself hornblower knew it was true he felt his tenderness towards her surging up within him but she was still speaking and something else that isnt a secret went on maria perhaps youve guessed i think you have i thought so said hornblower you make me very happy my dear wife maria smiled her face quite transfigured perhaps this time it will be a little daughter a sweet little girl hornblower had suspected it as he said he did not know if he was happy with his knowledge although he said he was it would only be a day or two before he took hotspur to sea again back to the blockade of brest back to the monotonous perils of the goulet chapter hotspur lay in the iroise and the victualler was heavingto close alongside to begin again the toilsome labour of transferring stores after sixty days of blockade duty there would be much to do even though the pleasant sunshine of early summer would ease matters a little the fendoffs were over the side and the first boat was on its way from the victualler bringing the officer charged with initiating the arrangements heres the post sir said the officer handing hornblower the small package of letters destined for the ships company but heres a letter from the commanderinchief sir the sent it across to me from the hibernia as i passed through the outer squadron thank you said hornblower he passed the packet to bush to sort out there would be letters from maria in it but a letter from the commanderinchief took precedence there was the formal address horatio hornblower esq master and commander hm sloop hotspur the letter was sealed with an informal wafer instantly broken my dear captain hornblower i hope you can find it convenient to visit me in hibernia as i have news for you that would best be communicated personally to save withdrawing hotspur from her station and to save you a long journey by boat you might find it convenient to come in the victualler that brings this letter you are therefore authorized to leave your first lieutenant in command and i will find means for returning you to your ship when our business is completed i look forward with pleasure to seeing you your obdt servant wm cornwallis two seconds of bewilderment and then a moment of horrid doubt which made hornblower snatch the other letters back from bush and hurriedly search through them for those from maria best communicated personally hornblower had a sudden secret fear that something might have happened to maria and that cornwallis had assumed the responsibility for breaking the news to him but here was a letter from maria only eight days old and all was well with her and with little horatio and the child to be cornwallis could hardly have later news than that hornblower was reduced to rereading letter and weighing every word like a lover receiving his first love letter the whole letter appeared cordial in tone until hornblower forced himself to admit that if it was summons to a reprimand it might be worded in exactly the same way except for the opening word my that was a departure from official practice yet it might be a mere slip and the letter concerned itself with news too hornblower took a turn up the deck and forced himself to laugh at himself he really was behaving like a lovelorn youth if after all these years of senice he had not learned to wait patiently through a dull hour for an inevitable crisis the navy had not taught him even his first lesson the stores came slowly on board there were the receipts to sign and of course there were the final hurried questions hurled at him by people afraid of accepting responsibility make up your own mind about that snapped hornblower and mr bushll tell you what to do and i hope hell put a flea in your ear then at last he was on a strange deck watching with vast curiosity the handling of a different ship as the victualler filled away and headed out of the iroise the victuallers captain offered him the comfort of his cabin and suggested sampling the new consignment of rum but hornblower could not make himself accept either offer he could only just manage to make himself stand still aft by the taffrail as they gradually left the coast behind and picked their way through the inshore squadron and set a course for the distant topsails of the main body of the channel fleet the huge bulk of the hibernia loomed up before them and hornblower found himself going up the side and saluting the guard newton the captain of the ship and collins the captain of the fleet both happened to be on deck and received him cordially enough hornblower hoped they did not notice his gulp of excitement as he returned their good afternoons collins prepared to show him to the admirals quarters please dont trouble sir i can find my own way protested hornblower id better see you past all the cerberuses that guard these nether regions said collins cornwallis was seated at one desk and his flaglieutenant at another but they both rose at his entrance and the flaglieutenant slipped unobtrusively through a curtained door in the bulkhead while cornwallis shook hornblowers hand it could hardly be a reprimand that was coming yet hornblower found it difficult to sit on more than the edge of the chair that cornwallis offered him cornwallis sat with more ease yet bolt upright with his back quite flat as was his habit well said cornwallis hornblower realized that cornwallis was trying to conceal his mood yet there was or was there not a twinkle in the china blue eyes all these years as commanderinchief still had not forged the admiral into the complete diplomat or perhaps they had hornblower could only wait he could think of nothing to say in reply to that monosyllable ive had a communication about you from the navy board said cornwallis at length severely yes sir hornblower could find a reply to this speech the navy board dealt with victualling and supplies and such like matters it could be nothing vital theyve called my attention to the consumption of stores by the hotspur you appear to have been expensive hornblower gunpowder shot sails cordage youve been using up these things as if hotspur were a ship of the line have you anything to say no sir he need not offer the obvious defence not to cornwallis neither have i cornwallis smiled suddenly as he said that his whole expression changing and that is what i shall tell the navy board its a naval officers duty to shoot and be shot at thank you sir ive done all i need to do in transmitting this information the smile died away from cornwalliss face and was replaced by something bleak something a little sad he looked suddenly much older hornblower was making ready to rise from his chair he could see that cornwallis had sent for him so that this censure from the navy board should be deprived of all its sting in the service anticipated crises sometimes resolved themselves into anticlimaxes but cornwallis went on speaking the sadness of his expression was echoed in the sadness of the tone of his voice now we can leave official business he said and proceed to more personal matters im hauling down my flag hornblower im sorry to hear that sir those might be trite mechanical words but they were not hornblower was genuinely sincerely sorry and cornwallis could hardly think otherwise it comes to us all in time he went on fiftyone years in the navy hard years too sir yes for two years and three months i havent set foot on shore but no one else could have done what you have done sir no one else could have maintained the channel fleet as a fighting body during those first years of hostilities thwarting every attempt by bonaparte to evade its crushing power you flatter me replied cornwallis very kind of you hornblower gardners taking my place and hell do just as well as me even in the sadness of the moment hornblowers ever observant mind took notice of the use of that name without the formal lord or admiral he was being admitted into unofficial intimacy with a commanderinchief albeit one on the point of retirement i cant tell you how much i regret it all the same sir he said lets try to be more cheerful said cornwallis the blue eyes were looking straight through hornblower extraordinarily penetrating apparently what they observed was specially gratifying cornwalliss expression softened something appeared there which might almost be affection doesnt all this mean anything to you hornblower he asked no sir replied hornblower puzzled only what ive said its a great pity that you have to retire sir nothing else no sir i didnt know such disinterestedness was possible dont you remember what is the last privilege granted a retiring commanderinchief no sir that was true when hornblower spoke realization came a second later oh of course now its beginning to dawn on you im allowed three promotions midshipman to lieutenant lieutenant to commander commander to captain yes sir hornblower could hardly speak those words he had to swallow hard its a good system went on cornwallis at the end of his career a commanderinchief can make those promotions without fear or favour he has nothing more to expect in this world and so he can lay up store for the next by making his selection solely for the good of the service yes sir do i have to go on im going to promote you to captain thank you sir i cant very true he could not speak as i said i have the good of the service in mind youre the best choice i can make hornblower thank you sir mark you this is the last service i can do for you a fortnight from now ill be nobody youve told me you have no friends in high places yes sir no sir and commands still go by favour i hope you find it hornblower and i hope you have better luck in the matter of prize money i did my best for you id rather be a captain and poor than anyone else and rich sir except perhaps an admiral said cornwallis he was positively grinning yes sir cornwallis rose from his chair now he was a commanderinchief again and hornblower knew himself dismissed cornwallis raised his voice in the highpitched carrying hail of the navy pass the word for captain collins i must thank you sir most sincerely dont thank me any more youve thanked me enough already if ever you become an admiral with favours to give youll understand why collins had entered and was waiting at the door goodbye hornblower goodbye sir only a shake of the hand no further word and hornblower followed collins to the quarterdeck ive a waterhoy standing by for you said collins in a couple of tacks shell fetch hotspur thank you sir youll be in the gazette in three weeks time plenty of time to make your arrangements yes sir salutes the squealing of pipes and hornblower went down the side and was rowed across to the troy it was an effort to be polite to the captain the tiny crew had hauled up the big lugsails before hornblower realized that this was an interesting process which he would have done well to watch closely with the lugsails trimmed flat and sharp the little hoy laid herself close to the wind and foamed forward towards france those last words of collins were still running through hornblowers mind he would have to leave the hotspur he would have to say goodbye to bush and all the others and the prospect brought a sadness that quite took the edge off the elation that he felt of course he would have to leave her hotspur was too small to constitute a command for a post captain he would have to wait for another command as the junior captain on the list he would probably receive the smallest and least important sixth rate in the navy but for all that he was a captain maria would be delighted end
