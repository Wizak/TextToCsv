ben the luggage boy preface in presenting ben the luggage boy to the public as the fifth of the ragged dick series the author desires to say that it is in all essential points a true history the particulars of the story having been communicated to him by ben himself nearly two years since in particular the circumstances attending the boys running away from home and adopting the life of a street boy are in strict accordance with bens own statement while some of the street incidents are borrowed from the writers own observation those who are really familiar with the different phases which street life assumes in new york will readily recognize their fidelity the chapter entitled the room under the wharf will recall to many readers of the daily journals a paragraph which made its appearance within two years the writer cannot close without expressing anew his thanks for the large share of favor which has been accorded to the volumes of the present series and takes this opportunity of saying that in their preparation invention has played but a subordinate part for his delineations of character and choice of incidents he has been mainly indebted to his own observation aided by valuable communications and suggestions from those who have been brought into familiar acquaintance with the class whose mode of life he has sought to describe new york april ben the luggage boy or among the wharves chapter i introduces ben the luggage boy how much yer made this mornin ben nary red answered ben composedly had yer breakfast only an apple thats all ive eaten since yesterday its most time for the train to be in from philadelphy im layin round for a job the first speaker was a short freckledfaced boy whose box strapped to his back identified him at once as a street bootblack his hair was red his fingers defaced by stains of blacking and his clothing constructed on the most approved system of ventilation he appeared to be about twelve years old the boy whom he addressed as ben was taller and looked older he was probably not far from sixteen his face and hands though browned by exposure to wind and weather were several shades cleaner than those of his companion his face too was of a less common type it was easy to see that if he had been well dressed he might readily have been taken for a gentlemans son but in his present attire there was little chance of this mistake being made his pants marked by a green stripe small around the waist and very broad at the hips had evidently once belonged to a bowery swell for the bowery has its swells as well as broadway its more aristocratic neighbor the vest had been discarded as a needless luxury its place being partially supplied by a shirt of thick red flannel this was covered by a frockcoat which might once have belonged to a member of the fat mens association being aldermanic in its proportions now it was fallen from its high estate its nap and original gloss had long departed and it was frayed and torn in many places but among the streetboys dress is not much regarded and ben never thought of apologizing for the defects of his wardrobe we shall learn in time what were his faults and what his virtues for i can assure my readers that street boys do have virtues sometimes and when they are thoroughly convinced that a questioner feels an interest in them will drop the chaff in which they commonly indulge and talk seriously and feelingly of their faults and hardships some do this for a purpose no doubt and the verdant stranger is liable to be taken in by assumed virtue and waste sympathy on those who do not deserve it but there are also many boys who have good tendencies and aspirations and only need to be encouraged and placed under right influences to develop into worthy and respectable men the conversation recorded above took place at the foot of cortlandt street opposite the ferry wharf it was nearly time for the train and there was the usual scene of confusion express wagons hacks boys laborers were gathering presenting a confusing medley to the eye of one unaccustomed to the spectacle ben was a luggage boy his occupation being to wait at the piers for the arrival of steamboats or at the railway stations on the chance of getting a carpetbag or valise to carry his business was a precarious one sometimes he was lucky sometimes unlucky when he was flush he treated himself to a square meal and finished up the day at tony pastors or the old bowery where from his seat in the pit he indulged in independent criticism of the acting as he leaned back in his seat and munched peanuts throwing the shells about carelessly it is not surprising that the streetboys like the old bowery and are willing to stint their stomachs or run the risk of a night in the streets for the sake of the warm room and the glittering illusions of the stage introducing them for the time being to the society of nobles and ladies of high birth and enabling them to forget for a time the hardships of their own lot while they follow with rapt interest the fortunes of lord frederic montressor or the lady imogene delacour strange as it may seem the street arab has a decided fancy for these pictures of aristocracy and never suspects their want of fidelity when the play ends and lord frederic comes to his own having foiled all the schemes of his crafty and unprincipled enemies no one rejoices more than the ragged boy who has sat through the evening an interested spectator of the play and in his pleasure at the successful denouement he almost forgets that he will probably find the newsboys lodging house closed for the night and be compelled to take up with such sleeping accommodations as the street may provide ben crossed the street taking a straight course without paying especial attention to the mud which caused other pedestrians to pick their way to the condition of his shoes he was supremely indifferent stockings he did not wear they are luxuries in which few street boys indulge he had not long to wait the boat bumped against the wharf and directly a crowd of passengers poured through the open gates in a continuous stream ben looked sharply around him to judge who would be likely to employ him his attention was drawn to an elderly lady with a large carpetbag swelled almost to bursting she was looking about her in a bewildered manner carry your bag maam he said at the same time motioning towards it who be you asked the old lady suspiciously im a baggagesmasher said ben then i dont want you answered the old lady clinging to her bag as if she feared it would be wrested from her im surprised that the law allows sich things you might be in a better business young man than smashing baggage thats where youre right old lady said ben bankin would pay better if i only had the money to start on are you much acquainted in new york asked the old lady yes said ben i know the mayor n aldermen n all the principal men a t stooarts my intimate friend and i dine with vanderbilt every sunday when i aint engaged at astors do you wear them cloes when you visit your fine friends asked the old lady shrewdly no said ben them are my everyday cloes ive got some velvet cloes to home embroidered with gold i believe you are telling fibs said the old lady what i want to know is if you know my darter mrs john jones her first name is seraphiny she lives on bleecker street and her husband who is a nice man though his head is bald on top keeps a grocery store of course i do said ben it was only yesterday that she told me her mother was comin to see her i might have knowed you was she how would you have knowed cause she told me just how you looked did she how did she say i looked she said you was most ninety and it isnt true said the old lady indignantly im only seventythree and everybody says im wonderful younglookin for my years i dont believe seraphiny told you so she might have said you looked as if you was most ninety youre a sassy boy said the owner of the carpetbag indignantly i dont see how im going to get up to seraphinys she continued complainingly theyd ought to have come down to meet me how much will you charge to carry my carpetbag and show me the way to my darters fifty cents said ben fifty cents repeated the old lady aghast i didnt think youd charge moren ten i have to said ben boards high in

a hundred and sixtythree a dollar and a half a dollar n a half couldnt you do it for less carry your bag sir asked ben of a gentleman passing the gentleman shook his head he made one or two other proposals which being in like manner unsuccessful he returned to the old lady who having by this time got through her negotiations with the hackman whom she had vainly striven to beat down to seventyfive cents was in a more favorable mood to accept bens services cant you take less than fifty cents she asked no said ben decidedly ill give you forty couldnt do it said ben who felt sure of gaining his point now well i suppose i shall be obleeged to hire you said the old lady with a sigh seraphiny ought to have sent down to meet me i didnt tell her i was comin today but she might have thought id come bein so pleasant here you boy you may take the bag and mind you dont run away with it there aint nothin in it but some of my cloes i dont want none of your cloes said ben my wifes biggern you and they wouldnt fit her massy sakes you aint married be you why shouldnt i be i dont believe it youre not old enough but im glad you dont want the cloes they wouldnt be of no use to you just you take the bag and ill foller on behind i want my pay first i aint got the change my darter seraphiny will pay you when we get to her house that dont go down said ben decidedly payment in advance thats the way i do business youll get your pay dont you be afraid i know i shall but i want it now you wont run away after ive paid you will you in course not that aint my style the old lady took out her purse and drew therefrom fortyseven cents she protested that she had not a cent more ben pardoned the deficiency feeling that he would notwithstanding be well paid for his time all right said he magnanimously i dont mind the three cents it aint any object to a man of my income take my hand old lady and well go across the street im afraid of bein run over said she hesitatingly whats the odds if you be said ben the cityll have to pay you damages but if i got killed that wouldnt do me any good remarked the old lady sensibly then the moneyd go to your friends said ben consolingly do you think i will be run over asked the old lady anxiously in course you wont ill take care of you they wouldnt dare to run over me said ben confidently somewhat reassured by this remark the old lady submitted to bens guidance and was piloted across the street in safety i wouldnt live in new york for a heap of money it would be as much as my life is worth she remarked how far is bleecker street about two miles i almost wish id rid but a dollar and a half is a sight to pay youd have to pay more than that thats all the man asked i know said ben but when hed got you there hed have charged you five dollars i wouldnt have paid it yes you would said ben he couldnt make me if you didnt pay hed have locked you in and driven you off to the river and dumped you in do they ever do such things asked the old lady startled in course they do only last week a beautiful young lady was served that way cause she wouldnt pay what the hackman wanted and what was done to him nothin said ben the police is in league with em and get their share of the money why you dont say so what a wicked place new york is to be sure of course it is its so wicked im goin to the country myself as soon as i get money enough to buy a farm have you got much money saved up asked the old lady interested four thousand six hundred and seventyseven dollars and fiftyfive cents i dont count this money you give me cause im goin to spend it you didnt make it all carryin carpetbags said the old lady incredulously no i made most of it spekilatin in real estate said ben you dont say yes i do youve got most enough to buy a farm aready i aint goin to buy till i can buy a good one whats the name of this street west broadway they were really upon west broadway by this time that being as direct a line as any to bleecker street you see that store said ben yes whats the matter of it i dont own it now said ben i sold it cos the tenants didnt pay their rent reglar i should think youd dress better if youve got so much money said the old lady not unnaturally whats the use of wearin nice cloes round among the wharves said ben theres suthin in that i tell my darter jane she lives in the country that its no use dressin up the children to go to school theyre sure to get their cloes tore and dirty afore they get home so ben beguiled the way with wonderful stories with which he played upon the old ladys credulity of course it was wrong but a street education is not very likely to inspire its pupils with a reverence for truth and ben had been knocking about the streets of new york most of the time among the wharves for six years his street education had commenced at the age of ten he had adopted it of his own free will even now there was a comfortable home waiting for him there were parents who supposed him dead and who would have found a difficulty in recognizing him under his present circumstances in the next chapter a light will be thrown upon his past history and the reader will learn how his street life began chapter ii how ben commenced his street life one pleasant morning six years before the date at which this story commences a small coastingvessel drew up at a north river pier in the lower part of the city it was loaded with freight but there was at least one passenger on board a boy of ten dressed in a neat jacket and pants of graymixed cloth stood on deck watching with interest the busy city which they had just reached well bub here we are said the captain as he passed i suppose you know your way home yes sir are you going on shore now yes sir well good luck to you my lad if you are ever down this way when im in port i shall be glad to see you thank you sir goodby goodby ben clambered over the side and stepped upon the wharf in the great city he knew no one and he was an utter stranger to the streets never before having visited it he was about to begin life for himself at the age of ten he had voluntarily undertaken to support himself leaving behind him a comfortable home where he had been well cared for i must explain how this came about ben had a pleasant face and would be considered goodlooking but there was a flash in his eye when aroused which showed that he had a quick temper and there was an expression of firmness unusual to one so young which might have been read by an experienced physiognomist he was quicktempered proud and probably obstinate yet with these qualities he was pleasant in his manners and had a sense of humor which made him a favorite among his companions his father was a coaldealer in a town a few miles distant from philadelphia of a hasty temper like ben himself a week before he had punished ben severely for a fault which he had not committed the boys pride revolted at the injustice and young as he was he resolved to run away i suppose there are few boys who do not form this resolution at some time or other in their lives but as a general thing it amounts to nothing with ben it was different his was a strong nature whether for good or for evil and when he decided to do anything he was not easily moved from his resolve he forgot in the present case that though he had been unjustly punished the injustice was not intentional on the part of his father who had been under a wrong impression respecting him but right or wrong ben made up his mind to run away and he did so it was two or three days before a good opportunity presented itself then with a couple of shirts and collars rolled up in a small bundle he made his escape to philadelphia and after roaming about the streets for several hours he made his way to the wharves where he found a vessel bound for new york representing to the captain that he lived in new york and had no money to pay his passage home that officer who was a goodnatured man agreed to carry him for nothing the voyage was now over and ben landed as we have said an utter stranger with very indefinite ideas as to how he was to make his living he had told the captain that he knew his way home for having falsely represented that he lived in new york he was in a manner compelled to this additional falsehood still in spite of his friendless condition his spirits were very good the sun shone brightly all looked animated and cheerful ben saw numbers of men at work about him and he thought it will be a pity if i cannot make a living he did not care to linger about the wharf for the captain might be led to doubt his story accordingly he crossed the street and at a venture turned up a street facing the wharf ben did not know much about new york even by report but he had heard of broadway as who has not and this was about all he did know when therefore he had gone a short distance he ventured to ask a bootblack whom he encountered at the corner of the next block can you tell me the shortest way to broadway follow your nose johnny was the reply my name isnt johnny replied ben rather indignant at the familiarity he had not learned that in new york johnny is the generic name for boy where the specific name is unknown aint it though returned the bootblack whats the price of turnips out where you live ill make your nose turn up if you aint careful retorted ben wrathfully youll do said the bootblack favorably impressed by bens pluck just go straight ahead and youll come to broadway im going that way and you can come along with me if you want to thank you said ben appeased by the boys changed manner are you going to stay here inquired his new acquaintance yes said ben im going to live here where do your friends live i havent got any friends in new york said ben with a little hesitation over in brooklyn or jersey maybe no i dont know anybody this way whew whistled the other how you goin to live i expect to earn my living said ben in a tone of importance father and mother dead no theyre alive i spose theyre poor no theyre not theyre well off the bootblack looked puzzled why didnt you stay at home then wouldnt they let you of course they would the fact is ive run away maybe theyd adopt me instead of you i dont think they would said ben laughing i wish somebody with lots of cash would adopt me and make a gentleman of me it would be a good sight bettern blackin boots do you make much money that way inquired ben pleasant days like this sometimes i make a dollar but when it rains there aint much doin how much have you made this morning asked ben with interest sixty cents sixty cents and it isnt more than ten oclock thats doing pretty well taint so good in the afternoon most every body gets their boots blacked in the mornin what are you goin to do i dont know said ben goin to black boots ill show you how said the other generously overlooking all considerations of possible rivalry i dont think i should like that very well said ben slowly having been brought up in a comfortable home he had a prejudice in favor of clean hands and unsoiled clothes a prejudice of which his street life speedily cured him i think i should rather sell papers or go into a store said ben you cant make so much money sellin papers said his new acquaintance then you might get stuck whats that inquired ben innocently dont you know asked the bootblack wonderingly why its when youve got more papers than you can sell thats what takes off the profits i was a newsboy once but its too hard work for the money there aint no chance of gettin stuck on my business its rather a dirty business said ben venturing to state his main objection at the risk of offending but jerry collins for that was his name was not very sensitive on this score whats the odds he said indifferently a feller gets used to it ben looked at jerrys begrimed hands and clothes liberally marked with spots of blacking and he felt that he was not quite ready to get used to appearing in public in this way he was yet young in his street life the time came when he ceased to be so particular where do you board asked ben after a little pause jerry collins stared at the questioner as if he suspected that a joke was intended but bens serious face assured him that he was in earnest youre jolly green he remarked sententiously look here said ben with spirit ill give you a licking if you say that again it may be considered rather singular that jerry instead of resenting this threat was led by it to regard ben with favor i didnt mean anything he said by way of apology youre a trump and youll get over it when youve been in the city a week what made you call me green asked ben did you think i boarded up to the fifth avenue asked jerry whats that a hotel yes its one of the big hotels where they eat off gold plates no i dont suppose you board there said ben laughing but i suppose there are cheaper boardingplaces where do you sleep sometimes in wagons or in doorways on the docks or anywhere where i get a chance dont you get cold sleeping outdoors asked ben oh im used to it said jerry when its cold i go to the lodging house whats that jerry explained that there was a newsboys lodging house where a bed could be obtained for six cents a night thats cheap said ben taint so cheap as sleepin outdoors returned the bootblack this was true but ben thought he would rather pay the six cents than sleep out if it were only for the damage likely to come to his clothes which were yet clean and neat looking at jerrys suit however he saw that this consideration would be likely to have less weight with him he began to understand that he had entered upon a very different life from the one he had hitherto led he was not easily daunted however if he can stand it i can he said to himself chapter iii street scenes heres broadway said jerry suddenly they emerged from the side street on which they had been walking and turning the corner found themselves in the great thoroughfare a block or two above trinity church ben surveyed the busy scenes that opened before him with the eager interest of a country boy who saw them for the first time what church is that he asked pointing to the tall spire of the imposing church that faces wall street thats trinity church do you go to church there i dont go anywhere else said jerry equivocally whats the use of going to church i thought everybody went to church said ben speaking from his experience in a country village that is most everybody he corrected himself as several persons occurred to his mind who were more punctual in their attendance at the liquor saloon than the church if id got good clothes like you have id go once just to see what its like but id a good sight rather go to the old bowery theatre but you ought not to say that said ben a little startled why not because its better to go to church than to the theatre is it said jerry well you can go if you want to id give more for a stunnin old play at the bowery than fifty churches ben began to suspect that jerry was rather loose in his ideas on the subject of religion but did not think it best to say so for fear of giving offence though in all probability jerrys sensitiveness would not have been at all disturbed by such a charge during the last portion of the conversation they had been standing still at the street corner im goin to nassau street said jerry if you want to go up broadway thats the way without waiting for an answer he darted across the street threading his way among the numerous vehicles with a coolness and a success which amazed ben who momentarily expected to see him run over he drew a long breath when he saw him safe on the other side and bethought himself that he would not like to take a similar risk he felt sorry to have jerry leave him so abruptly the bootblack had already imparted to him considerable information about new york which he saw was likely to be of benefit to him besides he felt that any society was better than solitude and a sudden feeling of loneliness overpowered him as he felt that among the crowd of persons that jostled him as he stood at the corner there was not one who felt an interest in him or even knew his name it was very different in his native village where he knew everybody and everybody had a friendly word for him the thought did occur to him for a moment whether he had been wise in running away from home but the thought of the unjust punishment came with it and his expression became firmer and more resolute i wont go home if i starve he said proudly to himself and armed with this new resolution he proceeded up broadway his attention was soon drawn to the street merchants doing business on the sidewalk here was a vender of neckties displaying a varied assortment of different colors for only twentyfive cents each next came a candy merchant with his stock in trade divided up into irregular lumps and labelled a penny apiece they looked rather tempting and ben would have purchased but he knew very well that his cash capital amounted to only twentyfive cents which considering that he was as yet without an income was likely to be wanted for other purposes next came a man with an assortment of knives all of them open and sticking into a large board which was the only shop required by their proprietor ben stopped a moment to look at them he had always had a fancy for knives but was now without one in fact he had sold a handsome knife which he had received as a birthday present for seventyfive cents to raise money for his present expedition of this sum but twentyfive cents remained will you buy a knife today young gentleman asked the vender who was on the alert for customers no i guess not said ben heres a very nice one for only one dollar said the street merchant taking up a showylooking knife with three blades its the best of steel warranted you wont get another such knife for the price in the city it did look cheap certainly ben could not but allow that he would like to have owned it but circumstances forbade no i wont buy today he said here you shall have it for ninetyfour cents and the vender began to roll it up in a piece of paper you cant say it isnt cheap yes its cheap enough said ben moving away but i havent got the money with me this settled the matter and the dealer reluctantly unrolled it and replaced it among his stock if youll call round tomorrow ill save it for you till then he said all right said ben i wonder he thought whether he would be so anxious to sell if he knew that i had run away from home and had but twentyfive cents in the world bens neat dress deceived the man who naturally supposed him to belong to a city family well to do our young hero walked on till he came to the astor house he stood on the steps a few minutes taking a view of what may be considered the liveliest and most animated part of new york nearly opposite was barnums american museum the site being now occupied by the costly and elegant herald building and park bank he looked across to the lower end of the city hall park not yet diverted from its original purpose for the new post office building he saw a procession of horsecars in constant motion up and down park row everything seemed lively and animated and again the thought came to ben if there is employment for all these people there must be something for me to do he crossed to the foot of the park and walked up on the park row side here again he saw a line of street merchants most conspicuous were the dealers in penny ballads whose wares lined the railings and were various enough to suit every taste here was an old woman who might have gained a first prize for ugliness presiding over an applestand take one honey its only two cints she said observing that bens attention was drawn to a rosycheeked apple ben was rather hungry and reflecting that probably apples were as cheap as any other article of diet he responded to the appeal by purchasing it proved to be palatable and he ate it with a good relish icecream only a penny a glass was the next announcement the glasses to be sure were of very small size still icecream in any quantity for a penny seemed so ridiculously cheap that ben poor as he was could not resist the temptation ill take a glass he said a dab of icecream was deposited in a glass and with a pewter spoon handed to ben he raised the spoon to his mouth but alas the mixture was not quite so tempting to the taste as to the eye and the pocket it might be icecream but there was an indescribable flavor about it only to be explained on the supposition that the ice had been frozen dishwater bens taste had not been educated up to that point which would enable him to relish it he laid it down with an involuntary contortion of the face give it to me johnny he heard at his elbow turning he saw a small dirtyfaced boy of six with bare feet and tattered attire who was gazing with a look of greedy desire at the delicious mixture ben handed him the glass and spoon and stood by looking at him with some curiosity as he disposed of the contents with a look of evident enjoyment do you like it he asked its bully said the young epicure if ben had not been restricted by his narrow means he would have purchased another glass for the urchin it would have been a very cheap treat but our young adventurer reflected that he had but twentytwo cents left and prudence forbade i dont see how he can like the nasty stuff he thought but the time was to come when ben himself grown less fastidious would be able to relish food quite as uninviting ben made his way across the park to broadway again he felt that it was high time for him to be seeking employment his ideas on this subject were not very well defined but when he left home he made up his mind that he would try to get a place in a store on broadway he supposed that among the great number of stores there would be a chance for him to get into some one he expected to make enough to live in a comfortable boardinghouse and buy his clothes though he supposed that would be about all he expected to have to economize on spending money the first year but the second year his wages would be raised and then it would come easier all this shows how very verdant and unpractical our young adventurer was and what disappointment he was preparing for himself however bens knowledge was to come by experience and that before long reaching broadway he walked up slowly on the west side looking in at the shopwindows in the lower part of this busy street are many wholesale houses while the upper part is devoted principally to retail shops coming to a large warehouse for the sale of readymade clothing ben thought he might as well begin there in such a large place there must be a good deal to do he passed in and looked about him rather doubtfully the counters which were numerous were filled high with readymade garments ben saw no one as small as himself and that led him to doubt whether his size might not be an objection well sonny what do you want asked a clerk dont you want to hire a boy asked our young adventurer plunging into his business i suppose you have had considerable experience in the business said the clerk inclined to banter him a little no i havent said ben frankly indeed i judged from your looks that you were a man of experience if you dont want to hire me ill go said ben independently well young man im afraid youll have to go the fact is we should have to higher you before we could hire you and the clerk laughed at his witticism ben naturally saw nothing to laugh at but felt rather indignant he stepped into the street a little depressed at the result of his first application but then as he reflected there were a great many other stores besides this and he might have better luck next time he walked on some distance however before trying again indeed he had got above bleecker street when his attention was arrested by a paper pasted inside of a shopwindow bearing the inscription cashboys wanted ben did not clearly understand what were the duties of a cashboy though he supposed they must have something to do with receiving money looking in through the glass door he saw boys as small as himself flitting about and this gave him courage to enter and make an application for a place he entered therefore and walked up boldly to the first clerk he saw do you want a cashboy he asked go up to that desk johnny said the clerk pointing to a desk about midway of the store a stout gentleman stood behind it writing something in a large book ben went up and repeated his inquiry do you want a cashboy how old are you asked the gentleman looking down at him ten years old have you ever been in a store no sir do you live in the city yes sir with your parents no sir said ben with hesitation who do you live with then with nobody i take care of myself humph the gentleman looked a little surprised not at the idea of a boy of ten looking out for himself for such cases are common enough in new york but at the idea of such a welldressed lad as ben being in that situation how long have you been your own man he inquired ive only just begun ben admitted are your parents dead no sir theyre alive then i advise you to go back to them we dont receive any boys into our employment who do not live with their parents the gentleman returned to his writing and ben saw that his case was hopeless his disappointment was greater than before for he liked the looks of the proprietor if as he judged this was he besides boys were wanted and his size would be no objection judging from the appearance of the other boys in the store so he had been sanguine of success now he saw that there was an objection which he could not remove and which would be very likely to stand in his way in other places chapter iv a restaurant on fulton street ben kept on his way looking in at the shop windows as before he had not yet given up the idea of getting a place in a store though he began to see that his chances of success were rather small the next pause he came to was before a bookstore here too there was posted on the window boy wanted ben entered there were two or three persons behind the counter the oldest a man of forty ben decided to be the proprietor he walked up to him and said do you want a boy yes said the gentleman we want a boy to run of errands and deliver papers to customers how old are you ten years old that is rather young im pretty strong of my age said ben speaking the truth here for he was rather larger and stouter than most boys of ten that is not important as you will not have very heavy parcels to carry are you well acquainted with the streets in this part of the city this question was a poser ben thought he was at first tempted to say yes but decided to answer truthfully no sir he answered do you live in the lower part of the city yes sir that is im going to live there how long have you lived in the city i only arrived this morning ben confessed reluctantly then im afraid you will not answer my purpose we need a boy who is well acquainted with the city streets he was another disqualification ben left the store a little discouraged he began to think that it would be harder work making a living than he had supposed he would apply in two or three more stores and if unsuccessful he must sell papers or black boots of the two he preferred selling papers blacking boots would soil his hands and his clothes and as it was possible that he might some day encounter some one from his native village he did not like to have the report carried home that he had become a new york bootblack he felt that his education and bringing up fitted him for something better than that however it was not necessary to decide this question until he had got through applying for a situation in a store he tried his luck again and once was on the point of being engaged at three dollars per week when a question as to his parents revealed the fact that he was without a guardian and this decided the question against him its of no use said ben despondently i might as well go back so he turned and retraced his steps down broadway by the time he got to the city hall park he was quite tired seeing some vacant seats inside he went in and sat down resting his bundle on the seat beside him he saw quite a number of street boys within the inclosure most of them bootblacks as a rule they bore the marks of their occupation not only on their clothes but on their faces and hands as well some who were a little more careful than the rest were provided with a small square strip of carpeting on which they kneeled when engaged in shining up a customers boots this formed a very good protection for the knees of their pantaloons two were even more luxurious having chairs in which they seated their customers where this extra accommodation was supplied however a fee of ten cents was demanded while the bootblacks in general asked but five black your boots asked one boy of ben observing that our young adventurers shoes were soiled yes said ben if youll do it for nothing ill black your eye for nothing said the other thank you said ben i wont trouble you ben was rather interested in a scene which he witnessed shortly afterwards a young man whose appearance indicated that he was from the country was waylaid by the boys and finally submitted his boots to an operator how much do you want twentyfive cents was the reply twentyfive cents exclaimed the customer aghast youre jokin aint you reglar price mister was the reply why i saw a boy blackin boots down by the museum for ten cents maybe you did but this is the city hall park were employed by the city and we have to charge the reglar price i wish id got my boots blacked down to the museum said the victim in a tone of disappointment producing twentyfive cents which was eagerly appropriated by the young extortioner i say tommy give us a treat or well peach said one of the boys tom led the way to the icecream venders establishment where with reckless extravagance he ordered a penny icecream all round for the halfdozen boys in his company even then making a handsome thing out of the extra pay he had obtained from his rustic patron by this time it was halfpast two oclock so ben learned from the city hall clock he was getting decidedly hungry there were apple and cake stands just outside the railings on which he could have regaled himself cheaply but his appetite craved something more solid there was a faint feeling which nothing but meat could satisfy ben had no idea how much a plate of meat would cost at a restaurant he had but twentytwo cents and whatever he got must come within that limit still he hoped that something could be obtained for this sum where to go that was the question can you tell me a good place to get some dinner he asked of a boy standing near him down on nassau street or fulton street was the reply where is fulton street asked ben catching the last name im goin that way you can go with me if you want to ben readily accepted the companionship proffered and was led past the museum the site of which as i have said is now occupied by the herald building turning down fulton street ben soon saw a restaurant with bills of fare displayed outside thats a good place said his guide thank you said ben he scanned the bill in advance ascertaining to his satisfaction that he could obtain a plate of roast beef for fifteen cents and a cup of coffee for five this would make but twenty cents leaving him a balance of two cents he opened the door and entered there was a long table running through the centre of the apartment from the door to the rear on each side against the sides of the room were small tables intended for four persons each there were but few eating as the busy time at downtown restaurants usually extends from twelve to halfpast one or two oclock and it was now nearly three ben entered and took a seat at one of the side tables laying his bundle on a chair beside him a colored waiter came up and stood awaiting his orders give me a plate of roast beef said ben yes sir coffee or tea coffee the waiter went to the lower end of the diningroom and called out roast beef after a brief delay he returned with the article ordered and a cup of coffee there were two potatoes with the meat and a small piece of bread on the side of the plate the coffee looked muddy and not particularly inviting ben was not accustomed to the ways of restaurants and supposed that as in shops immediate payment was expected heres the money twenty cents he said producing the sum named pay at the desk as you go out said the waiter ben looked up and then for the first time noticed a man behind a counter in the front part of the room at the same time the waiter produced a green ticket bearing cents printed upon it ben now addressed himself with a hearty appetite to the dinner the plate was dingy and the meat neither very abundant nor very tender still it can hardly be expected that for fifteen cents a large plate of sirloin can be furnished ben was not in a mood to be critical at home he would have turned up his nose at such a repast but hunger is very well adapted to cure one of fastidiousness he ate rapidly and felt that he had seldom eaten anything so good he was sorry there was no more bread the supply being exceedingly limited as for the coffee he was able to drink it though he did not enjoy it so well it tasted as if there was not more than a teaspoonful of milk in the infusion while the flavor of the beverage differed strangely from the coffee he had been accustomed to get at home it isnt very good thought ben and he could not help wishing he had a cup of the good coffee his mother used to make at home have anything more asked the waiter coming up to the table ben looked over the bill of fare not that he expected to get anything for the two cents that still remained to him but because he wanted to notice the prices of different articles his eye rested rather longingly on apple dumplings he was very fond of this dish and his appetite was so far from being satisfied that he felt that he could have easily disposed of a plate but the price was ten cents and of course it was entirely beyond his means nothing more said he and rose from his seat he went up to the counter and settled his bill and went out again into the street he felt more comfortable than he had done as one is very apt to feel after a good dinner and bens dinner had been a good one his appetite making up for any deficiency in the quality where should he go now he was still tired and did not care to wander about the streets besides he had no particular place to go to he therefore decided to walk back to the city hall park and sit down on one of the benches there would be something to see and he was interested in watching the street boys whose ranks he felt that he should very soon be compelled to join his prospects did not look particularly bright as he was not provided with means sufficient to pay for another meal but the time had not yet come to trouble himself about that when he got hungry again he would probably realize his position a little more keenly chapter v a beergarden in the bowery ben sat down again in his old seat and occupied himself once more in looking about him after a while he became sleepy besides having taken a considerable walk he had not slept much the night before as no one occupied the bench but himself he thought he might as well make himself comfortable accordingly he laid his bundle crosswise at one end and laid back using it for a pillow the visor of his cap he brought down over his eyes so as to shield them from the afternoon sun the seat was hard to be sure but his recumbent position rested him he did not mean to go to sleep but gradually the sounds around him became an indistinct hum even the noise and bustle of busy broadway but a few feet distant failed to ward off sleep and in a short time he was sleeping soundly of course he could not sleep in so public a place without attracting attention two ragged boys espied him and held a low conference together whats he got in that bundle jim do you think asked one wed better look and see they went up to the bench and touched him to make sure that he was fast asleep the touch did not rouse him to consciousness just lift up his head mike and ill take the bundle said the larger of the two boys this was done now let him down softly so the bundle was removed and poor ben wandering somewhere in the land of dreams was none the wiser his head deprived of its former support now rested on the hard bench it was not so comfortable but he was too tired to awake so he slept on meanwhile jim and mike opened the bundle its a couple of shirts said jim is that all asked mike disappointed well thats better than nothin give me one of em its just about your size taint big enough for me then give me the two of em whatll you give i aint got no stamps ill pay you a quarter when i get it that dont go down said jim whose confidence in his confederates honesty was not very great considering the transaction in which they were now engaged it is not surprising that there should have been a mutual distrust being unable to make any bargain jim decided to take his share of the booty round to a secondhand clothesdealer in chatham street here after considerable higgling he succeeded in selling the shirt for sixteen cents which was less than his companion had offered however it was cash down and so was immediately available an important consideration in the present state of jims finances a bird in the hand as he considered was worth two in the bush jim immediately purchased a cigar with a portion of his dishonest gains and procuring a light walked about in a state of high enjoyment puffing away as coolly as a man of twice his years meanwhile ben continued to sleep happily unconscious of the loss of his entire personal possessions in his dreams he was at home once more playing with his school companions let him sleep he will waken soon enough to the hard realities of a street life voluntarily undertaken it is true but none the less likely to bear heavily upon him he slept a long time when he awoke it was six oclock he sat upon his seat and rubbed his eyes in momentary bewilderment in his dreams he had been back again to his native village and he could not at once recall his change of circumstances but it all came back to him soon enough he realized with a slight pang that he had a home no longer that he was a penniless vagrant for whom the hospitality of the streets alone was open he did wish that he could sit down at the plentiful home table and eat the wellcooked supper which was always provided that is if he could blot out one remembrance when he thought of the unjust punishment that had driven him forth his pride rose and his determination became as stubborn as ever i do not defend ben in this he was clearly wrong the best of parents may be unintentionally unjust at times and this is far from affording an adequate excuse for a boy to leave home but ben had a great deal of pride and i am only telling you how he felt our young adventurer did not at first realize the loss which he had sustained it was at least five minutes before he thought of his bundle at all at length chancing to look at the seat beside him he missed it where can it be i wonder he thought perplexed he looked under the bench thinking that perhaps it had rolled off but it need not be said that it was not to be seen ben was rather disturbed it was all he had brought from home and constituted his entire earthly possessions it must have rolled off and been picked up by somebody he thought but the explanation was not calculated to bring any satisfaction i did not think i should fall asleep it occurred to him that some of the boys near by might have seen it so he went up to a group of bootblacks near by one of whom was jim who had actually been concerned in the robbery the other boys knew nothing of the affair i say boys said ben have you seen anything of my bundle what bundle johnny said jim who was now smoking his second cigar i had a small bundle tied up in a newspaper said ben i put it under my head and then fell asleep now i cant find it do you think we stole it said jim defiantly of course i dont said ben but i thought it might have slipped out and you might have seen somebody pick it up havent seen it johnny said one of the other boys most likely its stole do you think so asked ben anxiously in course you might expect it would be i didnt mean to go to sleep what was there in it there was two shirts youve got a shirt on aint you yes said ben thats all right then what does a feller want of a thousand shirts theres some difference between two shirts and a thousand said ben whats the odds i havent got but one shirt thats all i want when it is wore out ill buy a new one what do you do when it gets dirty asked ben in some curiosity oh i wash it once in two or three weeks was the reply this was not exactly in accordance with bens ideas of neatness but he saw that no satisfaction was likely to be obtained in this quarter so he walked away rather depressed it certainly hadnt been a lucky day this first day in the city he had been rejected in halfadozen stores in his applications for employment had spent nearly all his money and been robbed of all his clothing except what he wore again ben began to feel an appetite he had eaten his dinner late but it had consisted of a plate of meat only his funds being now reduced to two cents he was obliged to content himself with an apple which did something towards appeasing his appetite next ben began to consider anxiously how he was to pass the night having no money to spend for lodging there seemed nothing to do but to sleep out of doors it was warm weather and plenty of street boys did it but to ben it would be a new experience and he regarded it with some dread he wished he could meet with jerry collins his acquaintance of the morning from him he might obtain some information that would be of service in his present strait three or four hours must elapse before it would be time to go to bed ben hardly knew how or where to pass them he had become tired of the park besides he had got over a part of his fatigue and felt able to walk about and explore the city he turned at a venture up chatham street and was soon interested in the sights of this peculiar thoroughfare the shops open to the street with half their stock in trade exposed on the sidewalk the importunities of the traders and the appearance of the people whom he met it seemed very lively and picturesque to ben and drew away his attention from his own awkward position he was asked to buy by some of the traders being promised wonderful bargains but his penniless condition put him out of the reach of temptation so he wandered on until he came to the bowery a broad avenue wider than broadway and lined by shops of a great variety but of a grade inferior to those of its more aristocratic neighbor here also the goods are liberally displayed on the sidewalk and are generally labelled with low prices which tempts many purchasers the purchaser however must look carefully to the quality of the goods which he buys or he will in many cases find the low price merely a snare and a delusion and regret that he had not paid more liberally and bought a better article later in the evening on his return walk ben came to an establishment brilliant with light from which proceeded strains of music looking in he saw that it was filled with small tables around which were seated men women and children they had glasses before them from which they drank this was a lager beer hall or garden an institution transplanted from germany and chiefly patronized by those of german birth or extraction it seemed bright and cheerful and our young adventurer thought it would be pleasant to go in and spend an hour or two listening to the music but he was prevented by the consciousness that he had no money to spend and might be considered an intruder while he was looking in wistfully he was struck on the back and turning saw to his surprise the face of his only acquaintance in new york jerry collins the bootblack i am glad to see you he said eagerly offering his hand without considering that jerrys hand unwashed during the day was stained with blacking he felt so glad to meet an acquaintance however that he would not have minded this even if it had occurred to him the same to you said jerry are you going in i havent got any money said ben a little ashamed of the confession well i have and thatll do just as well he took ben by the arm and they passed through a vestibule and entered the main apartment which was of large size on one side about half way down was a large instrument some like an organ from which the music proceeded the tables were very well filled germans largely predominating among the guests sit down here said jerry they took seats at one of the tables opposite was a stout german and his wife the latter holding a baby both had glasses of lager before them and the baby was also offered a share by its mother but from the contortions of its face did not appear to relish it zwei glass lager said jerry to a passing attendant can you speak german asked ben surprised yaw said jerry my father was an irishman and my mother was a dutchman jerrys german however seemed to be limited as he made no further attempts to converse in that language the glasses were brought jerry drank his down at a draught but ben who had never before tasted lager could not at once become reconciled to its bitter taste dont you like it asked jerry not very much said ben then ill finish it for you and he suited the action to the word besides the lager a few plain cakes were sold but nothing more substantial evidently the beer was the great attraction ben could not help observing with some surprise that though everybody was drinking there was not the slightest disturbance or want of decorum or drunkenness the music which was furnished at intervals was of very good quality and was listened to with attention i was goin to tony pastors tonight said jerry if i hadnt met you what sort of a place is that asked ben oh its a bully place lots of fun you must go there some time i think i will answered ben mentally adding if i ever have money enough here the music struck up and they stopped to listen to it when this was over jerry proposed to go out ben would have been willing to stay longer but he saw that his companion did not care so much for the music as himself and he did not wish to lose sight of him to be alone in a great city particularly under bens circumstances is not very pleasant and our young adventurer determined to stick to his new acquaintance who though rough in his manners had yet seemed inclined to be friendly and ben felt sadly in need of a friend chapter vi the burning bales where are you going to sleep tonight asked ben introducing a subject which had given him some anxiety i dont know said jerry carelessly ill find a place somewhere ill go with you if youll let me said ben in course i will i havent got any money whats the odds they dont charge nothin at the hotel where i stop what time do you go to bed most any time do you feel sleepy rather i didnt sleep much last night well well go and find a place now howd you like sleepin on cottonbales i think that would be comfortable theres a pile of bales down on the pier where the new orleans steamers come in maybe we could get a chance there all right where is it pier north river itll take us twenty minutes or maybe half an hour to go there let us go said ben he felt relieved at the idea of so comfortable a bed as a cottonbale and was anxious to get stowed away for the night the two boys struck across to broadway and followed that street down past trinity church turning down the first street beyond rector street notwithstanding its clerical name is far from an attractive street just in the rear of the great church and extending down to the wharves is a collection of miserable dwellings occupied by tenants upon whom the near presence of the sanctuary appears to produce little impression of a salutary character ben looked about him in illconcealed disgust he neither fancied the neighborhood nor the people whom he met but the island is very narrow just here and he had not far to walk to west street which runs along the edge of manhattan island and is lined with wharves jerry of course did not mind the surroundings he was too well used to them to care they brought out opposite the pier there it is said jerry ben saw a pile of cottonbales heaped up on the wharf in front just behind them was a gate and over it the sign of the new orleans company i should think somebody would steal the bales said ben are they left out here all night theres a watchman round here somewhere said jerry he stays here all night to guard the bales will he let us sleep here i dont know said jerry well creep in when he isnt looking the watchman was sitting down leaning his back against one of the bales a short pipe was in his mouth and he seemed to be enjoying his smoke this was contrary to orders for the cotton being combustible might easily catch fire but this man supposing that he would not be detected indulged himself in the forbidden luxury now creep along softly said jerry the latter being barefooted had an advantage over ben but our young adventurer crept after him as softly as he could jerry found a bale screened from observation by the higher piles on each side where he thought they could sleep unobserved following his lead ben stretched himself out upon it the watchman was too busily occupied with his pipe to detect any noise aint it comfortable whispered jerry yes said ben in the same low tone i wouldnt ask for nothin better said jerry ben was not so sure about that but then he had not slept out hundreds of nights like jerry in old wagons or on doorsteps or wherever else he could so he had a different standard of comparison he could not immediately go to sleep he was tired it was true but his mind was busy it was only twelve hours since he had landed in the city but it had been an eventful twelve hours he understood his position a little better now and how much he had undertaken in boldly leaving home at ten years of age and taking upon himself the task of earning his living if he had known what was before him would he have left home at all ben was not sure about this he did own to himself however that he was disappointed the city had not proved the paradise he had expected instead of finding shopkeepers eager to secure his services he had found himself uniformly rejected he began to suspect that it was rather early to begin the world at ten years of age then again though he was angry with his father he had no cause of complaint against his mother she had been uniformly kind and gentle and he found it hard to keep back the tears when he thought how she would be distressed at his running away he had not thought of that in the heat of his first anger but he thought of it now how would she feel if she knew where he was at this moment resting on a cottonbale on a city wharf penniless and without a friend in the great city except the ragged boy who was already asleep at his side she would feel badly ben knew that and he half regretted having been so precipitate in his action he could remedy it all and relieve his mothers heart by going back but here bens pride came in to go back would be to acknowledge himself wrong it would be a virtual confession of failure and moreover knowing his fathers sternness he knew that he would be severely punished unfortunately for ben his father had a stern unforgiving disposition that never made allowances for the impulses of boyhood he had never condescended to study his own son and the method of training he had adopted with him was in some respects very pernicious his system hardened instead of softening and prejudiced ben against what was right maddening him with a sense of injustice and so preventing his being influenced towards good of course all this did not justify ben in running away from home the thought of his mother ought to have been sufficient to have kept him from any such step but it was necessary to be stated in order that my readers might better understand what sort of a boy ben was so in spite of his half relenting ben determined that he would not go home at all events whatever hardships lay before him in the new life which he had adopted he resolved to stand them as well as he could indeed however much he might desire to retrace his steps he had no money to carry him back nor could he obtain any unless he should write home for it and this again would be humiliating bens last thought then as he sank to sleep was that he would stick to new york and get his living somehow even if he had to black boots for a living at the end of an hour both boys were fast asleep the watchman after smoking his pipe got up and paced up and down the wharf drowsily he did not happen to observe the young sleepers if he had done so he would undoubtedly have shaken them roughly and ordered them off it was rather fortunate that neither ben nor his companion were in the habit of snoring as this would at once have betrayed their presence even to the negligent watchman after a while the watchman bethought himself again of his pipe and filling the bowl with tobacco lighted it then with the most culpable carelessness he half reclined on one of the bales and took comfort not having prepared himself for the vigils of the night by repose during the day he began to feel uncommonly drowsy the whiffs came less and less frequently until at last the pipe fell from his lips and he fell back fast asleep the burning contents of the pipe fell on the bale and gradually worked their way down into the interior here the mischief soon spread what followed may easily be imagined ben was aroused from his sleep by a confused outcry he rubbed his eyes to see what was the matter there was something stifling and suffocating in the atmosphere which caused him to choke as he breathed as he became more awake he realized that the cottonbales among which he had taken refuge were on fire he became alarmed and shook jerry energetically whats up said jerry drowsily i aint done nothin you cant take me up jerry wake up the bales are on fire said ben i thought twas a copp said jerry rousing and at a glance understanding the position of affairs lets get out of this that was not quite so easy there was fire on all sides and they must rush through it at some risk however it was every moment getting worse and there was no chance for delay foller me said jerry and he dashed through closely pursued by ben by this time quite a crowd of men and boys had gathered around the burning bales when the two boys rushed out there was a general exclamation of surprise then one burly man caught jerry by the arm and said heres the young villain that set the bales on fire let me alone will you said jerry yer grandmother set it on fire more likely no sooner was jerry seized than another man caught hold of ben and forcibly detained him ive got the other he said now you young rascal tell me how you did it said the first was you smokin no i wasnt said jerry shortly i was sleepin along of this other boy what made you come here to sleep cause we hadnt no other bed are you sure you wasnt smoking look here said jerry contemptuously you must think im a fool to go and set my own bed on fire thats true said a bystander it wouldnt be very likely who did it then asked the stout man suspiciously its the watchman i seed him smokin when i turned in where is he now search was made for the watchman but he had disappeared awaking to a consciousness of what mischief he had caused through his carelessness he had slipped away in the confusion and was not likely to return the boy tells the truth said one of the crowd i saw the watchman smoking myself no doubt the fire caught from his pipe the boys are innocent better let them go the two custodians of jerry and ben released their hold and they gladly availed themselves of the opportunity to remove themselves to a safer distance from their late bedchamber two fireengines came thundering up and streams of water were directed effectively at the burning bales the flames were extinguished but not till considerable damage had been done as the two boys watched the contest between the flames and the engines from a safe distance they heard the sonorous clang of the bell in the churchtower ringing out twelve oclock chapter vii bens temptation jest my luck complained jerry why couldnt the fire have waited till mornin we might have burned up said ben who was considerably impressed by his narrow escape only we didnt said jerry well have to try another hotel for the rest of the night where shall we go we may find a haybarge down to the pier at the foot of franklin street is it far not very let us go then so the boys walked along the street until they came to the pier referred to there was a barge loaded with hay lying alongside the wharf jerry speedily provided himself with a restingplace upon it and ben followed his example it proved to be quite as comfortable if not more so than their former bed and both boys were soon asleep how long he slept ben did not know but he was roused to consciousness by a rude shake wake up there said a voice ben opened his eyes and saw a laboring man bending over him is it time to get up he inquired hardly conscious where he was i should think it was particularly as you havent paid for your lodging wheres jerry asked ben missing the bootblack the fact was that jerry whose business required him to be astir early had been gone over an hour he had not felt it necessary to wake up ben knowing that the latter had nothing in particular to call him up i dont know anything about jerry youd better be going home young un take my advice and dont stay out another night he evidently thought that ben was a truant from home as his dress would hardly class him among the homeless boys who slept out from necessity ben scrambled upon the pier and took a cross street up towards broadway he had slept off his fatigue and the natural appetite of a healthy boy began to assert itself it was rather uncomfortable to reflect that he was penniless and had no means of buying a breakfast he had meant to ask jerrys advice as to some occupation by which he could earn a little money and felt disappointed that his companion had gone away before he waked up his appetite was the greater because he had been limited to a single apple for supper where to go he did not know one place was as good as another it was a strange sensation to ben to feel the cravings of appetite with nothing to satisfy it all his life he had been accustomed to a good home where his wants were plentifully provided for he had never had any anxiety about the supply of his daily wants in the city there were hundreds of boys younger than he who rising in the morning knew not where their meals were to come from or whether they were to have any but this had never been his case i am young and strong thought ben why cant i find something to do his greatest anxiety was to work and earn his living somehow but how did not seem clear even if he were willing to turn bootblack he had no box nor brush and had some doubts whether he should at first possess the requisite skill selling papers struck him more favorably but here again the want of capital would be an objection so in a very perplexed frame of mind our young adventurer went on his way and after a while caught sight of the upper end of the city hall park here he felt himself at home and entering looked among the dozens of boys who were plying their work to see if he could not find his acquaintance jerry but here he was unsuccessful jerrys business stand was near the cortlandt street pier hour after hour passed and ben became more and more hungry and dispirited he felt thoroughly helpless there seemed to be nothing that he could do he began to be faint and his head ached one oclock found him on nassau street near the corner of fulton there was a stand for the sale of cakes and pies located here presided over by an old woman of somewhat ample dimensions this stall had a fascination for poor ben he had such a craving for food that he could not take his eyes off the tempting pile of cakes which were heaped up before him it seemed to him that he should be perfectly happy if he could be permitted to eat all he wanted of them ben knew that it was wrong to steal he had never in his life taken what did not belong to him which is more than many boys can say who have been brought up even more comfortably than he but the temptation now was very strong he knew it was not right but he was not without excuse watching his opportunity he put his hand out quickly and seizing a couple of pies stowed them away hastily in his pocket and was about moving off to eat them in some place where he would not be observed but though the owner of the stolen articles had not observed the theft there was a boy hanging about the stall possibly with the same object in view who did see it hes got some of your pies old lady said the young detective the old woman looked round and though the pies were in bens pocket there was a telltale in his face which betrayed him put back them pies you young thafe said the angry piemerchant aint you ashamed of yerself to rob a poor widdy that has hard work to support herself and her childers you thats dressed like a gentleman and ought to know better give it to him old lady said the hardhearted young vagabond who had exposed bens iniquity as for ben he had not a word to say in spite of his hunger he was overwhelmed with confusion at having actually attempted to steal and been caught in the act he was by no means a model boy but apart from anything which he had been taught in the sunday school he considered stealing mean and discreditable and yet he had been led into it what would his friends at home think of it if they should ever hear of it so as i said he stood without a word to say in his defence mechanically replacing the pies on the stall i say old lady youd orter give me a pie for tellin you said the informer youd have done the same you young imp if youd had the chance answered the pievender with more truth than gratitude clear out the whole on ye ive had trouble enough with ye ben moved off thankful to get off so well he had feared that he might be handed over to the police and this would have been the crowning disgrace but the old woman seemed satisfied with the restoration of her property and the expression of her indignation the attempt upon her stock she regarded with very little surprise having suffered more than once before in a similar way but there was another spectator of the scene whose attention had been drawn to the neat attire and respectable appearance of ben he saw that he differed considerably from the ordinary run of street boys he noticed also the flush on the boys cheek when he was detected and judged that this was his first offence something out of the common way must have driven him to the act he felt impelled to follow ben and learn what that something was i may as well state here that he was a young man of twentyfive or thereabouts a reporter on one or more of the great morning papers he like ben had come to the city in search of employment and before he secured it had suffered more hardships and privations than he liked to remember he was now earning a modest income sufficient to provide for his wants and leave a surplus over he had seen much of suffering and much of crime in his daily walks about the city but his heart had not become hardened nor his sympathies blunted he gave more in proportion to his means than many rich men who have a reputation for benevolence ben had walked but a few steps when he felt a hand upon his shoulder looking round hastily he met the gaze of the young man he had thought at first it might be a policeman and he felt relieved when he saw his mistake you are the boy who just now took a couple of pies from a stall said the reporter yes said ben hesitatingly his face crimsoning as he spoke do you mind telling me why you did so there was something in his tone which reassured ben and he determined to tell the truth frankly i have eaten nothing today he said you never took anything before no said ben quickly i suppose you had no money to buy with no i had not how does it happen that a boy as well dressed as you are are in such a position i would rather not tell said ben have you run away from home yes i had a good reason he added quickly what do you propose to do you must earn your living in some way or starve i thought i might get a place in a store but i have tried half a dozen and they wont take me no your chance will be small unless you can bring good references but you must be hungry i am ben admitted that can be remedied at all events i am just going to get some dinner will you go with me i have no money i have and that will answer the purpose for this time we will go back to fulton street ben turned back thankfully and with his companion entered the very restaurant in which he had dined the day before if you are faint soup will be the best thing for you to begin on said the young man and he gave an order to the waiter nothing had ever seemed more delicious to ben than that soup when he had done justice to it a plate of beefsteak awaited him which also received his attention then he was asked to select some dessert i am afraid you are spending too much for me he said dont be afraid of that i am glad that you have a good appetite at length the dinner was over ben felt decidedly better his despondency had vanished and the world again seemed bright to him it is hard to be cheerful or take bright views of life on an empty stomach as many have learned beside our young adventurer now said his newfound friend i have a few minutes to spare suppose we talk over your plans and prospects and see if we can find anything for you to do thank you said ben i wish you would give me your advice my advice is that you return to your home if you have one said the reporter ben shook his head i dont want to do that he answered i dont of course know what is your objection to this which seems to me the best course putting it aside however we will consider what you can do here to earn your living that is what i want to do how would you like selling papers i think i should like it said ben but i have no money to buy any it doesnt require a very large capital i will lend you or give you the small amount which will be necessary however you mustnt expect to make a very large income if i can make enough to live on i wont care said ben he had at first aimed higher but his short residence in the city taught him that he would be fortunate to meet his expenses there are a good many besides ben who have found their early expectations of success considerably modified by experience let me see it is halfpast one oclock said the reporter drawing out his watch you had better lay in a supply of expresses and evening posts and take a good stand somewhere and do your best with them as you are inexperienced in the business it will be well to take a small supply at first or you might get stuck thats so you must not lay in more than you can sell where can i get the papers i will go with you to the newspaper offices and buy you half a dozen of each if you succeed in selling them you can buy more tomorrow you can lay in some of the morning papers the herald world tribune or times it will be well also to have a few suns for those who do not care to pay for the higherpriced papers thank you said ben who was eager to begin his business career they rose from the table and set out for the offices of the two evening papers whose names have been mentioned chapter viii ben commences his business career ben soon took his stand in the street with a roll of papers under his arm supplied by the generosity of his new acquaintance it was rather a trying ordeal for a country boy new to the city and its ways but ben was not bashful he was not a timid boy but was fully able to push his way so glancing at the telegraphic headings he began to call out the news in a businesslike way he had already taken notice of how the other newsboys acted and therefore was at no loss how to proceed he met with very fair success selling out the twelve papers which had been bought for him in a comparatively short time it might have been that the fact that he was neater and better dressed operated in his favor at any rate though a new hand he succeeded better than those who were older in the business but his neat dress operated to his disadvantage in another quarter his business rivals who were with scarcely an exception dressed with no great pretensions to style or neatness looked upon the interloper with a jealous eye they regarded him as stuck up in virtue of his superior dress and were indignant to find their sales affected by his competition whos he ever seen him afore asked tim banks of a newsboy at his side no hes a new chap what business has he got to come here and steal away our trade id like to know continued tim eying ben with no friendly glance at that moment a gentleman passing tim bought an evening post of ben it was the third paper that ben had sold since tim had effected a sale this naturally increased his indignation hes puttin on airs just because hes got good cloes said the other newsboy who shared tims feelings on the subject lets shove him out suggested tim all right tim who was a boy of twelve with a shock head which looked as if it had never been combed and a suit of clothes which bore the marks of severe usage advanced to ben closely followed by his confederate who had agreed to back him ben had just sold his last paper when the two approached him he did not understand their object until tim swaggering up to him said offensively youd better clear out you aint wanted here ben turned and faced his ragged opponent with intrepidity why aint i wanted here he inquired without manifesting the least symptom of alarm tim rather anticipated that ben would show the white feather and was a little surprised at his calmness cause yer aint thats why he answered if you dont like my company you can go somewhere else said ben this is my place said tim you aint got no right to push in if its your place how much did you pay for it asked ben i thought that the sidewalk was free to all you aint got no right to interfere with my business i didnt know that i had interfered with it well you have i aint sold moren half as many papers since youve been here youve got the same chance as i have said ben i didnt tell them not to buy of you well you aint wanted here and youd better make tracks said tim who considered this the best argument of all suppose i dont said ben then ill give you a lickin ben surveyed the boy who uttered this threat in the same manner that a general would examine an opposing force with a view to ascertain his strength and ability to cope with him it was clear that tim was taller than himself and doubtless older as to being stronger ben did not feel so positive he was himself well and compactly made and strong of his age he did not relish the idea of being imposed upon and prepared to resist any encroachment upon his rights he did not believe that tim had any right to order him off he felt that the sidewalk was just as free to him as to any other boy and he made up his mind to assert and maintain his right if you want to give me a licking just try it he said ive got just as much right to stand here and sell papers as you have and im going to do it you neednt be so stuck up jest because youve got good cloes on if they are good i cant help it said ben theyre all i have and they wont be good long maybe i could get good cloes if id steal em said tim do you mean to say i stole these retorted ben angrily he had no sooner said it however than he thought of the pies which he should have stolen if he had not been detected and his face flushed luckily tim did not know why his words produced an effect upon ben or he would have followed up his attack yes i do said tim then you judge me by yourself said ben thats all ive got to say say that agin said tim menacingly so i will if you want to hear it you judge me by yourself ill give you a lickin youve said that before tim was not particularly brave still ben was a smaller boy and besides he had a friend at hand to back him so he concluded that it would be safe to venture doubling up a dirty fist he struck out intending to hit ben in the face but our young adventurer was on his guard and fended off the blow with his arms will yer go now demanded tim pausing after his attack why should i if you dont ill give you another lick i can stand it if it isnt any worse than that tim was spurred by this to renew the assault he tried to throw his arms around ben and lift him from the ground which would enable him to throw him with greater ease but ben was wary and experienced in this mode of warfare having often had scuffles in fun with his schoolfellows he evaded tims grasp therefore and dealt him a blow in the breast which made tim stagger back he began to realize that ben though a smaller boy was a formidable opponent and regretted that he had undertaken a contest with him he was constrained to appeal to his companion for assistance just lend a hand jack and well give it to him so you have to ask help said ben scornfully though youre bigger than i am i could lick yer well enough alone said tim but youve been interferin with jacks business as well as mine jack responded to his friends appeal and the two advanced to the assault of ben of course all this took place much more quickly than it has taken to describe it the contest commenced and our young adventurer would have got the worst of it if help had not arrived though a match for either of the boys singly he could not be expected to cope with both at a time especially as he was smaller than either tim found himself seized forcibly by the arm just as he was about to level a blow at ben looking up he met the glance of another newsboy a boy of fourteen who was known among his comrades as rough and ready this boy was stout and strong and was generally liked by those of his class for his generous qualities as well as respected for his physical strength which he was always ready to exert in defence of a weaker boy whats all this tim he demanded aint you ashamed the two of you to pitch into a smaller boy he aint got no business here said tim doggedly why not hes takin away all our trade hasnt he just as much right to sell papers as you he can go somewhere else so can you hes a new boy this is the first day hes sold papers then you ought to be able to keep up with him whats your name young un this question was of course addressed to ben ben answered our young hero he did not think it necessary to mention his other name especially as having run away from home he had a vague idea that it might lead to his discovery well ben go ahead and sell your papers ill see that you have fair play thank you said ben im not afraid of either of them both of them might be too much for you i dont want to interfere with their business theyve got just as good a chance to sell as i have of course they have is this your first day yes how many papers have you sold six posts and six expresses thats pretty good for a beginning are you going to get some more yes i was just going into the office when that boy pointing to tim tried to drive me off he wont do it again come in with me im going to buy some papers too whats your name asked ben i like you youre not mean like those fellows my name is rufus but the boys call me rough and ready where do you live at the newsboys lodging house no i live in leonard street ive got a mother and a little sister i live with them have you got a father no that is not a real father ive got a stepfather but hes worse than none for he is loafing round most of the time and spends all the money he can get on drink if it wasnt for me hed treat mother worse than he does how long have you been in new york only a day or two said ben where are you living anywhere i can i havent got any place where did you sleep last night in a haybarge at one of the piers along with a bootblack named jerry that was the first night i ever slept out how did you like it i think id prefer a bed said ben you can get one at the lodge for six cents i didnt have six cents last night theyll trust you there and you can pay next time where is the lodging house its on the corner of this street and fulton said rough and ready ill show it to you if you want me to id like to have you id rather pay six cents than sleep out again by this time they reached the office of the express and entering purchased a supply of papers he was about to invest his whole capital but by the advice of his companion bought only eight copies as by the time these were disposed of a later edition would be out which of course would be more salable chapter ix scenes at the newsboys lodging house it will be unnecessary to give in detail the record of bens sales he succeeded because he was in earnest and he was in earnest because his own experience in the early part of the day had revealed to him how uncomfortable it was to be without money or friends in a large city at seven oclock on counting over his money he found that he had a dollar and twelve cents of this sum he had received half a dollar from the friendly reporter to start him in business this left sixtytwo cents as his net profits for the afternoons work ben felt proud of it for it was the first money he had ever earned his confidence came back to him and he thought he saw his way clear to earning his own living although the reporter had not exacted repayment ben determined to lay aside fifty cents for that purpose of the remaining sixtytwo a part must be saved as a fund for the purchase of papers the next morning probably thirty cents would be sufficient for this as after selling out those first purchased he would have money for a new supply this would leave him thirtytwo cents to pay for his supper lodging and breakfast ben would not have seen his way to accomplish all this for so small a sum if he had not been told that at the newsboys lodge the regular charge was six cents for each meal and the same for lodging this would make but eighteen cents leaving him a surplus of fourteen on inquiry however he ascertained that it was already past the hour for supper at the lodge and therefore went into the restaurant on fulton street where he ordered a cup of coffee and a plate of teabiscuit these cost ten cents finding his appetite still unsatisfied he ordered another plate of biscuit which carried up the expense of his supper to fifteen cents this left seventeen cents for lodging and breakfast after supper he went out into the street once more and walked about for some time until he began to feel tired when he turned his steps towards the newsboys lodge this institution occupied at that time the two upper stories of the building at the corner of nassau and fulton streets on the first floor was the office of the daily sun the entrance to the lodge was on fulton street ben went up a steep and narrow staircase and kept mounting up until he reached the sixth floor here to the left he saw a door partially opened through which he could see a considerable number of boys whose appearance indicated that they belonged to the class known as street boys he pushed the door open and entered he found himself in a spacious but lowstudded apartment abundantly lighted by rows of windows on two sides at the end nearest the door was a raised platform on which stood a small melodeon which was used at the sundayevening meetings there were rows of benches in the centre of the apartment for the boys a stout pleasantlooking man who proved to be mr oconnor the superintendent advanced to meet ben whom he at once recognized as a newcomer is this the newsboys lodge asked ben yes said the superintendent do you wish to stop with us i should like to sleep here tonight said ben you are quite welcome how much do you charge our charge is six cents here is the money said ben drawing it from his vestpocket what is your name benjamin and your other name brandon answered ben with some hesitation what do you do for a living i am selling papers well we will assign you a bed where are the beds asked ben looking about him they are on the floor below any of the boys will go down and show you when you get ready to retire can i get breakfast here in the morning inquired ben certainly we charge the same as for lodging ben handed over six cents additional and congratulated himself that he was not as badly off as the night before being sure of a comfortable bed and a breakfast in the morning what are those for he asked pointing to a row of drawers or lockers on the sides of the apartment near the floor boys who have any extra clothing or any articles which they value are allowed to use them here they are safe as they can be locked we will assign you one if you wish i have nothing to put away said ben i had a little bundle of clothes but they were stolen from me while i was lying asleep on a bench in the city hall park i suppose you dont know who took them no said ben but i think it was some of the boys that were blacking boots near me that boys got one of them on he said suddenly in an excited tone pointing out mike the younger of the two boys who had appropriated his bundle mike had locked up his own shirt which was considerably the worse for wear and put on bens which gave him a decidedly neater appearance than before he had thought himself perfectly safe in doing so not dreaming that he would be brought face to face with the true owner in the lodge what makes you think it is yours asked mr oconnor it is cut like mine said ben besides i remember getting a large spot of ink on one of the sleeves which would not wash out there it is on the left arm as ben had said there was a faint bluish spot on the sleeve of the shirt this made bens story a plausible one though not conclusive the superintendent decided to inquire of mike about the matter and see what explanation he could give mike rafferty he said in a tone of authority come here i want you mike came forward but when he saw ben whom he recognized he felt a little taken aback but he had not been brought up in the streets for nothing his embarrassment was only momentary he determined to brazen it out and swear if anything was said about the shirt that it was his own lawful property i see youve got a new shirt on mike said mr oconnor yes sir said mike where did you get it where would i get it said mike i bought it yesterday where did you buy it round in baxter street said mike confidently it is a pretty good shirt for baxter street remarked mr oconnor how much did you pay for it fifty cents answered mike glibly this may all be true mike said the superintendent but i am not certain about it this boy here says it is his shirt and he thinks that you stole it from him while he was lying asleep in city hall park yesterday its a lie hes tellin sir said mike i never seed him afore here seemed to be a conflict of evidence of the two ben seemed the more likely to tell the truth still it was possible that he might be mistaken and mike might be right after all have you any other proof that the shirt is yours asked mr oconnor turning to ben yes said ben my name is marked on the shirt just below the waist we can settle the matter quickly then mike pull out the shirt so that we can see it mike made some objection which was quickly overruled the shirt being examined bore the name of benj brandon just as ben had said the shirt is yours said the superintendent to ben now mike what did you mean by telling me that lie it was bad enough to steal without adding a lie besides i bought the shirt in baxter street persisted mike unblushingly then how do you account for his name on it maybe he sold it to the man i bought it of i didnt sell it at all said ben was that all you had taken no said ben there was another shirt besides do you know anything about it mike no i dont said mike i dont know whether you are telling the truth or not said the superintendent but at any rate you must take this off and give it to the right owner and will he pay me the fifty cents asked mike i dont think you bought it at all but if you did you can prove it by the man you bought it of if you can do that i will see that the money is refunded to you there was one strong reason for discrediting mikes story these baxterstreet shops are often the receptacles of stolen goods as their identification might bring the dealers into trouble they are very careful as soon as an article comes into their possession to obliterate all the marks of former ownership it was hardly likely that they would suffer a shirt to go out of their hands so plainly marked as was the case in the present instance mr oconnor of course knew this and accordingly had very little fear that he was doing injustice to mike in ordering him to make restitution to ben mike was forced considerably against his will to take off the new shirt and put on his old ragged one but the former was no longer as clean as formerly where can i get it washed asked ben you can wash it yourself in the washroom or you can carry it to a laundry as some of the boys do if you are willing to pay for it i think i would rather carry it to a laundry said ben who doubted strongly his ability to wash the shirt so as to improve its appearance the superintendent accordingly gave him the direction to one of these establishments opposite the room which he had entered was a smaller room used by the boys as a gymnasium ben looked into it and determined to use it on some future occasion he next went into the washroom here he saw two or three boys stripped to the waist engaged in washing out their shirts being provided with but a single one each they left them to dry over night while they were in bed and could dispense with them ben wondered how they managed about ironing them but he soon found that with these amateur laundresses ironing was not considered necessary they are put on roughdry in the morning and so worn until they are considered dirty enough for another purification ben looked about him with interest the boys were chatting in an animated manner detailing their experiences during the day or chaffing each other in a style peculiar to themselves say jim said one didnt i see you at the grand opera last night yes of course you did said jim i was in a private box along with the mayor i had a dimond pin in the bosom of my shirt yes i seed you through my operaglass what have you done with your dimond pin do you think id bring it here to be stole no i keep it in my safe along of my other valooables ben listened in amusement and thought that jim would have cut rather a singular figure in the mayors box several boys who had gone barefoot were washing their feet that being required previous to going to bed this is necessary otherwise the clean bedclothes would be so soiled as to require daily washing the boys seemed to be having a good time and then though he was unacquainted with any of them felt that it was much pleasanter to be here in a social atmosphere than wandering around by himself in the dark and lonely streets he observed one thing with surprise that the boys refrained from profane or vulgar speech though they were by no means so particular in the street during the day this is however a rule strictly enforced by the superintendent and if not complied with the offender is denied the privilege of the lodging house after a while ben expressed a desire to go to bed and in company with one of the boys descended to a room equally large in the story below where over a hundred single beds were arranged in tiers in a manner very similar to the berths of a steamboat ben was agreeably surprised by the neat and comfortable appearance of these beds he felt that he should be nearly as well provided for as at home quickly undressing himself he jumped into the bed assigned him and in a few minutes was fast asleep chapter x further experiences ben had a comfortable nights rest and when he awoke in the morning he felt that a bed at the newsboys lodge was considerably better than a bale of cotton or a haybarge at an early hour in the morning the boys were called and began to tumble out in all directions interchanging as they performed their hasty toilet a running fire of chaff and goodhumored jesting some of which consisted of personal allusions the reverse of complimentary many of the boys stopped to breakfast but not all some wanted to get to work earlier and took breakfast at a later hour at some cheap restaurant earning it before they ate it ben however had paid for his breakfast in advance knowing that he could not get it so cheap elsewhere and so waited to partake of it he took his place at a long table with his companions and found himself served with a bowl of coffee and a generous slice of bread sometimes but not always a little cold meat is supplied in addition but even when there is bread only the coffee warms the stomach and so strengthens the boys for their labors outside the breakfast was not as varied of course as ben had been accustomed to at home nor as tempting as my young readers have spread before them every morning but it was good of its kind and ben ate it with unusual relish when he had finished his meal he prepared to go out to work not however till the superintendent whose recollection of individual boys is surprising considering the large number who frequent the lodging house in the course of a year had invited him to come again the lodging house though it cannot supply the place of a private home steps between hundreds of boys and complete vagabondage into which but for its existence they would quickly lapse probably no money is more wisely expended than that which enables the childrens aid society of new york to maintain this and kindred institutions ben had after breakfast eightyfive cents to commence the day on but of this sum it will be remembered he had reserved fifty cents to pay the friendly reporter for his loan this left him a working capital of thirtyfive cents it was not a large sum to do business on but it was enough and with it ben felt quite independent in front of the times office ben met rough and ready the newsboy who had taken his part the day before he had got the start of ben and was just disposing of his only remaining paper how are you asked ben sos to be around answered the other what are you up to im going to buy some papers i have sold eight already where did you sleep last night at the lodging house how do you like it its a good place and very cheap yes its a bully place id go there myself if it wasnt for mother and rose its enough sight better than our room on leonard street but i cant leave my mother and sister if youre going to buy some more papers id like to go with you all right come ahead ben invested his money under the direction of his companion by his advice he purchased nearly to the amount of his entire capital knowing that it would come back to him again so that his plan for paying the reporter could still be carried out you can stand near me if you want to ben said rough and ready i am afraid i shall interfere with your trade answered ben dont be afraid of that i dont ask no favors i can get my share of business ben while engaged in selling papers himself had an opportunity to watch the ready tact with which rough and ready adapted himself to the different persons whom he encountered he succeeded in effecting a sale in many cases where others would have failed he had sold all his papers before ben had disposed of twothirds of his though both began with an equal number here ben he said generously give me three of your papers ill sell em for you by this friendly help ben found himself shortly emptyhanded shall i buy any more he inquired of his companion its gettin late for mornin papers said rough and ready youd better wait till the evenin papers come out how much money have you made ben counted over his money and answered ive made thirtyfive cents well thatll be moren enough to buy your dinner how much do you make in a day asked ben sometimes over a dollar you ought to lay up money then rough and ready shook his head i have to pay everything over to my mother he said its little enough to support a family doesnt your father earn anything my stepfather repeated the other emphasizing the first syllable no he doesnt earn much and what he does earn he spends for rum we could do a great deal better without him he continued ben began to see that he had a much easier task before him in supporting himself than his new friend in supplying the wants of a family of four for mr martin his stepfather did not scruple to live partially on the earnings of his stepson whose industry should have put him to shame i guess ill go home a little while said rough and ready ill see you again this afternoon left to himself ben began to walk around with an entirely different feeling from that which he experienced the day before he had one dollar and twenty cents in his pocket not all of it his own but the greater part of it his own earnings only twentyfour hours before his prospects seemed very dark now he had found friends and he had also learned how to help himself as he was walking down nassau street he suddenly espied a little distance ahead the reporter who had done him such an important service the day before he quickened his pace and speedily came up with him goodmorning said he by way of calling the reporters attention goodmorning responded the reporter not at first recognizing him im ready to pay the money you lent me yesterday said ben oh youre the boy i set up in business yesterday well how have you made out pretty well said ben with satisfaction heres the money you lent me and he drew out fifty cents and offered it to the young man but have you got any money left inquired the reporter ben displayed the remainder of his money mentioning the amount youve succeeded capitally where did you sleep last night at the newsboys lodge thats better than sleeping out i begin to think my young friend you must have a decided business talent it isnt often a new boy succeeds so well ben was pleased with this compliment and made a new offer of the money which the young man had not yet taken i dont know as i had better take this money said the reporter you may need it no said ben ive got enough to keep me along youve got to get dinner that wont cost me more than twentyfive cents then i shall have fortyfive to buy papers this afternoon well said the young man if you dont need it i will take it but on one condition what is that asked ben that if you get hard up at any time you will come to me and i will help you out thank you said ben gratefully you are very kind i know that you boys are apt to have hard times but if you work faithfully and dont form any bad habits i think you will get along here is my card and directions for finding me if you need any assistance at any time ben took the card and went on his way feeling more glad that he had paid his debt than if the money were still in his possession he felt that it was a partial atonement for the theft which he had nearly committed the day before as he walked along thinking of what he had just done he suddenly found himself shoved violently off the sidewalk looking angrily to see who was the aggressor he recognized mike rafferty who had been detected the night before in wearing his stolen shirt whats that for demanded ben angrily its to tache you better manners ye spalpeen said mike ben returned the blow with spirit thats to teach you not to steal my shirt again he said its a lie said mike i bought it of the man you sold it to you know better retorted ben you took it while i was asleep in the park mike was about to retaliate with another blow when the sight of an approaching policeman warned him of peril and he retreated in good order sending back looks of defiance at our hero whom he could not forgive for having proved him guilty of theft bens exploration of the city had thus far been very limited he had heard of the battery and he determined to go down there the distance was not great and in a few minutes he found himself at the lower end of the manhattan island looking with interest at the shores across the river here was castle garden a large structure now used for recently arrived emigrants but once the scene of one of jenny linds triumphs now it would seem very strange to have a grand concert given in such a building and in such a locality however ben knew nothing of the purposes of the building and looked at it ignorantly the battery he thought might once have been pretty but now the grass has been worn off by pedestrians and the once fashionable houses in the neighborhood have long ago been deserted by their original proprietors and been turned into warehouses or cheap boardinghouses after looking about a little ben turned to go back he began to feel hungry and thought he might as well get some dinner after that was eaten it would be time for the evening papers he was intending to go back to fulton street but his attention was drawn to a restaurant by the bills of fare exposed outside a brief examination satisfied him that the prices were quite as moderate as in fulton street and he decided to enter and take his dinner here chapter xi ben becomes a baggagesmasher the restaurant was a small one and not fashionable in appearance having a shabby look the floor was sanded and the tables were covered with soiled cloths however ben had learned already not to be fastidious and he sat down and gave his order a plate of roast beef and a cup of coffee were brought according to his directions seated opposite him at the table was a man who had nearly completed his dinner as ben commenced he held in his hand a philadelphia paper which he left behind when he rose to go you have left your paper said ben i have read it through was the reply i dont care to take it ben took it up and found it to be a daily paper which his father had been accustomed to take for years it gave him a start as he saw the familiar page and he felt a qualm of homesickness the neat house in which he had lived since he was born his mothers gentle face rose up before him compared with his present friendless condition and the tears rose to his eyes but he was in a public restaurant and his pride came to the rescue he pressed back the tears and resumed his knife and fork when he had finished his dinner he took up the paper once more reading here and there at last his eye rested on the following advertisement my son benjamin brandon having run away from home without any good reason i hereby caution the public against trusting him on my account but will pay the sum of one dollar and necessary expenses to any person who will return him to me he is ten years old well grown for his age has dark eyes and a dark complexion he was dressed in a graymixed suit and had on a blue cap when he left home james brandon bens face flushed when he read this advertisement it was written by his father he knew well enough and he judged from the language that it was written in anger one dollar was offered for his restoration ben felt somehow humiliated at the smallness of the sum and at the thought that this advertisement would be read by his friends and schoolcompanions the softer thoughts which but just now came to him were banished and he determined whatever hardships awaited him to remain in new york and support himself as he had begun to do but embittered as he felt against his father he felt a pang when he thought of his mother he knew how anxious she would feel about him and he wished he might be able to write her privately that he was well and doing well but he was afraid the letter would get into his fathers hands and reveal his whereabouts then the police might be set on his track and he might be forced home to endure the humiliation of a severe punishment and the jeers of his companions who would never let him hear the last of his abortive attempt at last a way occurred to him he would write a letter and place it in the hands of some one going to philadelphia to be posted in the latter city this would give no clue to his present home and would answer the purpose of relieving his mothers anxiety late in the afternoon ben went into a stationery store on nassau street will you give me a sheet of paper and an envelope he asked depositing two cents on the counter the articles called for were handed him can i write a letter here inquired ben you can go round to that desk said the clerk you will find pen and ink there ben with some difficulty composed and wrote the following letter for it was the first he had ever had occasion to write dear mother i hope you will not feel very bad because i have left home father punished me for what i did not do and after that i was not willing to stay but i wish i could see you dont feel anxious about me for i am getting along very well and earning my own living i cannot tell you where i am for father might find out and i do not want to come back especially after that advertisement i dont think my going will make much difference to father as he has only offered one dollar reward for me you need not show this letter to him i send you my love and i also send my love to mary though she used to tease me sometimes and now i must bid you goodby from your affectionate son ben after completing this letter ben put it in the envelope and directed it to mrs ruth brandon cedarville pennsylvania it may be explained that the mary referred to was an elder sister ten years older than ben against whom he felt somewhat aggrieved on account of his sisters having interfered with him more than he thought she had any right to do she and ben were the only children if i were to express my opinion of this letter of bens i should say that it was wanting in proper feeling for the mother who had always been kind and gentle to him and whose heart he must have known would be deeply grieved by his running away from home but bens besetting sin was pride mingled with obstinacy and pride prevailed over his love for his mother if he could have known of the bitter tears which his mother was even now shedding over her lost boy i think he would have found it difficult to maintain his resolution when the letter was written ben went across to the postoffice and bought a threecent stamp which he placed on the envelope then learning that there was an evening train for philadelphia he went down to the cortlandt street ferry and watched till he saw a gentleman who had the air of a traveller ben stepped up to him and inquired are you going to philadelphia sir yes my lad was the answer are you going there also no sir i thought you might want somebody to take charge of you is there anything i can do for you yes sir if you would be so kind as to post this letter in philadelphia i will do so but why dont you post it in new york it will go just as well the person who wrote it said ben doesnt want to have it known where it came from very well give it to me and i will see that it is properly mailed the gentleman took the letter and ben felt glad that it was written he thought it would relieve his mothers anxiety as he was standing on the pier a gentleman having a carpetbag in one hand and a bundle of books in the other accosted him can you direct me to the astor house boy yes sir said ben then with a sudden thought he added shall i carry your carpetbag sir on the whole i think you may said the gentleman or stay i think you may take this parcel of books i can carry both sir no matter about that i will carry the bag and you shall be my guide ben had not yet had time to get very well acquainted with the city but the astor house which is situated nearly opposite the lower end of the city hall park he had passed a dozen times and knew the way to it very well he was glad that the gentleman wished to go there and not to one of the uptown hotels of which he knew nothing he went straight up cortlandt street to broadway and then turning north soon arrived at the massive structure which for over thirty years has welcomed travellers from all parts of the world this is the astor house sir said ben i remember it now said the gentleman but it is ten years since i have been in new york and i did not feel quite certain of finding my way do you live in new york yes sir you may give me the package now how much shall i pay you for your services whatever you please sir said ben will that answer and the traveller placed twentyfive cents in the hands of our young hero yes sir said ben in a tone of satisfaction thank you the traveller entered the hotel and ben remained outside congratulating himself upon his good luck thats an easy way to earn twenty five cents he thought it didnt take me more than fifteen minutes to come up from the ferry and i should have to sell twentyfive papers to make so much this sum added to what he had made during the day by selling papers and including what he had on hand originally made one dollar and thirty cents but out of this he had spent twentyfive cents for dinner and for his letter including postage five cents thus his expenses had been thirty cents which being deducted left him just one dollar out of this however it would be necessary to buy some supper and pay for his lodging and breakfast at the newsboys home fifteen cents however would do for the first while the regular charge for the second would be but twelve cents ben estimated therefore that he would have seventythree cents to start on next day he felt that this was a satisfactory state of finances and considered whether he could not afford to spend a little more for supper however not feeling very hungry he concluded not to do so the next morning he bought papers as usual and sold them but it seemed considerably harder work for the money than carrying bundles however ben foresaw that in order to become a baggagesmasher for this is the technical term by which the boys and men are known who wait around the ferries and railway depots for a chance to carry baggage though i have preferred to use the term luggage boy it would be necessary to know more about localities in the city than he did at present accordingly he devoted the intervals of time between the selling of papers to seeking out and ascertaining the locality of the principal hotels and streets in the city in the course of a fortnight he had obtained a very fair knowledge of the city he now commenced waiting at the ferries and depots though he did not immediately give up entirely the newspaper trade but at length he gave it up altogether and became a baggagesmasher by profession or as he is styled in the title of this book a luggage boy thus commences a new page in his history chapter xii bens home in philadelphia though the story of ben the luggage boy professes to treat of life in the city streets i must devote a single chapter to a very different place i must carry the reader to bens home in pennsylvania and show what effect his running away had upon the family circle there was a neat twostory house standing on the principal street in cedarville with a pleasant lawn in front through which from the gate a gravelled walk ran to the front door mr brandon as i have already said was a coaldealer and in very comfortable circumstances so that ben had never known what it was to want anything which he really needed he was a man of great firmness and at times severity and more than once ben had felt aggrieved by his treatment of him mrs brandon was quite different from her husband being gentle and kind and it was to her that ben always went for sympathy in any trouble or difficulty whether at home or at school mrs brandon was sitting at the window with her work in her hand but it had fallen listlessly in her lap and on her face was a look of painful preoccupation opposite her sat her daughter mary bens only sister already referred to dont worry so mother said mary you will make yourself sick i cannot help it mary said mrs brandon i cant help worrying about ben he has been gone a week now and heaven knows what he has suffered he may be dead no mother said mary who had more of her fathers strength than her mothers gentleness he is not dead you may depend upon that but he had no money that i know of how could he live ben can take care of himself better than most boys of his age but think of a boy of ten going out in the world by himself there are many boys of ten who have to do it mother what could the poor boy do he might suffer a little but if he does he will the sooner come home i wish he might said mrs brandon with a sigh i think your father does very wrong not to go after him he wouldnt know where to go besides he has advertised i hope ben will not see the advertisement poor boy he would feel hurt to think that we cared so little for him as to offer only one dollar for his return he will know you had nothing to do with the advertisement mother you may be sure of that yes he knows me too well for that i would give all i have to have him back i want him back too said mary he is my only brother and of course i love him but i dont think it will do him any harm to suffer a little as a punishment for going away you were always hard upon the poor boy mary said mrs brandon no i am not hard but i see his faults and i want him to correct them it is you who have been too indulgent if i have been it is because you and your father have been too much the other way there was a brief pause then mrs brandon said can you think of any place mary where ben would be likely to go yes i suppose he went to philadelphia when a boy runs away from home he naturally goes to the nearest city i have a great mind to go up tomorrow what good would it do mother i might meet him in the street there is not much chance of that i shouldnt wonder if by this time he had gone to sea gone to sea repeated mrs brandon turning pale what makes you think so did he ever speak of such a thing to you yes he once threatened to run away to sea when i did something that did not suit him oh i hope not i have heard that boys are treated very badly on board ship besides he might get drowned i am not sure whether a good seavoyage might not be the best thing for him said strongminded mary but suppose he should be illtreated it might take the pride out of him and make him a better boy i never get much satisfaction from you mary i dont see how you can be so harsh i see we are not likely to agree mother but there is a boy coming up the walk with a letter in his hand it may be from ben said his mother rising hastily and going to the door the boy was william gordon a schoolmate of bens whose disappearance long before this time had been reported throughout the village i was passing the postoffice mrs brandon he said when the postmaster called from the window and asked me to bring you this letter i think it is from ben the handwriting looks like his oh thank you william said mrs brandon joyfully give it to me quick she tore it open and read the letter which is given at length in the last chapter is it from ben asked william yes is he in philadelphia i noticed it was mailed there yes no he says he cannot tell us where he is i think he must be in philadelphia or the letter would not be mailed there come in william i must go and tell mary no thank you mrs brandon i am on an errand for my mother i hope ben is well yes he says so mrs brandon went in and showed the letter to her daughter there i told you mother you need not be alarmed he says he is earning his living but it seems so hard for a boy of ten to have to work for his living what can he do oh there are various things he can do he might sell papers for instance i think i shall go to philadelphia tomorrow mary it wont be of any use you may depend mother he is not in philadelphia but this letter is posted there that is a proof to me that he is not there he says he dont want to come back shortly after mr brandon entered the house we have had a letter from ben father said mary show it to me he said briefly he read the letter and handed it back without a word what are you going to do about it mr brandon asked his wife what is there to be done he asked i think i had better go up to philadelphia tomorrow what for i might see him you would be going on a wildgoose chase then why wont you go it isnt worth while if the boy doesnt want to come home he may take care of himself if he likes it so well i shant run round after him he says he did not do what you punished him for said mrs brandon rather deprecatingly for she was somewhat in awe of her husband of course he would say that i have heard that before but i dont think he really did i know you have always been foolishly indulgent to him at any rate that cannot be said of you said his wife with some spirit no he answered rather surprised at such an unusual manifestation from his usually acquiescent wife you are right there and you might add that i dont mean to be if he should return i think he would have come home but for that advertisement you see what he says about it in his letter if i were to write it again i should write it in the same manner though perhaps i might not offer so large a sum mrs brandon sighed and ceased speaking she knew her husband well enough to see that there was little chance of changing his determination or softening his anger towards ben the next day when mr brandon returned home to dinner from his coalwharf he found mary seated at the head of the table where is your mother he asked she went to philadelphia by the middle train was the answer she has gone on a fools errand i advised her not to go but she thought she might meet ben and i could not dissuade her well she will be better satisfied after she has been up and failed to find him do you think he will ever come back father yes he will turn up again some day like a bad penny he will find that earning his own living is not quite so agreeable as being taken care of at home suppose he shouldnt come back so much the worse for him said mr brandon mr brandon spoke after his way of speaking for he was not an affectionate man nor given to the softer emotions he had never given ben any reason to think he loved him at least since he was a baby but appearances are sometimes deceptive and he thought more of his sons absence than any one would have supposed he thought too of that sentence in bens letter in which he spoke of being punished for what he did not do and he admitted to himself though he would not have done so to his wife that perhaps he had been unjust to the boy after all every day when he turned from his office to go home it was with the unacknowledged hope that he might find the prodigal returned but in this hope they were all doomed to be disappointed year after year passed away and still no tidings from ben beyond that single letter which we have mentioned mrs brandon returned from philadelphia as might have been anticipated disappointed and despondent she was very tired for she had wandered about the streets looking everywhere during the four or five hours she was in the city once or twice her heart beat high as she saw in front of her a boy of bens size and dressed as he had been dressed when he left home but when with hurrying steps she came up with him she was doomed in every case to disappointment i told you it would be no use mother said mary i couldnt stay at home contented if i did nothing to find him mary hell turn up yet some day mother return in rags most likely come when he may or how he may mary my arms shall be open to receive him but the years passed and ben did not come chapter xiii the first cigar it was a week or more after ben started in business as a baggagesmasher that in returning from carrying a carpetbag to lovejoys hotel on broadway he fell in with his first city acquaintance jerry collins jerry had just polished up a gentlemans boots and having been unusually lucky this morning in securing shines felt disposed to be lavish how are you ben asked jerry what are you up to now im a baggagesmasher answered ben who was beginning to adopt the language of the streets how does it pay well said ben sometimes it pays first rate when im lucky other days i dont get much to do i didnt make but fifteen cents this morning i carried a bag up to lovejoys and thats all the man would pay me ive made fifty cents this mornin look here johnny the johnny addressed was a boy who sold cigars four for ten cents ill take two said jerry producing five cents six cents for two said the cigar boy all right ill owe you the other cent said jerry coolly do you smoke inquired ben in course i do dont you no why dont you i dont know said ben do you like it its bully here take this cigar i bought it for you ben hesitated but finally induced mainly by a curiosity to see how it seemed accepted the cigar and lighted it by jerrys the two boys sat down on an empty box and jerry instructed ben how to puff ben did not particularly enjoy it but thought he might as well learn now as any other time his companion puffed away like a veteran smoker but after a while bens head began to swim and he felt sick at his stomach i dont feel well he said i guess ill stop smoking oh go ahead said jerry its only because its the first time youll like it after a while thus encouraged ben continued to smoke though his head and his stomach got continually worse i dont like it gasped ben throwing down the cigar im going to stop youve got a healthy color said jerry slyly im afraid im going to be awful sick said ben whose sensations were very far from comfortable just at this moment ignorant of the brief character of his present feelings he heartily wished himself at home for the first time since his arrival in the city you do look rather green said jerry maybe youre going to have the cholera ive heard that theres some cases round this suggestion alarmed ben who laid his head down between his knees and began to feel worse than ever dont be scared said jerry thinking it time to relieve bens mind its only the cigar youll feel all right in a jiffy while ben was experiencing the disagreeable effects of his first cigar he resolved never to smoke another but as might have been expected he felt differently on recovering it was not long before he could puff away with as much enjoyment and unconcern as any of his street companions and a part of his earnings were consumed in this way it may be remarked here that the street boy does not always indulge in the luxury of a whole cigar sometimes he picks up a fragment which has been discarded by the original smoker there are some small dealers who make it a business to collect these stubs or employ others to do so and then sell them to the street boys at a penny apiece or less according to size sometimes these stubs are bought in preference to a cheap cigar because they are apt to be of a superior quality ben however never smoked stubs in course of time he became very much like other street boys but in some respects his taste was more fastidious and he preferred to indulge himself in a cheap cigar which was not secondhand we must now pass rapidly over the six years which elapsed from the date of bens first being set adrift in the streets to the period at which our story properly begins these years have been fruitful of change to our young adventurer they have changed him from a country boy of ten to a selfreliant and independent street boy of sixteen the impressions left by his early and careful hometraining have been mostly effaced nothing in his garb now distinguishes him from the class of which he is a type he has long since ceased to care for neat or whole attire or carefully brushed hair his straggling locks usually long protrude from an aperture in his hat his shoes would make a very poor advertisement for the shoemaker by whom they were originally manufactured his face is not always free from stains and his street companions have long since ceased to charge him with putting on airs on account of the superior neatness of his personal appearance indeed he has become rather a favorite among them in consequence of his frankness and his willingness at all times to lend a helping hand to a comrade temporarily hard up he has adopted to a great extent the tastes and habits of the class to which he belongs and bears with acquired philosophy the hardships and privations which fall to their lot like ragged dick he has a sense of humor which is apt to reveal itself in grotesque phrases or amusing exaggerations of course his education so far as education is obtained from books has not advanced at all he has not forgotten how to read having occasion to read the daily papers occasionally too he indulges himself in a dime novel the more sensational the better and is sometimes induced to read therefrom to a group of companions whose attainments are even less than his own it may be asked whether he ever thinks of his pennsylvania home of his parents and his sister at first he thought of them frequently but by degrees he became so accustomed to the freedom and independence of his street life with its constant variety that he would have been unwilling to return even if the original cause of his leaving home were removed life in a pennsylvania village seemed slow compared with the excitement of his present life in the winter when the weather was inclement and the lodging accommodations afforded by the street were not particularly satisfactory ben found it convenient to avail himself of the cheap lodgings furnished by the newsboys lodging house but at other times particularly in the warm summer nights he saved his six cents and found a lodging for himself among the wharves or in some lane or alley of the future he did not think much like street boys in general his horizon was limited by the present sometimes indeed it did occur to him that he could not be a luggage boy all his lifetime some time or other he must take up something else however ben carelessly concluded that he could make a living somehow or other and as to old age that was too far ahead to disquiet himself about chapter xiv the passenger from albany ben did not confine himself to any particular pier or railway depot but stationed himself now at one now at another according as the whim seized him or as the prospect of profit appeared more or less promising one afternoon he made his way to the pier at which the albany boats landed he knew the hour of arrival not only for the riverboats but for most of the inward trains for this was required by his business he had just finished smoking a cheap cigar when the boat arrived the passengers poured out and the usual bustle ensued now was the time for ben to be on the alert he scanned the outcoming passengers with an attentive eye fixing his attention upon those who were encumbered with carpetbags valises or bundles these he marked out as his possible patrons and accosted them professionally smash yer baggage sir he said to a gentleman carrying a valise the latter stared hard at ben evidently misunderstanding him and answered irascibly confound your impudence boy what do you mean smash yer baggage sir if you smash my baggage ill smash your head thank you sir for your kind offer but my head aint insured said ben who saw the joke and enjoyed it look here boy said the puzzled traveller what possible good would it do you to smash my baggage thats the way i make a livin said ben do you mean to say any persons are foolish enough to pay you for destroying their baggage you must be crazy or else you must think i am not destroying it smashin it whats the difference here a person who had listened to the conversation with some amusement interposed if you will allow me to explain sir the boy only proposes to carry your valise he is what we call a baggagesmasher and carrying it is called smashing indeed thats a very singular expression to use well my lad i think i understand you now you have no hostile intentions then nary a one answered ben then i may see fit to employ you of course you know the way everywhere yes sir you may take my valise as far as broadway there i shall take a stage ben took the valise and raising it to his shoulders was about to precede his patron you can walk along by my side said the gentleman i want to talk to you all right governor said ben im ready for an interview how do you like baggagesmashing as you call it i like it pretty well when im workin for a liberal gentleman like you said ben shrewdly what makes you think i am liberal asked the gentleman smiling i can tell by your face answered our hero but you get disappointed sometimes dont you yes sometimes ben admitted tell me some of your experiences that way last week said ben i carried a bag and a thunderin heavy one from the norwich boat to frenchs hotel a mile and a half i guess it was and how much do you think the man paid me twentyfive cents yes he did but he didnt want to all he offered me first was ten cents thats rather poor pay i dont think i should want to work for that myself you couldnt live very high on such pay said ben i have worked as cheap though you have said ben surprised yes my lad i was a poor boy once as poor as you are where did you live asked ben interested in a country town in new england my father died early and i was left alone in the world so i hired myself out to a farmer for a dollar a week and board i had to be up at five every morning and work all day my wages you see amounted to only about sixteen cents a day and board for twelve hours work why didnt you run away inquired ben i didnt know where to run to i spose you aint workin for that now said our hero no ive been promoted said the gentleman smiling of course i got higher pay as i grew older still at twentyone i found myself with only two hundred dollars i worked a year longer till it became three hundred and then i went out west to ohio where i took up a quartersection of land and became a farmer on my own account since then ive dipped into several things have bought more land which has increased in value on my hands till now i am probably worth fifty thousand dollars im glad of it said ben why because you can afford to pay me liberal for smashin your baggage what do you call liberal inquired his patron smiling fifty cents answered ben promptly then i will be liberal now suppose you tell me something about yourself how long have you been a baggagesmasher as you call it six years said ben you must have begun young how old are you now sixteen youll soon be a man what do you intend to do then i havent thought much about it said ben with truth you dont mean to carry baggage all your life do you i guess not answered ben when i get to be old and infirm im goin into some light genteel employment such as keepin a street stand so that is your highest ambition is it asked the stranger i dont think ive got any ambition said ben as long as i make a livin i dont mind when you see welldressed gentlemen walking down broadway or riding in their carriages dont you sometimes think it would be agreeable if you could be in their place i should like to have a lot of money said ben i wouldnt mind bein the president of a bank or a railwaydirector or somethin of that kind i am afraid you have never thought seriously upon the subject of your future said bens companion or you wouldnt be satisfied with your present business what else can i do id rather smash baggage than sell papers or black boots i would not advise either ill tell you what you ought to do my young friend you should leave the city and come out west ill give you something to do on one of my farms and promote you as you are fit for it youre very kind said ben more seriously but i shouldnt like it why not i dont want to leave the city here theres somethin goin on id miss the streets and the crowds id get awful lonesome in the country isnt it better to have a good home in the country than to live as you do in the city i like it well enough said ben were a jolly crowd and we do as we please there aint nobody to order us round cept the copps and they let us alone unless we steal or something of that kind so you are wedded to your city life yes i guess so though i dont remember when the weddin took place and you prefer to live on in your old way yes sir thank you all the same you may change your mind some time my lad if you ever do and will write to me at b ohio i will send for you to come out here is my card thank you sir said ben ill keep the card and if ever i change my mind ill let you know they had been walking slowly or they would have reached broadway sooner they had now arrived there and the stranger bade ben goodby handing him at the same time the fifty cents agreed upon hes a brick ben soliloquized even if he did say hed smash my head i hope ill meet some more like him bens objection to leaving the city is felt in an equal degree by many boys who are situated like himself street life has its privations and actual sufferings but for all that there is a wild independence and freedom from restraint about it which suits those who follow it to be at the beck and call of no one to be responsible only to themselves provided they keep from violating the law has a charm to these young outcasts then again they become accustomed to the street and its varied scenes and the daily excitement of life in a large city becomes such a matter of necessity to them that they find the country lonesome yet under the auspices of the childrens aid society companies of boys are continually being sent out to the great west with the happiest results after a while the first loneliness wears away and they become interested in the new scenes and labors to which they are introduced and a large number have already grown up to hold respectable and in some cases prominent places in the communities which they have joined others have pined for the city until they could no longer resist their yearning for it and have found their way back to the old familiar scenes to resume the former life of suffering and privation such is the strange fascination which their lawless and irresponsible mode of life oftentimes exerts upon the minds of these young arabs of the street when ben parted from the passenger by the albany boat he did not immediately seek another job accustomed as he was to live from hand to mouth he had never troubled himself much about accumulating more than would answer his immediate needs some boys in the lodging house made deposits in the bank of that institution but frugality was not one of bens virtues as long as he came out even at the end of the day he felt very well satisfied generally he went penniless to bed his business not being one that required him to reserve money for capital to carry it on in the case of a newsboy it was different he must keep enough on hand to buy a supply of papers in the morning even if he were compelled to go to bed supperless with fifty cents in his pocket ben felt rich it would buy him a good supper besides paying for his lodging at the newsboys home and a ticket for the old bowery besides that is a fifteencent ticket which according to the arrangement of that day would admit him to one of the bestlocated seats in the house that is in the pit corresponding to what is known as the parquette in other theatres this arrangement has now been changed so that the street boys find themselves banished to the upper gallery of their favorite theatre but in the days of which i am speaking they made themselves conspicuous in the front rows and were by no means bashful in indicating their approbation or disapprobation of the different actors who appeared on the boards before them ben had not gone far when he fell in with an acquaintance barney flynn where you goin ben inquired barney goin to get some grub answered ben im with you then i havent eat anything since mornin and im awful hungry have you got any stamps ive got a fifty so have i where are you goin for supper to pats i guess all right ill go with you the establishment known as pats is located in a basement in nassau street as the reader of mark the match boy will remember it is of coarse a cheap restaurant and is considerably frequented by the street boys who here find themselves more welcome guests than at some of the more pretentious eatinghouses ben and barney entered and gave their orders for a substantial repast the style in which the meal was served differed considerably from the service at delmonicos but it is doubtful whether any of the guests at the famous uptown restaurant enjoyed their meal any better than the two street boys each of whom was blest with a healthy appetite barney had eaten nothing since morning and bens fast had only been broken by the eating of a twocent apple which had not been sufficient to satisfy his hunger notwithstanding the liberality of their orders however each of the boys found himself at the end of the meal the possessor of twentyfive cents this was not a very large sum to sleep on but it was long since either had waked up in the morning with so large a capital to commence operations upon what shall we do asked ben suppose we go to the old bowery suggested barney or tony pastors amended ben i like the bowery best theres a great fight and a feller gets killed on the stage its a stunnin old play then let us go said ben who as well as his companion liked the idea of witnessing a stage fight which was all the more attractive on account of having a fatal termination as the theatre tickets would cost but fifteen cents each the boys felt justified in purchasing each a cheap cigar which they smoked as they walked leisurely up chatham street chapter xv the room under the wharf it was at a late hour when the boys left the theatre the play had been of a highly sensational character and had been greeted with enthusiastic applause on the part of the audience particularly the occupants of the pit now as they emerged from the portals of the theatre various characteristic remarks of a commendatory character were interchanged howd you like it ben asked barney bully said ben i liked the fight best said barney jones give it to him just about right yes that was good said ben but i liked it best where alphonso says to montmorency caitiff beware or by the heavens above my trusty sword shall drink thy foul hearts blood ben gave this with the stage emphasis so far as he could imitate it barney listened admiringly i say ben he replied you did that bully youd make a tiptop actor would i said ben complacently i think id like to try it if i knew enough how much money have you got barney nary a red i spent the last on peanuts just my case well have to find some place to turn in for the night i know a place said barney if theyll let us in whereabouts is it down to dover street wharf what sort of a place is it there aint any boxes or old wagons are there no its under the wharf a bully place under the wharf its wet isnt it no you just come along ill show you having no other place to suggest ben accepted his companions guidance and the two made their way by the shortest route to the wharf named it is situated not far from fulton ferry on the east side it may be called a double wharf as originally built it was found too low for the class of vessels that used it and another flooring was built over the first leaving a considerable space between the two its capabilities for a private rendezvous occurred to a few boys who forthwith proceeded to avail themselves of it it was necessary to carry on their proceedings secretly otherwise there was danger of interference from the city police what steps they took to make their quarters comfortable will shortly be described when they reached the wharf barney looked about him with an air of caution which ben observed what are you scared of asked ben we mustnt let the copp see us said barney dont make no noise thus admonished ben followed his companion with as little noise as possible how do you get down there he asked ill show you said barney he went to the end of the wharf and motioning ben to look over showed him a kind of ladder formed by nailing strips of wood at regular intervals from the outer edge down to the waters edge this was not an arrangement of the boys but was for the accommodation of riverboats landing at the wharf ill go down first whispered barney if the copp comes along move off so he wont notice nothin all right said ben barney got part way down the ladder when a head was protruded from below and a voice demanded whos there its i barney flynn come along then ive got a fellow with me continued barney who is it its ben the baggagesmasher he wants to stop here tonight all right we can trust him come along ben barney called up the ladder ben quickly commenced the descent barney was waiting for him and held out his hand to help him off our hero stepped from the ladder upon the lower flooring of the wharf and looked about him with some curiosity it was certainly a singular spectacle that met his view about a dozen boys were congregated in the room under the wharf and had evidently taken some pains to make themselves comfortable a carpet of good size was spread over a portion of the flooring upon this three beds were spread each occupied by three boys those who could not be accommodated in this way laid on the carpet some of the boys were already asleep two were smoking and conversing in a low voice looking about him ben recognized acquaintances in several of thema is that you mike sweeny he asked of a boy stretched out on the nearest bed yes said mike come and lay alongside of me there was no room on the bed but ben found space beside it on the carpet and accordingly stretched himself out a the description of the room under the wharf and the circumstances of its occupation by a company of street boys are not imaginary it was finally discovered and broken up by the police the details being given at the time in the daily papers as some of my new york readers will remember discovery did not take place however until it had been occupied some time how do you like it asked mike tiptop said ben howd you get the carpet and beds did you buy em yes said mike with a wink but the man wasnt in and we didnt pay for em you stole them then we took em said mike who had an objection to the word stole how did you get them down here without the copp seein you we hid em away in the daytime and didnt bring em here till night we came near gettin caught how long have you been down here most a month its a good place yes said mike and the rent is very reasonable we dont have to pay nothin for lodgin its cheapern the lodge thats so said ben im sleepy he said gaping ive been to the old bowery tonight goodnight goodnight in five minutes ben was fast asleep half an hour later and not a sound was heard in the room under the wharf except the occasional deep breathing of some of the boys the policeman who trod his beat near by little suspected that just at hand and almost under his feet was a rendezvous of street vagrants and juvenile thieves for such i am sorry to say was the character of some of the boys who frequented these cheap lodgings in addition to the articles already described there were two or three chairs which had been contributed by different members of the organization ben slept soundly through the night when he woke up the gray morning light entering from the open front towards the sea had already lighted up indistinctly the space between the floors two or three of the boys were already sitting up yawning and stretching themselves after their nights slumber among these was mike sweeny are you awake ben he asked yes said ben i didnt hardly know where i was at first its a bully place isnt it thats so howd you come across it oh some of us boys found it out weve been sleepin here a month wont you let a feller in we might let you in ill speak to the boys id like to sleep here said ben its a good deal better than sleepin out round who runs the hotel well im one of em you might call it sweenys hotel suggested ben laughing i aint the boss jim bagleys got most to do with it which is he thats he over on the next bed what does he do hes a travellin match merchant that sounds big jims smart he is he makes more moneyn any of us where does he travel once he went to californy in the steamer he got a steerage ticket for seventyfive dollars but he made moren that blackin boots for the other passengers afore they got there he stayed there three months and then came home does he travel now yes he buys a lot of matches and goes up the river or down into jersey and is gone a week a little while ago he went to buffalo oh yes i know where that is blest if i do its in the western part of york state just across from canada who told you i learned it in school i didnt know you was a scholar ben i aint now ive forgot most all i ever knew i havent been to school since i was ten years old where was that in the country well i never went to school moren a few weeks i can read a little but not much it costs a good deal to go to buffalo how did jim make it while he was gone oh he came home with ten dollars in his pocket besides payin his expenses what does jim do with all his money hes got a mother and sister up in bleecker street or somewheres round there he pays his mother five dollars a week besides takin care of himself why dont he live with his mother hed rather be round with the boys i may remark here that jim bagley is a real character and all that has been said about him is derived from information given by himself in a conversation held with him at the newsboys lodging house he figures here however under an assumed name partly because the record in which his real name is preserved has been mislaid the impression made upon the mind of the writer was that jim had unusual business ability and selfreliance and might possibly develop into a successful and prosperous man of business jim by this time was awake jim bagley said mike heres a feller would like to put up at our hotel who is he asked jim the travelling match merchant as mike had described him was a boy of fifteen rather small of his age with a keen black eye and a quick decided businesslike way its this feller hes a baggagesmasher explained mike all right said jim he can come if hell pay his share how much is it asked ben mike explained that it was expected of each guest to bring something that would add to the comforts of the rendezvous two boys had contributed the carpet for which probably they had paid nothing jim had supplied a bed for which he did pay as taking things without leave was not in his line three boys had each contributed a chair thus all the articles which had been accumulated were individual contributions ben promised to pay his admission fee in the same way but expressed a doubt whether he might not have to wait a few days in order to save money enough to make a purchase he never stole himself though his association with street boys whose principles are not always very strict on this point had accustomed him to regard theft as a venial fault provided it was not found out for his own part however he did not care to run the risk of detection though he had cut himself off from his old home he still felt that he should not like to have the report reach home that he had been convicted of dishonesty at an early hour the boys shook off their slumbers and one by one left the wharf to enter upon their daily work the newsboys were the first to go as they must be on hand at the newspaper offices early to get their supply of papers and fold them in readiness for early customers the bootblacks soon followed as most of them were under the necessity of earning their breakfast before they ate it ben also got up early and made his way to the pier of the stonington line of steamers from boston these usually arrived at an early hour and there was a good chance of a job in bens line when the passengers landed chapter xvi ben meets an old friend ben had about half an hour to wait for the arrival of the steamer among the passengers who crossed the plank from the steamer to the pier was a gentleman of middle age and a boy about a year younger than ben the boy had a carpetbag in his hand the father for such appeared to be the relationship carried a heavy valise besides a small bundle want your baggage carried asked ben varying his usual address the gentleman hesitated a moment youd better let him take it father said the boy very well you may take this and the valise was passed over to ben give me the bag too said ben addressing the boy no ill take that youll have all you want to do in carrying the valise they crossed the street and here the gentleman stood still evidently undecided about something what are you thinking about father i was thinking the gentleman said after a slight pause what i had better do about what i have two or three errands in the lower part of the city which as my time is limited i should like to attend to at once you had better do it then what i was thinking was that it would not be worth while for you to go round with me carrying the baggage couldnt i go right up to cousin marys asked his son i am afraid you might lose the way this boy will go with me i suppose he knows the way all about the city dont you he asked turning to ben where do you want to go asked ben to no madison avenue yes i can show you the way there well enough but its a good way off you can both take the cars or stage when you get up to the astor house how will that do asked charles for this was his name i think that will be the best plan this boy can go with you and you can settle with him for his services have you got money enough yes plenty i will leave you here then left to themselves it was natural that the two boys should grow social so far as clothing went there was certainly a wide difference between them ben was attired as described in the first chapter charles on the other hand wore a short sack of dark cloth a white vest and gray pants a gold chain depending from his watchpocket showed that he was the possessor of a watch his whole appearance was marked by neatness and good taste but leaving out this difference a keen observer might detect a considerable resemblance in the features of the two boys both had dark hair black eyes and the contour of the face was the same i regret to add however that bens face was not so clean as it ought to have been among the articles contributed by the boys who lived in the room under the wharf a washstand had not been considered necessary and it had been long since ben had regarded washing the face and hands as the first preparation for the labors of the day charles marston looked at his companion with some interest and curiosity he had never lived in new york and there was a freshness and novelty about life in the metropolis that was attractive to him is this your business he asked what smashin baggage inquired ben is that what you call it yes well is that what you do for a living yes said ben its my profession when i aint attendin to my duties as a member of the common council so youre a member of the city government asked charles amused yes do you have much to do that way im one of the committee on wharves said ben its my business to see that theyre right side up with care likewise that nobody runs away with them in the night how do you get paid well i earn my lodgin that way just now said ben have you always been in this business no sometimes ive sold papers how did you like that i like baggagesmashin best when i get enough to do you dont live in the city do you no i live just out of boston a few miles ever been in new york before once that was four years ago i passed through on the way from pennsylvania where i used to live pennsylvania repeated ben beginning to be interested whereabouts did you live there in philadelphy no a little way from there in a small town named cedarville ben started and he nearly let fall the valise from his hand whats the matter asked charles i came near fallin said ben a little confused whats your name he asked rather abruptly charles marston ben scanned intently the face of his companion he had good reason to do so for though charles little suspected that there was any relationship between himself and the ragged and dirty boy who carried his valise the two were own cousins they had been schoolmates in cedarville and passed many a merry hour together in boyish sport in fact charles had been bens favorite playmate as well as cousin and many a time when he lay awake in such chance lodgings as the street provided he had thought of his cousin and wished that he might meet him again now they had met most strangely no longer on terms of equality but one with all the outward appearance of a young gentleman the other a ragged and ignorant street boy bens heart throbbed painfully when he saw that his cousin regarded him as a stranger and for the first time in a long while he felt ashamed of his position he would not for the world have revealed himself to charles in his present situation yet he felt a strong desire to learn whether he was still remembered how to effect this without betraying his identity he hardly knew at length he thought of a way that might lead to it my names shortern yours he said what is it asked charles its ben that stands for benjamin so yours is the longest after all thats so i never thought of that everybody calls me ben whats your other name ben hesitated if he said brandon he would be discovered and his pride stood in the way of that finally he determined to give a false name so he answered after a slight pause which charles did not notice my other name is hooper ben hooper didnt you ever know anybody of my name what ben hooper no ben yes i had a cousin named ben is he as old as you asked ben striving to speak carelessly he is older if he is living but i dont think he is living why dont you know he ran away from home when he was ten years old and we have never seen him since didnt he write where he had gone he wrote one letter to his mother but he didnt say where he was that is the last any of us heard from him what sort of a chap was he inquired ben he was a bad un wasnt he no ben wasnt a bad boy he had a quick temper though but whenever he was angry he soon got over it what made him run away from home his father punished him for something he didnt do he found it out afterwards but he is a stern man and he never says anything about him but i guess he feels bad sometimes father says he has grown old very fast since my cousin ran away is his mother living your aunt ben inquired drawn on by an impulse he could not resist yes but she is always sad she has never stopped mourning for ben did you like your cousin ben asked looking wistfully in the face of his companion yes he was my favorite cousin poor ben and i were always together i wish i knew whether he were alive or not perhaps you will see him again some time i dont know i used to think so but i have about given up hopes of it it is six years now since he ran away maybe hes turned bad said ben sposin he was a ragged baggagesmasher like me you wouldnt care about seein him would you yes i would said charles warmly id be glad to see ben again no matter how he looked or how poor he might be ben looked at his cousin with a glance of wistful affection street boy as he was old memories had been awakened and his heart had been touched by the sight of the cousin whom he had most loved when a young boy and i might be like him thought ben looking askance at the rags in which he was dressed instead of a walkin ragbag i wish i was and he suppressed a sigh it has been said that street boys are not accessible to the softer emotions but ben did long to throw his arm round his cousins neck in the old affectionate way of six years since it touched him to think that charlie held him in affectionate remembrance but his thoughts were diverted by noticing that they had reached the astor house i guess wed better cross the street and take the fourth avenue cars he said theres one over there all right said charles i suppose you know best there was a car just starting they succeeded in getting aboard and were speedily on their up town chapter xvii ben forms a resolution does this car go up madison avenue asked charles after they had taken their seats no said ben it goes up fourth avenue but thats only one block away from madison well get out at thirtieth street im glad youre with me i might have a hard time finding the place if i were alone are you going to stay in the city long asked ben yes i am going to school here father is going to move here soon until he comes i shall stay with my cousin mary ben felt quite sure that this must be his older sister but did not like to ask is she married yes it is the sister of my cousin ben about two years ago she married a new york gentleman he is a broker and has an office in wall street i suppose hes rich whats his name asked ben maybe ive seen his office it is abercrombie james abercrombie did you ever hear that name no answered ben i cant say as i have he aint the broker that does my business have you much business for a broker asked charles laughing i do a smashin business in erie and new york central answered ben you are in the same business as the railroads said charles how is that you are both baggagesmashers thats so only i dont charge so much for smashin baggage as they do they were on centre street now and a stone building with massive stone columns came in view on the west side of the street what building is that asked charles thats a hotel where they lodge people free gratis charles looked at his companion for information its the tombs said ben it aint so popular though as the hotels where they charge higher no i suppose not it looks gloomy enough it aint very cheerful said ben i never put up there but thats what people say that have enjoyed that privilege where is the bowery well soon be in it we turn off centre street a little farther up charles was interested in all that he saw the broad avenue which is known as the bowery with its long line of shops on either side and the liberal display of goods on the sidewalk attracted his attention and he had numerous questions to ask most of which ben was able to answer he had not knocked about the streets of new york six years for nothing his business had carried him to all parts of the city and he had acquired a large amount of local information a part of which he retailed now to his cousin as they rode side by side in the horsecars at length they reached thirtieth street and here they got out at the distance of one block they found madison avenue examining the numbers they readily found the house of which they were in search it was a handsome fourstory house with a brownstone front this must be mr abercrombies house said charles i didnt think cousin mary lived in such a nice place ben surveyed the house with mingled emotions he could not help contrasting his own forlorn neglected condition with the position of his sister she lived in an elegant home enjoying no doubt all the advantages which money could procure while he her only brother walked about the streets in rags sleeping in any outoftheway corner but he could blame no one for it it had been his own choice and until this morning he had been well enough contented with it but all at once a glimpse had been given him of what might have been his lot had he been less influenced by pride and waywardness and by the light of this new prospect he saw how little hope there was of achieving any decent position in society if he remained in his present occupation but what could he do should he declare himself at once to his cousin and his sister pride would not permit him to do it he was not willing to let them see him in his ragged and dirty state he determined to work and save up money until he could purchase a suit as handsome as that which his cousin wore then he would not be ashamed to present himself so far as his outward appearance went he knew very well that he was ignorant but he must trust to the future to remedy that deficiency it would be a work of time as he well knew meanwhile he had his cousins assurance that he would be glad to meet him again and renew the old affectionate intimacy which formerly existed between them while these thoughts were passing through bens mind as i have said they reached the house have you had any breakfast asked charles as they ascended the steps not yet answered ben it isnt fashionable to take breakfast early then you must come in my cousin will give you some breakfast ben hesitated but finally decided to accept the invitation he had two reasons for this partly because it would give him an opportunity to see his sister and secondly because it would save him the expense of buying his breakfast elsewhere and that was a consideration now that he had a special object for saving money is mrs abercrombie at home asked charles of the servant who answered his summons yes sir who shall i say is here her cousin charles montrose will you walk into the parlor said the servant opening a door at the side of the hall she looked doubtfully at ben who had also entered the house sit down here ben said charles indicating a chair on one side of the hatstand ill stop here till mrs abercrombie comes down he said soon a light step was heard on the stairs and mrs abercrombie descended the staircase she is the same that we last saw in the modest house in the pennsylvania village but the lapse of time has softened her manners and the influence of a husband and a home have improved her but otherwise she has not greatly changed in her looks ben who examined her face eagerly recognized her at once yes it was his sister mary that stood before him he would have known her anywhere but there was a special mark by which he remembered her there was a dent in her cheek just below the temple the existence of which he could account for in a fit of boyish passion occasioned by her teasing him he had flung a stick of wood at her head and this had led to the mark where did you come from charles she said giving her hand cordially to her young cousin from boston cousin mary have you just arrived and where is your father you did not come on alone did you no father is with me or rather he came on with me but he had some errands down town and stopped to attend to them he will be here soon how did you find the way alone i was not alone there is my guide by the way i told him to stay and you would give him some breakfast certainly he can go down in the basement and the servants will give him something mrs abercrombie looked at ben as she spoke but on her part there was no sign of recognition this was not strange a boy changes greatly between ten and sixteen years of age and when to this natural change is added the great change in bens dress it will not be wondered at that his sister saw in him only an ordinary street boy ben was relieved to find that he was not known he had felt afraid that something in his looks might remind his sister of her lost brother but the indifferent look which she turned upon him proved that he had no ground for this fear you have not breakfasted i suppose charles said his cousin you wouldnt think so if you knew what an appetite i have he answered laughing we will do our best to spoil it said mrs abercrombie she rang the bell and ordered breakfast to be served we are a little late this morning she said mr abercrombie is in philadelphia on business so you wont see him till tomorrow when the servant appeared mrs abercrombie directed her to take ben downstairs and give him something to eat dont go away till i see you ben said charles lingering a little all right said ben he followed the servant down the stairs leading to the basement on the way he had a glimpse through the halfopen door of the breakfasttable at which his sister and his cousin were shortly to sit down some time perhaps i shall be invited in there he said to himself but at present he had no such wish he knew that in his ragged garb he would be out of place in the handsome breakfastroom and he preferred to wait until his appearance was improved he had no fault to find with the servants who brought him a bountiful supply of beefsteak and bread and butter and a cup of excellent coffee ben had been up long enough to have quite an appetite besides the quality of the breakfast was considerably superior to those which he was accustomed to take in the cheap restaurants which he frequented and he did full justice to the food that was spread before him when he had satisfied his appetite he had a few minutes to wait before charles came down to speak to him well ben i hope you had a good breakfast he said tiptop answered ben and i hope also that you had an appetite equal to mine my appetite dont often give out said ben but it aint so good now as it was when i came in now we have a little business to attend to how much shall i pay you for smashing my baggage charles asked with a laugh whatever you like well heres fifty cents for your services and six cents for your carfare back thank you said ben besides this mrs abercrombie has a note which she wants carried down town to her husbands office in wall street she will give you fifty cents more if you will agree to deliver it there at once as it is of importance all right said ben ill do it here is the note i suppose you had better start with it at once goodmorning goodmorning said ben as he held his cousins proffered hand a moment in his own maybe ill see you again some time i hope so said charles kindly a minute later ben was on his way to take a fourth avenue car down town chapter xviii luck and ill luck that will do very well for a beginning thought ben as he surveyed with satisfaction the two half dollars which he had received for his mornings services he determined to save one of them towards the fund which he hoped to accumulate for the object which he had in view how much he would need he could not decide but thought that it would be safe to set the amount at fifty dollars this would doubtless require a considerable time to obtain he could not expect to be so fortunate every day as he had been this morning some days no doubt he would barely earn enough to pay expenses still he had made a beginning and this was something gained it was still more encouraging that he had determined to save money and had an inducement to do so as ben rode down town in the horsecars he thought of the six years which he had spent as a new york street boy and he could not help feeling that the time had been wasted so far as any progress or improvement was concerned of books he knew less than when he first came to the city he knew more of life indeed but not the best side of life he had formed some bad habits from which he would probably have been saved if he had remained at home ben realized all at once how much he had lost by his hasty action in leaving home he regarded his street life with different eyes and felt ready to give it up as soon as he could present himself to his parents without too great a sacrifice of his pride at the end of half an hour ben found himself at the termination of the car route opposite the lower end of the city hall park as the letter which he had to deliver was to be carried to wall street he kept on down broadway till he reached trinity church and then turned into the street opposite he quickly found the number indicated and entered mr abercrombies office it was a handsome office on the lower floor two or three clerks were at work at their desks so this is my brotherinlaws office thought ben its rather better than mine well young man what can i do for you today inquired a clerk in a tone which indicated that he thought ben had got into the wrong shop you can tell me whether your name is sampson answered ben coolly no it isnt thats what i thought suppose i am not what then then the letter ive got isnt for you thats all so youve got a letter have you thats what i said it seems to me youre mighty independent sneered the clerk who felt aggrieved that ben did not show him the respect which he conceived to be his due thank you for the compliment said ben bowing you can hand me the letter i thought your name wasnt sampson ill hand it to mr sampson hes gone out a moment hell be in directly much obliged said ben but id rather hand it to mr sampson myself business aint particularly pressin this mornin so if youll hand me the mornin paper ill read till he comes well youve got cheek ejaculated the clerk ive got two of em if i counted right when i got up said ben here there was a laugh from the other two clerks hes too smart for you granby said one hes impudent enough muttered the first as he withdrew discomfited to his desk the enemy having retreated ben sat down in an armchair and picking up a paper began to read he had not long to wait five minutes had scarcely passed when a man of middle age entered the office his manner showed that he belonged there if youre mr sampson said ben approaching him here is a letter for you that is my name said the gentleman opening the note at once you come from mrs abercrombie he said glancing at ben as he finished reading it yes sir said ben how did she happen to select you as her messenger i went up there this morning to carry a valise i have a great mind to send you back to her with an answer but i hesitate on one account what is that asked ben i dont know whether you can be trusted nor i said ben but im willin to run the risk no doubt said mr sampson smiling but it seems to me that i should run a greater risk than you i dont know about that answered ben if its money and i keep it you can send the copps after me and ill be sent to the island that would be worse than losing money thats true but some of you boys dont mind that however i am inclined to trust you mrs abercrombie asks for a sum of money and wishes me to send it up by one of the clerks that i cannot very well do as we are particularly busy this morning i will put the money in an envelope and give it to you to deliver i will tell you beforehand that it is fifty dollars very good said ben ill give it to her wait a moment mr sampson went behind the desk and reappeared almost directly mrs abercrombie will give you a line to me stating that she has received the money when you return with this i will pay you for your trouble all right said ben as he left the office the young clerk first mentioned said i am afraid mr sampson mrs abercrombie will never see that money why not the boy will keep it what makes you think so hes one of the most impudent young rascals i ever saw i didnt form that opinion he was respectful enough to me he wasnt to me mr sampson smiled a little he had observed young granbys assumption of importance and partly guessed how matters stood its too late to recall him he said i must run the risk my own opinion is that he will prove faithful ben had accepted the commission gladly not alone because he would get extra pay for the additional errand but because he saw that there was some hesitation in the mind of mr sampson about trusting him and he meant to show himself worthy of confidence there were fifty dollars in the envelope he had never before been trusted with that amount of money and now it was rather because no other messenger could be conveniently sent that he found himself so trusted not a thought of appropriating the money came to ben true it occurred to him that this was precisely the sum which he needed to fit him out respectably but there would be greater cause for shame if he appeared well dressed on stolen money than if he should present himself in rags to his sister however it is only just to ben to say that had the party to whom he was sent been different he would have discharged his commission honorably not that he was a model boy but his pride which was in some respects a fault with him here served him in good stead as it made him ashamed to do a dishonest act ben rightly judged that the money would be needed as soon as possible and as the distance was great he resolved to ride trusting to mr sampsons liberality to pay him for the expense which he would thus incur in addition to the compensation allowed for his services he once more made his way to the station of the fourth avenue cars and jumped aboard one just ready to start the car gradually filled and they commenced their progress up town ben took a seat in the corner next to the door next to him was a man with black hair and black whiskers he wore a tall felt hat with a bell crown and a long cloak ben took no particular notice of him being too much in the habit of seeing strange faces to observe them minutely the letter he put in the side pocket of his coat on the side nearest the stranger he took it out once to look at it it was addressed to mrs abercrombie at her residence and in one corner mr sampson had written money enclosed now it chanced though ben did not suspect it that the man at his side was a member of the swell mob and his main business was picking pockets he observed the two words already quoted on the envelope when ben took it in his hand and he made up his mind to get possession of it this was comparatively easy for bens pocket was on the side towards him our hero was rather careless it must be owned but it happened that the inside pocket of his coat had been torn away which left him no other receptacle for the letter besides ben had never been in a situation to have much fear of pick pockets and under ordinary circumstances he would hardly have been selected as worth plundering but the discovery that the letter contained money altered the case while ben was looking out from the opposite window across the street the stranger dexterously inserted his hand in his pocket and withdrew the letter they were at that moment just opposite the tombs having gained possession of the letter of course it was his interest to get out of the car as soon as possible since ben was liable at any moment to discover his loss he touched the conductor who was just returning from the other end of the car after collecting the fares ill get out here he said the conductor accordingly pulled the strap and the car stopped the stranger gathered his cloak about him and stepping out on the platform jumped from the car just at that moment ben put his hand into his pocket and instantly discovered the loss of the letter he immediately connected it with the departure of his fellowpassenger and with a hasty ejaculation sprang from the car and started in pursuit of him chapter xix which is the guilty party it was an exciting moment for ben he felt that his character for honesty was at stake in case the pickpocket succeeded in getting off with the letter and money mr sampson would no doubt come to the conclusion that he had appropriated the fifty dollars to his own use while his story of the robbery would be regarded as an impudent fabrication he might even be arrested and sentenced to the island for theft if this should happen though he were innocent ben felt that he should not be willing to make himself known to his sister or his parents but there was a chance of getting back the money and he resolved to do his best the pickpocket turned down a side street his object being to get out of the range of observation as soon as possible but one thing he did not anticipate and this was bens immediate discovery of his loss on this subject he was soon enlightened he saw ben jump from the horsecar and his first impulse was to run he made a quick movement in advance and then paused it occurred to him that he occupied a position of advantage with regard to his accuser being respectably dressed while ben was merely a ragged street boy whose word probably would not inspire much confidence this vantage ground he would give up by having recourse to flight as this would be a virtual acknowledgment of guilt he resolved instantaneously to assume an attitude of conscious integrity and frown down upon ben from the heights of assumed respectability there was one danger however that he was known to some of the police force in his true character but he must take the risk of recognition on landing in the middle of the street ben lost no time but running up to the pickpocket caught him by the arm what do you want boy he demanded in a tone of indifference i want my money said ben i dont understand you said the pickpocket loftily look here mister said ben impatiently you know well enough what i mean you took a letter with money in it out of my pocket just hand it back and i wont say anything about it youre an impudent young rascal returned the gentleman affecting to be outraged by such a charge do you dare to accuse a gentleman like me of robbing a ragmuffin like you yes i do said ben boldly then youre either crazy or impudent i dont know which call me what you please but give me back my money i dont believe you ever had five dollars in your possession how much do you mean to say there was in this letter fifty dollars answered ben the pickpocket had an object in asking this question he wanted to learn whether the sum of money was sufficient to make it worth his while to keep it had it been three or four dollars he might have given it up to avoid risk and trouble but on finding that it was fifty dollars he determined to hold on to it at all hazards clear out boy he said fiercely i shant stand any of your impudence give me my money then if you dont stop that ill knock you down repeated the pickpocket shaking off bens grasp and moving forward rapidly if he expected to frighten our hero away thus easily he was very much mistaken ben had too much at stake to give up the attempt to recover the letter he ran forward and seizing the man by the arm he reiterated in a tone of firm determination give me my money or ill call a copp take that you young villain exclaimed the badgered thief bringing his fist in contact with bens face in such a manner as to cause the blood to flow in a physical contest it was clear that ben would get the worst of it he was but a boy of sixteen strong indeed of his age but still what could he expect to accomplish against a tall man of mature age he saw that he needed help and he called out at the top of his lungs help police his antagonist was adroit and a life spent in eluding the law had made him quickwitted he turned the tables upon ben by turning round grasping him firmly by the arm and repeating in a voice louder than bens help police contrary to the usual custom in such cases a policeman happened to be near and hurried to the spot where he was apparently wanted whats the row he asked before ben had time to prefer his charge the pickpocket said glibly policeman i give this boy in charge whats he been doing i caught him with his hand in my pocket said the man hes a thieving young vagabond thats a lie exclaimed ben rather startled at the unexpected turn which affairs had taken hes a pickpocket the real culprit shrugged his shoulders you aint quite smart enough boy he said has he taken anything of yours asked the policeman who supposed ben to be what he was represented no said the pickpocket but he came near taking a money letter which i have in my pocket here with astonishing effrontery he displayed the letter which he had stolen from ben thats my letter said ben he took it from my pocket a likely story smiled the pickpocket in serene superiority the letter is for mrs abercrombie a friend of mine and contains fifty dollars i incautiously wrote upon the envelope money enclosed which attracted the attention of this young vagabond as i held it in my hand on replacing it in my pocket he tried to get possession of it thats a lie from beginning to end exclaimed ben impetuously hes tryin to make me out a thief when hes one himself well what is your story asked the policeman who however had already decided in his own mind that ben was the guilty party i was ridin in the fourth avenue cars along side of this man said ben when he put his hand in my pocket and took out the letter that hes just showed you i jumped out after him and asked him to give it back when he fetched me a lick in the face do you mean to say that a ragamuffin like you had fifty dollars demanded the thief no said ben the money wasnt mine i was carryin it up to mrs abercrombie who lives on madison avenue its a likely story that a ragamuffin like you would be trusted with so much money if you dont believe it said ben go to mr abercrombies office in wall street mr sampson gave it to me only a few minutes ago if he says he didnt just carry me to the stationhouse as quick as you want to this confident assertion of bens put matters in rather a different light it seemed straightforward and the reference might easily prove which was the real culprit the pickpocket saw that the officer wavered and rejoined hastily you must expect the officers a fool to believe your ridiculous story its not so ridiculous answered the policeman scrutinizing the speaker with sudden suspicion i am not sure but the boy is right im willing to let the matter drop said the pickpocket magnanimously as he didnt succeed in getting my money i will not prosecute you may let him go mr officer not so fast said the policeman his suspicions of the other party getting stronger and more clearly defined i havent any authority to do as you say very well take him along then i suppose the law must take its course yes it must very well boy im sorry youve got into such a scrape but its your own fault good morning officer youre in too much of a hurry said the policeman coolly you must go along with me too really said the thief nervously i hope youll excuse me ive got an important engagement this morning and i in fact it will be excessively inconvenient im sorry to put you to inconvenience but it cant be helped really mr officer its no use i shall need you oblige me by handing me that letter here it is said the thief unwillingly surrendering it really its excessively provoking id rather lose the money than break my engagement ill promise to be on hand at the trial whenever it comes off if you keep the money it will be a guaranty of my appearance i dont know about that answered the officer as to being present at the trial i mean that you shall be of course i promised that theres one little matter you seem to forget said the officer your appearance may be quite as necessary as the boys it may be your trial and not his do you mean to insult me demanded the pickpocket haughtily not by no manner of means i aint the judge you know if your story is all right itll appear so of course but i shall have to break my engagement well that cant be helped as i see come along if you please he tucked one arm in that of the man and the other in bens and moved towards the stationhouse of the two ben seemed to be much the more unconcerned he was confident that his innocence would be proclaimed while the other was equally convinced that trouble awaited him well boy how do you like going to the stationhouse asked the policeman i dont mind as long as he goes with me answered ben what i was most afraid of was that id lose the money and then mr sampson would have taken me for a thief meanwhile the other party was rapidly getting more and more nervous he felt that he was marching to his fate and that the only way of escape was by flight and that immediate for they were very near the stationhouse just as ben pronounced the last words the thief gathered all his strength and broke from the grasp of the officer whose hold was momentarily relaxed once free he showed an astonishing rapidity the officer hesitated for an instant for he had another prisoner to guard go after him exclaimed ben eagerly dont let him escape ill stay where i am the conviction that the escaped party was the real thief determined the policeman to follow bens advice he let him go and started in rapid pursuit of the fugitive ben sat down on a doorstep and awaited anxiously the result of the chase chapter xx how all came right in the morning it is quite possible that the pickpocket would have made good his escape if he had not unluckily for himself run into another policeman beg your pardon he said hurriedly stop a minute said the officer detaining him by the arm for his appearance and haste inspired suspicion he was bareheaded for his hat had fallen off and he had not deemed it prudent to stop long enough to pick it up im in a great hurry panted the thief my youngest child is in a fit and i am running for a physician this explanation seemed plausible and the policeman who was himself the father of a family was on the point of releasing him when the first officer came up hold on to him he said hes just broken away from me thats it is it said the second policeman he told me he was after a doctor for his youngest child i think hell need a doctor himself said the first if he tries another of his games you didnt stop to say goodby my man i told you i had an important engagement said the pickpocket sulkily one that i cared more about than the money wheres the boy i had to leave him to go after you thats a pretty way to manage you let the thief go in order to chase his victim youre an ablebodied victim said the policeman laughing where are you taking me im going back for the boy he said hed wait till i returned are you green enough to think youll find him sneered the man in charge perhaps not but i shouldnt be surprised if i did if i guess right hell find it worth his while to keep his promise when they returned to the place where the thief had first effected his escape our hero was found quietly sitting on a wooden step so youve got him said ben advancing to meet the officer with evident satisfaction hes got you too growled the pickpocket why didnt you run away you little fool i didnt have anything to run for answered ben besides i want my money back then youll have to go with me to the stationhouse said the officer i wish i could go to mr abercrombies office first to tell mr sampson whats happened i cant let you do that but you may write a letter from the stationhouse all right said ben cheerfully and he voluntarily placed himself on the other side of the officer and accompanied him to the stationhouse i thought you was guilty at first said the officer but i guess your story is correct if it isnt youre about the coolest chap i ever saw and ive seen some cool ones in my day its just as i said said ben itll all come right in the morning they soon reached the stationhouse ben obtained the privilege of writing a letter to mr sampson for which the officer undertook to procure a messenger in fact he began to feel quite interested for our hero feeling fully convinced that the other party was the real offender ben found some difficulty in writing his letter when he first came to the city he could have written one with considerable ease but he had scarcely touched a pen or formed a letter for six years and of course this made an important difference however he finally managed to write these few lines with a leadpencil mr sampson i am sory i cant cary that leter til tomorrow but it was took from my pokit by a thefe wen i was ridin in the cars and as he sed i took it from him the copp has brort us both to the stashunhouse whare i hope you wil come and tel them how it was and that you give me the leter to cary for the other man says it is his the copp took the leter ben hooper it will be observed that bens spelling had suffered but this will not excite surprise considering how long it was since he had attended school it will also be noticed that he did not sign his real name but used the same which he had communicated to charles marston more than ever till he was out of his present difficulty he desired to conceal his identity from his relations meanwhile mr sampson was busily engaged in his office in wall street it may as well be explained here that he was the junior partner of mr abercrombie occasionally he paused in his business to wonder whether he had done well to expose a ragged street boy to such a temptation but he was a largehearted man inclined to think well of his fellowmen and though in his business life he had seen a good deal that was mean and selfish in the conduct of others he had never lost his confidence in human nature and never would it is better to have such a disposition even if it does expose the possessor to being imposed upon at times than to regard everybody with distrust and suspicion at any rate it promotes happiness and conciliates goodwill and these will offset an occasional deception an hour had passed when a boy presented himself at mr abercrombies office it was a newsboy who had been intrusted with bens letter this is for mr sampson he said looking around him on entering another of mr sampsons friends sneered granby in a tone which he took care should be too low to come to that gentlemans ears my name is sampson said the owner of that name who is your letter from its from ben and who is ben asked mr sampson not much enlightened its ben the baggagesmasher give it to me said the gentleman conjecturing rightly that it was his messenger who was meant he ran his eye rapidly over the paper or i should say as rapidly as the character of bens writing would permit do you come from the stationhouse he asked looking up yes sir which stationhouse is it in leonard street very well go back and tell the boy that i will call this afternoon i will also give you a line to a house on madison avenue can you go right up there calling at the stationhouse on the way yes sir very well here is something for your trouble the boy pocketed with satisfaction the money proffered him and took the letter which mr sampson hastily wrote it was to this effect my dear mrs abercrombie i received your note and despatched the money which you desired by a messenger but i have just learned that his pocket was picked on the horsecars i cannot spare one of my clerks just now but at one oclock will send one up with the money hoping that he may have better fortune than the first messenger and that you will not be seriously inconvenienced by the delay yours truly henry sampson then he dismissed the matter from his mind until afternoon when the office having closed he made his way to the leonard street stationhouse where he was speedily admitted to see ben im glad youve come mr sampson said our hero eagerly i hope you dont think i was to blame about the letter tell me how it was my lad said mr sampson kindly i dare say you can give me a satisfactory explanation ben felt grateful for the kindness of his tone he saw that he was not condemned unheard but had a chance of clearing himself he explained briefly how it occurred of course it is unnecessary to give his account for we know all about it already i believe you said mr sampson in a friendly tone the only fault i have to find with you is that you might have been more careful in guarding your pockets thats so said ben but i dont often carry anything thats worth stealing no i suppose not said mr sampson smiling well it appears that no serious loss has occurred the money will be recovered as it is in the hands of the authorities as to the delay that is merely an inconvenience but the most serious inconvenience falls upon you in your being brought here i dont mind that as long as the money is safe said ben itll all be right in the morning i see you are a philosopher i see your face is swelled you must have got a blow yes said ben the chap that took my letter left me something to remember him by i shall try to make it up to you said mr sampson i cant stop any longer but i will be present at your trial and my testimony will undoubtedly clear you he took his leave leaving ben considerably more cheerful than before a stationhouse is not a very agreeable place of detention but then ben was not accustomed to luxury and the absence of comfort did not trouble him much he cared more for the loss of his liberty finding the narrow cell somewhat too restricted for enjoyment however he consoled himself by reflecting to use his favorite phrase that it would all be right in the morning it will not be necessary to give a circumstantial account of bens trial mr sampson was faithful to his promise and presented himself somewhat to his personal inconvenience at the early hour assigned for trial his testimony was brief and explicit and cleared ben the real pickpocket however being recognized by the judge as one who had been up before him some months before charged with a similar offence was sentenced to a term of imprisonment considerably to his dissatisfaction ben left the courtroom well pleased with the result his innocence had been established and he had proved that he could be trusted or rather he had not proved faithless to his trust and he felt that with his present plans and hopes he could not afford to lose his character for honesty he knew that he had plenty of faults but at any rate he was not a thief while he stood on the steps of the tombs in which the trial had taken place mr sampson advanced towards him and touched him on the shoulder well my lad he said in a friendly manner so youre all right once more yes said ben i knew it would all be right in the morning i owe you something for the inconvenience you have suffered while in my employ here is a tendollar bill i hope you will save it till you need it and wont spend it foolishly thank you said ben joyfully ill put it in the bank that will be a good plan goodmorning when you need a friend you will know where to find me he shook bens hand in a friendly way and left him hes a trump thought ben if my fatherd treated me like that id never have wanted to run away from home chapter xxi in a new line ten dollars said ben to himself with exultation thats pretty good pay for a few hours in the stationhouse id like to board there a week on the same terms bens capital now amounted to eleven dollars but of this sum he decided to retain one dollar as a reserve to fall back upon in case of need the ten dollars he determined to deposit at once in a savingsbank he accordingly bent his steps towards one in the course of the forenoon the business was quickly transacted and ben left the building with a bankbook containing an entry of his first deposit this was a very good beginning so ben thought fifty dollars as he had estimated would enable him to carry out the plan which he proposed and he had already onefifth of the sum but the accumulation of the other forty dollars would no doubt take him a considerable time the business of a baggagesmasher as ben knew from experience is precarious the amount of gains depending partly upon luck he had sometimes haunted the steamboat landings for hours without obtaining a single job now that he was anxious to get on he felt this to be an objection he began to consider whether there was any way of adding to his income after considerable thought he decided to buy a supply of weekly papers which he could sell while waiting for a job one advantage in selecting weekly papers rather than daily was this that the latter must be sold within a few hours or they prove a dead loss a daily paper of yesterday is as unsalable as a last years almanac as ben was liable to be interrupted in his paper business at any time by a chance to carry luggage it was an important consideration to have a stock which would remain fresh for a few days this idea impressed ben so favorably that he determined to act upon it at once in considering where he should go for his supply of papers he thought of a broadway newsstand which he frequently had occasion to pass on reaching it he said to the proprietor where do you buy your papers what do you want to know for i thought maybe id go into the business you dont think of setting up a stand do you asked the man with a significant glance at bens ragged attire no said ben i havent got capital enough for that unless youll sell out for fifty cents i suppose you want a few to carry round and sell yes where do you think of going with them down to the wharves im a baggagesmasher and i thought i might make somethin by sellin papers when i hadnt any baggage to carry i get my papers from the american news company on nassau street i know the place well enough what papers do you think i could sell best asked ben the picture papers go off as fast as any said the street dealer but ill tell you what my lad maybe i can make an arrangement for you to sell papers for me i dont think id like to stand here all day said ben supposing the other to mean to engage him to tend the stand i dont mean that well said ben im open to an offer as the old maid of sixty told a feller that called to see her ill tell you what i mean ill give you a bundle of papers every morning to take with you you will sell what you can and bring back the rest at night i like that said ben with satisfaction but how much will i get it will depend on the price of the papers harpers weekly and frank leslie sell for ten cents i will allow you two cents on each of these on the ledger and weekly and other papers of that price i will allow one cent youd make rather more if you bought them yourself but you might have them left on your hands thats so said ben did you ever sell papers i used to sell the mornin and evenin papers before i went to baggagesmashin then you know something about the business when do you want to begin right off very well i will make you up a bundle of a dozen papers to begin on ill put in three each of the illustrated papers and fill up with the story papers all right mister you know better than i what people will buy the dealer began to collect the papers but paused in the middle of his task and looked doubtfully at our hero well whats up asked ben observing his hesitation how do i know but youll sell the papers and keep the money yourself said the dealer thats so said ben i never thought of that that wouldnt be very profitable for me you see ill bring back the money or the papers said ben you neednt be afraid very likely you would but how am i to know that so you dont want to trust me said ben rather disappointed have you got any money yes very well you can leave enough with me to secure me against loss and i will give you the papers how much will that be after a little thought the dealer answered seventyfive cents he had some doubt whether ben had so much but our hero quickly set his doubts at rest by drawing out his two halfdollars and demanding a quarter in change the sight of this money reassured the dealer bens ragged clothes had led him to doubt his financial soundness but the discovery that he was a capitalist to the extent of a dollar gave him considerable more respect for him a dollar may not be a very large sum i hope that to you my young reader it is a very small one and that you have never been embarrassed for the want of it but it is enough to lift a ragged street boy from the position of a penniless vagabond to that of a thrifty capitalist after seeing it the dealer would almost have felt safe in trusting ben with the papers without demanding a deposit of their value still it was better and safer to require a deposit and he therefore took the dollar from ben returning twentyfive cents in change this preliminary matter settled he made up the parcel of papers there they are he said if youre smart you can sell em all before night i hope so said ben with the papers under his arm ben made his way westward to the cortlandt street ferry which was a favorite place of resort with him he did not have long to wait for his first customer as he was walking down cortlandt street he met a gentleman whose attention seemed attracted by the papers he carried what papers have you got there my lad he inquired harpers weekly frank leslie ledger weekly repeated ben glibly adding the names of the other papers in his parcel give me the two picture papers said the gentleman twenty cents i suppose yes said ben and as much more as you want to pay i dont set no limit to the generosity of my customers youre sharp said the gentleman laughing thats worth something heres twentyfive cents you may keep the change ill do it cheerfully said ben thank you sir i hope youll buy all your papers of me i wont promise always to pay you more than the regular price but you may leave harpers and leslie at my office every week here is my card ben took the card and put it in his pocket he found the office to be located in trinity building broadway ill call every week reglar he said thats right my lad goodmorning goodmornin ben felt that he had started well he had cleared nine cents by his sale four representing his regular commission while the other five cents might be regarded as a donation nine cents was something but for his idea about the papers he would have made nothing so far it is a very good thing to have two strings to your bow so ben thought though the thought did not take that precise form in his mind he kept on his way till he reached the ferry there was no train in on the other side and would not be for some time but passengers came over the ferry and ben placed himself where he could be seen it was some time before he sold another paper however although ben who improved some of his spare time by looking over the pictures was prepared to recommend them what papers have you got boy asked a tall lank man whose thin lips and pinched expression gave him an outward appearance of meanness which by the way did not belie his real character ben recited the list whats the price of harpers weekly ten cents ten cents is too much to pay for any paper i dont see how they have the face to ask it nor i said ben but they dont consult me ill give you eight cents no you wont not if i know it id rather keep the paper for my private readin answered ben then you are at liberty to do so said the gentleman snappishly youd make profit enough if you sold at eight cents all the profit id make wouldnt pay for a flys breakfast said ben the gentleman deigned no response but walked across the street in a dignified manner here he was accosted by a bootblack who proposed to shine his boots hell get em done at the wholesale price see if he dont thought ben he kept an eye on the bootblack and his patron until the job was finished then he witnessed what appeared to be an angry dispute between the two parties it terminated by the gentleman lifting his cane in a menacing manner ben afterwards gained from the boy particulars of the transaction which may be given here in the third person shine yer boots asked the bootblack as the gentleman reached his side of the street just after his unsuccessful negotiations with ben what do you charge he inquired ten cents thats too much its the reglar price i can get my boots blacked for five cents anywhere if youll do it for that you can go to work the boy hesitated it was half price but he had not yet obtained a job and he yielded when the task was finished his generous patron drew four cents from his pocket i havent got but four cents he observed i guess thatll do the boy was indignant as was natural to work for half price and then lose onefifth of his reduced pay was aggravating what made it worse was that his customer was carefully dressed and bore every appearance of being a man of substance i want another cent he demanded youre well enough paid said the other drawing on a kid glove four cents i consider very handsome pay for ten minutes work many men do not make as much this reasoning did not strike the little bootblack as sound he was no logician but he felt that he had been defrauded and that in a very mean manner give me my money he screamed angrily ill hand you over to the authorities said the gentleman though i hardly feel justified in calling him such lifting his cane menacingly what could the boy do might was evidently on the side of the man who had cheated him but he was quickwitted and a characteristic mode of revenge suggested itself the street was muddy new york streets are occasionally in that condition the bootblack stooped down and clutched a handful of mire in his hand fortunately having no kid gloves to soil and before his late customer fathomed his intention plentifully besprinkled one of the boots which he had just carefully polished thats worth a cent he remarked with satisfaction escaping from the wrath of the injured party his victim almost speechless with rage seemed disposed to pursue him but the boy regardless of the mire had run across the street and to follow would only be to make matters worse if i ever catch you ill break every bone in your body you little vagabond he said in a voice almost choked by passion shaking his cane energetically ben who had witnessed the whole burst into a hearty laugh which drew upon his head a portion of wrath after a pause the victim of his own meanness turned up a side street the reader will be glad to learn that he had to employ a second boot black so that he was not so much better off for his economical management after all it may be added that he was actuated in all his dealings by the same frugality if we may dignify it by that name he was a large dealer in readymade underclothing for the making of which he paid starvation prices but unfortunately the poor sewinggirls whom he employed for a pittance were not so well able to defend themselves against imposition as the smart little bootblack who knew his rights and knowing dared maintain chapter xxii the heavy valise ben had sold half his papers when the arrival of the train from philadelphia gave him an opportunity to return to his legitimate calling smash your baggage sir asked ben of a darkcomplexioned man of thirtyfive who carried a moderatesized valise yes said the other where shall i carry it to here the man hesitated and finally answered there is no need of telling you i will take it from you when we have got along far enough ben was about to walk beside the owner of the valise but the latter objected to this you neednt walk beside me he said keep about a block ahead but how will i know where to go asked ben naturally you know where broome street runs into the bowery of course i do go there by the shortest route dont trouble yourself about me ill follow along behind and take the valise from you there if you get there before i do wait for me i suppose im too ragged to walk alongside of him thought ben he could think of no other reason for the direction given by the other however bens pride was not very much hurt although he was ragged now he did not mean to be long the time would come he was confident when he could lay aside his rags and appear in a respectable dress the valise which he carried proved to be considerably heavier than would have been imagined from its size i wonder whats in it thought ben who found it tugging away at his arms if its shirts theyre castiron maybe theyre just comin in fashion however he did not perplex himself much about this point beyond a momentary curiosity he felt no particular interest in the contents of the valise the way in which it affected him principally was to make him inwardly resolve to ask an extra price on account of the extra weight after walking a while he looked back for the owner of the valise but he was not in sight i might carry off his baggage thought ben without his knowin it he kept on however never doubting that the owner would sooner or later overtake him if he did not care enough for the valise to do this ben would not be responsible he had just shifted the heavy burden from one hand to the other when he felt himself tapped on the shoulder looking round he saw that the one who had done this was a quietlooking man of middle size but with a keen sharp eye whats wanted asked ben where did you get that valise my lad asked the newcomer i dont know as thats any of your business answered ben who didnt perceive the others right to ask the question is it yours maybe it is let me lift it a moment hands off said ben suspiciously dont try none of your tricks on me the other did not appear to notice this i take it for granted that the valise is not yours he said now tell me where you got it from there was something of authority in his manner which led ben to think that he had a warrant for asking the question though he could not guess his object in doing so im a baggagesmasher answered ben i got this from a man that came by the philadelphia train where is he i guess hes behind somewheres where are you carrying the valise seems to me you want to know a good deal said ben undecided as to the right of the other to ask so many questions ill let you into a secret my lad but you must keep the secret that valise is pretty heavy isnt it ill bet it is to the best of my information the man who employed you is a noted burglar and this valise contains his tools i am a detective and am on his track i received a telegram an hour ago from philadelphia informing me that he was on his way i got down to the wharf a little too late now tell me where you are to carry this and the detective pointed to the valise i am to meet the gentleman at the corner of broome street and the bowery said ben very well go ahead and meet him shall you be there asked ben never mind go on just as if i had not met you and deliver up the valise if youre goin to nab him just wait till ive got my pay i dont want to smash such heavy baggage for nothin i agree to that moreover if i succeed in getting hold of the fellow through your information i dont mind paying you five dollars out of my own pocket very good said ben i shant mind takin it not by no means go on and dont be in too much of a hurry i want time to lay my trap ben walked along leisurely in accordance with his instructions at length he reached the rendezvous he found the owner of the valise already in waiting well boy he said impatiently you took your time i generally do said ben it aint dishonest to take my own time is it ive been waiting here for a quarter of an hour i didnt know but youd gone to sleep somewhere on the way i dont sleep much in the daytime it dont agree with my constitution well mister i hope youll give me something handsome your baggage here is thunderin heavy theres twentyfive cents said the other twentyfive cents exclaimed ben indignantly twentyfive cents for walkin two miles with such a heavy load its worth fifty well you wont get fifty said the other roughly just get somebody else to carry your baggage next time said ben angrily he looked round and saw the quietlooking man before referred to approaching he felt some satisfaction in knowing that his recent employer would meet with a check which he was far from anticipating without answering ben the latter took the valise and was about moving away when the quietlooking man suddenly quickened his pace and laid his hand on his arm the burglar for he was really one started and turned pale what do you want you know what i want said the detective quietly i want you what do you want me for demanded the other but it was easy to see that he was nervous and alarmed you know that also said the detective but i dont mind telling you you came from philadelphia this morning and your name is sly bill you are a noted burglar and i shall take you into immediate custody youre mistaken said bill youve got hold of the wrong man that will soon be seen have the kindness to accompany me to the stationhouse and ill take a look into that valise of yours bill was physically a stronger man than the detective but he succumbed at once to the tone of quiet authority with which he spoke and prepared to follow though by no means with alacrity here my lad said the detective beckoning ben who came up come and see me at this place tomorrow he continued producing a card and i wont forget the promise i made you all right said ben im in luck agin he said to himself at this rate it wont take me long to make fifty dollars smashin baggage for burglars pays pretty well he bethought himself of his papers of which half remained unsold he sold some on the way back to the wharf where after a while he got another job for which being at some distance he was paid fifty cents at five in the afternoon he reported himself at the newsstand ive sold all the papers you gave me he said and heres the money i guess i can sell more tomorrow the newsdealer paid him the commission agreed upon amounting to eighteen cents ben of course retaining besides the five cents which had been paid him extra in the morning this made his earnings for the day ninetyeight cents besides the dollars promised by the detective chapter xxiii the surprise ben had certainly met with good luck so far even his temporary detention at the stationhouse he regarded as a piece of good luck since he was paid handsomely for the confinement while his bed there was considerably more comfortable than he often enjoyed his adventure with the burglar also brought him in as much as under ordinary circumstances he would have earned in a week in two days he was able to lay aside fifteen dollars and a half towards his fund but of course such lucky adventures could not be expected every day the bulk of his money must be earned slowly as the reward of persistent labor and industry but ben was willing to work now that he had an object before him he kept up his double business of baggagesmasher and vender of weekly papers after a while the latter began to pay him enough to prove quite a help besides filling up his idle moments another good result of his new business was that while waiting for customers he got into the habit of reading the papers he had for sale now ben had done very little reading since he came to new york and if called upon to read aloud would have shown the effects of want of practice in his frequent blunders but the daily lessons in reading which he now took began to remedy this deficiency and give him increased fluency and facility it also had the effect of making him wish that his education had not been interrupted so that his cousin charles might not be so far ahead of him ben also gave up smoking not so much because he considered it injurious but because cigars cost money and he was economizing in every possible way he continued to sleep in the room under the wharf which thus far the occupants had managed to keep from the knowledge of the police gradually the number had increased until from twenty to thirty boys made it a rendezvous nightly by some means a stove had been procured and what was more difficult got safely down without observation so that as the nights grew cooler the boys managed to make themselves comfortable here they talked and told stories and had a good time before going to sleep one evening it was proposed by one of the boys that each should tell his own story for though they met together daily they knew little of each other beyond this that they were all engaged in some street avocation some of the stories told were real some burlesque first jim bagley told his story i aint got much to tell boys he said my father kept a cigar store on eighth avenue and my mother and sister and i lived behind the shop we got along pretty well till father got run over by a streetcar and pretty soon after he died we kept the store along a little while but we couldnt make it go and pay the rent so we sold out to a man who paid half down and promised to pay the rest in a year but before the year was up he shut up the shop and went off and we never got the rest of the money the money we did get did not last long mother got some sewin to do but she couldnt earn much i took to sellin papers but after a while i went into the match business which pays pretty good i pay mother five dollars a week and sometimes more so she gets along well i dont see how you make so much money jim said phil cranmer ive tried it and i didnt get nothin much out of it jim knows how said one of the boys hes got enterprise i go off into the country a good deal said jim theres plenty of match boys in the city sometimes i hire another boy to come along and help me if hes smart i make money that way too last time i went out i didnt make so much how was that jim i went up to albany on the boat i was doin pretty well up there when all to once they took me up for sellin without a license so i had to pay ten dollars afore theyd let me off did you have the money to pay jim yes but it cleaned me out so i didnt have but two dollars left but i travelled off into the country towns and got it back in a week or two im glad they didnt get hold of bill who was bill the feller that sold for me i couldnt have paid his fine too thats about all i have to tellb captain jinks called out one of the boys your turn next attention was directed to a tall overgrown boy of sixteen or possibly seventeen to whom for some unknown reason the name of the famous captain jinks had been given that aint my name he said oh bother your name go ahead i aint got nothing to say go ahead and say it the captain was rather taciturn but was finally induced to tell his story b the main incidents of jim bagleys story are true having been communicated to the writer by jim himself a wideawake boy of fifteen who appeared to possess decided business ability and energy the name only is fictitious my father and mother are dead he said i used to live with my sister and her husband he would get drunk off the money i brought home and if i didnt bring home as much as he expected hed fling a chair at my head he was a bully brotherinlaw said jerry did it hurt the chair much if you want to know bad ill try it on you growled the narrator good for captain jinks exclaimed two or three of the boys when did you join the hoss marines asked jerry with apparent interest shut up your mouth said the captain who did not fancy the joke go ahead jinks i would not stand that so i went off and lived at the lodge till i got in here thats all captain jinks relapsed into silence and tim mcquade was called upon he had a pair of sparkling black eyes that looked as if he were not averse to fun maybe you dont know he said that im fust cousin to a markis the markis of cork suggested one of the boys and sometimes i expect to come in for a lot of money if i dont miss of it when you do just treat a feller will you said jerry course i will i was born in a big castle made of stone and used to go round dressed in welvet and had no end of nice things till one day a feller that had a spite agin the markis carried me off and brought me to america where i had to go to work and earn my own livin why dont you write the markis and get him to send for you asked jerry cause he cant read you spalpeen what ud be the use of writin to him maybe its the fault of your writin tim maybe it is said tim when the markis dies im going back an ill invite you all to come an pass a week at castle mcquade bully for you tim now dutchey tell us your story dutchey was a boy of ten with a full face and rotund figure whose english as he had been but two years in the country was highly flavored with his native dialect i cannot english sprechen he said never mind dutchey do as well as you can it is mine story you want he is not very long but i will tell him so goot as i can mine vater was a shoemaker what makes boots he come from sharmany on der rhein mit my moder and five childer he take a little shop and make some money till one day a house fall on his head mit a brick an he die then i go out into der street and black boots so much as i get him to do and the money what i get i carry home to mine moder i cannot much english sprechen or i could tell mine story more goot bully for you dutchey youre a trump what is one trump asked the boy with a puzzled expression it is a good feller this explanation seemed to reconcile dutchey to being called a trump and he lay back on the bed with an expression of satisfaction now ben tell us your story it was ben the luggage boy who was addressed the question embarrassed him for he preferred to keep his story secret he hoped ere long to leave his present haunts and associates and he did not care to give the latter a clue by which they might trace him in his new character and position yet he had no good reason to assign for silence he was considering what sort of a story he could manufacture that would pass muster when he was relieved from further consideration by an unexpected occurrence it appears that a boy had applied for admission to the rendezvous but on account of his unpopular character had been refused this naturally incensed him and he determined to betray the boys to the policeman on the beat the sight that greeted ben as he looked towards the entrance was the face of the policeman peering into the apartment he uttered a half exclamation which attracted the general attention instantly all was excitement the copp the copp passed from mouth to mouth the officer saw that the odds were against him and he must summon help he went up the ladder therefore and went in search of assistance the boys scrambled up after him some were caught and ultimately sentenced to the island on a charge of stealing the articles which were found but others escaped among these was ben who was lucky enough to glide off in the darkness he took the little german boy under his protection and managed to get him safely away also in this case the ends of justice were not interfered with as neither of the two had been guilty of dishonesty or anything else rendering them amenable to the law well dutchey were safe said ben when they had got some blocks away from the wharf how do you feel i lose mine breath said the little boy panting with the effort he had made thats better than losin your liberty said ben youll get your breath back again now we must look about and see where we can sleep i wonder if jim bagleys took just then a boy came running up why its ben and dutchey he said jerry is it you im glad youre safe the copp got a grip of me but i left my jacket in his hands he can carry that to the stationhouse if he wants to jerrys appearance corresponded to his statement his jacket being gone leaving a dilapidated vest and ragged shirt alone to protect the upper part of his body he shivered with the cold for it was now november here jerry said ben just take my vest an put over yours ill button up my coat if i was as fat as dutchey i wouldnt mind the cold said jerry the three boys finally found an old wagon in which all three huddled up together by this means keeping warmer than they otherwise could being turned out of their beds into the street might have been considered a hardship by boys differently reared but it was not enough to disturb the philosophy of our young vagrants chapter xxiv ben transformed ben worked away steadily at his double occupation saving money as well as he could but he met with no more profitable adventures his earnings were gradual some weeks he laid by as much as a dollar and a half or even two dollars but other weeks he barely reached a dollar so the end of march came before he was able to carry out the object which he had in view one morning about this time ben carefully counted up his deposits and found they amounted to fifty dollars and thirtyseven cents it was a joyful moment which he had long looked forward to he had been tempted to rest satisfied with forty when he had reached that sum but he resisted the temptation i aint goin to do things by halves he said to himself i cant do it for lessn fifty dollars i must wait awhile but the moment had arrived when he could accomplish his purpose as ben looked down at his ragged attire which was in a considerably worse condition then when he was first presented to the reader he felt that it was high time he got a new suit the first thing to be done was to get his money he made his way to the savingsbank and presented himself at the counter i want all of my money he said i hope youre not going to spend it all said the bank officer who by this time had come to feel acquainted with ben from his frequent calls to make deposits im goin to buy some new clothes said ben dont i look as if i needed some yes you are rather out at elbows i must admit but new clothes wont cost all the money you have in the bank im goin home to my friends said ben after ive got dressed decently thats a good resolution my boy i hope youll stick to it its what ive been workin for for a long time said ben he filled out the order for the money and it was delivered to him the next thing was to buy a new suit of clothes usually ben had procured his outfit in chatham street but he soared higher now he made his way to a large readymade clothing warehouse on broadway and entered the main apartment was spacious the counters were heaped with articles of dress and numerous clerks were ready to wait upon customers well whats wanted asked one glancing superciliously at the ragged boy entering have you got any clothes that will fit me asked ben i guess youve lost your way johnny havent you what makes you think so asked ben this isnt chatham street thank you for the information said ben i thought it was when i saw you here there was a laugh at the clerks expense among those who heard the retort what are you here for any way demanded the clerk with an air of insulted majesty to buy some clothes said ben but you neednt show em to me ill go to somebody else have you got any money youll know soon enough he went to another part of the store and applied to a salesman whose appearance he liked better after some hesitation ben made choice of a suit of substantial warm cloth a dark mixed sackcoat vest of the same material and a pair of pants of neat pattern i wont trouble you to send em said ben as my house is closed for the season the bundle was made up and handed to him the price of the entire suit was twenty dollars which was a good price for those days ben took the bundle under his arm and went out his purchases were not yet all made he went next to a furnishing store and bought three shirts three pairs of stockings some collars and a necktie finishing up with a pair of gloves these cost him eight dollars a neat felt hat and a pair of shoes which he procured elsewhere completed his outfit on counting up ben found that he had expended thirtysix dollars leaving in his hands a balance of fourteen dollars and thirtyseven cents before putting on his new purchases ben felt that he must go through a process of purification he went therefore to a barbers basement shop with which baths were connected and going down the steps said to the barbers assistant who happened to be alone at the time i want a warm bath pay in advance said the young man surveying the ragged figure before him with some hesitation all right said ben how much is it twentyfive cents here it is said ben producing the exact amount from his vestpocket such ragged customers were not usual but there seemed to be no good excuse for refusing ben as he had the money to pay in five minutes the bath was declared to be ready and ben entering the small room assigned to him joyfully divested himself of the ragged garments which he was never again to put on and got into the tub it probably will not excite surprise when i say that ben stood in need of a bath his street life had not been particularly favorable to cleanliness nor had he been provided with such facilities for attending to his toilet as are usual in wellregulated families however he was quite aware of his deficiencies in this way and spared neither pains nor soap to remedy them it was a work of time but finally he felt satisfied with the result of his efforts and after drying himself proceeded to put on his new clothes they proved to fit excellently indeed they wrought such a change in our heros appearance that he could hardly believe in his own identity when he stood before the glass and saw reflected the form of a welldressed boy in place of the ragged figure which he saw on entering the only thing which marred his good appearance was his hair which had grown to undue length he determined to have it cut before he left the barbers shop he tied up the clothes he had taken off in the paper which had contained his new suit and opening the door went out into the main room with the bundle under his arm meanwhile the proprietor of the shop had returned who is taking a bath he asked of his assistant a ragged street boy said the latter what did you let him in for he paid in advance i dont care about such customers any way said the barber remember next time all right at this moment ben made his appearance but that appearance was so much altered that the young man looked at him in astonishment he looked thoroughly well dressed and might have passed readily for the scion of a wealthy family were two bathrooms occupied asked the proprietor no i thought you said i was never so surprised in my life said the assistant did you get changed in the bath he asked of ben yes said ben what made you wear such a ragged suit i was in disguise said ben but ive got tired of it and thrown it off i think ill have my hair cut take a seat said the proprietor ill cut your hair myself how will you have it cut i want to be in the fashion said ben make it look as well as you can he took his seat and the task commenced the barber was skilful in his art and he saw at once what style would become ben best he exerted himself to the utmost and when at the end of half an hour he withdrew the cloth from around our heros neck he had effected a change almost marvellous in bens appearance i have already said that ben was naturally goodlooking but even good looks need fair play and rags and neglect are apt to obscure the gifts of nature so ben had never looked his best till now but when his hair was cut and arranged and he looked in the mirror to observe the effect he was himself surprised it was some like the change that transformed cinderella into a princess i shant be ashamed to tell my cousin who i am now he said chapter xxv ben makes himself known ben went out into the street with two bundles under his arm one contained the ragged clothes which he had just taken off the other which was much smaller contained his extra shirts and stockings the first he did not care to keep he therefore lost no time in throwing it into an alleyway itll be a lucky chap that finds it thought ben he next put on his gloves and considered what he should do next it was halfpast twelve oclock already for he had not been able to get his money from the bank till ten and the purchases and bath as well as the haircutting had taken up considerable time he began to feel hungry and appetite suggested that he should first of all go to a restaurant and get some dinner on the way thither he met two of his street acquaintances who passed him without the slightest mark of recognition this pleased ben for it assured him that the change which he had effected in his appearance was a considerable one while eating dinner he deliberated what he should do it was saturday and it would be almost too late to start for his pennsylvania home he decided to go to his sisters house on madison avenue and make himself known there first of all he was influenced to this partly by the desire he had to meet his cousin who as he knew was making his home while attending school at the house of mr abercrombie he had more than once been up to that part of the city in the hope of catching a glimpse of the cousin for whom he retained his old boyish love but he had always shrunk even when seeing him from attracting his observation he did not wish to be remembered in his rags and so denied himself the pleasure for which he yearned but now he was satisfied with his appearance he felt that he was as well dressed as charles himself and would do no discredit to him if they were seen in the street together he got on board an omnibus and took his seat a lady soon after entered and sat down beside him she drew out some money from her purse and passing it to ben said will you have the kindness to pass up my fare sir certainly said ben politely it was a small incident but he felt from the young ladys manner of addressing him that she looked upon him as her equal socially and this afforded him not a little pleasure he wondered how he could have been content to drift about the streets so long clothed in rags new hopes and a new ambition had been awakened within him and he felt that a new life lay before him much better worth living than the old life these thoughts occupied him as he rode up broadway at length he left the omnibus and took the shortest route to his sisters house when he ascended the steps and rang the bell he felt rather a queer sensation come over him he remembered very well the last time he had ascended those same steps carrying his cousins valise his heart beat quick with excitement in the midst of which the door was opened by the servant he had already decided to ask for his cousin preferring to make himself known to him first is charles marston in he inquired yes sir said the servant wont you come in she threw open the door of the parlor and ben entering seated himself in an armchair holding his hat in his hand i wonder if shed asked me in here if id come in my rags he asked himself with a smile the servant went upstairs where she found charles in his own room writing a french exercise master charles she said one of your schoolmates is in the parlor he wants to see you all right ill go right down the mistake was quite a natural one as boys who attended the same private school frequently called for charles charles went downstairs and entered the parlor ben rose as he entered how are you charlie said ben rising and offering his hand charles looked in his face with a puzzled expression it was not one of his schoolmates as he had supposed but it must be some one that knew him intimately or he would not have addressed him so familiarly i ought to know you he said apologetically but i cant think who it is dont you remember your cousin ben charlie asked our hero ben exclaimed charles in the greatest astonishment he looked eagerly in our heros face for a moment then impulsively threw his arms around bens neck and kissed him i am so glad to see you ben he said where have you been all the time then you didnt forget me charlie said ben returning the embrace no ben ive thought of you many and many a time we used to be such good friends you know we will be again will we not i hope so charlie that was one of my reasons for coming back how did you know i was here i will tell you some time charlie but not now is my sister at home yes i will call her she will be very much surprised we all thought you dead i suppose yes but i always hoped you would come back again dont tell mary who it is see if she recognizes me summoned by charles mrs abercrombie came down to the parlor she was merely told that a gentleman desired to see her when she entered the parlor ben rose from his seat she looked at him for a moment and her face lighted up its ben she said o ben how could you stay away so long what do you remember me mary asked our hero in surprise yes i knew you by your resemblance to charles we always remarked it when you were young boys together as the two boys were standing side by side the resemblance of which she spoke was quite striking ben was the larger of the two but their features were similar as well as the color of the hair and eyes and the similarity of their dress completed the illusion mrs abercrombie surveyed her brother with satisfaction she had been afraid he would be coarse and vulgar after so many years of neglect if he should ever return but here he was to all appearance a young gentleman of whom she need not feel ashamed ben must share my room cousin mary said charles weve got so much to say to each other i didnt know i was to stay said ben smiling you mustnt leave us again ben said his sister monday you must start for home poor mother has mourned for you so long she will be overjoyed to see you again when mr abercrombie came home his new brotherinlaw was introduced to him he received ben cordially and in a way to make him feel at home in the course of the morning mr sampson called and ben was introduced to him theres something in your brothers voice that sounds familiar he said to mrs abercrombie i think i must have met him before he has not been with us for some years said mrs abercrombie who did not care to reveal that ben was a returned prodigal probably i am deceived said mr sampson ben however knew that mr sampson had good cause to remember him he was afraid the servant who had brought him his breakfast some months before in the basement might remember him but there was no danger of that she never dreamed of associating the young gentleman her mistresss brother with the ragged and dirty boy who had brought the valise for master charles chapter xxvi the prodigals return on sunday evening ben in company with his sister her husband and charles attended a sacred concert in steinway hall as he stepped within the vestibule he saw two street boys outside whom he knew well their attire was very similar to that which he had himself worn until the day before they looked at ben but never thought of identifying him with the baggagesmasher with whom they had often bunked together see what it is thought ben to be well dressed and have fashionable friends as he sat in a reserved seat but a little distance from the platform surrounded by welldressed people he was sometimes tempted to doubt whether he was the same boy who a few days before was wandering about the streets a friendless outcast the change was so complete and wonderful that he seemed to himself a new boy but he enjoyed the change it seemed a good deal pleasanter resting in the luxurious bedchamber which he shared with charles at his sisters house than the chance accommodations to which he had been accustomed on monday he started for philadelphia on his journey home we will precede him mrs brandon sat in an armchair before the fire knitting she was not old but care and sorrow had threaded her dark hair with silver and on her brow there were traces of a sorrow patiently borne but none the less deeply felt she had never recovered from the loss of her son her daughter mary had inherited something of her fathers selfcontained undemonstrative manner but ben had been impulsive and affectionate and had always been very near his mothers heart to feel that he had passed from her sight was a great sorrow but it was a greater still not to know where he was he might be suffering pain or privation he might have fallen into bad and vicious habits for aught she knew it would have been a relief though a sad one to know that he was dead but nothing whatever had been heard of him since the letter of which the reader is already aware since marys marriage mrs brandon had been very much alone her husband was so taciturn and reserved that he was not much company for her so she was left very much to her own thoughts and these dwelt often upon ben though six years had elapsed since he left home if i could see him once more she often said to herself i could die in peace so mrs brandon was busily thinking of ben on that monday afternoon as she sat knitting before the fire little thinking that god had heard her prayer and that the son whom she so longed to see was close at hand he was even then coming up the gravelled walk that led to the house it may be imagined that bens heart beat with unwonted excitement as the scenes of his early boyhood once more appeared before him a thousand boyish memories returned to him as he trod the familiar street he met persons whom he knew but they showed no recognition of him six years had wrought too great a change in him he rang the bell the summons was answered by the servant the only one employed in mrs brandons modest establishment is mrs brandon at home asked ben yes answered the girl will you walk in ben stepped into the entry and the girl opened the door of the room in which mrs brandon was seated mrs brandon looked up she saw standing at the door a wellgrown lad of sixteen with a face browned by long exposure to the sun and air it was six years since she had seen ben but in spite of the changes which time may have wrought a mothers heart is not easily deceived a wild hope sprang up in her heart she tried to rise from her chair but her excite was so great that her limbs refused their office mother exclaimed ben and hurrying forward he threw his arms around his mothers neck god be thanked she exclaimed with heartfelt gratitude i have missed you so much ben bens heart reproached him as he saw the traces of sorrow upon his mothers face and felt that he had been the cause forgive me mother he said it is all forgotten now i am so happy she answered her eyes filled with joyful tears they sat down together and ben began to tell his story in the midst of it his father entered he stopped short when he saw ben sitting beside his mother it is ben come back said his mother joyfully mr brandon did not fall on his sons neck and kiss him that was not his way he held out his hand and said benjamin i am very glad to see you in the evening they talked together over the new plans which bens return suggested you must stay with us ben said his mother i cannot part with you now i am getting old benjamin said his father i need help in my business you must stay and help me and by and by you shall have the whole charge of it i am afraid i dont know enough said ben i havent studied any since i left home i dont know as much as i did when i was ten you shall study at home for a year said his father the teacher of the academy shall give you private lessons you can learn a great deal in a year if you set about it to this arrangement ben acceded he is now studying at home and his abilities being excellent and his ambition excited is making remarkable progress next year he will assist his father mr brandon seems to have changed greatly he is no longer stern and hard but gentle and forbearing and is evidently proud of ben who would run a chance of being spoiled by overindulgence if his hard discipline as a street boy had not given him a manliness and selfreliance above his years he is gradually laying aside the injurious habits which he acquired in his street life and i confidently hope for him a worthy and useful manhood from time to time ben visits new york and renews his intimacy with his cousin charles who returns his warm affection charles in turn spends the summer at cedarville where they are inseparable so we bid farewell to ben the luggage boy hoping that he may be able to repay his mother in part for the sorrow which his long absence occasioned her and that she may live long to enjoy his society to my young readers who have received my stories of street life

juveniles harry castlemon how i came to write my first book when i was sixteen years old i belonged to a composition class it was our custom to go on the recitation seat every day with clean slates and we were allowed ten minutes to write seventy words on any subject the teacher thought suited to our capacity one day he gave out what a man would see if he went to greenland my heart was in the matter and before the ten minutes were up i had one side of my slate filled the teacher listened to the reading of our compositions and when they were all over he simply said some of you will make your living by writing one of these days that gave me something to ponder upon i did not say so out loud but i knew that my composition was as good as the best of them by the way there was another thing that came in my way just then i was reading at that time one of mayne reids works which i had drawn from the library and i pondered upon it as much as i did upon what the teacher said to me in introducing swartboy to his readers he made use of this expression no visible change was observable in swartboys countenance now it occurred to me that if a man of his education could make such a blunder as that and still write a book i ought to be able to do it too i went home that very day and began a story the old guides narrative which was sent to the new york weekly and came back respectfully declined it was written on both sides of the sheets but i didnt know that this was against the rules nothing abashed i began another and receiving some instruction from a friend of mine who was a clerk in a book store i wrote it on only one side of the paper but mind you he didnt know what i was doing nobody knew it but one day after a hard saturdays work the other boys had been out skating on the brickpond i shyly broached the subject to my mother i felt the need of some sympathy she listened in amazement and then said why do you think you could write a book like that that settled the matter and from that day no one knew what i was up to until i sent the first four volumes of gunboat series to my father was it work well yes it was hard work but each week i had the

exceptional phase or odd combination of circumstances he stands on the common level and appeals to the universal heart and all that he suggests or achieves is on the plane and in the line of march of the great body of humanity the jack hazard series of stories published in the late our young folks and continued in the first volume of st nicholas under the title of fast friends is no doubt destined to hold a high place in this class of literature the delight of the boys in them and of their seniors too is well founded they go to the right spot every time trowbridge knows the heart of a boy like a book and the heart of a man too and he has laid them both open in these books in a most successful manner apart from the qualities that render the series so attractive to all young readers they have great value on account of their portraitures of american country life and character the drawing is wonderfully accurate and as spirited as it is true the constable sellick is an original character and as minor figures where will we find anything better than miss wansey and mr p pipkin esq the picture of mr dinks school too is capital and where else in fiction is there a better nickname than that the boys gave to poor little stephen treadwell step hen as he himself pronounced his name in an unfortunate moment when he saw it in print for the first time in his lesson in school on the whole these
